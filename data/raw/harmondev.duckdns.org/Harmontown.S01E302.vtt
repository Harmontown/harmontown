Yeah, I mean, like, well,\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.240\nwe had our 300th episode, it was the last thing we did, right? And I watched that clip of me trying\n\n02:06.240 --> 02:13.280\nto learn from open mic. We did an episode after that. Oh, did we? I just, I don't know why I can't\n\n02:13.280 --> 02:20.560\nlearn things. Because you have to remember shit to learn. You can be a really hard worker,\n\n02:20.560 --> 02:27.200\nit wouldn't matter if you're an alcoholic. God, I've been to the crossroads eight times,\n\n02:27.200 --> 02:33.120\nwhen am I going to learn the blues? You keep drinking too much, Ralph Macchio in the movie\n\n02:33.120 --> 02:44.960\nCrossroads. I don't know, I obviously, yes, I do have a story from Emmy Knight that I don't\n\n02:44.960 --> 02:50.400\nthink would be in any trouble. Did you, you were at the Emmys? I was at the Emmys and I won an Emmy,\n\n02:50.400 --> 03:00.000\nwe all, obviously. And what I mean is, when I say, I mean, the show that I work on, but like,\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:06.160\nwell, where are the, you know, it's me, it's this shows about me, I won an Emmy. Right, right. In\n\n03:06.160 --> 03:13.600\nmixed company, I'd be like, you know, who won an Emmy is Sid in marketing. Right, right. Remember\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:20.080\nwhen they marketed Rick and Morty successfully? Yeah, that fateful day. Yeah. Thank you, Sid.\n\n03:21.360 --> 03:23.440\nIt is an award for everybody. So you were saying,\n\n03:23.440 --> 03:34.640\nwell, I do have, look here, the craziest fucking thing. So we, maybe I oversold it by saying that,\n\n03:34.640 --> 03:39.040\nbecause it's also like insidiously not crazy. It was just this odd thing, or maybe I'm listening\n\n03:39.040 --> 03:43.200\nto too many of these like creepy pasta podcasts, where there's just like these little stories about\n\n03:43.200 --> 03:48.400\nlittle shit where you encounter, like you accidentally like, open this Lovecraftian advent\n\n03:48.400 --> 03:53.360\nwindow and the calendar of your monotonous life. And then, oh, I wrote the subway wrong. And then\n\n03:53.360 --> 03:59.520\nthe people had tentacles and Slender Man was like, what next stop? I have no face. And then, but then\n\n03:59.520 --> 04:04.160\nyou went back and you're like, never touch an elevator wrong. Are you going to tell the Emmy\n\n04:04.160 --> 04:12.240\nstory in a crazy Canadian voice? One of the things I like to do is go to the Emmy Awards.\n\n04:12.240 --> 04:24.880\nSo we, you get sat in, you know, with your peeps like, so like, it's a big production. We got like\n\n04:24.880 --> 04:33.360\nbasically a full row in this auditorium is sort of like, you look down the row and you're seeing\n\n04:33.360 --> 04:39.440\npeople that you worked with and that are there tonight for that are on the show. And, but that's\n\n04:39.440 --> 04:45.440\nnot, you know, you don't recognize it. It's an entire row. So that's not necessarily a thing\n\n04:45.440 --> 04:51.680\nthat you're conscious of. And then, so Justin, because he's the cool one, shows up last. And\n\n04:51.680 --> 04:56.880\nlike, I had been sitting there with Cody and then like, there's another row behind us and\n\n04:56.880 --> 05:03.200\nRyan Ridley's back there. And it's like, people like, you know, there's another whole row behind us.\n\n05:03.200 --> 05:09.600\nAnd people are chatting and things and the theater slowly fills up. And Justin's like,\n\n05:09.600 --> 05:15.680\nrolling in with his girlfriend, like, really close to just like, the lights are going down and\n\n05:15.680 --> 05:21.200\nthey're going to, the guy comes out and he explains, your acceptance speech has to be this long. And\n\n05:21.200 --> 05:25.440\nwhen you, if I do this, you got to do this or whatever. And it's like, not a big deal. But it's\n\n05:25.440 --> 05:30.560\nlike, Justin's like standing in the aisle. And he's got an estate. And it's like, he's like,\n\n05:30.560 --> 05:37.760\nmaking this gesture. And we finally realize, oh, shit, we look at the row. And there's one seat\n\n05:37.760 --> 05:43.440\nempty. And he's standing there with his date. And he's going like, you know, he's like making this\n\n05:43.440 --> 05:48.160\nbecause we're all having to be hushed now. And he's like, jump out. And we're like, oh, God,\n\n05:49.680 --> 05:54.400\none seat open. And so then this is like, kind of flurry of this panic starts to happen. Like,\n\n05:54.400 --> 05:59.680\nwhat, what could possibly go wrong? So the, I don't know when to reveal that this whole time\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:10.000\nin the story, there's this guy sitting there that is alone and is not, does not work on the show.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:16.640\nAnd it's, and it's just sort of like, he looks like, you know, if I was casting this movie,\n\n06:16.640 --> 06:22.960\nhe would, I would cast him, I would cast Jolo Trulio as this guy. He was, he was, he was a,\n\n06:22.960 --> 06:30.640\nhe was a, he was a, he was an attractive man in a, in a, in a respectfully diminutive package\n\n06:30.640 --> 06:34.800\nthat sort of like, it was like, he's not, he's not a big bruiser. He's not a, he's not a, he's not\n\n06:34.800 --> 06:40.560\na basketball player. I was like, he's kind of like, here I am. I'm this guy. I got, I got my frame\n\n06:40.560 --> 06:48.000\nand I'm occupying my space. And he looked good in his suit. And, and he was, he was sitting there\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:53.360\nwhen I got there. And I got there, you know, pretty early. And it was like, the theater was\n\n06:53.360 --> 06:59.680\nlike filling up and he was just sitting there. So like, who is going to, there's, there's a guy,\n\n06:59.680 --> 07:04.720\nJustin's going like, who do I don't know? And so then obviously the first thing everybody that's,\n\n07:04.720 --> 07:08.960\nyou know, like me is going to go like, okay, this must be my fault. I'm going to look at my ticket.\n\n07:08.960 --> 07:15.760\nI'm going to, and I look and I go, oh, see, and Cody's like, see, you're in the 315. And look\n\n07:15.760 --> 07:20.480\nwhere you're, and I'm in 3, I don't know, 13 or something like that. And she's like, and I'm in\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:25.840\n314. And then this, this Joe LaTrulyo guy is like next to her. And it was like, and we're like,\n\n07:25.840 --> 07:31.200\nokay, all right. Well, it's, and the guy is like, he's not not participating in it. He's not with\n\n07:31.200 --> 07:36.160\nanybody. He's not distracted. He's just sort of watching it all unfold. He's just going like,\n\n07:36.160 --> 07:42.160\nlike, huh? Yeah. And then, and then, and then we, and then we go, so we finally like, I go 315.\n\n07:42.160 --> 07:49.440\nAnd Cody, like, it's like, I'm standing in 313. She's standing in 314. So like already, you know,\n\n07:50.640 --> 07:57.360\nwe're not, but we're still airing on the side of caution by going, so Cody goes,\n\n07:58.560 --> 08:04.560\nsorry, what, what seat are you in? And he's been watching and he like, and he looks down between\n\n08:04.560 --> 08:13.440\nhis legs and he looks where the seat thing is, because he's like 315. And we're like, okay, well,\n\n08:14.800 --> 08:19.600\nbut also that doesn't explain, like just him being in the wrong seat doesn't explain anything.\n\n08:19.600 --> 08:27.440\nBut him not not supposed to be thereing is would explain everything. Yeah. And explain everything.\n\n08:27.440 --> 08:31.920\nHe didn't show you a ticket. If he was an alien, it would explain everything. Because then there\n\n08:31.920 --> 08:36.960\nwould be exactly two seats that are there are the two people that are there in the full row.\n\n08:36.960 --> 08:43.680\nBut no one's going there in their head. Everyone's just like, oh, okay. So, and it's like clear,\n\n08:43.680 --> 08:46.880\nlike I'm swear, I'm telling you, like he's not being passive aggressive, like ignoring us,\n\n08:46.880 --> 08:51.200\nlike he's sort of like fascinated by what's happening. Yeah. Because he's like, he's kind of\n\n08:51.200 --> 08:55.120\nhelping out a little bit. It's kind of hard to describe. Sorry, I'm spilling my drink everywhere.\n\n08:55.120 --> 09:02.880\nBut like he's like he's sort of like involved. He is like he was it was I'm judging too much.\n\n09:02.880 --> 09:07.600\nI'm analyzing too much during the story because I'd like to analyze it forever after the story.\n\n09:07.600 --> 09:13.360\nBut like a footnote here is looking back on it. My perception is that his goal was to\n\n09:13.360 --> 09:20.000\nfucking blend. And you don't blend by just ignoring everyone to blend. He also was like, like, like,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:27.680\nuh-huh, like he was like, he was part of the fracas. Yeah. He was like helping out. And\n\n09:27.680 --> 09:30.960\nthen one of my, and he goes like, like, and then I go, I'm sorry, can we, and he goes,\n\n09:30.960 --> 09:38.320\nyou want to switch seats? And he gets up and he switches seats with me, which just skirts the\n\n09:38.320 --> 09:44.640\nissue. It's fucking, he's like, because it gets me in the right seat and look, we're all fuck ups\n\n09:44.640 --> 09:51.120\nhere. I've been sitting in 313 my whole life and I'm 315. Who are we going to judge right now?\n\n09:51.120 --> 09:54.800\nAnd he's like, so I'm switching seats with this guy and then he plops down and the thing.\n\n09:54.800 --> 10:00.640\nAnd it just keeps mounting because it's like, it's a situation where there's no authority\n\n10:00.640 --> 10:04.880\nreally. Like, it's not like a theater where you're like, I'm going to go get the kid with the\n\n10:04.880 --> 10:08.720\nflashlight. You know, like, I'm going to put an end to all this shenanigans. Someone's going to\n\n10:08.720 --> 10:15.440\ngo, dammit. It's like, it's a too big a theater and the timing's wrong and the anxiety's wrong.\n\n10:15.440 --> 10:21.120\nLike, you don't, you don't do that here. It feels like you don't know what to do. And so because\n\n10:21.120 --> 10:26.800\nno one knows what to do, but the urgency is, is keeps heightening. Something happens and something\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:32.000\njust snaps. And I, that's the part of the story. I don't really know because somewhere over there\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:38.000\nwhere this guy, this guy has switched seats with me, somebody finally has an exchange with him\n\n10:39.680 --> 10:46.400\nthat very quickly gets resolved and he goes like, and then he just, he starts leaving.\n\n10:46.400 --> 10:50.320\nAnd then we're like, and then like, then Justin and, and, and Ozzie, you're going to go like,\n\n10:50.320 --> 10:57.680\nsit down now. And, and in the wake of it, we're like, okay, cool. What the fuck? And then,\n\n10:57.680 --> 11:02.400\nand then the person that was over there that had had the immediate change was like, he said he was\n\n11:02.400 --> 11:13.040\na seat filler. Um, no, I don't know. I don't know. Someone has misinterpreted that job description.\n\n11:13.040 --> 11:20.080\nYeah. Yeah. Ain't no volunteer seat filler. So I'm like, I'm like, so, so a couple, like a couple\n\n11:20.080 --> 11:29.760\nof the logic tree branches here, like, okay, world's most like dedicated seat filler, Paul Blart\n\n11:29.760 --> 11:34.800\nseat filler, like that's the bit is like, I'm going to, I was born to fill seats. I'm going to,\n\n11:34.800 --> 11:40.560\nmy mom always said never leave a seat unfilled. Like it's just some perversion of a seat that\n\n11:40.560 --> 11:46.960\ndoesn't exist. That's not, that's not real. Um, then a cousin of that theory is I just picture\n\n11:46.960 --> 11:50.880\nthe guy like at some, there's like seat filler culture where the guy's like, you ever hear of\n\n11:50.880 --> 12:00.400\nDale, uh, Shannon, man? No, the Dale, what? Uh, season three of Nash Bridges, uh, Golden Globes,\n\n12:01.600 --> 12:08.960\nJeremy seat fills next to Melanie Griffith. Yeah. Don Johnson's in the bathroom, food poisoning.\n\n12:08.960 --> 12:13.840\nJeremy ends up going to the governor's ball with Mel. Now he calls her Mel. You know why?\n\n12:13.840 --> 12:18.480\nWhy? He became a associate producer the next, the following week. Like, I don't, like, like,\n\n12:18.480 --> 12:22.240\nlike these stories where you go like, you know, Bruce Willis was a bartender and then he like,\n\n12:22.240 --> 12:27.040\nhe said, uh, uh, come out to the coast, have a few laughs while he was making a drink and\n\n12:27.040 --> 12:34.400\nsomeone was like, say that again, but now say it in an air vent. Um, okay, now be on moon lighting\n\n12:34.400 --> 12:40.000\nfor eight years and then, uh, some seagrams, gold wine coolers and that. I got, I got, I see you in\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.880\nan air vent baby saying that we get, we get, you know, Hollywood is high stakes and like crazy\n\n12:44.880 --> 12:49.600\nstories and like, we just find the dude that asked him to play harmonica and stab him in his face.\n\n12:50.560 --> 12:56.480\nSo that the guy might have been, the guy might have been, and then someone made the joke that\n\n12:56.480 --> 13:02.160\nwas like, when Justin rolled up that the guy was like, yeah, nice try rookie seat filler.\n\n13:02.160 --> 13:06.640\nHilarious. Because he's like the Justin and he's like, yeah, yeah, nice. And we were laughing\n\n13:06.640 --> 13:13.600\nabout that, but here's, here's what I, I swear it's rare that I, I genuinely believe the crazier\n\n13:13.600 --> 13:21.040\nmore art bell thing. I, I, I don't think that any of that stuff explains it. I don't, I don't believe\n\n13:21.040 --> 13:26.960\nthat he was a seat filler explains the thing. I think that he may or may not have technically\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:36.240\nbeen one, but more importantly, he was part of a fucking crazy, like weird thing that 10 years\n\n13:36.240 --> 13:41.840\nfrom now, there'll be a Netflix documentary of not just about him. It won't be like the seat\n\n13:41.840 --> 13:47.760\nstealer. It'll, it'll be called like seat stealers. Like, and it'll be about the fact that like,\n\n13:47.760 --> 13:54.400\nthere's like five or six people that know that the guy, and then, and then everyone, every, every\n\n13:54.400 --> 13:59.200\naward show, there's always like a big thing where like there's 60 people on stage. I always go up\n\n13:59.200 --> 14:03.680\nfor that. Like he would go up because there was like this thing where they had all the Star Trek\n\n14:03.680 --> 14:08.320\npeople come out and they're just talking about Star Trek for like what seemed like like star dates.\n\n14:09.680 --> 14:13.920\nAnd, and I was just thinking like, yeah, that guy could have just wandered up there and like\n\n14:13.920 --> 14:20.880\nstood next to LeVar Burton and been like, yeah, yeah. Like, like, like, what an art that would be,\n\n14:20.880 --> 14:26.160\nbut not if you did it once, but if you did it 20 times over 20 years, and just, you just decided\n\n14:26.160 --> 14:29.680\nlike, I'm going to do it until I get caught. And then if I get caught, then I'm going to just like,\n\n14:29.680 --> 14:33.280\nsee what I can do. Like I'll request all the footage and I'll piece something together. I just,\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:37.840\nit's like, like, like this is art or something. He just had this look on his face. I look back\n\n14:37.840 --> 14:46.080\nand I'm like, we met a gremlin. We met a unicorn. We brushed like with like some like, like, like\n\n14:46.080 --> 14:51.120\nsomething real, something mythical. I wish he would try that shit at the BET Awards.\n\n14:54.720 --> 14:59.120\nGod, I mean, what if he did? What if he did? And they were like, what if he came on the show\n\n14:59.120 --> 15:03.920\nand he was like, yeah, oh, yeah, nice, like, roll a clip. And I was like, all the more. And it's\n\n15:03.920 --> 15:08.880\nlike, of course, there's like one like white dude there. And there's like little navy blue coat,\n\n15:08.880 --> 15:14.800\nlike, of course. Anyway, it just makes sense to everyone. It's just like this Zellig, you know,\n\n15:14.800 --> 15:22.880\nthing. Yeah, I, he, that guy, boy, he did not want to stop filling that seat. Yeah. And I think\n\n15:22.880 --> 15:28.960\nthat he fascinates you because you have a thing, perhaps as I do, which is you wonder how someone\n\n15:28.960 --> 15:33.680\ntakes, they get those balls. How do you get the balls to sit there and enter, you know,\n\n15:33.680 --> 15:37.920\nentertain the idea that you might get thrown out, but that you might serve. And that entwines with\n\n15:37.920 --> 15:43.920\nyour fraud complex, which is like, oh, you know, why am I better than a seat filler? The, you know,\n\n15:43.920 --> 15:47.200\nof course, you're gonna, your mind's gonna go there when it's like that we like any place where\n\n15:47.200 --> 15:55.040\nthere's class is imputed, whatever. That's not the word in life. Like your head immediately goes,\n\n15:55.040 --> 16:01.280\nwhat am I doing here? What am I doing? And then, so then you think and then that, yeah, I, it's\n\n16:01.280 --> 16:07.520\nboth of those things. It's like, like, what, like, how can you fucking, so if you got, if you, if you\n\n16:07.520 --> 16:15.360\nwere like, would I, would I, and didn't I? Yeah, I did. Yeah, that's all I did. Just fill the seat.\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:22.000\nAlso, you do, you kind of, it resets you. Like you said, you go, Jesus Christ, we're in the same\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:27.760\nspace right now. Yours is a fraud, and that you're not supposed to be here. So is mine. And so is mine.\n\n16:27.760 --> 16:34.640\nYeah. And you have like some like, like quirky in 90s indie movie thing, or like, I'm going to give\n\n16:34.640 --> 16:42.080\nyou this, my dead father's watch. Yeah. When it stops ticking, you and I trade back or whatever,\n\n16:42.080 --> 16:49.440\nlike, just like sliding doors thing, or like, I keep filling the seat or, or like Donald Sutherland\n\n16:49.440 --> 16:54.880\ncomes down with a popcorn cart, and he's like, like, there's like a seat filler coupon, but it's\n\n16:54.880 --> 17:00.400\nmagic. And like, so like, I, and I'm like being obnoxious and doing coke and going like, at least\n\n17:00.400 --> 17:10.560\nI'm not a seat filler. I'll tell you what, I wish, I wish, I wish I could fill his seat just to show\n\n17:10.560 --> 17:19.920\nhim how much more I do with it. Yo, Sutherland popcorn. Here you go. I'm from Maine. It's\n\n17:19.920 --> 17:35.200\nlightning. Are you referencing the Marsha Mason movie? I don't know what movie I'm. It's the Jason\n\n17:35.200 --> 17:40.480\nRobarts comes to town. Oh, well, Jason wrote you mean dream a little dream. Was that what it was called?\n\n17:40.480 --> 17:45.920\nNo, it's this. It's a single mother. She's got a son. Oh, Mr. Dynamite or something like that.\n\n17:45.920 --> 17:49.760\nMr. Dynamite. Fantastic. He comes to town and he changes this woman's life. He's a millionaire.\n\n17:49.760 --> 17:55.120\nIt's ages old, but it's very similar. Oh, no, I'm not familiar with this. I thought you were talking\n\n17:55.120 --> 17:58.880\nabout like, because we were vaguely alluding to body swapping things. Did you see the thing\n\n17:58.880 --> 18:05.520\nwith him and Corey Feldman? No, but apparently a lot of movies share the same plot. Yeah,\n\n18:06.560 --> 18:10.480\nmagic abounds. All right, well, let's let's let's bring out Rob Schrab.\n\n18:12.640 --> 18:22.800\nLadies and gentlemen, back from a season of championships, we welcome the wonderful Rob\n\n18:22.800 --> 18:38.080\nSchrab. Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Schrab. Welcome back.\n\n18:41.200 --> 18:47.280\nHello. What did we do during the show after the 300th one? I was a\n\n18:47.280 --> 18:53.120\nOh, no, I wasn't here. Are you talking to me? Anyone that was here? I don't know.\n\n18:53.120 --> 18:55.360\nSchrab wasn't here. So good thing you brought me out.\n\n18:59.760 --> 19:05.360\nI was just lying. Schrab was here. Hey, read you a quick.\n\n19:07.840 --> 19:14.560\nThis is from like, okay, you want to know me. Maybe it's maybe for one hour. It's safe to click\n\n19:14.560 --> 19:23.840\nyour name. I get emails from the publicity firm. They go like, oh, press roundup or whatever. And\n\n19:23.840 --> 19:29.520\nthey even vet them for like, you know, they're not going to like, you know, here's here's all of your\n\n19:29.520 --> 19:34.400\nyou being mentioned on the internet. Like, they lose clients that way. This is the first win for\n\n19:34.400 --> 19:40.480\nadult swim. Oh, shit, right? Wait, no, wait, is this their first Emmy adult swim? Well, I don't\n\n19:40.480 --> 19:44.880\nI don't know about that. I know. I mean, it's certainly it was good to see you too, Dan.\n\n19:46.720 --> 19:49.280\nWell, you you put you paused and I had a thing.\n\n19:51.040 --> 19:55.040\nOkay, here it is. All right, sorry. A lot of that was just I don't know how to work my phone.\n\n19:55.040 --> 19:59.200\nYou can't do that. You can't come out and then sit for five minutes. And then I'm like, all right,\n\n19:59.200 --> 20:03.760\nmoving on. I'm going to do this thing. And then you're like, well, how do you do, you know, come\n\n20:03.760 --> 20:08.800\nout with a fucking story about a bear or something or come out, make yourself at home and chill. And\n\n20:08.800 --> 20:14.080\nI'm not going to tell my thing about my the thing I got my phone. That's another way to do it.\n\n20:15.920 --> 20:21.600\nWhat do you want me to ask you? Like, oh, what's been going on like a host of a show?\n\n20:23.680 --> 20:28.080\nNo, just invite somebody out to heaven, sit and watch you talk.\n\n20:28.080 --> 20:39.600\nAll right, now let's build out to bring out Bill Johnson. All right, Bill Johnson, sit down.\n\n20:39.600 --> 20:45.600\nSo anyway, I was eating a sandwich. This sandwich is fucking great. I was eating this.\n\n20:46.400 --> 20:53.200\nBill Johnson is going, why did why did I even leave the house? Why did I come here? I don't have to\n\n20:53.200 --> 21:01.760\nstand. All right, well, what's new with you? And it better be fucking amazing.\n\n21:03.520 --> 21:11.440\nVape adventures. Oh, okay. I'm into vapes now as what did you did you and Spencer Spencer and I\n\n21:11.440 --> 21:25.040\nwent on a vape adventure and a vape sure a Spencer vape adventure. So hashtag vape culture, vape\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:34.560\nculture. Okay, all right. I, I thought I thought it through in my head. I categorized it as not\n\n21:34.560 --> 21:43.120\ntechnically a rape joke. But right, the customer is always right. And let's let's keep communicating\n\n21:43.120 --> 21:49.120\nlike that. And I'm fine with it if you are. I did I vetted it. I did not want to hurt anybody.\n\n21:50.160 --> 21:56.400\nThe public has spoken rhyming counts and I didn't know it. And I will not make the same mistake\n\n21:56.400 --> 22:03.600\nagain. That debt, you know, we're a couple years away from that being on a poster of some dream\n\n22:03.600 --> 22:12.240\nworks. Like I mean, yeah, well, yeah, grape culture. Oh, I didn't know that's\n\n22:12.240 --> 22:19.360\nrude. I mean, yeah, yeah, like, okay. And we're gonna be gone. Oh, grape culture. That sounds\n\n22:19.360 --> 22:28.320\nfamiliar. Jesus. What the fuck? Mommy, why is it that interesting? I don't know. Who are you?\n\n22:28.320 --> 22:38.240\nWhy are you in my car? Vape adventure starring Spencer, Rob and Kate. So Spencer text me super\n\n22:38.240 --> 22:45.760\nearly in the morning. So early. So early. Like, um, like what, like 415. What? Yeah. No, no,\n\n22:45.760 --> 22:52.400\nnot that. Actually, I think you, you, you texted me like, like the night before and I didn't get\n\n22:52.400 --> 22:59.840\nit until the night of all important information. So, uh, you know, you come over and we go to the\n\n22:59.840 --> 23:07.040\nmagic place where, you know, you get your vape on and there's like, there's so much Rick and Morty\n\n23:07.040 --> 23:11.360\nstuff there, Dan, they got it all hang out. You should go there. You should go. Well,\n\n23:14.720 --> 23:21.040\npretty cool. He's got the hanging on wall. They might give you some free shit.\n\n23:21.040 --> 23:29.920\nMight give you some free shit. Oh, I got the one and I mean, pretty cool. You got that on the\n\n23:29.920 --> 23:36.320\nwall. Rob's doing a good face. Pretty cool. You got it on the wall. I just wanted to do with that a\n\n23:36.320 --> 23:44.800\nlittle bit. Why is he elbow? Look at his face he's making. So anyway, we go in there and they set\n\n23:44.800 --> 23:49.760\nme up with vape. They said Kate and I up with some good vapes. We got some good vapes. Like, we got\n\n23:49.760 --> 23:56.480\ntwo different brands. We got or not flavors. What are they called? Uh, well, that there's\n\n23:56.480 --> 24:01.920\ndifferent like varieties of weed that are called brands. Okay. So we got two different brands.\n\n24:03.120 --> 24:08.160\nGo home and Spencer is like, all right, that's how you do it. And he said, he tells us how to put\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:13.360\nthe battering thing. He's squeezing in there and they're like, I got what? Chocolate? What did I\n\n24:13.360 --> 24:20.080\nget? I think you got chocolate. I got chocolate or something. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate.\n\n24:20.080 --> 24:25.680\nWas it? I do this. I go, I go. Okay. So was it got a button? No, I think you can just,\n\n24:25.680 --> 24:32.640\nyou can just like, you know, you know, suck on it. Oh, God, sorry. Everybody give him a second.\n\n24:34.240 --> 24:37.280\nHe did. Because you know what else you suck on is ticks and titties.\n\n24:37.280 --> 24:42.800\nAll manner of hilarious things. So I go, okay. So how do you do it?\n\n24:47.040 --> 24:50.080\nBecause I was trying to make, and I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing.\n\n24:51.200 --> 24:56.320\nYou can't see the light because it's down the pipe right away. So I did it. So, so anyway,\n\n24:57.360 --> 25:03.040\nSpencer turns around and goes, wow, that was, whoa, boy, you took a big hit there. I like,\n\n25:03.040 --> 25:07.360\nand then I was like, yeah, the thing you got to know is like the big hits, you just not, not to hit\n\n25:07.360 --> 25:12.480\nlike that at first. Okay, don't do that. So I'm like, I don't really feel anything.\n\n25:19.440 --> 25:27.120\nAnd then I go, Kate, we got to go to cryotherapy right now. Cryotherapy cry. Is it, am I pronouncing?\n\n25:27.120 --> 25:33.120\nNo, I assume cryotherapy. Flash frozen. So this is, this is, why did you want to get flash?\n\n25:35.120 --> 25:39.200\nFirst of all, are you for real? Did you go to cryotherapy? Because you got too high?\n\n25:39.200 --> 25:43.840\nYeah. So second of all, then now you have to stop and explain not for a high vauding agent.\n\n25:43.840 --> 25:48.800\nHe was going to go anyway. Everybody listening. Well, we were talking about it for a long time.\n\n25:48.800 --> 25:54.320\nWe kept like, we were going to do, I had the whole day. Just tell them what cryotherapy is.\n\n25:54.320 --> 25:58.880\nCryotherapy is something that Joel Hodgson told me about. He went on, like, when we were doing\n\n25:58.880 --> 26:03.840\nmystery science theater this summer, like, after every shoot, he would go, Hey, man,\n\n26:03.840 --> 26:08.400\nyou want to do some cryotherapy? Man, it's pretty cool. You should check it out. It's good for your\n\n26:08.400 --> 26:14.160\nskin. Help my back. Might get frozen while some crazy movies playing and have some kind of stuff\n\n26:14.160 --> 26:20.640\nto say about it. You got to do it, man. It's the best, you know. And so, so I, I never did it,\n\n26:20.640 --> 26:27.040\nbut I, I always wanted to try it. And then, and the thing that I go, so what do you do is, well,\n\n26:27.040 --> 26:39.680\nyou go into this, like, shower sized room that is like, like, lots of degrees below zero. And you\n\n26:39.680 --> 26:44.000\ngo in there for three minutes and you do jumping jacks and you get it. And what it does is they\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:50.560\nget, it makes your body go into this fight or flight mode where everything is on deck going, Jesus\n\n26:50.560 --> 26:55.840\nChrist, what are you doing? This is, you're trying to kill yourself. This is stupid. And it's supposed\n\n26:55.840 --> 27:02.000\nto, like, bring supposed to, you know, be good for your skin, but mostly wake you up and if you\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:08.400\nsleep at night. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know. It's probably stupid. But anyway, how much, how\n\n27:08.400 --> 27:22.480\nmuch, how much, how much, how much, how much, how much, how much, how much, it was way, what's the,\n\n27:22.480 --> 27:30.480\nwhat's the number that would make you then not go white people? What's it, if it was seven dollars,\n\n27:30.480 --> 27:35.360\nwould you be like, all right, okay, fine. It's seven dollars. I'm like, okay, freeze me for seven\n\n27:35.360 --> 27:39.360\ndollars. It still, it wasn't seven dollars. It's still, it's always going to be white people.\n\n27:41.760 --> 27:47.120\nJust walking into a shower where it's cold, white people, some shit you have in your house. But\n\n27:47.120 --> 27:52.880\nthat part, but I do believe that it is probably one of those things where it's like, it's a thousand\n\n27:52.880 --> 27:59.280\ndollars. I mean, it can't be, because if it's 30, if it's 30 dollars, you wouldn't do it, right?\n\n27:59.280 --> 28:04.720\nLike you can't, you don't freeze your body, even if it only caused them a nickel, they'd make more\n\n28:04.720 --> 28:09.840\nmoney if they charged $90 than 30, because it wasn't 30. It's like, I'm not going to have you\n\n28:09.840 --> 28:18.640\nfreeze my body for the price of a transformer. What, how much was it? I don't, I didn't, I didn't\n\n28:18.640 --> 28:26.960\nset it up, dude. I was fucking, I was, that's my guess. My guess is $179. All right, okay, fine.\n\n28:26.960 --> 28:32.960\nAnd there's specials for couples and whatever. So anyway, Joel is telling me, you do this,\n\n28:32.960 --> 28:37.120\nyou do this, man, you're doing, they play music and you dance around there if you want. And I go,\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:45.680\ndo you get to pick the music? Yeah. What song did you, did you play, Joel? Tell me. And he's like,\n\n28:45.680 --> 28:54.640\nyou got all bashful. And he goes, do you believe in life after love by, by Cher? Because Joel's a\n\n28:54.640 --> 29:00.320\nhuge Cher fan, as we know. We're like, he loves Cher. Like not, I, I didn't know, I learned from\n\n29:00.320 --> 29:08.080\nthis. Yeah. Well, he, he, he goes to Cher concert. It's, it's, it's amazing. So I go, Kate, and I'm\n\n29:08.080 --> 29:15.280\nlike, so we go there. 70 bucks. Is it 70? 70 bucks. How do we add a coupon?\n\n29:20.320 --> 29:26.800\nIt's like that is 30 bucks. I'll rub ice on your head. I'll make, I'll make you feel things and\n\n29:26.800 --> 29:34.000\ncome back. Deal, deal. So anyway, we, because we're a couple of weeks, we can both go in the,\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:42.400\ninto the chamber at the same time. And they go, okay, all right, Mr. Scrab and Kate friend,\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:47.200\nwhatever, you know, we're standing in our underwear, you know, like getting ready to\n\n29:47.200 --> 29:53.200\nfreeze ourselves to death. And, and they, and he says, what music do you want to listen to?\n\n29:53.200 --> 30:04.560\nAnd Kate goes, money for nothing. And I'm like, no, no, we have to do, do you believe in life\n\n30:04.560 --> 30:12.560\nafter love by Cher? Oh, come on. She's like, all right, sure, fine. I'm like, okay, fine.\n\n30:12.560 --> 30:17.360\nAre you guys Cher or a thing? Yeah, you, because we're a couple, we can do that. Okay. You and I\n\n30:17.360 --> 30:23.200\ncan do it next. Okay. All right. And so we go in there. And the guy goes, yeah, we can play that\n\n30:23.200 --> 30:30.160\nsong. We got an apple, whatever, we put it on, it goes in, it's freezing. And you remember being\n\n30:30.160 --> 30:36.000\nin Wisconsin, where you're like, Oh, I got to throw out this, I got to let the dog in, whatever. I'm\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:46.800\ntoo lazy to put on a jacket or a hat or whatever. It's like that feeling. I remember it totally.\n\n30:46.800 --> 30:52.480\nAnd it goes, and it's freezing. So the music comes on. And it's the wrong song.\n\n30:54.800 --> 31:01.680\nSo everybody I'm assuming knows, do you believe in life after love after love? Good song. Good song\n\n31:01.680 --> 31:07.120\nto jump around like an idiot so you don't freeze to death. Instead, they play, what's the song? I\n\n31:07.120 --> 31:18.480\nwrote it down. After all by Sharon Peter Cetera, which is this love ballad. After all that we've\n\n31:18.480 --> 31:30.080\nbeen through, it's just this. And we're both going, God damn it, wrong song, banging on the glass.\n\n31:30.080 --> 31:38.240\nWrong song. And the guy's like, he's like a carny. He's just like in a booth. I didn't know\n\n31:38.240 --> 31:45.440\nthere was a guy, he could see you. You want to go colder? It's pretty, it's pretty close to that.\n\n31:45.440 --> 31:49.600\nDo you all have to get naked for this? No, no, no, but I'm in my underwear. We're both.\n\n31:49.600 --> 31:55.120\nBut you're not wearing pants. Yeah. I mean, you're in your unders. That's not naked. I know. But\n\n31:55.120 --> 32:04.320\nthe important answer to your question is this is a ridiculous situation. And it's much more than\n\n32:04.320 --> 32:09.280\na lot of us could get paid $70 to do. I'm not trying to high road this. I don't want to be one\n\n32:09.280 --> 32:17.920\nof these practical guys. It's like $70 to be cold. I'm not going to be that guy. Don't. I'm not.\n\n32:17.920 --> 32:29.520\nYou're not allowed. I do crazy. I pay $70 to simulate living in a post apocalyptic\n\n32:30.640 --> 32:38.080\nplace in Boston where I spend nine hours a night sorting my living room. I'll pay for the high\n\n32:38.080 --> 32:42.640\nresolution pack of a video game just so the cupboards could look better as I'm like figuring\n\n32:42.640 --> 32:48.800\nout where to put my duct tape. And my fucking house is falling apart around me. And somebody's\n\n32:48.800 --> 32:54.320\nlike, did you put an orange Julius on the dog's head? Yeah, I don't care about life. I'm trying\n\n32:54.320 --> 32:59.920\nto sort my fallout apartment. Anyways, continue. I just wanted to interject it with a little bit\n\n32:59.920 --> 33:05.920\nof what the people really want, which is, wow. No matter how much you dilute yourself,\n\n33:05.920 --> 33:12.560\nyou still got a little bit of me in there. Keep going. Keep going. They got what they need.\n\n33:12.560 --> 33:23.040\nKeep going. Okay. So the fucking computer system goes three minutes left. And you're like, oh,\n\n33:23.040 --> 33:29.840\nfuck you. Three minutes? And we're screaming, fuck you. Wrong song. Kate and I are both going,\n\n33:29.840 --> 33:36.000\nwrong fucking song. I fucking hate this song. This song made it last like it was eight minutes.\n\n33:36.880 --> 33:41.280\nIt was slow. I mean, at least with an uptempo song, it would feel\n\n33:42.240 --> 33:48.000\nshorter. It didn't. This was awful. And then we get out and we go wrong song. Oh,\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:55.360\nall right. You know, did you just press like any share song at random? It doesn't work that way.\n\n33:55.360 --> 34:00.960\nIt doesn't. You can get out. Did he say? Yeah, were you locked inside? That sounds\n\n34:00.960 --> 34:07.120\nterrifying. No, I wasn't locked, but we committed to it. Okay, sure. And, and, and...\n\n34:07.120 --> 34:14.080\nThis motherfucker deserved it. And I deserved it. Did he say that he would make it up to you?\n\n34:14.080 --> 34:15.840\nNo. He didn't promise to?\n\n34:15.840 --> 34:22.800\nNo. I mean, after all that you'd been through.\n\n34:25.520 --> 34:31.360\nYeah. I don't even remember that song. I don't know that song at all. You're...\n\n34:31.360 --> 34:32.640\nAnd I love Peter Sotero.\n\n34:35.360 --> 34:41.120\nI'll play it. I'll play it for you later. And, but anyway, through this whole thing,\n\n34:41.120 --> 34:48.480\nI'm still stoned AF, motherfucker. I am stoned as fuck. I'm just like going,\n\n34:48.480 --> 34:55.920\nI would think this freezing cold sensation would sober me up, but I was fucked up all day.\n\n34:56.720 --> 35:00.880\nAfter we leave, I go, hey, let's go to this restaurant that's right next door.\n\n35:01.920 --> 35:07.520\nAnd we drove over there. We got it ordered all this food. I just kept eating, eating, eating.\n\n35:07.520 --> 35:12.640\nOkay. It's like, you're just so, you're such a cliche of shaggy. What are you doing?\n\n35:13.840 --> 35:19.120\nThen I went home and then I, you know, had to take the dog. I don't remember half the day.\n\n35:19.120 --> 35:25.680\nI remember doing this a lot on the couch, just laying there. And then I go to take Lolly to\n\n35:25.680 --> 35:31.840\nthe dog groomer to wash the dog because she's got shit on her butt. And so I take, take the dog\n\n35:31.840 --> 35:37.600\nover there. And then I was like, it's closest to where Steve Agee lives. So I go to Steve Agee.\n\n35:37.600 --> 35:42.800\nI said, Hey, can I hang out while my dog's getting her ass washed? If I bring a bunch of ice cream,\n\n35:42.800 --> 35:50.240\nI bring a bunch of ice cream over to Steve Agee's house. And he was watching the Twilight Zone.\n\n35:50.240 --> 35:58.400\nI eat like a whole tub of ice cream, talked over the Twilight Zone. He was trying to record a podcast.\n\n35:58.400 --> 36:03.120\nAnd then I was like going, Hey, my dog's done. Talk to you later. I don't think he said anything.\n\n36:03.120 --> 36:09.440\nAnd I just left and I'm just, and then I was like, did I come over by your house yesterday\n\n36:09.440 --> 36:14.720\nand talk over your television show and ate ice cream? Yeah. Yeah. You did all of that.\n\n36:14.720 --> 36:18.240\nYeah. A lot of people, I'm glad you're not then moving on to try to convince people that you're\n\n36:18.240 --> 36:24.880\nnot having the best life in the world. That's not, I think I would like to spend the day doing that.\n\n36:24.880 --> 36:34.640\nIt was, it was, it was quite good. I almost went to do VR like Star Wars VR.\n\n36:34.640 --> 36:38.240\nYou hear about this void? Yeah. Oh, okay.\n\n36:41.360 --> 36:47.200\nLet me tell you something. Did you look at, he came out with notes like a, like an alternative\n\n36:47.200 --> 36:56.080\ncomic in San Francisco. He's got a, he's got a whole notepad. Here's another question. Here's\n\n36:56.080 --> 37:05.520\na question. Okay. All right. So, you know, I was watching this movie with Kate and it,\n\n37:05.520 --> 37:10.720\nit was like this British movie came out last year. It's like these two old people falling\n\n37:10.720 --> 37:15.600\nin love and learning how to dance and doing a whatever. I know it sounds right up your alley.\n\n37:15.600 --> 37:22.960\nAnd throw me under the bus. I love feelings. Anyway, it was, it was sweet. It was cheesy\n\n37:22.960 --> 37:27.600\nor whatever. And I was like thinking like, well, there's like this demographic, this\n\n37:27.600 --> 37:33.920\nabout Schmidt bucket list, Morgan Freeman, you know, Alan Arkin, like,\n\n37:35.360 --> 37:39.440\nthey, you know, it's like the matlock of movies or whatever, where they go, we're gonna go,\n\n37:39.440 --> 37:43.840\nokay, we're targeting these baby boomers or whatever. You know what I'm talking about.\n\n37:43.840 --> 37:50.640\nYes. It's the, it's the something's got to give the right. What's with your, what's with your\n\n37:50.640 --> 37:58.080\ncroissant? Yeah, I'm kind of like, Mickey, Mickey Oldman and he wears a sweater. Johnson are,\n\n37:58.080 --> 38:02.160\nyou know, but it's like people that we remember as ghostbusters and stuff. Yeah.\n\n38:02.160 --> 38:08.960\nBecause I don't ask that our arteries are slowly my question to you as a writer and a producer\n\n38:08.960 --> 38:18.080\nof various things. Do you think that when our generation hits that, are there going to be more\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:25.440\nlike sci-fi, you know, fantasy stuff featuring old people? Or do we just get to it? Jason Sudeikiss\n\n38:25.440 --> 38:32.800\nand Allison Brie are fighting an insect monster. Yeah. But they're like, we're like good walkers.\n\n38:33.440 --> 38:36.880\nBecause it reminds us of a simpler time. Kind of back to the future.\n\n38:36.880 --> 38:42.720\nJust showed up with the ray gun. God damn it. Well, do you love me or not? I don't know. We\n\n38:42.720 --> 38:56.240\ngrew up friends. All I want to do is see my grandchildren on Easter. Oh, well, Jesus, it's\n\n38:56.240 --> 39:10.080\nnot very sci-fi. But how about Kevin Hart in How We Go Get Back to Earth? Or when I was your age,\n\n39:10.080 --> 39:14.800\nEarth was uphill, you know, because it'll be more about, it'll be more like, are we there yet?\n\n39:14.800 --> 39:22.400\nYou know, that sounds like that could come out tomorrow. Is there like a whole series of\n\n39:22.400 --> 39:27.440\nhow are we going to get back to blanks? Tiffany Haddish has, how are we going to get back tomorrow?\n\n39:29.760 --> 39:36.320\nThe Kevin Hart series, Kevin Hart 70, and it's a yes. How are we going to get back to blank series?\n\n39:36.320 --> 39:41.680\nAnd then it gets to the point where it's so over saturated that the movies have to start\n\n39:41.680 --> 39:53.920\nbecoming like, how are we going to get back to meet the meets Jason Voorhees? I'm trying to think\n\n39:53.920 --> 40:00.080\nof an example. It's like, God damn it. If I wish when we were making First Blood, we had known\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:06.560\nthat we were just making a franchise called Rambo. We made this so confusing. What do you mean,\n\n40:06.560 --> 40:12.480\nRambo colon First Blood part two? That's so confusing. What are we going to call the third\n\n40:12.480 --> 40:21.840\nmovie? I have an idea. Yes, Mr. S? Rambo three. Okay, fine. But that's not, I mean, our point is,\n\n40:21.840 --> 40:31.920\nyour point is make a third movie. But First Blood part two, look, we could call it second blood\n\n40:31.920 --> 40:38.080\nand just get rid of the last. We could call it the bloodening. Yeah, just sort of keep it more blood.\n\n40:38.080 --> 40:42.080\nCall it second blood, first blood, first blood, second blood, third blood, you know,\n\n40:42.080 --> 40:46.320\nthey would fucking die for opportunity to do that. They'd make so much money if they would have done\n\n40:46.320 --> 40:52.000\nthat. God damn it. I'm sorry. I hate that you've taken on this role. Oh, no, I don't. I love it.\n\n40:52.000 --> 41:03.200\nI love it because it's I love irony. I love watching you turn into your mother. After all\n\n41:03.200 --> 41:08.480\nof these years of friendship, we bonded, our original bond, it was like, you know, we bonded\n\n41:08.480 --> 41:12.480\nover the fact that we were raised in a culture of, oh, you're in Milwaukee, and you got your\n\n41:12.480 --> 41:17.360\npacifier in your mouth, and you look at a Wrigley's billboard, and you're like, how come the billboard\n\n41:17.360 --> 41:22.640\nmakes look like a gum's a bad idea? And your and your parents go like, you're talking about it.\n\n41:22.640 --> 41:27.120\nAnd we like bonded about it. We're like, yeah, man. And then to get out here and like make stuff.\n\n41:27.120 --> 41:33.760\nAnd now look at you, man, you're fucking Saruman. And I'm Gandalf the White.\n\n41:36.800 --> 41:42.480\nAnd I'll tell you what, man, put me on the roof of your tower and leave me up there forever\n\n41:42.480 --> 41:49.920\nwhile you make new kinds of goblins. And then I hope you visit me every once in a while.\n\n41:49.920 --> 41:57.040\nBut I'll tell you what, man, there's moths everywhere. And they talk to eagles. And I will\n\n41:57.040 --> 42:03.040\nget out of here because you should have just killed me. Okay, don't hate the wizard hate the\n\n42:03.040 --> 42:08.800\nweird fucking rules. Yep. Yep. Everybody, everybody's against you. I know. Yeah.\n\n42:08.800 --> 42:14.560\nYeah. I get it. It's pretty bad. You got to know that's you. You know that guy's you when Gandalf\n\n42:14.560 --> 42:19.600\ngoes you when you watched Lord of the Rings, we never talked about it. Why is there we watch\n\n42:19.600 --> 42:24.240\ngrumpy old men are like, Oh, that's you. And that's me. Like, like, when we watched American Splendor,\n\n42:24.240 --> 42:29.280\nwe knew that, you know, you were crumb and I was the Harvey P car. We were like, Okay, that's us.\n\n42:29.280 --> 42:34.880\nYeah. And then, but, you know, we never checked in. We never called each other Lord of the Rings\n\n42:34.880 --> 42:39.120\nago. Come on, you're Saruman. Like when when fucking Gandalf rides up, he's like, I'm going to go\n\n42:39.120 --> 42:47.200\nand the guy's like, Don't let me touch that ring. It's so powerful. I'm going to go talk to my friend\n\n42:47.200 --> 42:52.800\nSaruman about it. He's the best friend I've ever had. I've never trusted anyone in my life. Don't\n\n42:52.800 --> 42:58.880\nlet me touch that ring. I'm so smart about this shit. I'm going to go to the library, look up a\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:03.680\ncouple things. I'm going to go see my roommate from college. I'll tell him everything. I never\n\n43:03.680 --> 43:08.480\ntrusted anybody more in my life. I'm just I live on a different plane where I know about everything.\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:14.080\nAnd it's you. Yeah. And you're like, look into the crystal ball. What do you see? Oh, it is like,\n\n43:14.080 --> 43:20.080\nI see it all because I'm fucking like, because you're yeah, that's you. I saw I saw that guy and\n\n43:20.080 --> 43:27.200\nI was like, that's Schrab. And I'm the only one that sees it. You know, nobody looks at me and\n\n43:27.200 --> 43:32.240\ngoes, That's Gandalf. But like, I am like, I'm like, like the self destructiveness, like you\n\n43:32.240 --> 43:36.400\nshall not pass. Who does that? Somebody that hates himself. Like he knows that's a ball rock. He knows\n\n43:36.400 --> 43:40.560\nhe's going to die. But he doesn't care. Because he's like, fuck it. You know what, people feel\n\n43:40.560 --> 43:47.120\nsorry for me. I'll probably come back to life anyway. I get that. Why do you say they love each\n\n43:47.120 --> 43:51.600\nother? And the way he said fly you fools so that people would spend a year trying to figure out\n\n43:51.600 --> 43:58.000\nwhether what he said, because we're like, what, what fire you fool? What? What did he say? Like,\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:04.320\nhe got to buy like special shit to know what he said. Close captioning. What? You gotta buy close\n\n44:04.320 --> 44:12.080\ncaptioning. Yeah. But at the root of all that, you're basically saying, I love you, dog. No, dude.\n\n44:12.080 --> 44:16.720\nWell, I mean, look, because you went way too deep on that for somebody who's not in love.\n\n44:18.320 --> 44:23.520\nYou can keep chipping away at this theory that I love, Rob. Like I people like to do that. Like\n\n44:23.520 --> 44:32.640\ntheories. This concept that you've been coming up with now, Rob.\n\n44:33.680 --> 44:38.880\nRob, do you have anything nice to say to your brother? That's not what this show's about. It's\n\n44:38.880 --> 44:44.560\nnot. It doesn't have to be a show about. Yeah, I don't want to share this anymore. I thought\n\n44:44.560 --> 44:54.800\nthis was funny, but can I ask you a quick question that everyone is probably did you call? Oh, I\n\n44:54.800 --> 45:04.480\ntexted my parents. You don't know this, but three people in the back just fist bumped.\n\n45:04.480 --> 45:14.480\nI texted them a photo of my second Emmy with an arrow pointing at it because there's two of them.\n\n45:17.040 --> 45:23.200\nOne must be for humility. Are they most outstanding use of humility in a straight\n\n45:23.200 --> 45:30.640\nwhite male? Does the new Emmy look newer than the old one? Can you see that? No,\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:37.120\nwell, I haven't looked that close to them. I'm high on life. Okay. So I texted the photo,\n\n45:37.120 --> 45:42.080\nand then my mom texted. We just found out. Yesterday, congratulations. I'm very proud of\n\n45:42.080 --> 45:47.600\nyou. And then she said, did we ever congratulate you on your 70 episode thing? So cool. And then\n\n45:47.600 --> 45:52.480\nthere was like a pause. And then the last thing was from my mom saying, you were right. Leave the car\n\n45:52.480 --> 46:01.600\nwhere it is, which I assume is just she just did you text your other dad as well? I did.\n\n46:01.600 --> 46:06.800\nActually, well, yeah, because he, he, he, my, my, my surrogate father, Heath Collins,\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:12.000\nwho is still dad and my phone texted congratulations. And I was like, thank you, dad. And we actually\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:16.640\nbonded for a while about it. And yeah, it was nice. Actually, I think we've decided to just\n\n46:16.640 --> 46:22.400\nrole play that now. And it's kind of like, yeah, if that works, then that's, that should be how it\n\n46:22.400 --> 46:29.680\nworks. And you're glowing. You're glowing. Thank you. Very, very happy. All right. Let me read you\n\n46:29.680 --> 46:34.800\nguys this because I want to be happy with yourself. So like I said, like I was saying earlier, so\n\n46:34.800 --> 46:43.200\nyou go like, okay, well, why isn't the tongue considered like more than it is? I mean, it's not\n\n46:43.200 --> 46:48.400\na limb, but it's like, you know, it's a fingernail away from being a mouth finger, you know, like\n\n46:48.400 --> 46:55.200\nit's, it's, why is it, why don't we say it's like a tongue, the tongue, the tongue, way better than\n\n46:55.200 --> 47:05.920\na finger. Mouth finger. You could point with it. What you need is somebody to ground you.\n\n47:05.920 --> 47:12.800\nYeah, I mean, it's, I think we make, she won't come to Harmontown.\n\n47:15.520 --> 47:18.480\nAll right, let us have it. You know that we're tubes.\n\n47:21.840 --> 47:27.600\nWe're like big worms. Yeah. Not me. And then when you eat something, you're just rubbing up against\n\n47:27.600 --> 47:32.800\nit with the outside of your body that became the inner ring of this like, torus shape that's\n\n47:32.800 --> 47:36.800\nbeen extruded. Not me though. That doesn't apply to me.\n\n47:39.520 --> 47:46.000\nAll right. And that's why butt chugging will kill you kids. Don't do it. You're putting vodka into\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:53.680\na hole that is not designed. Butt chugging? Yes. Oh yeah. Kids are dying out there. They put funnels\n\n47:53.680 --> 48:00.000\nin their asses and pour whiskey down it. And they're dying from butt chugging. And the ladies with\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:07.520\nthe tampons and the ladies and the tampons. Those are the people dumping vodka into your butt?\n\n48:08.160 --> 48:12.000\nNo, I don't know if they are. I don't know who's helping with that. The ladies and the tampons.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:17.760\nThe vodka soaked tampons is the other thing. Vodka soaked tampons. It hits your system quicker\n\n48:17.760 --> 48:25.040\nbecause those membranes are more, are less, less selective, I guess. What fucking Emmy parties\n\n48:25.040 --> 48:35.840\nwere you going to? I didn't go to any. I needed to die. Okay. All right. So I thought, okay,\n\n48:35.840 --> 48:40.000\nwhy don't you click on something? And this is not, this is not, I just, I thought-\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:44.800\nHow soon? Is this an hour after we're talking? No, this is right before I came to the show.\n\n48:44.800 --> 48:49.280\nBecause I was like, I went to my email and I was like, what's going on? All right, I got to deal\n\n48:49.280 --> 48:52.560\nwith that. I got to deal with that. And then there's, I always get one email from the publicist\n\n48:52.560 --> 48:57.680\nthat's like, press roundup. And then I'm like, well, all right. And then I'll just see a bunch of\n\n48:57.680 --> 49:02.720\nheadlines. And I was like, oh, I, the show won an Emmy. So like some extra big email, it's all\n\n49:02.720 --> 49:08.880\nhyperlinked. They go like, well, top, top one is AV club. And it says Pickle Rick won a fucking Emmy.\n\n49:08.880 --> 49:14.000\nYou know, it's like, which, which is more than just like reporting. And I just felt, I'm like,\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:19.120\nI'm just gonna, I'm gonna look at it, see what the AV club take is. That's such a long relationship\n\n49:19.120 --> 49:24.480\nwith, with them as a metric of television culture and whatnot. Like, let's just read the paragraph\n\n49:24.480 --> 49:28.720\nthere. And it was like, you know, faithful reporting of the fact and whatever. And then I'm like,\n\n49:28.720 --> 49:32.960\nGod damn it, there's the, there's the comment section. And you can just see the top of one. And\n\n49:32.960 --> 49:38.080\nthey have like this interface where you can, you have to click to unclog, like all of it. And I,\n\n49:38.080 --> 49:43.840\nsure enough, I fucking did. And I just saw this exchange. And this is not, this is not about me.\n\n49:43.840 --> 49:50.000\nNot about you. I thought this was nothing to do with you. This is not, this is not, it's\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:55.680\neverything about me. But it's not, it's not me going, you should feel sorry for me because\n\n49:55.680 --> 50:01.520\nthey're like, that's not what I'm doing. I'm like, I just think this is more like me kind of, in my\n\n50:01.520 --> 50:07.520\nmind, this is me dancing on the graves of my enemies. Because my enemies are humanity at this\n\n50:07.520 --> 50:13.600\npoint. Okay. So it's like, this is, there's a, the top, there's a comment that starts it as this guy\n\n50:13.600 --> 50:22.800\nsays, is that Harmon's first Emmy? Hot take. I like Dan Harmon. Not just his shows. I root for\n\n50:22.800 --> 50:30.480\nthe guy. Yeah, he slips up and acts like a drunken asshole sometimes. He will admit to that and\n\n50:30.480 --> 50:36.720\napologize for it and try to learn from it. Harmontown is going strong, 300 episodes in,\n\n50:36.720 --> 50:43.440\nwell-deserved Emmy win. That could be any of us. It's a weird, weird way to express it and like,\n\n50:43.440 --> 50:48.480\nbut we're not going to nitpick any of that. Then the replies to that. Because now we've\n\n50:48.480 --> 50:53.920\nstarted a conversation. Let's have it. I mean, hey, let's talk about this. This is what\n\n50:53.920 --> 50:59.360\nthe response goes, if he keeps slipping up, then he isn't really, all right, you know what, why\n\n50:59.360 --> 51:03.920\nam I, why am I making this guy have a funny voice? Please do. Let me, sorry. I like the voice.\n\n51:03.920 --> 51:08.480\nLet me make this guy James Brolin and let me just like, all right, let's keep him a funny voice.\n\n51:08.480 --> 51:13.360\nFuck this dude. James Brolin's good though. If he keeps slipping up, then he isn't really learning\n\n51:13.360 --> 51:22.320\nfrom it, is he? Apologizing is easy. Fixing your shit is the hard part, says pimp hand of Cisco.\n\n51:22.320 --> 51:34.800\nYeah. Yeah. And then a person responds to them. Yes. And says, yeah, this person's responding\n\n51:34.800 --> 51:42.800\nand they agree. Someone saw that and was like, yeah, I better get in there because same-z's.\n\n51:42.800 --> 51:52.480\nYeah. Yeah. Sometimes he strikes me as one of those, just do it and apologize if you get\n\n51:52.480 --> 52:00.480\ncaught type of guys. And he's just getting better at apologizing. What I think Schrab meant about\n\n52:00.480 --> 52:06.160\nsociety's worst nightmare. What if this famous person is in an endless cycle of headlines we're\n\n52:06.160 --> 52:12.080\nreading? What if he just keeps doing things we don't like and then saying he's sorry we didn't\n\n52:12.080 --> 52:21.680\nlike them? Oh my God, someone get a message to this guy before he wastes his life. Well, obviously\n\n52:21.680 --> 52:29.600\nit's a joke more for me than you, I guess. I just thought, I guess I'm the only person that\n\n52:29.600 --> 52:33.600\nunderstands what I'm talking about. I think there's a lot there. Yeah. It's a lot to unpack.\n\n52:33.600 --> 52:42.880\nRight. Sort of. Sort of. I just, can you, I'm just like, okay. You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, he strikes\n\n52:42.880 --> 52:55.280\nme as, stop right there. Who types that? He strikes me as I'm a human being. I strike you as nothing,\n\n52:55.280 --> 53:03.040\nyou don't know me. He strikes me as, he strikes me as a famous person is what he strikes you as.\n\n53:03.040 --> 53:09.200\nThat's how he's designed to strike you. That's how he will strike you because he's not your uncle\n\n53:09.200 --> 53:13.840\nand he's not your babysitter and he's not your mailman. So he strikes you as a famous person.\n\n53:13.840 --> 53:21.040\nNo, no, no, no. He strikes me as, he strikes me as the kind of guy. There's a lot of different kinds\n\n53:21.040 --> 53:27.680\nof guys. Let me get this straight. I'm going to go, hold on, Mr. Whiskers. Let me good little kitty.\n\n53:27.680 --> 53:35.200\nYou love it. This is the city of walking and calling is an outstanding parking ticket.\n\n53:38.240 --> 53:46.160\nYour mother still needs that kidney. Anyways, God damn it's fucking distractions. Dan Harmon strikes\n\n53:46.160 --> 53:56.400\nme as the kind of guy. I think he's just going to keep on doing things wrong. And then he just\n\n53:56.400 --> 54:02.160\nis going to keep on apologizing for them. And I for one, I want no part of it. I don't want\n\n54:02.160 --> 54:08.960\nany more part of it. I am closing my laptop, but I'm going to use ghost fingers to check in\n\n54:09.920 --> 54:16.320\nand see if he breaks that cycle, because only then will he get the ghost reward that I give to\n\n54:16.320 --> 54:22.640\npeople who've become perfect. And by perfect, I mean doing nothing and therefore not apologizing\n\n54:22.640 --> 54:33.280\nfor it. I hate America. But I also, it's not easy to apologize. That sentence sucks.\n\n54:34.480 --> 54:39.520\nIt's not easy to admit that you make mistakes. It's easy to say my bad, my bad, I'm sorry,\n\n54:39.520 --> 54:57.920\nI'm sorry, whatever. Sit your ass down, bro. I'm sorry. See? And then you stopped reading,\n\n54:57.920 --> 55:02.160\nI take it. Yes, I did. Good. At least I got that. At least I did. And maybe that's the only kind\n\n55:02.160 --> 55:07.040\nof improvement you could hope for. 45 years old, three years from retirement. Okay, I got to the\n\n55:07.040 --> 55:10.960\npoint where I only have to read three comments down before I'm like, what are you doing? Take a\n\n55:10.960 --> 55:18.320\nscreenshot and start with your friends. And also that I'm like, yeah. Did you say three years\n\n55:18.320 --> 55:24.960\ninto retirement? Three years till retirement. Oh, till retirement. Okay. So yeah, like watch me.\n\n55:24.960 --> 55:33.520\nWhat are you going to do? I'm going to play minecraft and I'm going to just sit around the\n\n55:33.520 --> 55:38.960\nhouse and kind of just poke around and you know, I'm going to, I'm just going to sit around and\n\n55:38.960 --> 55:50.080\nplay minecraft. You can beat his ass. That's the first day of retirement. Okay. All right. This\n\n55:50.080 --> 55:57.520\nis a story that'll make you feel better. Okay. So this happened to me on Labor Day. Labor Day. So\n\n55:57.520 --> 56:04.240\nit's Labor Day evening. Labor Day is now Labor Night. And I'm going, I'm walking the dog. I'm\n\n56:04.240 --> 56:09.520\nwalking the dog.

Do you speak Armenian? Speak Armenian. I'm like, no, I do not speak Armenian.\n\n56:35.600 --> 56:41.120\nAnd she goes, she looks like, oh my gosh, is something wrong? Or she's like, my baby fell\n\n56:41.120 --> 56:46.240\nout or whatever, you know, she comes over to me. She runs to me and she's holding like what looks\n\n56:46.240 --> 56:53.280\nlike a gummy bear wrapper. And she's pointing to it.

59:19.940\nBut it looked like something she picked off\n\n59:19.940 --> 59:22.980\ntheir car floor and looked like a gummy bear wrapper.\n\n59:22.980 --> 59:26.660\nAnd she kept pointing at it saying,

--> 59:36.100\nI know people that work at Costco who don't work for Costco.\n\n59:36.100 --> 59:41.100\nThey work within Costco and they have the whole sub industry\n\n59:41.900 --> 59:46.020\nof

like,\n\n01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.140\nand then it slowly turns into this.\n\n01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.420\nYou got a serious problem up there, buddy.\n\n01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.460\nThe crazy thing is, how long has she lived in LA?\n\n01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.260\nHas she ever seen a bald LAPD officer?\n\n01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.420\nAnd if so, why is she alive?\n\n01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.500\nIf she jumps out of cars and charges people\n\n01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.980\nwith an unknown object in her hand saying,\n\n01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:45.740\nlike, I mean, she like, statistically should be done.\n\n01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.620\nNow this is not necessarily like,\n\n01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.060\nit's more of a tag than anything.\n\n01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.580\nBut, and then I go home and I ordered pizza\n\n01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.460\nand I get back in and I'm like, I don't need to,\n\n01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.460\ngotta be bare on my, I'm

01:01:11.020\nThat's like, and then ding dong, the pizza's here.\n\n01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.780\nI go downstairs now.\n\n01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.620\nI don't know if this is related at all\n\n01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.220\nor whether it was a weird night, whatever.\n\n01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.140\nBut the pizza place that I order from,\n\n01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.780\nit's always the same guy that delivers the pizza.\n\n01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.420\nAnd he's an Armenian guy and he's like, oh, pizza boy,\n\n01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.180\npizza boy, pizza boy, good, oh, good,

other\n\n01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:27.260\nand say to ourselves, it's like, I'm not, I'm just like,\n\n01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.140\nI kind of, just because of the age we're living in now,\n\n01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.660\nwhere everybody's getting in trouble for everything,\n\n01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.180\nwhich you could just cynically go like, I've had it,\n\n01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:39.900\nI have had it, but also, it also just makes me think about\n\n01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.180\neverything that's said and everything we're saying\n\n01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.540\nto each other and all that stuff, but it's like,\n\n01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.860\neven my own body, the things that I tell myself\n\n01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.820\nwhen I look in the mirror, let alone like, just like,\n\n01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:56.780\nyeah, it's weird, like, I don't know,\n\n01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.980\nwhy am I trying to act like that's a big point that I'm\n\n01:05:58.980 --> 01:05:59.460\nmaking?\n\n01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:00.020\nIt is weird.\n\n01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.140\nIs this a new shirt?\n\n01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.660\nIs this shirt new?\n\n01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.940\nIt's probably old.\n\n01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.860\nI'm probably, I'm going through the closet and I'm like,\n\n01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:14.500\nI have had guys maybe back me up, guys with fluctuating weight,\n\n01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.860\nyou get a shirt where the buttons are popping,\n\n01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.740\nand you don't put it in the Goodwill bag right away.\n\n01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.900\nNot if you're fluctuating weight, like, you take it\n\n01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.220\nand you look at it and you go, I'll be back, motherfucker.\n\n01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.340\nAnd then slowly over the years, because you keep getting\n\n01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.220\nfatter, your weight fluctuates, but you keep getting fatter.\n\n01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:38.220\nSo if you're lucky enough to have a big enough closet,\n\n01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.860\nlike, you start to, the overall effect\n\n01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:44.300\nis a large library of shirts that never fit you\n\n01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.220\nfor various reasons.\n\n01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:50.860\nAnd it, every morning, I have like a 10-minute pad\n\n01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.900\nthat I have to give myself, because I'm like going through\n\n01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.380\nand going, oh yeah, what's your name?\n\n01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.340\nWhen did we meet last?\n\n01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:00.180\nAll right, Paul, time to take another ride around the fucking\n\n01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:00.460\nblock.\n\n01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.940\nAnd then I'm like, OK, still won't work, that's fine.\n\n01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.820\nPut it back.\n\n01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.220\nI'll also just, like, I'll throw them, like, angrily.\n\n01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.620\nLike, so then the, like, they go through the wash\n\n01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.180\nand probably get smaller, but.\n\n01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.660\nI think I assume this is one of those,\n\n01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:21.460\nor maybe it's a well-bought, well, Bomfell shirt\n\n01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.300\nfrom Bomfell.com.\n\n01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.500\nHey, kids, do you want a

this Wild West\n\n01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.340\nwith podcast advertising and there's this true crime thing\n\n01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.660\nI was listening to.\n\n01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.180\nI think it was, it's,\n\n01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.940\nI think it was a popular one,\n\n01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.460\nDr. Death, are you guys listening to Dr. Death?\n\n01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.300\nNo?\n\n01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.140\nOkay.\n\n01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.220\nWell, I thought, then good, then I'm Prometheus,\n\n01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.660\nlisten to it.\n\n01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:39.620\nI think it's only three episodes in, it's like a Syria,\n\n01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.020\nit's one of those things, it's like very, like dirty John,\n\n01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.860\nhe was listening to dirty John.\n\n01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.220\nIt's like just sort of a, they break up like a very curious-\n\n01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.260\nOh man, check that out, dirty John?\n\n01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.820\nYeah, listen to dirty John, holy shit.\n\n01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:51.220\nInto a bunch of episodes and this guy was like doctor,\n\n01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.140\nwho's not, he's not necessarily just a sociopath\n\n01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.300\nwho pretended to be a doctor,\n\n01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.300\nbut then again, he was never a good doctor,\n\n01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.380\nbut he just kind of bluffed his way\n\n01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.340\nthrough the medical system and was like gouging out\n\n01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.460\npeople's spines and like, very interesting.\n\n01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.060\nAnd like early on in the podcast, the guy goes like,\n\n01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.380\nand then his, and then he gouged out the spine\n\n01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.020\nand then the person's leg turned blue\n\n01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.660\nand then they had a stroke and now they're dead\n\n01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.900\nand it's like, if you, and then he's paused,\n\n01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.660\nthere's this pause and then the same voice says,\n\n01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.980\nthis podcast may be making you feel very uncomfortable.\n\n01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:30.900\nBut nothing is more comfortable than a good pair of socks.\n\n01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.460\nIt was basically that, and I was like,\n\n01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:39.460\nI was aroused from my bed, I was like, Cody, that's wrong.\n\n01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.060\nThat's not right.\n\n01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:48.060\nLike they actually found, like in a world where no one cares,\n\n01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.980\nlike there's something fundamentally wrong about that.\n\n01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.940\nI can't, like where you're like,\n\n01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.820\nit's back to the 30s or something\n\n01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:57.500\nwhere you're just like, you can just now get really

01:11:10.820\nas we go back in time to the 1960s.\n\n01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.940\nBut you know what, it'll take you back in time\n\n01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.220\nmore as like a Reese's kiss.\n\n01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.940\nThat's fine, right?\n\n01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.940\nCause it's like, who cares?\n\n01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.500\nIt's just like a segue.\n\n01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.500\nBut why was I offended by the socks making you comfortable?\n\n01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.740\nOh, it was because like, what if he said,\n\n01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.620\ncause there's that podcast advertiser\n\n01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.020\nthat's like the real time shrinky dink,\n\n01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.780\nlike you can like call a number and have a shrink,\n\n01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.420\nyou know, it's like feelfine.org or whatever.\n\n01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.980\nLike you can, it's like, you know, clear, clear,\n\n01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.540\nclear, clear, fun talk, like talk to somebody.\n\n01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.740\nIt's like, don't kill yourself, like talk to this thing.\n\n01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.060\nAnd true crime podcast will advertise it.\n\n01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.260\nBut like, what if he used that say,\n\n01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.500\nis like, this is going to make you uncomfortable\n\n01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.300\ntalking about this guy gouging out spines\n\n01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.300\ncause he's not a good doctor.\n\n01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.060\nAnd like, hey, maybe you'll be next.\n\n01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.660\nIf that upsets you, you should call this company\n\n01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:06.660\nthat profits every time you're freaked out\n\n01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.060\nand you call the number.\n\n01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.820\nI guess that's what I was thinking is like,\n\n01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.180\nlike that's what triggered me in me.\n\n01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.340\nIt was like, you can't make people uncomfortable\n\n01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.340\nand then tell them that socks will help.\n\n01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.540\nIt hasn't worked that way in years.\n\n01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.460\nThat's dangerous.\n\n01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.300\nThat's like a-\n\n01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.500\nIt's like a hamster wheel of necessity.\n\n01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.020\nYou can't, yeah, you can't be like,\n\n01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.420\nif you're listening to this podcast,\n\n01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.540\nyou might, you currently might be afraid\n\n01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.420\nof leaving your home.\n\n01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.100\nYou should buy a new television.\n\n01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.380\nOkay, I guess that's what we do.\n\n01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.220\nIt's fucked up.\n\n01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.580\nThat's exactly what they do though.\n\n01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.420\nThat's why you see Taco Bell commercials\n\n01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.700\nat like one o'clock in the morning\n\n01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.180\ntelling you that you should combo meal their shit\n\n01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.300\ncause they know your stuff.\n\n01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.140\nYeah, I know that.\n\n01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.220\nSo why did I, so what was it about the sock thing?\n\n01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.060\nI guess it was because-\n\n01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.900\nYou liked that segue.\n\n01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.420\nIt was because podcasting for me is like a little bit.\n\n01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.060\nIt's both sacred and unsacred.\n\n01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:53.900\nIt's sort of like,\n\n01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.380\nI feel like Al Swearingen looking at his window\n\n01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.380\nin Deadwood going like,\n\n01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.020\nGod damn, telephone wires, suck my dick.\n\n01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.020\nYou know, like,\n\n01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.100\nI'm gonna stab a Indian in the stomach\n\n01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:02.940\ncause I have-\n\n01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.420\nLike, and I'm just like,\n\n01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.380\nall the fucking senators here, fuck it.\n\n01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.500\nI'm gonna fuck everybody.\n\n01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.820\nAlso, there's gotta be a little bit of love\n\n01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.860\nfor something that's kind of hard to do.\n\n01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.900\nSo maybe there's a little bit of admiration in there\n\n01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.980\ncause it's a corny segue,\n\n01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.220\nbut that motherfucker went for it.\n\n01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.620\nI always thought the podcast business\n\n01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.020\nwas gonna go like,\n\n01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.500\nokay, everybody spread out\n\n01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.180\nand say whatever the fuck you can think to say\n\n01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.620\nto make people listen to you.\n\n01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.860\nAnd then after we do that for a while,\n\n01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:32.620\nlet's slowly coalesce into networks\n\n01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.140\nand then let's have those networks\n\n01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.980\nengage in collective bargaining\n\n01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:41.460\nwith a newly subjugated corporate clientele.\n\n01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.620\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\n01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.500\nSo, yeah.\n\n01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.460\nWhat is it instead?\n\n01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.300\nI don't know.\n\n01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.140\nI wanna describe it.\n\n01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:47.980\nIs this advertisers?\n\n01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.820\nYeah, it's just like,\n\n01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.860\nit was just more like somebody else\n\n01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:52.300\nthought that was like me,\n\n01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.780\nbut instead of a guy that likes to talk into a microphone,\n\n01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.180\nthat person loves advertising\n\n01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.260\nand was like, hey, I'll tell you what, why don't we?\n\n01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.180\nI belong to this agency,\n\n01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.180\nthat there's like agencies rounding up\n\n01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.100\nthe corporate clientele that are willing\n\n01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.940\nto advertise on podcasts,\n\n01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.020\nwhich are more high risk for them PR-wise maybe.\n\n01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.740\nYou know, it's a Wild West kind of thing.\n\n01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.100\nSo you notice the kind of clientele you're getting.\n\n01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.100\nIt's like, it's the kind that your brain goes,\n\n01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.260\noh, yeah, they don't risk anything.\n\n01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.740\nLike Snickers isn't advertising during podcasts yet.\n\n01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.180\nAnd yeah, so it's like somebody went around\n\n01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.340\nand gathered all those people up into families\n\n01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.900\nand then they collectively bargained.\n\n01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.660\nLike, hey, what the fuck's your podcast about?\n\n01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.620\nWhat, you fucking getting high and watching movies?\n\n01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.940\nYes, so is everybody's.\n\n01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.700\nCome on, what do you got for us?\n\n01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.740\nWell, I promise I'll tell everybody\n\n01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.780\nI'll wear your socks for a dollar.\n\n01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.460\nI don't want it to go that way.\n\n01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.780\nThere's something worse than just podcast advertising\n\n01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.420\nabout like true crime podcast advertising though,\n\n01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:55.260\nisn't there?\n\n01:14:55.260 --> 01:15:00.260\nIt's like, and then like her blood was spread like everywhere\n\n01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.780\nand no one could find most of it.\n\n01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:06.660\nAlso, tied gum, it's gum now.\n\n01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.500\nIt's gum now.\n\n01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.340\nTied gum?\n\n01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.300\nIt's gum now.\n\n01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.140\nIt's gum now.\n\n01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.700\nFriends and clean their shirt.\n\n01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:17.180\nYeah, should have told you that last week.\n\n01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.980\nYour clothes get cleaner as you wear them.\n\n01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.420\nIt's gum now.\n\n01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.420\nIt just seems gruesome to be all like,\n\n01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:28.420\nyeah, man, fucking buy this because all these people died.\n\n01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.260\nHave you guys heard the thing?\n\n01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.100\nHave you guys heard the thing?\n\n01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.300\nThe body was wrapped in a soft blanket from Downey.\n\n01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.220\nIs that what we're worried about?\n\n01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.900\nIf he was using the gravity blanket.\n\n01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.900\nThere was a pretty fun sophisticated like,\n\n01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.740\noh, first people to do it in a comprehensive way,\n\n01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.300\nlike podcast spoof that was like a,\n\n01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:48.060\nit was a spoof of the podcast that I poked a little fun of\n\n01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.660\non here a while back about the,\n\n01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.140\nand I was like done disappeared or gone up and vanished.\n\n01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.220\nWhat podcast?\n\n01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.740\nUp and vanished, I think is the real one, right?\n\n01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.620\nAnd then someone did a spoof of up and vanished\n\n01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:04.020\nthat I think was called done disappeared.\n\n01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.420\nAnd if you haven't heard it, it's really funny.\n\n01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:12.340\nAnd it's also like sociologically edifying\n\n01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.380\nbecause you're like,\n\n01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.260\nyou're living in the beginning of a new medium.\n\n01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.220\nAnd this is like one of the first like actual\n\n01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:23.180\nlike kind of yank of vikings like of another.\n\n01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.780\nIt's like, oh, this popular podcast.\n\n01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.100\nAnd then someone not only just sat there like me\n\n01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.140\nand went like, you heard this one guy\n\n01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.540\nneeds to get a fucking haircut.\n\n01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.260\nYou know, somebody, somebody like dug in\n\n01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.460\nand like did a spoof.\n\n01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.260\nAnd I'm fascinated by that stuff too,\n\n01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.820\nis we're watching it evolve.\n\n01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.740\nWhy do I have to try to take the fun out of everything?\n\n01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.260\nI remember when I was like in my twenties,\n\n01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.540\nlike I got high with you and Sean McKenna\n\n01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.540\nand we were talking about something.\n\n01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.740\nAnd then like, you guys were talking about like songs\n\n01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.580\nor something.\n\n01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:52.860\nAnd then I was like, yeah, it's funny\n\n01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.460\nbecause you listened to a first song with then you listen\n\n01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.460\nand they talked for a while.\n\n01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.380\nAnd then it was a big pause.\n\n01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.300\nAnd then you and Sean both went like,\n\n01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.660\noh, is that how we enjoy things?\n\n01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.340\nThanks.\n\n01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.420\nWe said that in unison.\n\n01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:08.980\nYou both went like, you both, you both, you both.\n\n01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.900\nBad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.\n\n01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.260\nWell, I mean, worse than that, I was like, I was.\n\n01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.300\nIs it possible that Sean just said that?\n\n01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.140\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:16.980\nAnd I was just sitting next to him.\n\n01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.820\nYou're getting me wrong.\n\n01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:19.700\nI know, I was being, no, that's exactly why.\n\n01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.380\nI don't remember this story.\n\n01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.380\nBecause it was so important.\n\n01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.220\nCaring.\n\n01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.460\nIt was so, you guys both looked at each other\n\n01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.900\nand both had the same thought\n\n01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:32.340\nand didn't even need to conspire about it.\n\n01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.620\nThat's, and I was like, you know, the old saying\n\n01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.740\nif somebody calls you a horse's ass,\n\n01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.860\nmaybe they're a horse's ass.\n\n01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.260\nIf two people call you a horse's ass,\n\n01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.100\nmaybe get a saddle or whatever it goes.\n\n01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.660\nLike, it was like, you guys were both like,\n\n01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.820\nI just finished explaining.\n\n01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.860\nI was just like, I'm always explaining everything.\n\n01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.940\nI'm a fucking explainaholic.\n\n01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:52.940\nOr, yeah.\n\n01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.780\nYeah, no, that's it.\n\n01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.620\nThat was the worst.\n\n01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.580\nBut with booze.\n\n01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.420\nCan I ask?\n\n01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.740\nIt's a Simpsons joke.\n\n01:18:00.740

01:19:28.180\nIt's like, I did it wrong.\n\n01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.340\nI did it wrong.\n\n01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.380\nI did it wrong.\n\n01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.540\nI was like, Justin, no

row.\n\n01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.660\nAnd she was like, as I was like coming back from,\n\n01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.140\nyou do this whole conveyor belt when you, if you win one,\n\n01:20:09.140 -->

01:20:26.620\nAnd I think you're asking what I'm answering,\n\n01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:29.100\nwhich is like, did you have any encounters with famous people\n\n01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:29.780\nthat you?\n\n01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:31.020\nJust the ones you like.\n\n01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.940\nJust like if there were any moments where you're like,\n\n01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.380\nholy shit, I was talking to George R. R. Miley.\n\n01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.940\nI mean, I saw, you know, they did this big Star Trek thing.\n\n01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.460\nSo LeVar Burton's up there.\n\n01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.820\nAnd I'm like, I'm going to fucking mad dog.\n\n01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:43.300\nI'm going to tell you, you know,\n\n01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.220\nlike I'm going to make eye contact with this guy.\n\n01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.540\nBecause I was like right in the wings,\n\n01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.220\nI was coming back to the thing.\n\n01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.380\nAnd I was like, and I just looked at LeVar Burton\n\n01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.300\nand waited for him to look at me as I walked past.\n\n01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:54.940\nI was like, he's not like, he didn't look.\n\n01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:57.300\nAnd I was like, well, he's blind, isn't he?\n\n01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.020\nDid he have his?\n\n01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.140\nRight, he's blind.\n\n01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.460\nHe didn't have his thing on.\n\n01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.180\nBut I thought it'd be so funny.\n\n01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.140\nLike, how amazing.\n\n01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.540\nIt was a low risk, high yield thing.\n\n01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.580\nBecause I was like, I'm going to totally mad dog LeVar Burton.\n\n01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:12.940\nAnd on the off chance that he like looks and see,\n\n01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.300\nbecause he peripherally like experiences like this,\n\n01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.060\nlike who's staring at me?\n\n01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.380\nAnd then like, what if he had like, while he's on stage,\n\n01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.940\ngone like, hey.\n\n01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:25.540\nAnd then like, I had this fantasy in my head of like,\n\n01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:27.820\nand then people would be like, what the fuck's going on over there?\n\n01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.340\nLike, why is LeVar Burton like crouching down\n\n01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.660\nand hugging somebody?\n\n01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.460\nWho's that?\n\n01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.500\nOh, that guy's got an Emmy.\n\n01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.980\nThat's Dan Harmon.\n\n01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:39.020\nWhat mountains can't he climb?\n\n01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:39.860\nHe's already got an Emmy.\n\n01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.220\nWhy is he like, well, LeVar Burton was like,\n\n01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.700\nJesus, I got to look this guy up.\n\n01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.100\nOh, he's a pedophile.\n\n01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.260\nGod damn it.\n\n01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.340\nWell, I didn't know that.\n\n01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.940\nGod damn it, we were on such a great run.\n\n01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.900\nAnd he just fucked it up.\n\n01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:58.900\nCan you explain what is the LeVar Burton thing?\n\n01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.140\nOh, well, he was at your podium for a while ago.\n\n01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:06.420\nJeff was on an extended like tour.\n\n01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.620\nAnd we were on the road.\n\n01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:13.460\nWe did like a fun like string of guest comptrollers, Gilbert\n\n01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:17.820\nGodfrey, and there was some really fun.\n\n01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.220\nAnd LeVar Burton was one of them.\n\n01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:20.980\nHoly shit.\n\n01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.380\nIt was great.\n\n01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.300\nSo even with him.\n\n01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.420\nI was married to Erin McGathy yet.\n\n01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.060\nAnd he was like, in that podcast, he's like,\n\n01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.260\nI'm coming to your wedding.\n\n01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:32.260\nI think we're just shit-faced.\n\n01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:36.100\nSo you still feel a little shy to go over to LeVar Burton?\n\n01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:39.500\nWell, he never came to my wedding.\n\n01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.180\nSo then I'm like, all right, are we beefing?\n\n01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.660\nWhat if he googled me after that night?\n\n01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.140\nAll right, I'm coming to your wedding.\n\n01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:53.060\nGoogle, oh, I can see through my visor.\n\n01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.740\nThis guy's trouble.\n\n01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.700\nWho would you want to have as a guest comptroller\n\n01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.740\nif you had any?\n\n01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.140\nBrandon Johnson.\n\n01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.500\nLike, what do you mean by default?\n\n01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.260\nLike, if I was about to die?\n\n01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.740\nYou were saying, like, we had a great suite, too sweet,\n\n01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:19.380\nlike none of all these fabulous people on my show\n\n01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.420\ncomptrolling.\n\n01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.460\nIt was just so sweet.\n\n01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.820\nI don't know if that was the line reading.\n\n01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.980\nIt was a lot.\n\n01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.500\nYou just made it sound like.\n\n01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.980\nIt was LeVar Burton.\n\n01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:30.380\nYeah.\n\n01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.900\nHe was hosting the show.\n\n01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:32.820\nI understand that.\n\n01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:33.540\nI'm saying.\n\n01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:34.140\nDo you?\n\n01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.300\nHe did reading Rainbow.\n\n01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.220\nWhy do you have a lantern?\n\n01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.620\nLike, an old, like, train conductor.\n\n01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.940\nIt's not even lit.\n\n01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.460\nIt's out of batteries.\n\n01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:47.860\nIt's out of batteries.\n\n01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.980\nIt's out.\n\n01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.180\nOK, great.\n\n01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.540\nThat's why you have it there.\n\n01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.500\nThat's why I have it there, to charge.\n\n01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.740\nAll right, lay down and beat.\n\n01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.740\nOh, shit.\n\n01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:06.600\nYeah.\n\n01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:18.840\nRhythm 2, the plate rhythm, has a fate, a destiny of time\n\n01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.320\ngone by.\n\n01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.160\nI fucked your mama in her eyes.\n\n01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.600\nDidn't mean to, bro.\n\n01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.440\nI fucked a rainbow.\n\n01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:43.800\nRed, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,\n\n01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.440\nthat's the spectrum.\n\n01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.120\nAll the colors come in.\n\n01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:56.120\nRainbow strips of brothers got red talking over it.\n\n01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.280\nOrange saying, yo, orange is like what?\n\n01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:05.080\nBut we try to get along, and recognize\n\n01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.320\nare the same color all along.\n\n01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:14.520\nBecause red can't be red unless it's really dark orange.\n\n01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.040\nAnd orange eventually has to accept\n\n01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.520\nthat it's kind of a form of red.\n\n01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.720\nThat's why it's called the spectrum.\n\n01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.880\nI think, I assume, I don't know.\n\n01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.240\nThere's probably actually a definitive delineation\n\n01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:36.040\nbetween those colors that are super important scientifically.\n\n01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.120\nBut you better prove it.\n\n01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.280\nOK.\n\n01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.680\nOh, five fingers of death.\n\n01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.180\nYo.\n\n01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:52.400\nYo, I ate a sandwich today.\n\n01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.280\nAnd this is how it went.\n\n01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.960\nTell them about your sandwich.\n\n01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.960\nI ate so many sandwiches today.\n\n01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.720\nI had to install an extra air vent.\n\n01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.960\nHo, ho, ho, ho.\n\n01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.160\nI got that tempo that lets you rap good.\n\n01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.760\nIt lets you think about things that rhyme like what?\n\n01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.040\nDoesn't matter what you do.\n\n01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.080\nI could do my taxes while I say everything.\n\n01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.280\nWell, that's probably going to rhyme with taxes.\n\n01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.480\nYeah, I'm a slow rapper thinking of the words\n\n01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.120\nLittle Rhyme later.\n\n01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.680\nAll right.\n\n01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:43.600\nI just wanted to give people a segment.\n\n01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.360\nYou have to split it just a little bit.\n\n01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.360\nThe things that I don't.\n\n01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.280\nNew money.\n\n01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.640\nNew money.\n\n01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.880\nLike, you know, the definition of our new relationship\n\n01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.480\nis like, whatever I do for you guys,\n\n01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.000\nit's not that I resent doing it for you, but it is a favor.\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.480\nWow.\n\n01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.080\nWow.\n\n01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:07.720\nIt's not.\n\n01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.440\nIt's just a slight.\n\n01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.960\nAnd look, if it's a deal breaker, I understand.\n\n01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.440\nIt would be a deal breaker for me too.\n\n01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.360\nI don't need you.\n\n01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.120\nCan you love someone that doesn't need you?\n\n01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.040\nWas your relationship reliant on my insecurity?\n\n01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.400\nI will remain insecure until the day I die.\n\n01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.040\nLike, I'm going to my EKG or whatever that beepy thing is\n\n01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.160\nthat shows that you're dying.\n\n01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.680\nLike, it's going to go beep.\n\n01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.680\nAnd I'm going to go, oh, God, I fucked up.\n\n01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.800\nI fucked up so bad.\n\n01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.240\nI fucked up everything.\n\n01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.160\nI'm going to be so insecure.\n\n01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.680\nI'm going to die.\n\n01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.720\nLike, I'm going to go straight to hell\n\n01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.440\nbecause it's going to be just the sum of all of the tightness\n\n01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.240\nthat I had and all of the resistance I had to everyone's\n\n01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:49.740\nlove.\n\n01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.920\nAnd I'm just going to like forever spiral\n\n01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:58.640\ninto this crazy, like self-created projection of torture.\n\n01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.560\nSo don't worry about me getting punished or being humbled\n\n01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.400\nor figuring out that I did something wrong.\n\n01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:13.440\nI'm sorry that when I say something wrong,\n\n01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.440\ninstead of saying it to three people,\n\n01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.000\nI say it to 300,000 people.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.280\nAnd therefore, then there's a headline that says,\n\n01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.760\nDNR, it says something wrong.\n\n01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.560\nAnd then when I feel bad about it,\n\n01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.720\nI go, hey, I feel bad about that.\n\n01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.360\nAnd then it says, DNR, it feels bad about that thing.\n\n01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.480\nLike, I can understand how you as a person would be like, hmm,\n\n01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.760\nI think I'll examine who Dan Harmon is.\n\n01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.280\nOh, he said that.\n\n01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.480\nThat's fucked up.\n\n01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.840\nAre you sorry about it?\n\n01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.120\nWell, that should end that.\n\n01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:41.620\nWhat?\n\n01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.520\nHe said another thing?\n\n01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.000\nWell, now he's sorry about that.\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.280\nWhere's this going?\n\n01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.040\nLife is where it's going.\n\n01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.640\nLife.\n\n01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.360\nI'm alive.\n\n01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:51.860\nYeah.\n\n01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.880\nI'm alive.\n\n01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.880\nI'm dying.\n\n01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.400\nI'm going to die in front of you.\n\n01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.920\nThere's nothing's going to change if that's\n\n01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.800\nwhat you want to change.\n\n01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.520\nI'm not going to turn into a cockroach.\n\n01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.720\nI'm not going to slowly turn into a mummy.\n\n01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.520\nI mean, I am.\n\n01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.720\nI am.\n\n01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.440\nBut I'm not going to be like, watch me become sting.\n\n01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.320\nHe had a publicist.\n\n01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.480\nIt doesn't work the way you think it works\n\n01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:24.280\nif you're waiting for me to stop being a bad person.\n\n01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:29.400\nThat it's like waiting for rain to taste like mint.\n\n01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.640\nIt's just it's a great wish, and I back you up on it,\n\n01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.080\nand it's not going to happen.\n\n01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.840\nAnd it's your fault for waiting for it.\n\n01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.800\nI know I'm late to the party, but this British baking show\n\n01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.120\nis fucking great.\n\n01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.800\nHave you seen the latest season with Noel Fielding?\n\n01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.160\nIt's really good.\n\n01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:56.560\nI sat down episode one and watched it all the way\n\n01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.600\nthrough into the end, and I kept eating toast.\n\n01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.400\nThat's the one thing is you're talking about advertising.\n\n01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.120\nThey don't advertise on Netflix, but if they would clean up,\n\n01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.080\nif they had bread commercials.\n\n01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.080\nBecause I was eating toast all day long.\n\n01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:21.880\nI was toasting toast, which is weird.\n\n01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:26.440\nYou should say toasting bread into toast.\n\n01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:26.920\nOK, anyway.\n\n01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.600\nWhat is it called?\n\n01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.200\nWhat's the?\n\n01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.400\nBritish baking show.\n\n01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.680\nIt's just called British Bake Off.\n\n01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.000\nIt's called the Great British Bake Off.\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nGreat, say again?\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.280\nBritish Bake Off.\n\n01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.440\nDoes that suck, I patch nihilist?\n\n01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.760\nIs that so bad?\n\n01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.440\nOK.\n\n01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:49.160\nHere's the thing that I noticed right away,\n\n01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.160\nbecause I haven't watched a lot of reality television,\n\n01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.400\nbut most of the reality television\n\n01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.080\nI've watched is American reality TV.\n\n01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:02.800\nAnd the thing about the Great British Bake Off show\n\n01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.760\nis everybody's so nice to each other.\n\n01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.080\nThey're helping each other out.\n\n01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.840\nThey're just like, oh, you dropped your thing.\n\n01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.560\nLet me hear it.\n\n01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.240\nYou can use my fork or whatever you want to use my oven.\n\n01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.840\nThey're all helping each other out.\n\n01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.840\nAnd even the critique is like, hmm,\n\n01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.960\nit's a little up-sided, isn't it?\n\n01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.880\nIt's not like, what is this garbage?\n\n01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.320\nIt's like it's very positive.\n\n01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:30.280\nAnd I think that show would make you happy.\n\n01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.000\nI like the story about that woman costing you at an absolute\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.440\nYou would have been in fucking hand.\n\n01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.520\nYou said this will make you feel better.\n\n01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.280\nAnd I forgot to tell you, by the way, that did fucking you.\n\n01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.360\nThat was insane.\n\n01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.760\nYeah, I've been wanting to tell you for a while\n\n01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.560\nbecause I knew it would make you so happy.\n\n01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:51.000\nAnd I don't think you understand how angry and short I was\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.360\nwith this woman who was, in her mind, trying to save my life.\n\n01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.720\nAnd I'm like going, I don't need that.\n\n01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.640\nGet away from me.\n\n01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:03.840\nI was being very angry and curt.\n\n01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:04.320\nShort.\n\n01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.600\nI just kind of endlessly fascinated\n\n01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.880\nwith these cosmetic issues.\n\n01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:15.920\nThat's like a man starts to lose his hair, me.\n\n01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.040\nAnd then I go, OK, I'm losing it.\n\n01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.560\nBut it's like there's lines between the clinical\n\n01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.720\nand the cosmetic.\n\n01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:26.000\nAnd every day we wake up and we go through routines and things\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.080\nwhere we go, well, who I am is not going to work.\n\n01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:36.240\nAnd I don't even mean I'm not going all punk rock on you\n\n01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.240\nand going, oh, why do we wear makeup at all?\n\n01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.680\nI mean, even people who don't wear makeup,\n\n01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.840\nyou look in the mirror and you have this moment\n\n01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.240\nwhere you're like, if there's an eyebrow that's\n\n01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.000\nshooting out of my head, maybe I would clip it with scissors.\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.240\nNo matter how low maintenance you think you are.\n\n01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.160\nWhen you get a bald spot that starts to grow in your head,\n\n01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:07.120\nand it's all just the weirdest thing.\n\n01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.360\nIt's this thing that I never see unless there's like,\n\n01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.360\nI get a haircut and then they show me the mirror thing.\n\n01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.880\nAnd then I have this like, I go, oh, god,\n\n01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.520\nis there something I can do about that?\n\n01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.920\nBut I don't even understand why I'm thinking that.\n\n01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.160\nCody doesn't express anything like, oh, boy,\n\n01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.240\ncan you do something?\n\n01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.560\nShe's more aware than I am.\n\n01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.920\nShe's seeing in the back of my head\n\n01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.760\nalong with the rest of everybody more than I am.\n\n01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.480\nAnd then you just say, OK, so every day\n\n01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.400\nwith the tweezing and everything,\n\n01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:43.000\nlike we're like, oh, god, I don't know, sorry.\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:43.800\nIt's new.\n\n01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.040\nIt's a crazy thing.\n\n01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.960\nIt's not new, but I'm new to it, I think.\n\n01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:52.800\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.840\nMy bald friend, I can't talk about my relationship\n\n01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.400\nwith baldness in front of my bald friend.\n\n01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.240\nI know, I get it.\n\n01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.240\nYeah, didn't start losing your hand.\n\n01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.440\nYou can't give me a bald pass.\n\n01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:07.960\nThat must have really interfered with your dating life.\n\n01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.320\nYou really probably didn't?\n\n01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.800\nIt's not dating life.\n\n01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.680\nI have a girl I would spend the rest of my life with.\n\n01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.200\nIt's about the I don't understand\n\n01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.160\nwhy we have feelings about our scalps.\n\n01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.560\nIt scares us to think maybe that's\n\n01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.520\nwhat's going on inside, too, a little bit.\n\n01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.120\nI think it scares us to go, well, we're falling apart.\n\n01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.280\nWe're decaying in front of the mirror.\n\n01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.240\nThat's what happened.\n\n01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.160\nBut what if your culture said that when\n\n01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.720\nyou can start to see a man's scalp,\n\n01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.920\nthat that was called the hardening or something?\n\n01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.600\nCulture could easily, look at the fucked-up periscopes\n\n01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.080\nwe create for everything.\n\n01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.080\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.280\nBut we're like, oh, shit, time is passing.\n\n01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.200\nThat's what that means.\n\n01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.600\nIt means you're not 25, for sure.\n\n01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.160\nNo matter how much you've been passing.\n\n01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.240\nOr 22.\n\n01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.800\nYes, god damn it, I can't talk about this around you.\n\n01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:00.560\nI get it.\n\n01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.400\nNo, you can't.\n\n01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.680\nYou're just like a guy that's playing uno\n\n01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.000\nand you have all reverse cards.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:04.840\nLike, I don't know.\n\n01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.680\nOh, damn.\n\n01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.480\nIt's still a topic I'm allowed to have in my head,\n\n01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.200\njust because someone's balder.\n\n01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.080\nThat doesn't mean I can't talk about it.\n\n01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:19.440\nI didn't say you should stop talking about this horrible problem.\n\n01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.560\nI should pay the ghost, pay the ghost,\n\n01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.320\nto put it in Nicholas Cage terms.\n\n01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:24.760\nPay the ghost.\n\n01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.000\nPay the ghost.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.160\nThe classic Nicholas Cage movie, Pay the Ghost.\n\n01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.280\nYou're telling me you haven't seen Pay the Ghost?\n\n01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.760\nI haven't seen Pay the Ghost.\n\n01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.600\nOh my god.\n\n01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.400\nWith Andre Brower.\n\n01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.120\nHe said something.\n\n01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.080\nHe said something.\n\n01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.320\nHe said, pay the ghost.\n\n01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.640\nPay the ghost.\n\n01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.280\nPay the ghost.\n\n01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280\nYeah, pay the ghost.\n\n01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.040\nIt's one of the eight Nicholas Cage movies.\n\n01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.800\nNicholas Cage in a box is a service\n\n01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.760\nthat can come to your door.\n\n01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:55.760\nYou can, the only way to keep up with all of the movies\n\n01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.840\nNicholas Cage does every day.\n\n01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:58.680\nIn a cage.\n\n01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.800\nIt's the Nick Cage.\n\n01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.560\nIt's the Nick Cage.\n\n01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.560\nIt comes in a hand cage.\n\n01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.240\nIt comes in a box.\n\n01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:03.760\nLet me out.\n\n01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.400\nLet me out.\n\n01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.400\nIt comes with a separate package of bees\n\n01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.160\nthat you activate them with.\n\n01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:11.640\nWhat's that?\n\n01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.200\nWhat's that?\n\n01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.480\nWhat is that?\n\n01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.360\nDid you know that they edit the bees out of the wicker\n\n01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.000\nman in the regular cut, like the vanilla cut\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.280\nthat you get on Apple TV?\n\n01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.800\nBecause Cody hadn't seen it.\n\n01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.040\nI'm like, we got to watch Wicker Man.\n\n01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.920\nAnd no fucking bees.\n\n01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.400\nWhat?\n\n01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.520\nSo they went to the screening.\n\n01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.680\nAnd people were like, holy shit.\n\n01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.880\nRight.\n\n01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.760\nOh, no, not the bees.\n\n01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.440\nFucking hashtag.com.org.\n\n01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.520\nitalics.\n\n01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.440\nHoly fucking trending shit.\n\n01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.960\nOh, no, not the bees.\n\n01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.560\nAnd they're like, god damn it.\n\n01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.520\nThey're making fun of our movie.\n\n01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.920\nThat's the only reason why it's not Citizen Kane.\n\n01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.680\nWe got to take a little show them.\n\n01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.720\nWe'll just take that out.\n\n01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.160\nThanks for telling us how to get stronger, you rubes.\n\n01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.120\nNow we're the best movie ever.\n\n01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.760\nCome on, don't take the no, not the bees out.\n\n01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.840\nThat's bullshit.\n\n01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.080\nSame thing with the Battlefield Earth.\n\n01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:11.840\nIs about to say.\n\n01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.680\nA lot of shit, man.\n\n01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.440\nThere was a lot.\n\n01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.080\nSchrab and I saw that movie in the theater.\n\n01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:21.080\nIt was us in the front row and a lot of strange,\n\n01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.720\nstrangely identical group of people in white polo shirts\n\n01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720\non the back that were.\n\n01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.760\nThey weren't in white polo shirts.\n\n01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:28.200\nThey were dressed like civilians,\n\n01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.120\nbut it was like happening.\n\n01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.840\nA lot of applause over those opening credits.\n\n01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:32.960\nDo you realize what's happening?\n\n01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.800\nWe're the only three people in this movie,\n\n01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.760\nand the back two rows are the Church of Scientology,\n\n01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.520\nwho have been assigned to come see this movie.\n\n01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.320\nAnd they're like, because we picked up on it\n\n01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.160\nafter a while because like, like, John Travolta would say something\n\n01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.720\nand we'd laugh.\n\n01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.400\nThe three of us are like, ha, ha, ha.\n\n01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.200\nAnd there's no silence in the back.\n\n01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.840\nAnd then John Travolta would say something\n\n01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.880\nthat they'd laugh.\n\n01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.160\nAnd we're like, well, that wasn't funny.\n\n01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.240\nYeah, that was his character making a joke.\n\n01:37:59.240 --> 01:37:59.960\nI agree with that.\n\n01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.360\nBut oh, oh, got it.\n\n01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.240\nAll right.\n\n01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.520\nWell, when it was based on the book by L. Ron Humbert,\n\n01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.920\nand they were all applauding in the back, we were like, ooh.\n\n01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.400\nBut in that movie, there was so much more.\n\n01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.240\nThere was a bunch of crazy shit.\n\n01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.520\nWe watched it, and we were telling everybody about it\n\n01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.320\nbecause there were no hashtags back then.\n\n01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.920\nWe were just like going into strangers.\n\n01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.480\nYou had to go and hashtag each person back then.\n\n01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.920\nYou had to say, hashtag Paul, hashtag Mary, hashtag Sebastian.\n\n01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.440\nYou had to like, every single person, you had to just text them\n\n01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.600\nand be like, hey, here's the thing I'd like you to be talking about.\n\n01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.200\nWhat is that hashtag?\n\n01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.680\nAnd we were like, yeah.\n\n01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.800\nBut they were like, yeah.\n\n01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.520\nAnd then they, like, I bought it on DVD and the scenes were gone.\n\n01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.640\nYeah, same with the bees.\n\n01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.600\nYou can only see the bees.\n\n01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.680\nWhat was the scene?\n\n01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.480\nWhat did Cheville have to say?\n\n01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:01.920\nHe was like, you said you wouldn't make it appear.\n\n01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.680\nAnd it did appear or whatever.\n\n01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.720\nYeah, I can't remember.\n\n01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.360\nI don't want to.\n\n01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:07.960\nIt won't work.\n\n01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.720\nWere the Scientologists just enjoying the film,\n\n01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.800\nor was their job to make the film seem better reacted to\n\n01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.720\nas an audience than it actually was?\n\n01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.480\nI don't think they thought it through past.\n\n01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.880\nLet's just make sure there's always at least two rows\n\n01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.680\nof Scientology people.\n\n01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.800\nYeah, no, that's what I mean.\n\n01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.400\nYeah, and so they didn't anticipate it in theater,\n\n01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.480\nand then two rows of people.\n\n01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:34.840\nSo they didn't have their flow chart stopped there.\n\n01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:41.680\nIt wasn't like, if you're the only two rows, don't laugh at every joke,\n\n01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.080\nbecause it'll seem weird to everyone, but you.\n\n01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.520\nAlso, please don't sneak out of the Church of Scientology\n\n01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.760\nin this movie.\n\n01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.080\nYeah, don't take this opportunity,\n\n01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.320\njust because it's a dark room doesn't mean you can go out any door you want.\n\n01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.920\nYou will report back to your bus and into your cryo chamber.\n\n01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.120\nBees were an important part of the Wicker Man.\n\n01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:08.640\nThat's it.\n\n01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.400\nThat's all I want to say.\n\n01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.720\nThe best part of the bees thing is when he goes, wait, what's that?\n\n01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.200\nWhat is that?\n\n01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.600\nWhat's that buzzing?\n\n01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.080\nAnd I said, Cody, the clip, I'm like, this is what you miss.\n\n01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:24.960\nI made you watch the entire Wicker Man,\n\n01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.320\nbecause this was supposed to be in there, and it didn't happen.\n\n01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.040\nHere it is.\n\n01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.520\nI sent it to the YouTube link.\n\n01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:39.400\nDid she, after the credits, were like, Wicker Man, Wicker Man, Wicker Man?\n\n01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.120\nIt's Christmas in the post-pictures.\n\n01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.240\nDon't call it a chair.\n\n01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.760\nIt's not something you rock in.\n\n01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.320\nI've got a thread to the twigs and the spiraling in,\n\n01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.920\nand I've got a rabbit culture that's a paganistic.\n\n01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:54.280\nAnd then Cody was like, I don't understand why you thought it\n\n01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.400\nwas such a bad movie.\n\n01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.320\nIt was really cool.\n\n01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.400\nYeah, she really dug it.\n\n01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.560\nI was like, well, you got to see this bee scene.\n\n01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.720\nIt's so fucked up.\n\n01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.320\nYeah, I guess if you would add that, that would be a silly movie.\n\n01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.040\nBut that movie that you watched, the edited film, the vanilla version\n\n01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.000\nyou called it, was great.\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.640\nThat was really good.\n\n01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.560\nThat was good.\n\n01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:21.680\nI sent it to the scene, and she said, do you think we didn't see it\n\n01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:25.440\nbecause we were fooling around or something like that?\n\n01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:28.160\nAnd I thought it was an auto-correct typo.\n\n01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.680\nAnd I said, are you asking if Nicholas Cage was just\n\n01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:34.400\ntrying to make the crew laugh?\n\n01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:39.640\nOr are you asking if they were just, in the edit,\n\n01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.840\nwere just having a good time?\n\n01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.360\nOh, you mean did we start fucking?\n\n01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.200\nI thought like, it says it wasn't a typo.\n\n01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.680\nYou were texting her?\n\n01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:47.440\nWell, because she's sitting next to you?\n\n01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:47.960\nWell, it was later.\n\n01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.360\nIt was the next day, because I sent her the code.\n\n01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.800\nI was like, by the way, that movie is what you missed.\n\n01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:57.480\nSo the movie ended, and you just ran to bed and went to sleep.\n\n01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.440\nYou didn't like go, this is the thing?\n\n01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.320\nI said, I said, there's no bees.\n\n01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.240\nWe're here for the bees.\n\n01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:02.880\nThere are bees.\n\n01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.720\nWell, movie's over.\n\n01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.520\nGoodbye.\n\n01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.920\nI'll text you

asleep.\n\n01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.640\nI'll race it to tomorrow.\n\n01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.680\nI got there first.\n\n01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.200\nIf you were listening to the story,\n\n01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.920\nthe subtext there was that the movie\n\n01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:36.720\nwe didn't make it to the end.\n\n01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.600\nBecause of my active love life.\n\n01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.360\nOh, OK, sure.\n\n01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:44.920\nNice.\n\n01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:51.640\nSo you didn't watch until the end of the movie looking at you?\n\n01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:52.640\nHe was burning to death.\n\n01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:58.400\nAnd I was probably doing a really good job of fucking it.\n\n01:42:58.400 --> 01:42:58.920\nYou know?\n\n01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.200\nI was like, oh, god.\n\n01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.920\nDid you have to hear about how good you eat pussy again?\n\n01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.960\nI ate it so good.\n\n01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:08.720\nDo we have to sit through another nine-hour dissertation\n\n01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.120\nwhen we know how good Dan Harmon eats pussy?\n\n01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.160\nI've been hearing this story since you were 19.\n\n01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.720\nOh, I eat it like a small dick, but I eat pussy.\n\n01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.240\nSo fucking good.\n\n01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.000\nRob Schwab, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.080\nI have no complaints, man.\n\n01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.360\nWorth every penny.\n\n01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.760\nWhy they come?\n\n01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.480\nThey keep coming because I eat so much fucking good pussy.\n\n01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.560\nI'm not going to feel bad about having a small dick.\n\n01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:41.000\nBut you eat pussy so good.\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.600\nI'm sorry you picked up on the fact that I.\n\n01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.720\nI picked up.\n\n01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.160\nYou're reminding everybody every five fucking seconds.\n\n01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.280\nIf I got, if I ate pussy again.\n\n01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.000\nDan uses the story so simple.\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.440\nWhat did you do Labor Day?\n\n01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:58.440\nWell, I ate pussy good.\n\n01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.360\nThat's not true.\n\n01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.200\nThat's not true.\n\n01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.000\nIn laws.\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.200\nThat's not true.\n\n01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.800\nThe only thing that's true about that\n\n01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.520\nis that I'm transparent about not having a show.\n\n01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:12.560\nOr a grower, or a grower frankly.\n\n01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.480\nThe truth is you could wait all night.\n\n01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.960\nLike it's not grow, it'll grow.\n\n01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:16.880\nAnd then you're like, really?\n\n01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.400\nOkay, I grow.\n\n01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.240\nSo.\n\n01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.960\nBut the jamming out is I eat the pussy.\n\n01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.800\nI don't, I don't, I don't.\n\n01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.760\nLike you go home and look it up.\n\n01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.600\nI don't do that.\n\n01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.160\nGo look it up on the Wikipedia.\n\n01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.920\nIt'll tell you I ate pussy good.\n\n01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:34.240\nI don't know what else anyone would expect me to be good at\n\n01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:35.680\ngiven my situation.\n\n01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.720\nBut I, and so I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna be like,\n\n01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.200\nI'm terrible at eating pussy.\n\n01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.520\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:42.760\nAll right?\n\n01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:43.600\nThat's fair.\n\n01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.400\nBut I don't brag about it.\n\n01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.480\nI'm probably great at it.\n\n01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.640\nI gotta be great at it.\n\n01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640\nOh my God.\n\n01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.480\nSee?\n\n01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.320\nThis is how you get it.\n\n01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.160\nI must be.\n\n01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.720\nMy dick is so small.\n\n01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.280\nLike I must be amazing.\n\n01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.400\nLike look at the women that have stayed with me\n\n01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.840\nfor more than a year.\n\n01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.200\nLike they've, they've got to be getting something.\n\n01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.840\nLike, like, it's, it's, it's, and of course, whenever I ask,\n\n01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.000\nthey always say it's great.\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.200\nSo who would do that?\n\n01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.040\nOh, I just heard it.\n\n01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:10.880\nOh.\n\n01:45:10.880 -->

01:47:02.600\nit becomes somehow attractive and reactive to the fact,\n\n01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:05.680\nthe fundamental fact that talking about it,\n\n01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:08.560\nlike it's a competition, makes it bad.\n\n01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.240\nBut anyways, where was I?\n\n01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.440\nI licked her mom's pussy so hard I got a fuzzy eye.\n\n01:47:15.440 -->
