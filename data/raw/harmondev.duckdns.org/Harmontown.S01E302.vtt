00:00.000 --> 00:10.000

00:11.440 --> 00:19.040
Let me hear you at home. How are you feeling tonight? Excellent! We're so very happy to be here.

00:19.040 --> 00:26.320
It's so good to see all of you. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Game Master,

00:26.320 --> 00:46.000
King of All Kings, Spencer Crittenden. Yes! Yes! I have the unique and special honor of bringing to you

00:46.000 --> 00:55.360
now two-time Emmy winner. God bless you, Rick and Morty. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands

00:55.360 --> 01:00.000
together for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:05.040 --> 01:16.320
Yo, yeah, rap, yo, rap to the beat, yo, rap, rap, yeah, yeah, rap to the beat, rap to the rhymes,

01:16.320 --> 01:21.920
rap to your mama's booty, wind chimes, blowing in the wind, ringing around, a bucket so hard,

01:21.920 --> 01:27.200
a bottom by the pound, went to the deli, got three ounces, fucked your mama like a lion,

01:27.200 --> 01:33.200
pounces on that pussy, nine to five, fucked your mama just to stay alive, I'm a vampire,

01:33.200 --> 01:42.080
I gotta suck your mama, Osama, knock it down, knock your mama's pussy down, where was building seven?

01:42.080 --> 01:50.240
Okay. You notice your, did you know your mama's pussy does not, it's boiling point is less than

01:50.240 --> 02:02.000
steel. Just start asking questions, America. Stop, you fucking sheeple. Yeah, I mean, like, well,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.240
we had our 300th episode, it was the last thing we did, right? And I watched that clip of me trying

02:06.240 --> 02:13.280
to learn from open mic. We did an episode after that. Oh, did we? I just, I don't know why I can't

02:13.280 --> 02:20.560
learn things. Because you have to remember shit to learn. You can be a really hard worker,

02:20.560 --> 02:27.200
it wouldn't matter if you're an alcoholic. God, I've been to the crossroads eight times,

02:27.200 --> 02:33.120
when am I going to learn the blues? You keep drinking too much, Ralph Macchio in the movie

02:33.120 --> 02:44.960
Crossroads. I don't know, I obviously, yes, I do have a story from Emmy Knight that I don't

02:44.960 --> 02:50.400
think would be in any trouble. Did you, you were at the Emmys? I was at the Emmys and I won an Emmy,

02:50.400 --> 03:00.000
we all, obviously. And what I mean is, when I say, I mean, the show that I work on, but like,

03:00.000 --> 03:06.160
well, where are the, you know, it's me, it's this shows about me, I won an Emmy. Right, right. In

03:06.160 --> 03:13.600
mixed company, I'd be like, you know, who won an Emmy is Sid in marketing. Right, right. Remember

03:13.600 --> 03:20.080
when they marketed Rick and Morty successfully? Yeah, that fateful day. Yeah. Thank you, Sid.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.440
It is an award for everybody. So you were saying,

03:23.440 --> 03:34.640
well, I do have, look here, the craziest fucking thing. So we, maybe I oversold it by saying that,

03:34.640 --> 03:39.040
because it's also like insidiously not crazy. It was just this odd thing, or maybe I'm listening

03:39.040 --> 03:43.200
to too many of these like creepy pasta podcasts, where there's just like these little stories about

03:43.200 --> 03:48.400
little shit where you encounter, like you accidentally like, open this Lovecraftian advent

03:48.400 --> 03:53.360
window and the calendar of your monotonous life. And then, oh, I wrote the subway wrong. And then

03:53.360 --> 03:59.520
the people had tentacles and Slender Man was like, what next stop? I have no face. And then, but then

03:59.520 --> 04:04.160
you went back and you're like, never touch an elevator wrong. Are you going to tell the Emmy

04:04.160 --> 04:12.240
story in a crazy Canadian voice? One of the things I like to do is go to the Emmy Awards.

04:12.240 --> 04:24.880
So we, you get sat in, you know, with your peeps like, so like, it's a big production. We got like

04:24.880 --> 04:33.360
basically a full row in this auditorium is sort of like, you look down the row and you're seeing

04:33.360 --> 04:39.440
people that you worked with and that are there tonight for that are on the show. And, but that's

04:39.440 --> 04:45.440
not, you know, you don't recognize it. It's an entire row. So that's not necessarily a thing

04:45.440 --> 04:51.680
that you're conscious of. And then, so Justin, because he's the cool one, shows up last. And

04:51.680 --> 04:56.880
like, I had been sitting there with Cody and then like, there's another row behind us and

04:56.880 --> 05:03.200
Ryan Ridley's back there. And it's like, people like, you know, there's another whole row behind us.

05:03.200 --> 05:09.600
And people are chatting and things and the theater slowly fills up. And Justin's like,

05:09.600 --> 05:15.680
rolling in with his girlfriend, like, really close to just like, the lights are going down and

05:15.680 --> 05:21.200
they're going to, the guy comes out and he explains, your acceptance speech has to be this long. And

05:21.200 --> 05:25.440
when you, if I do this, you got to do this or whatever. And it's like, not a big deal. But it's

05:25.440 --> 05:30.560
like, Justin's like standing in the aisle. And he's got an estate. And it's like, he's like,

05:30.560 --> 05:37.760
making this gesture. And we finally realize, oh, shit, we look at the row. And there's one seat

05:37.760 --> 05:43.440
empty. And he's standing there with his date. And he's going like, you know, he's like making this

05:43.440 --> 05:48.160
because we're all having to be hushed now. And he's like, jump out. And we're like, oh, God,

05:49.680 --> 05:54.400
one seat open. And so then this is like, kind of flurry of this panic starts to happen. Like,

05:54.400 --> 05:59.680
what, what could possibly go wrong? So the, I don't know when to reveal that this whole time

05:59.680 --> 06:10.000
in the story, there's this guy sitting there that is alone and is not, does not work on the show.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.640
And it's, and it's just sort of like, he looks like, you know, if I was casting this movie,

06:16.640 --> 06:22.960
he would, I would cast him, I would cast Jolo Trulio as this guy. He was, he was, he was a,

06:22.960 --> 06:30.640
he was a, he was a, he was an attractive man in a, in a, in a respectfully diminutive package

06:30.640 --> 06:34.800
that sort of like, it was like, he's not, he's not a big bruiser. He's not a, he's not a, he's not

06:34.800 --> 06:40.560
a basketball player. I was like, he's kind of like, here I am. I'm this guy. I got, I got my frame

06:40.560 --> 06:48.000
and I'm occupying my space. And he looked good in his suit. And, and he was, he was sitting there

06:48.000 --> 06:53.360
when I got there. And I got there, you know, pretty early. And it was like, the theater was

06:53.360 --> 06:59.680
like filling up and he was just sitting there. So like, who is going to, there's, there's a guy,

06:59.680 --> 07:04.720
Justin's going like, who do I don't know? And so then obviously the first thing everybody that's,

07:04.720 --> 07:08.960
you know, like me is going to go like, okay, this must be my fault. I'm going to look at my ticket.

07:08.960 --> 07:15.760
I'm going to, and I look and I go, oh, see, and Cody's like, see, you're in the 315. And look

07:15.760 --> 07:20.480
where you're, and I'm in 3, I don't know, 13 or something like that. And she's like, and I'm in

07:20.480 --> 07:25.840
314. And then this, this Joe LaTrulyo guy is like next to her. And it was like, and we're like,

07:25.840 --> 07:31.200
okay, all right. Well, it's, and the guy is like, he's not not participating in it. He's not with

07:31.200 --> 07:36.160
anybody. He's not distracted. He's just sort of watching it all unfold. He's just going like,

07:36.160 --> 07:42.160
like, huh? Yeah. And then, and then, and then we, and then we go, so we finally like, I go 315.

07:42.160 --> 07:49.440
And Cody, like, it's like, I'm standing in 313. She's standing in 314. So like already, you know,

07:50.640 --> 07:57.360
we're not, but we're still airing on the side of caution by going, so Cody goes,

07:58.560 --> 08:04.560
sorry, what, what seat are you in? And he's been watching and he like, and he looks down between

08:04.560 --> 08:13.440
his legs and he looks where the seat thing is, because he's like 315. And we're like, okay, well,

08:14.800 --> 08:19.600
but also that doesn't explain, like just him being in the wrong seat doesn't explain anything.

08:19.600 --> 08:27.440
But him not not supposed to be thereing is would explain everything. Yeah. And explain everything.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.920
He didn't show you a ticket. If he was an alien, it would explain everything. Because then there

08:31.920 --> 08:36.960
would be exactly two seats that are there are the two people that are there in the full row.

08:36.960 --> 08:43.680
But no one's going there in their head. Everyone's just like, oh, okay. So, and it's like clear,

08:43.680 --> 08:46.880
like I'm swear, I'm telling you, like he's not being passive aggressive, like ignoring us,

08:46.880 --> 08:51.200
like he's sort of like fascinated by what's happening. Yeah. Because he's like, he's kind of

08:51.200 --> 08:55.120
helping out a little bit. It's kind of hard to describe. Sorry, I'm spilling my drink everywhere.

08:55.120 --> 09:02.880
But like he's like he's sort of like involved. He is like he was it was I'm judging too much.

09:02.880 --> 09:07.600
I'm analyzing too much during the story because I'd like to analyze it forever after the story.

09:07.600 --> 09:13.360
But like a footnote here is looking back on it. My perception is that his goal was to

09:13.360 --> 09:20.000
fucking blend. And you don't blend by just ignoring everyone to blend. He also was like, like, like,

09:20.000 --> 09:27.680
uh-huh, like he was like, he was part of the fracas. Yeah. He was like helping out. And

09:27.680 --> 09:30.960
then one of my, and he goes like, like, and then I go, I'm sorry, can we, and he goes,

09:30.960 --> 09:38.320
you want to switch seats? And he gets up and he switches seats with me, which just skirts the

09:38.320 --> 09:44.640
issue. It's fucking, he's like, because it gets me in the right seat and look, we're all fuck ups

09:44.640 --> 09:51.120
here. I've been sitting in 313 my whole life and I'm 315. Who are we going to judge right now?

09:51.120 --> 09:54.800
And he's like, so I'm switching seats with this guy and then he plops down and the thing.

09:54.800 --> 10:00.640
And it just keeps mounting because it's like, it's a situation where there's no authority

10:00.640 --> 10:04.880
really. Like, it's not like a theater where you're like, I'm going to go get the kid with the

10:04.880 --> 10:08.720
flashlight. You know, like, I'm going to put an end to all this shenanigans. Someone's going to

10:08.720 --> 10:15.440
go, dammit. It's like, it's a too big a theater and the timing's wrong and the anxiety's wrong.

10:15.440 --> 10:21.120
Like, you don't, you don't do that here. It feels like you don't know what to do. And so because

10:21.120 --> 10:26.800
no one knows what to do, but the urgency is, is keeps heightening. Something happens and something

10:26.800 --> 10:32.000
just snaps. And I, that's the part of the story. I don't really know because somewhere over there

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
where this guy, this guy has switched seats with me, somebody finally has an exchange with him

10:39.680 --> 10:46.400
that very quickly gets resolved and he goes like, and then he just, he starts leaving.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.320
And then we're like, and then like, then Justin and, and, and Ozzie, you're going to go like,

10:50.320 --> 10:57.680
sit down now. And, and in the wake of it, we're like, okay, cool. What the fuck? And then,

10:57.680 --> 11:02.400
and then the person that was over there that had had the immediate change was like, he said he was

11:02.400 --> 11:13.040
a seat filler. Um, no, I don't know. I don't know. Someone has misinterpreted that job description.

11:13.040 --> 11:20.080
Yeah. Yeah. Ain't no volunteer seat filler. So I'm like, I'm like, so, so a couple, like a couple

11:20.080 --> 11:29.760
of the logic tree branches here, like, okay, world's most like dedicated seat filler, Paul Blart

11:29.760 --> 11:34.800
seat filler, like that's the bit is like, I'm going to, I was born to fill seats. I'm going to,

11:34.800 --> 11:40.560
my mom always said never leave a seat unfilled. Like it's just some perversion of a seat that

11:40.560 --> 11:46.960
doesn't exist. That's not, that's not real. Um, then a cousin of that theory is I just picture

11:46.960 --> 11:50.880
the guy like at some, there's like seat filler culture where the guy's like, you ever hear of

11:50.880 --> 12:00.400
Dale, uh, Shannon, man? No, the Dale, what? Uh, season three of Nash Bridges, uh, Golden Globes,

12:01.600 --> 12:08.960
Jeremy seat fills next to Melanie Griffith. Yeah. Don Johnson's in the bathroom, food poisoning.

12:08.960 --> 12:13.840
Jeremy ends up going to the governor's ball with Mel. Now he calls her Mel. You know why?

12:13.840 --> 12:18.480
Why? He became a associate producer the next, the following week. Like, I don't, like, like,

12:18.480 --> 12:22.240
like these stories where you go like, you know, Bruce Willis was a bartender and then he like,

12:22.240 --> 12:27.040
he said, uh, uh, come out to the coast, have a few laughs while he was making a drink and

12:27.040 --> 12:34.400
someone was like, say that again, but now say it in an air vent. Um, okay, now be on moon lighting

12:34.400 --> 12:40.000
for eight years and then, uh, some seagrams, gold wine coolers and that. I got, I got, I see you in

12:40.000 --> 12:44.880
an air vent baby saying that we get, we get, you know, Hollywood is high stakes and like crazy

12:44.880 --> 12:49.600
stories and like, we just find the dude that asked him to play harmonica and stab him in his face.

12:50.560 --> 12:56.480
So that the guy might have been, the guy might have been, and then someone made the joke that

12:56.480 --> 13:02.160
was like, when Justin rolled up that the guy was like, yeah, nice try rookie seat filler.

13:02.160 --> 13:06.640
Hilarious. Because he's like the Justin and he's like, yeah, yeah, nice. And we were laughing

13:06.640 --> 13:13.600
about that, but here's, here's what I, I swear it's rare that I, I genuinely believe the crazier

13:13.600 --> 13:21.040
more art bell thing. I, I, I don't think that any of that stuff explains it. I don't, I don't believe

13:21.040 --> 13:26.960
that he was a seat filler explains the thing. I think that he may or may not have technically

13:26.960 --> 13:36.240
been one, but more importantly, he was part of a fucking crazy, like weird thing that 10 years

13:36.240 --> 13:41.840
from now, there'll be a Netflix documentary of not just about him. It won't be like the seat

13:41.840 --> 13:47.760
stealer. It'll, it'll be called like seat stealers. Like, and it'll be about the fact that like,

13:47.760 --> 13:54.400
there's like five or six people that know that the guy, and then, and then everyone, every, every

13:54.400 --> 13:59.200
award show, there's always like a big thing where like there's 60 people on stage. I always go up

13:59.200 --> 14:03.680
for that. Like he would go up because there was like this thing where they had all the Star Trek

14:03.680 --> 14:08.320
people come out and they're just talking about Star Trek for like what seemed like like star dates.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.920
And, and I was just thinking like, yeah, that guy could have just wandered up there and like

14:13.920 --> 14:20.880
stood next to LeVar Burton and been like, yeah, yeah. Like, like, like, what an art that would be,

14:20.880 --> 14:26.160
but not if you did it once, but if you did it 20 times over 20 years, and just, you just decided

14:26.160 --> 14:29.680
like, I'm going to do it until I get caught. And then if I get caught, then I'm going to just like,

14:29.680 --> 14:33.280
see what I can do. Like I'll request all the footage and I'll piece something together. I just,

14:33.280 --> 14:37.840
it's like, like, like this is art or something. He just had this look on his face. I look back

14:37.840 --> 14:46.080
and I'm like, we met a gremlin. We met a unicorn. We brushed like with like some like, like, like

14:46.080 --> 14:51.120
something real, something mythical. I wish he would try that shit at the BET Awards.

14:54.720 --> 14:59.120
God, I mean, what if he did? What if he did? And they were like, what if he came on the show

14:59.120 --> 15:03.920
and he was like, yeah, oh, yeah, nice, like, roll a clip. And I was like, all the more. And it's

15:03.920 --> 15:08.880
like, of course, there's like one like white dude there. And there's like little navy blue coat,

15:08.880 --> 15:14.800
like, of course. Anyway, it just makes sense to everyone. It's just like this Zellig, you know,

15:14.800 --> 15:22.880
thing. Yeah, I, he, that guy, boy, he did not want to stop filling that seat. Yeah. And I think

15:22.880 --> 15:28.960
that he fascinates you because you have a thing, perhaps as I do, which is you wonder how someone

15:28.960 --> 15:33.680
takes, they get those balls. How do you get the balls to sit there and enter, you know,

15:33.680 --> 15:37.920
entertain the idea that you might get thrown out, but that you might serve. And that entwines with

15:37.920 --> 15:43.920
your fraud complex, which is like, oh, you know, why am I better than a seat filler? The, you know,

15:43.920 --> 15:47.200
of course, you're gonna, your mind's gonna go there when it's like that we like any place where

15:47.200 --> 15:55.040
there's class is imputed, whatever. That's not the word in life. Like your head immediately goes,

15:55.040 --> 16:01.280
what am I doing here? What am I doing? And then, so then you think and then that, yeah, I, it's

16:01.280 --> 16:07.520
both of those things. It's like, like, what, like, how can you fucking, so if you got, if you, if you

16:07.520 --> 16:15.360
were like, would I, would I, and didn't I? Yeah, I did. Yeah, that's all I did. Just fill the seat.

16:17.520 --> 16:22.000
Also, you do, you kind of, it resets you. Like you said, you go, Jesus Christ, we're in the same

16:22.000 --> 16:27.760
space right now. Yours is a fraud, and that you're not supposed to be here. So is mine. And so is mine.

16:27.760 --> 16:34.640
Yeah. And you have like some like, like quirky in 90s indie movie thing, or like, I'm going to give

16:34.640 --> 16:42.080
you this, my dead father's watch. Yeah. When it stops ticking, you and I trade back or whatever,

16:42.080 --> 16:49.440
like, just like sliding doors thing, or like, I keep filling the seat or, or like Donald Sutherland

16:49.440 --> 16:54.880
comes down with a popcorn cart, and he's like, like, there's like a seat filler coupon, but it's

16:54.880 --> 17:00.400
magic. And like, so like, I, and I'm like being obnoxious and doing coke and going like, at least

17:00.400 --> 17:10.560
I'm not a seat filler. I'll tell you what, I wish, I wish, I wish I could fill his seat just to show

17:10.560 --> 17:19.920
him how much more I do with it. Yo, Sutherland popcorn. Here you go. I'm from Maine. It's

17:19.920 --> 17:35.200
lightning. Are you referencing the Marsha Mason movie? I don't know what movie I'm. It's the Jason

17:35.200 --> 17:40.480
Robarts comes to town. Oh, well, Jason wrote you mean dream a little dream. Was that what it was called?

17:40.480 --> 17:45.920
No, it's this. It's a single mother. She's got a son. Oh, Mr. Dynamite or something like that.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.760
Mr. Dynamite. Fantastic. He comes to town and he changes this woman's life. He's a millionaire.

17:49.760 --> 17:55.120
It's ages old, but it's very similar. Oh, no, I'm not familiar with this. I thought you were talking

17:55.120 --> 17:58.880
about like, because we were vaguely alluding to body swapping things. Did you see the thing

17:58.880 --> 18:05.520
with him and Corey Feldman? No, but apparently a lot of movies share the same plot. Yeah,

18:06.560 --> 18:10.480
magic abounds. All right, well, let's let's let's bring out Rob Schrab.

18:12.640 --> 18:22.800
Ladies and gentlemen, back from a season of championships, we welcome the wonderful Rob

18:22.800 --> 18:38.080
Schrab. Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Schrab. Welcome back.

18:41.200 --> 18:47.280
Hello. What did we do during the show after the 300th one? I was a

18:47.280 --> 18:53.120
Oh, no, I wasn't here. Are you talking to me? Anyone that was here? I don't know.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.360
Schrab wasn't here. So good thing you brought me out.

18:59.760 --> 19:05.360
I was just lying. Schrab was here. Hey, read you a quick.

19:07.840 --> 19:14.560
This is from like, okay, you want to know me. Maybe it's maybe for one hour. It's safe to click

19:14.560 --> 19:23.840
your name. I get emails from the publicity firm. They go like, oh, press roundup or whatever. And

19:23.840 --> 19:29.520
they even vet them for like, you know, they're not going to like, you know, here's here's all of your

19:29.520 --> 19:34.400
you being mentioned on the internet. Like, they lose clients that way. This is the first win for

19:34.400 --> 19:40.480
adult swim. Oh, shit, right? Wait, no, wait, is this their first Emmy adult swim? Well, I don't

19:40.480 --> 19:44.880
I don't know about that. I know. I mean, it's certainly it was good to see you too, Dan.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.280
Well, you you put you paused and I had a thing.

19:51.040 --> 19:55.040
Okay, here it is. All right, sorry. A lot of that was just I don't know how to work my phone.

19:55.040 --> 19:59.200
You can't do that. You can't come out and then sit for five minutes. And then I'm like, all right,

19:59.200 --> 20:03.760
moving on. I'm going to do this thing. And then you're like, well, how do you do, you know, come

20:03.760 --> 20:08.800
out with a fucking story about a bear or something or come out, make yourself at home and chill. And

20:08.800 --> 20:14.080
I'm not going to tell my thing about my the thing I got my phone. That's another way to do it.

20:15.920 --> 20:21.600
What do you want me to ask you? Like, oh, what's been going on like a host of a show?

20:23.680 --> 20:28.080
No, just invite somebody out to heaven, sit and watch you talk.

20:28.080 --> 20:39.600
All right, now let's build out to bring out Bill Johnson. All right, Bill Johnson, sit down.

20:39.600 --> 20:45.600
So anyway, I was eating a sandwich. This sandwich is fucking great. I was eating this.

20:46.400 --> 20:53.200
Bill Johnson is going, why did why did I even leave the house? Why did I come here? I don't have to

20:53.200 --> 21:01.760
stand. All right, well, what's new with you? And it better be fucking amazing.

21:03.520 --> 21:11.440
Vape adventures. Oh, okay. I'm into vapes now as what did you did you and Spencer Spencer and I

21:11.440 --> 21:25.040
went on a vape adventure and a vape sure a Spencer vape adventure. So hashtag vape culture, vape

21:25.040 --> 21:34.560
culture. Okay, all right. I, I thought I thought it through in my head. I categorized it as not

21:34.560 --> 21:43.120
technically a rape joke. But right, the customer is always right. And let's let's keep communicating

21:43.120 --> 21:49.120
like that. And I'm fine with it if you are. I did I vetted it. I did not want to hurt anybody.

21:50.160 --> 21:56.400
The public has spoken rhyming counts and I didn't know it. And I will not make the same mistake

21:56.400 --> 22:03.600
again. That debt, you know, we're a couple years away from that being on a poster of some dream

22:03.600 --> 22:12.240
works. Like I mean, yeah, well, yeah, grape culture. Oh, I didn't know that's

22:12.240 --> 22:19.360
rude. I mean, yeah, yeah, like, okay. And we're gonna be gone. Oh, grape culture. That sounds

22:19.360 --> 22:28.320
familiar. Jesus. What the fuck? Mommy, why is it that interesting? I don't know. Who are you?

22:28.320 --> 22:38.240
Why are you in my car? Vape adventure starring Spencer, Rob and Kate. So Spencer text me super

22:38.240 --> 22:45.760
early in the morning. So early. So early. Like, um, like what, like 415. What? Yeah. No, no,

22:45.760 --> 22:52.400
not that. Actually, I think you, you, you texted me like, like the night before and I didn't get

22:52.400 --> 22:59.840
it until the night of all important information. So, uh, you know, you come over and we go to the

22:59.840 --> 23:07.040
magic place where, you know, you get your vape on and there's like, there's so much Rick and Morty

23:07.040 --> 23:11.360
stuff there, Dan, they got it all hang out. You should go there. You should go. Well,

23:14.720 --> 23:21.040
pretty cool. He's got the hanging on wall. They might give you some free shit.

23:21.040 --> 23:29.920
Might give you some free shit. Oh, I got the one and I mean, pretty cool. You got that on the

23:29.920 --> 23:36.320
wall. Rob's doing a good face. Pretty cool. You got it on the wall. I just wanted to do with that a

23:36.320 --> 23:44.800
little bit. Why is he elbow? Look at his face he's making. So anyway, we go in there and they set

23:44.800 --> 23:49.760
me up with vape. They said Kate and I up with some good vapes. We got some good vapes. Like, we got

23:49.760 --> 23:56.480
two different brands. We got or not flavors. What are they called? Uh, well, that there's

23:56.480 --> 24:01.920
different like varieties of weed that are called brands. Okay. So we got two different brands.

24:03.120 --> 24:08.160
Go home and Spencer is like, all right, that's how you do it. And he said, he tells us how to put

24:08.160 --> 24:13.360
the battering thing. He's squeezing in there and they're like, I got what? Chocolate? What did I

24:13.360 --> 24:20.080
get? I think you got chocolate. I got chocolate or something. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate.

24:20.080 --> 24:25.680
Was it? I do this. I go, I go. Okay. So was it got a button? No, I think you can just,

24:25.680 --> 24:32.640
you can just like, you know, you know, suck on it. Oh, God, sorry. Everybody give him a second.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.280
He did. Because you know what else you suck on is ticks and titties.

24:37.280 --> 24:42.800
All manner of hilarious things. So I go, okay. So how do you do it?

24:47.040 --> 24:50.080
Because I was trying to make, and I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing.

24:51.200 --> 24:56.320
You can't see the light because it's down the pipe right away. So I did it. So, so anyway,

24:57.360 --> 25:03.040
Spencer turns around and goes, wow, that was, whoa, boy, you took a big hit there. I like,

25:03.040 --> 25:07.360
and then I was like, yeah, the thing you got to know is like the big hits, you just not, not to hit

25:07.360 --> 25:12.480
like that at first. Okay, don't do that. So I'm like, I don't really feel anything.

25:19.440 --> 25:27.120
And then I go, Kate, we got to go to cryotherapy right now. Cryotherapy cry. Is it, am I pronouncing?

25:27.120 --> 25:33.120
No, I assume cryotherapy. Flash frozen. So this is, this is, why did you want to get flash?

25:35.120 --> 25:39.200
First of all, are you for real? Did you go to cryotherapy? Because you got too high?

25:39.200 --> 25:43.840
Yeah. So second of all, then now you have to stop and explain not for a high vauding agent.

25:43.840 --> 25:48.800
He was going to go anyway. Everybody listening. Well, we were talking about it for a long time.

25:48.800 --> 25:54.320
We kept like, we were going to do, I had the whole day. Just tell them what cryotherapy is.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.880
Cryotherapy is something that Joel Hodgson told me about. He went on, like, when we were doing

25:58.880 --> 26:03.840
mystery science theater this summer, like, after every shoot, he would go, Hey, man,

26:03.840 --> 26:08.400
you want to do some cryotherapy? Man, it's pretty cool. You should check it out. It's good for your

26:08.400 --> 26:14.160
skin. Help my back. Might get frozen while some crazy movies playing and have some kind of stuff

26:14.160 --> 26:20.640
to say about it. You got to do it, man. It's the best, you know. And so, so I, I never did it,

26:20.640 --> 26:27.040
but I, I always wanted to try it. And then, and the thing that I go, so what do you do is, well,

26:27.040 --> 26:39.680
you go into this, like, shower sized room that is like, like, lots of degrees below zero. And you

26:39.680 --> 26:44.000
go in there for three minutes and you do jumping jacks and you get it. And what it does is they

26:44.000 --> 26:50.560
get, it makes your body go into this fight or flight mode where everything is on deck going, Jesus

26:50.560 --> 26:55.840
Christ, what are you doing? This is, you're trying to kill yourself. This is stupid. And it's supposed

26:55.840 --> 27:02.000
to, like, bring supposed to, you know, be good for your skin, but mostly wake you up and if you

27:02.000 --> 27:08.400
sleep at night. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know. It's probably stupid. But anyway, how much, how

27:08.400 --> 27:22.480
much, how much, how much, how much, how much, how much, how much, how much, it was way, what's the,

27:22.480 --> 27:30.480
what's the number that would make you then not go white people? What's it, if it was seven dollars,

27:30.480 --> 27:35.360
would you be like, all right, okay, fine. It's seven dollars. I'm like, okay, freeze me for seven

27:35.360 --> 27:39.360
dollars. It still, it wasn't seven dollars. It's still, it's always going to be white people.

27:41.760 --> 27:47.120
Just walking into a shower where it's cold, white people, some shit you have in your house. But

27:47.120 --> 27:52.880
that part, but I do believe that it is probably one of those things where it's like, it's a thousand

27:52.880 --> 27:59.280
dollars. I mean, it can't be, because if it's 30, if it's 30 dollars, you wouldn't do it, right?

27:59.280 --> 28:04.720
Like you can't, you don't freeze your body, even if it only caused them a nickel, they'd make more

28:04.720 --> 28:09.840
money if they charged $90 than 30, because it wasn't 30. It's like, I'm not going to have you

28:09.840 --> 28:18.640
freeze my body for the price of a transformer. What, how much was it? I don't, I didn't, I didn't

28:18.640 --> 28:26.960
set it up, dude. I was fucking, I was, that's my guess. My guess is $179. All right, okay, fine.

28:26.960 --> 28:32.960
And there's specials for couples and whatever. So anyway, Joel is telling me, you do this,

28:32.960 --> 28:37.120
you do this, man, you're doing, they play music and you dance around there if you want. And I go,

28:38.000 --> 28:45.680
do you get to pick the music? Yeah. What song did you, did you play, Joel? Tell me. And he's like,

28:45.680 --> 28:54.640
you got all bashful. And he goes, do you believe in life after love by, by Cher? Because Joel's a

28:54.640 --> 29:00.320
huge Cher fan, as we know. We're like, he loves Cher. Like not, I, I didn't know, I learned from

29:00.320 --> 29:08.080
this. Yeah. Well, he, he, he goes to Cher concert. It's, it's, it's amazing. So I go, Kate, and I'm

29:08.080 --> 29:15.280
like, so we go there. 70 bucks. Is it 70? 70 bucks. How do we add a coupon?

29:20.320 --> 29:26.800
It's like that is 30 bucks. I'll rub ice on your head. I'll make, I'll make you feel things and

29:26.800 --> 29:34.000
come back. Deal, deal. So anyway, we, because we're a couple of weeks, we can both go in the,

29:34.000 --> 29:42.400
into the chamber at the same time. And they go, okay, all right, Mr. Scrab and Kate friend,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.200
whatever, you know, we're standing in our underwear, you know, like getting ready to

29:47.200 --> 29:53.200
freeze ourselves to death. And, and they, and he says, what music do you want to listen to?

29:53.200 --> 30:04.560
And Kate goes, money for nothing. And I'm like, no, no, we have to do, do you believe in life

30:04.560 --> 30:12.560
after love by Cher? Oh, come on. She's like, all right, sure, fine. I'm like, okay, fine.

30:12.560 --> 30:17.360
Are you guys Cher or a thing? Yeah, you, because we're a couple, we can do that. Okay. You and I

30:17.360 --> 30:23.200
can do it next. Okay. All right. And so we go in there. And the guy goes, yeah, we can play that

30:23.200 --> 30:30.160
song. We got an apple, whatever, we put it on, it goes in, it's freezing. And you remember being

30:30.160 --> 30:36.000
in Wisconsin, where you're like, Oh, I got to throw out this, I got to let the dog in, whatever. I'm

30:36.000 --> 30:46.800
too lazy to put on a jacket or a hat or whatever. It's like that feeling. I remember it totally.

30:46.800 --> 30:52.480
And it goes, and it's freezing. So the music comes on. And it's the wrong song.

30:54.800 --> 31:01.680
So everybody I'm assuming knows, do you believe in life after love after love? Good song. Good song

31:01.680 --> 31:07.120
to jump around like an idiot so you don't freeze to death. Instead, they play, what's the song? I

31:07.120 --> 31:18.480
wrote it down. After all by Sharon Peter Cetera, which is this love ballad. After all that we've

31:18.480 --> 31:30.080
been through, it's just this. And we're both going, God damn it, wrong song, banging on the glass.

31:30.080 --> 31:38.240
Wrong song. And the guy's like, he's like a carny. He's just like in a booth. I didn't know

31:38.240 --> 31:45.440
there was a guy, he could see you. You want to go colder? It's pretty, it's pretty close to that.

31:45.440 --> 31:49.600
Do you all have to get naked for this? No, no, no, but I'm in my underwear. We're both.

31:49.600 --> 31:55.120
But you're not wearing pants. Yeah. I mean, you're in your unders. That's not naked. I know. But

31:55.120 --> 32:04.320
the important answer to your question is this is a ridiculous situation. And it's much more than

32:04.320 --> 32:09.280
a lot of us could get paid $70 to do. I'm not trying to high road this. I don't want to be one

32:09.280 --> 32:17.920
of these practical guys. It's like $70 to be cold. I'm not going to be that guy. Don't. I'm not.

32:17.920 --> 32:29.520
You're not allowed. I do crazy. I pay $70 to simulate living in a post apocalyptic

32:30.640 --> 32:38.080
place in Boston where I spend nine hours a night sorting my living room. I'll pay for the high

32:38.080 --> 32:42.640
resolution pack of a video game just so the cupboards could look better as I'm like figuring

32:42.640 --> 32:48.800
out where to put my duct tape. And my fucking house is falling apart around me. And somebody's

32:48.800 --> 32:54.320
like, did you put an orange Julius on the dog's head? Yeah, I don't care about life. I'm trying

32:54.320 --> 32:59.920
to sort my fallout apartment. Anyways, continue. I just wanted to interject it with a little bit

32:59.920 --> 33:05.920
of what the people really want, which is, wow. No matter how much you dilute yourself,

33:05.920 --> 33:12.560
you still got a little bit of me in there. Keep going. Keep going. They got what they need.

33:12.560 --> 33:23.040
Keep going. Okay. So the fucking computer system goes three minutes left. And you're like, oh,

33:23.040 --> 33:29.840
fuck you. Three minutes? And we're screaming, fuck you. Wrong song. Kate and I are both going,

33:29.840 --> 33:36.000
wrong fucking song. I fucking hate this song. This song made it last like it was eight minutes.

33:36.880 --> 33:41.280
It was slow. I mean, at least with an uptempo song, it would feel

33:42.240 --> 33:48.000
shorter. It didn't. This was awful. And then we get out and we go wrong song. Oh,

33:49.360 --> 33:55.360
all right. You know, did you just press like any share song at random? It doesn't work that way.

33:55.360 --> 34:00.960
It doesn't. You can get out. Did he say? Yeah, were you locked inside? That sounds

34:00.960 --> 34:07.120
terrifying. No, I wasn't locked, but we committed to it. Okay, sure. And, and, and...

34:07.120 --> 34:14.080
This motherfucker deserved it. And I deserved it. Did he say that he would make it up to you?

34:14.080 --> 34:15.840
No. He didn't promise to?

34:15.840 --> 34:22.800
No. I mean, after all that you'd been through.

34:25.520 --> 34:31.360
Yeah. I don't even remember that song. I don't know that song at all. You're...

34:31.360 --> 34:32.640
And I love Peter Sotero.

34:35.360 --> 34:41.120
I'll play it. I'll play it for you later. And, but anyway, through this whole thing,

34:41.120 --> 34:48.480
I'm still stoned AF, motherfucker. I am stoned as fuck. I'm just like going,

34:48.480 --> 34:55.920
I would think this freezing cold sensation would sober me up, but I was fucked up all day.

34:56.720 --> 35:00.880
After we leave, I go, hey, let's go to this restaurant that's right next door.

35:01.920 --> 35:07.520
And we drove over there. We got it ordered all this food. I just kept eating, eating, eating.

35:07.520 --> 35:12.640
Okay. It's like, you're just so, you're such a cliche of shaggy. What are you doing?

35:13.840 --> 35:19.120
Then I went home and then I, you know, had to take the dog. I don't remember half the day.

35:19.120 --> 35:25.680
I remember doing this a lot on the couch, just laying there. And then I go to take Lolly to

35:25.680 --> 35:31.840
the dog groomer to wash the dog because she's got shit on her butt. And so I take, take the dog

35:31.840 --> 35:37.600
over there. And then I was like, it's closest to where Steve Agee lives. So I go to Steve Agee.

35:37.600 --> 35:42.800
I said, Hey, can I hang out while my dog's getting her ass washed? If I bring a bunch of ice cream,

35:42.800 --> 35:50.240
I bring a bunch of ice cream over to Steve Agee's house. And he was watching the Twilight Zone.

35:50.240 --> 35:58.400
I eat like a whole tub of ice cream, talked over the Twilight Zone. He was trying to record a podcast.

35:58.400 --> 36:03.120
And then I was like going, Hey, my dog's done. Talk to you later. I don't think he said anything.

36:03.120 --> 36:09.440
And I just left and I'm just, and then I was like, did I come over by your house yesterday

36:09.440 --> 36:14.720
and talk over your television show and ate ice cream? Yeah. Yeah. You did all of that.

36:14.720 --> 36:18.240
Yeah. A lot of people, I'm glad you're not then moving on to try to convince people that you're

36:18.240 --> 36:24.880
not having the best life in the world. That's not, I think I would like to spend the day doing that.

36:24.880 --> 36:34.640
It was, it was, it was quite good. I almost went to do VR like Star Wars VR.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.240
You hear about this void? Yeah. Oh, okay.

36:41.360 --> 36:47.200
Let me tell you something. Did you look at, he came out with notes like a, like an alternative

36:47.200 --> 36:56.080
comic in San Francisco. He's got a, he's got a whole notepad. Here's another question. Here's

36:56.080 --> 37:05.520
a question. Okay. All right. So, you know, I was watching this movie with Kate and it,

37:05.520 --> 37:10.720
it was like this British movie came out last year. It's like these two old people falling

37:10.720 --> 37:15.600
in love and learning how to dance and doing a whatever. I know it sounds right up your alley.

37:15.600 --> 37:22.960
And throw me under the bus. I love feelings. Anyway, it was, it was sweet. It was cheesy

37:22.960 --> 37:27.600
or whatever. And I was like thinking like, well, there's like this demographic, this

37:27.600 --> 37:33.920
about Schmidt bucket list, Morgan Freeman, you know, Alan Arkin, like,

37:35.360 --> 37:39.440
they, you know, it's like the matlock of movies or whatever, where they go, we're gonna go,

37:39.440 --> 37:43.840
okay, we're targeting these baby boomers or whatever. You know what I'm talking about.

37:43.840 --> 37:50.640
Yes. It's the, it's the something's got to give the right. What's with your, what's with your

37:50.640 --> 37:58.080
croissant? Yeah, I'm kind of like, Mickey, Mickey Oldman and he wears a sweater. Johnson are,

37:58.080 --> 38:02.160
you know, but it's like people that we remember as ghostbusters and stuff. Yeah.

38:02.160 --> 38:08.960
Because I don't ask that our arteries are slowly my question to you as a writer and a producer

38:08.960 --> 38:18.080
of various things. Do you think that when our generation hits that, are there going to be more

38:18.080 --> 38:25.440
like sci-fi, you know, fantasy stuff featuring old people? Or do we just get to it? Jason Sudeikiss

38:25.440 --> 38:32.800
and Allison Brie are fighting an insect monster. Yeah. But they're like, we're like good walkers.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.880
Because it reminds us of a simpler time. Kind of back to the future.

38:36.880 --> 38:42.720
Just showed up with the ray gun. God damn it. Well, do you love me or not? I don't know. We

38:42.720 --> 38:56.240
grew up friends. All I want to do is see my grandchildren on Easter. Oh, well, Jesus, it's

38:56.240 --> 39:10.080
not very sci-fi. But how about Kevin Hart in How We Go Get Back to Earth? Or when I was your age,

39:10.080 --> 39:14.800
Earth was uphill, you know, because it'll be more about, it'll be more like, are we there yet?

39:14.800 --> 39:22.400
You know, that sounds like that could come out tomorrow. Is there like a whole series of

39:22.400 --> 39:27.440
how are we going to get back to blanks? Tiffany Haddish has, how are we going to get back tomorrow?

39:29.760 --> 39:36.320
The Kevin Hart series, Kevin Hart 70, and it's a yes. How are we going to get back to blank series?

39:36.320 --> 39:41.680
And then it gets to the point where it's so over saturated that the movies have to start

39:41.680 --> 39:53.920
becoming like, how are we going to get back to meet the meets Jason Voorhees? I'm trying to think

39:53.920 --> 40:00.080
of an example. It's like, God damn it. If I wish when we were making First Blood, we had known

40:00.080 --> 40:06.560
that we were just making a franchise called Rambo. We made this so confusing. What do you mean,

40:06.560 --> 40:12.480
Rambo colon First Blood part two? That's so confusing. What are we going to call the third

40:12.480 --> 40:21.840
movie? I have an idea. Yes, Mr. S? Rambo three. Okay, fine. But that's not, I mean, our point is,

40:21.840 --> 40:31.920
your point is make a third movie. But First Blood part two, look, we could call it second blood

40:31.920 --> 40:38.080
and just get rid of the last. We could call it the bloodening. Yeah, just sort of keep it more blood.

40:38.080 --> 40:42.080
Call it second blood, first blood, first blood, second blood, third blood, you know,

40:42.080 --> 40:46.320
they would fucking die for opportunity to do that. They'd make so much money if they would have done

40:46.320 --> 40:52.000
that. God damn it. I'm sorry. I hate that you've taken on this role. Oh, no, I don't. I love it.

40:52.000 --> 41:03.200
I love it because it's I love irony. I love watching you turn into your mother. After all

41:03.200 --> 41:08.480
of these years of friendship, we bonded, our original bond, it was like, you know, we bonded

41:08.480 --> 41:12.480
over the fact that we were raised in a culture of, oh, you're in Milwaukee, and you got your

41:12.480 --> 41:17.360
pacifier in your mouth, and you look at a Wrigley's billboard, and you're like, how come the billboard

41:17.360 --> 41:22.640
makes look like a gum's a bad idea? And your and your parents go like, you're talking about it.

41:22.640 --> 41:27.120
And we like bonded about it. We're like, yeah, man. And then to get out here and like make stuff.

41:27.120 --> 41:33.760
And now look at you, man, you're fucking Saruman. And I'm Gandalf the White.

41:36.800 --> 41:42.480
And I'll tell you what, man, put me on the roof of your tower and leave me up there forever

41:42.480 --> 41:49.920
while you make new kinds of goblins. And then I hope you visit me every once in a while.

41:49.920 --> 41:57.040
But I'll tell you what, man, there's moths everywhere. And they talk to eagles. And I will

41:57.040 --> 42:03.040
get out of here because you should have just killed me. Okay, don't hate the wizard hate the

42:03.040 --> 42:08.800
weird fucking rules. Yep. Yep. Everybody, everybody's against you. I know. Yeah.

42:08.800 --> 42:14.560
Yeah. I get it. It's pretty bad. You got to know that's you. You know that guy's you when Gandalf

42:14.560 --> 42:19.600
goes you when you watched Lord of the Rings, we never talked about it. Why is there we watch

42:19.600 --> 42:24.240
grumpy old men are like, Oh, that's you. And that's me. Like, like, when we watched American Splendor,

42:24.240 --> 42:29.280
we knew that, you know, you were crumb and I was the Harvey P car. We were like, Okay, that's us.

42:29.280 --> 42:34.880
Yeah. And then, but, you know, we never checked in. We never called each other Lord of the Rings

42:34.880 --> 42:39.120
ago. Come on, you're Saruman. Like when when fucking Gandalf rides up, he's like, I'm going to go

42:39.120 --> 42:47.200
and the guy's like, Don't let me touch that ring. It's so powerful. I'm going to go talk to my friend

42:47.200 --> 42:52.800
Saruman about it. He's the best friend I've ever had. I've never trusted anyone in my life. Don't

42:52.800 --> 42:58.880
let me touch that ring. I'm so smart about this shit. I'm going to go to the library, look up a

42:58.880 --> 43:03.680
couple things. I'm going to go see my roommate from college. I'll tell him everything. I never

43:03.680 --> 43:08.480
trusted anybody more in my life. I'm just I live on a different plane where I know about everything.

43:08.480 --> 43:14.080
And it's you. Yeah. And you're like, look into the crystal ball. What do you see? Oh, it is like,

43:14.080 --> 43:20.080
I see it all because I'm fucking like, because you're yeah, that's you. I saw I saw that guy and

43:20.080 --> 43:27.200
I was like, that's Schrab. And I'm the only one that sees it. You know, nobody looks at me and

43:27.200 --> 43:32.240
goes, That's Gandalf. But like, I am like, I'm like, like the self destructiveness, like you

43:32.240 --> 43:36.400
shall not pass. Who does that? Somebody that hates himself. Like he knows that's a ball rock. He knows

43:36.400 --> 43:40.560
he's going to die. But he doesn't care. Because he's like, fuck it. You know what, people feel

43:40.560 --> 43:47.120
sorry for me. I'll probably come back to life anyway. I get that. Why do you say they love each

43:47.120 --> 43:51.600
other? And the way he said fly you fools so that people would spend a year trying to figure out

43:51.600 --> 43:58.000
whether what he said, because we're like, what, what fire you fool? What? What did he say? Like,

43:58.000 --> 44:04.320
he got to buy like special shit to know what he said. Close captioning. What? You gotta buy close

44:04.320 --> 44:12.080
captioning. Yeah. But at the root of all that, you're basically saying, I love you, dog. No, dude.

44:12.080 --> 44:16.720
Well, I mean, look, because you went way too deep on that for somebody who's not in love.

44:18.320 --> 44:23.520
You can keep chipping away at this theory that I love, Rob. Like I people like to do that. Like

44:23.520 --> 44:32.640
theories. This concept that you've been coming up with now, Rob.

44:33.680 --> 44:38.880
Rob, do you have anything nice to say to your brother? That's not what this show's about. It's

44:38.880 --> 44:44.560
not. It doesn't have to be a show about. Yeah, I don't want to share this anymore. I thought

44:44.560 --> 44:54.800
this was funny, but can I ask you a quick question that everyone is probably did you call? Oh, I

44:54.800 --> 45:04.480
texted my parents. You don't know this, but three people in the back just fist bumped.

45:04.480 --> 45:14.480
I texted them a photo of my second Emmy with an arrow pointing at it because there's two of them.

45:17.040 --> 45:23.200
One must be for humility. Are they most outstanding use of humility in a straight

45:23.200 --> 45:30.640
white male? Does the new Emmy look newer than the old one? Can you see that? No,

45:30.640 --> 45:37.120
well, I haven't looked that close to them. I'm high on life. Okay. So I texted the photo,

45:37.120 --> 45:42.080
and then my mom texted. We just found out. Yesterday, congratulations. I'm very proud of

45:42.080 --> 45:47.600
you. And then she said, did we ever congratulate you on your 70 episode thing? So cool. And then

45:47.600 --> 45:52.480
there was like a pause. And then the last thing was from my mom saying, you were right. Leave the car

45:52.480 --> 46:01.600
where it is, which I assume is just she just did you text your other dad as well? I did.

46:01.600 --> 46:06.800
Actually, well, yeah, because he, he, he, my, my, my surrogate father, Heath Collins,

46:07.760 --> 46:12.000
who is still dad and my phone texted congratulations. And I was like, thank you, dad. And we actually

46:12.000 --> 46:16.640
bonded for a while about it. And yeah, it was nice. Actually, I think we've decided to just

46:16.640 --> 46:22.400
role play that now. And it's kind of like, yeah, if that works, then that's, that should be how it

46:22.400 --> 46:29.680
works. And you're glowing. You're glowing. Thank you. Very, very happy. All right. Let me read you

46:29.680 --> 46:34.800
guys this because I want to be happy with yourself. So like I said, like I was saying earlier, so

46:34.800 --> 46:43.200
you go like, okay, well, why isn't the tongue considered like more than it is? I mean, it's not

46:43.200 --> 46:48.400
a limb, but it's like, you know, it's a fingernail away from being a mouth finger, you know, like

46:48.400 --> 46:55.200
it's, it's, why is it, why don't we say it's like a tongue, the tongue, the tongue, way better than

46:55.200 --> 47:05.920
a finger. Mouth finger. You could point with it. What you need is somebody to ground you.

47:05.920 --> 47:12.800
Yeah, I mean, it's, I think we make, she won't come to Harmontown.

47:15.520 --> 47:18.480
All right, let us have it. You know that we're tubes.

47:21.840 --> 47:27.600
We're like big worms. Yeah. Not me. And then when you eat something, you're just rubbing up against

47:27.600 --> 47:32.800
it with the outside of your body that became the inner ring of this like, torus shape that's

47:32.800 --> 47:36.800
been extruded. Not me though. That doesn't apply to me.

47:39.520 --> 47:46.000
All right. And that's why butt chugging will kill you kids. Don't do it. You're putting vodka into

47:46.000 --> 47:53.680
a hole that is not designed. Butt chugging? Yes. Oh yeah. Kids are dying out there. They put funnels

47:53.680 --> 48:00.000
in their asses and pour whiskey down it. And they're dying from butt chugging. And the ladies with

48:00.000 --> 48:07.520
the tampons and the ladies and the tampons. Those are the people dumping vodka into your butt?

48:08.160 --> 48:12.000
No, I don't know if they are. I don't know who's helping with that. The ladies and the tampons.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.760
The vodka soaked tampons is the other thing. Vodka soaked tampons. It hits your system quicker

48:17.760 --> 48:25.040
because those membranes are more, are less, less selective, I guess. What fucking Emmy parties

48:25.040 --> 48:35.840
were you going to? I didn't go to any. I needed to die. Okay. All right. So I thought, okay,

48:35.840 --> 48:40.000
why don't you click on something? And this is not, this is not, I just, I thought-

48:40.000 --> 48:44.800
How soon? Is this an hour after we're talking? No, this is right before I came to the show.

48:44.800 --> 48:49.280
Because I was like, I went to my email and I was like, what's going on? All right, I got to deal

48:49.280 --> 48:52.560
with that. I got to deal with that. And then there's, I always get one email from the publicist

48:52.560 --> 48:57.680
that's like, press roundup. And then I'm like, well, all right. And then I'll just see a bunch of

48:57.680 --> 49:02.720
headlines. And I was like, oh, I, the show won an Emmy. So like some extra big email, it's all

49:02.720 --> 49:08.880
hyperlinked. They go like, well, top, top one is AV club. And it says Pickle Rick won a fucking Emmy.

49:08.880 --> 49:14.000
You know, it's like, which, which is more than just like reporting. And I just felt, I'm like,

49:14.000 --> 49:19.120
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna look at it, see what the AV club take is. That's such a long relationship

49:19.120 --> 49:24.480
with, with them as a metric of television culture and whatnot. Like, let's just read the paragraph

49:24.480 --> 49:28.720
there. And it was like, you know, faithful reporting of the fact and whatever. And then I'm like,

49:28.720 --> 49:32.960
God damn it, there's the, there's the comment section. And you can just see the top of one. And

49:32.960 --> 49:38.080
they have like this interface where you can, you have to click to unclog, like all of it. And I,

49:38.080 --> 49:43.840
sure enough, I fucking did. And I just saw this exchange. And this is not, this is not about me.

49:43.840 --> 49:50.000
Not about you. I thought this was nothing to do with you. This is not, this is not, it's

49:50.000 --> 49:55.680
everything about me. But it's not, it's not me going, you should feel sorry for me because

49:55.680 --> 50:01.520
they're like, that's not what I'm doing. I'm like, I just think this is more like me kind of, in my

50:01.520 --> 50:07.520
mind, this is me dancing on the graves of my enemies. Because my enemies are humanity at this

50:07.520 --> 50:13.600
point. Okay. So it's like, this is, there's a, the top, there's a comment that starts it as this guy

50:13.600 --> 50:22.800
says, is that Harmon's first Emmy? Hot take. I like Dan Harmon. Not just his shows. I root for

50:22.800 --> 50:30.480
the guy. Yeah, he slips up and acts like a drunken asshole sometimes. He will admit to that and

50:30.480 --> 50:36.720
apologize for it and try to learn from it. Harmontown is going strong, 300 episodes in,

50:36.720 --> 50:43.440
well-deserved Emmy win. That could be any of us. It's a weird, weird way to express it and like,

50:43.440 --> 50:48.480
but we're not going to nitpick any of that. Then the replies to that. Because now we've

50:48.480 --> 50:53.920
started a conversation. Let's have it. I mean, hey, let's talk about this. This is what

50:53.920 --> 50:59.360
the response goes, if he keeps slipping up, then he isn't really, all right, you know what, why

50:59.360 --> 51:03.920
am I, why am I making this guy have a funny voice? Please do. Let me, sorry. I like the voice.

51:03.920 --> 51:08.480
Let me make this guy James Brolin and let me just like, all right, let's keep him a funny voice.

51:08.480 --> 51:13.360
Fuck this dude. James Brolin's good though. If he keeps slipping up, then he isn't really learning

51:13.360 --> 51:22.320
from it, is he? Apologizing is easy. Fixing your shit is the hard part, says pimp hand of Cisco.

51:22.320 --> 51:34.800
Yeah. Yeah. And then a person responds to them. Yes. And says, yeah, this person's responding

51:34.800 --> 51:42.800
and they agree. Someone saw that and was like, yeah, I better get in there because same-z's.

51:42.800 --> 51:52.480
Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes he strikes me as one of those, just do it and apologize if you get

51:52.480 --> 52:00.480
caught type of guys. And he's just getting better at apologizing. What I think Schrab meant about

52:00.480 --> 52:06.160
society's worst nightmare. What if this famous person is in an endless cycle of headlines we're

52:06.160 --> 52:12.080
reading? What if he just keeps doing things we don't like and then saying he's sorry we didn't

52:12.080 --> 52:21.680
like them? Oh my God, someone get a message to this guy before he wastes his life. Well, obviously

52:21.680 --> 52:29.600
it's a joke more for me than you, I guess. I just thought, I guess I'm the only person that

52:29.600 --> 52:33.600
understands what I'm talking about. I think there's a lot there. Yeah. It's a lot to unpack.

52:33.600 --> 52:42.880
Right. Sort of. Sort of. I just, can you, I'm just like, okay. You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, he strikes

52:42.880 --> 52:55.280
me as, stop right there. Who types that? He strikes me as I'm a human being. I strike you as nothing,

52:55.280 --> 53:03.040
you don't know me. He strikes me as, he strikes me as a famous person is what he strikes you as.

53:03.040 --> 53:09.200
That's how he's designed to strike you. That's how he will strike you because he's not your uncle

53:09.200 --> 53:13.840
and he's not your babysitter and he's not your mailman. So he strikes you as a famous person.

53:13.840 --> 53:21.040
No, no, no, no. He strikes me as, he strikes me as the kind of guy. There's a lot of different kinds

53:21.040 --> 53:27.680
of guys. Let me get this straight. I'm going to go, hold on, Mr. Whiskers. Let me good little kitty.

53:27.680 --> 53:35.200
You love it. This is the city of walking and calling is an outstanding parking ticket.

53:38.240 --> 53:46.160
Your mother still needs that kidney. Anyways, God damn it's fucking distractions. Dan Harmon strikes

53:46.160 --> 53:56.400
me as the kind of guy. I think he's just going to keep on doing things wrong. And then he just

53:56.400 --> 54:02.160
is going to keep on apologizing for them. And I for one, I want no part of it. I don't want

54:02.160 --> 54:08.960
any more part of it. I am closing my laptop, but I'm going to use ghost fingers to check in

54:09.920 --> 54:16.320
and see if he breaks that cycle, because only then will he get the ghost reward that I give to

54:16.320 --> 54:22.640
people who've become perfect. And by perfect, I mean doing nothing and therefore not apologizing

54:22.640 --> 54:33.280
for it. I hate America. But I also, it's not easy to apologize. That sentence sucks.

54:34.480 --> 54:39.520
It's not easy to admit that you make mistakes. It's easy to say my bad, my bad, I'm sorry,

54:39.520 --> 54:57.920
I'm sorry, whatever. Sit your ass down, bro. I'm sorry. See? And then you stopped reading,

54:57.920 --> 55:02.160
I take it. Yes, I did. Good. At least I got that. At least I did. And maybe that's the only kind

55:02.160 --> 55:07.040
of improvement you could hope for. 45 years old, three years from retirement. Okay, I got to the

55:07.040 --> 55:10.960
point where I only have to read three comments down before I'm like, what are you doing? Take a

55:10.960 --> 55:18.320
screenshot and start with your friends. And also that I'm like, yeah. Did you say three years

55:18.320 --> 55:24.960
into retirement? Three years till retirement. Oh, till retirement. Okay. So yeah, like watch me.

55:24.960 --> 55:33.520
What are you going to do? I'm going to play minecraft and I'm going to just sit around the

55:33.520 --> 55:38.960
house and kind of just poke around and you know, I'm going to, I'm just going to sit around and

55:38.960 --> 55:50.080
play minecraft. You can beat his ass. That's the first day of retirement. Okay. All right. This

55:50.080 --> 55:57.520
is a story that'll make you feel better. Okay. So this happened to me on Labor Day. Labor Day. So

55:57.520 --> 56:04.240
it's Labor Day evening. Labor Day is now Labor Night. And I'm going, I'm walking the dog. I'm

56:04.240 --> 56:09.520
walking the dog. I'm walking the dog. I'm walking the dog. The dog starts to, Lonnie's taking a

56:09.520 --> 56:20.160
shit. All of a sudden, car drives, stops in the middle of the road. Woman gets out. She's,

56:20.880 --> 56:26.720
you know, she's like, I don't know, baby, you know, like 50, 55 or whatever. She goes, oh, oh,

56:26.720 --> 56:34.880
oh, oh my goodness. Do you speak Armenian? Speak Armenian. I'm like, no, I do not speak Armenian.

56:35.600 --> 56:41.120
And she goes, she looks like, oh my gosh, is something wrong? Or she's like, my baby fell

56:41.120 --> 56:46.240
out or whatever, you know, she comes over to me. She runs to me and she's holding like what looks

56:46.240 --> 56:53.280
like a gummy bear wrapper. And she's pointing to it. And she's like, why does the sheet like going,

56:53.280 --> 56:57.840
please listen to me, please listen to me. She says, look, look, this is your walking your

56:57.840 --> 57:03.360
dog and the driver stopped. Yeah, and she runs. She leaves her car door open.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.200
Okay, Michael Winslow.

57:09.520 --> 57:15.200
Doors open, car in the middle of the road runs up to me while my dog's shitting. And I'm trying

57:15.200 --> 57:17.640
I'm trying to, you know, split focus,

57:17.640 --> 57:18.480
because I got to watch.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.300
Why are you f-

57:19.300 --> 57:20.140
Nevermind.

57:20.140 --> 57:24.340
Because I got to pick it up and I don't want to step on it.

57:24.340 --> 57:27.480
Okay, so she comes up and she's like,

57:27.480 --> 57:30.680
oh my God, sir, sir, please, please listen to me, please.

57:30.680 --> 57:34.020
Look, look, and speaking, it's a gummy bear rapper

57:34.020 --> 57:37.980
pointing, honey, honey, Costco, it'll grow back,

57:37.980 --> 57:40.060
it'll grow back, it'll grow back.

57:40.060 --> 57:40.900
And I'm like,

57:40.900 --> 57:45.900
please, please, she's trying to give me this rapper at Costco.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.600
Honey, it'll grow back, please, please.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.880
And I'm like, I don't need that, madam, thank you.

57:54.880 --> 57:58.340
And she's like, please, please.

57:58.340 --> 58:03.680
And I start getting pissed, because the pleading

58:03.680 --> 58:08.620
is like, oh my God, please, please, please, please.

58:08.620 --> 58:13.620
The pleading, the, sir, you're pleading right now.

58:14.120 --> 58:17.900
You are so bald, you don't understand.

58:17.900 --> 58:19.520
You got to fix this shit.

58:19.520 --> 58:22.900
I would never fuck you with my uncle's dick.

58:22.900 --> 58:26.660
I can't believe it, that you're walking outside

58:26.660 --> 58:29.840
with this gash across your face.

58:29.840 --> 58:34.340
And I'm getting pissed and I go, I don't need that.

58:34.340 --> 58:37.780
I'm happy with what I look like.

58:37.780 --> 58:41.740
You can take that back to your car, please, please.

58:41.740 --> 58:43.620
And I'm like, I'm not taking it.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.460
I'm not taking it.

58:45.460 --> 58:47.100
I'm not taking it.

58:47.100 --> 58:51.100
And she's like, goes back to her car.

58:51.100 --> 58:56.100
And she's like, still yelling at Costco.

58:56.500 --> 58:58.860
It's in Costco, driving away.

58:59.740 --> 59:02.300
Wait, no, so when she was saying honey,

59:02.300 --> 59:03.980
she was addressing you as honey.

59:03.980 --> 59:04.820
I don't know.

59:04.820 --> 59:05.780
She wasn't telling you to go to Costco

59:05.780 --> 59:07.620
and get honey and rub it on your head.

59:07.620 --> 59:10.380
Because she was trying to give you an advertisement

59:10.380 --> 59:15.140
for either her or her sister's thing at Costco.

59:15.140 --> 59:17.660
I didn't have my glasses on and I would not touch that wrapper.

59:17.660 --> 59:19.940
But it looked like something she picked off

59:19.940 --> 59:22.980
their car floor and looked like a gummy bear wrapper.

59:22.980 --> 59:26.660
And she kept pointing at it saying, honey, later on,

59:26.660 --> 59:29.780
I thought maybe she's calling me honey, like, sweetie,

59:29.780 --> 59:32.540
seriously, we need to talk about your problem at Costco.

59:32.540 --> 59:36.100
I know people that work at Costco who don't work for Costco.

59:36.100 --> 59:41.100
They work within Costco and they have the whole sub industry

59:41.900 --> 59:46.020
of people with little kiosks inside Costco, right?

59:46.020 --> 59:48.180
So they're like, soak your fingernails in this

59:48.180 --> 59:52.420
and like, that lady's head was like,

59:53.420 --> 59:55.500
I think she's like, look, it was like Thanksgiving.

59:55.500 --> 59:58.100
I get to tell Rita, I've been busting my ass for you.

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.740
Like, you know, she's like, I'm fucking,

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.500
like my family's gonna succeed

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.140
because I'm gonna like, I'm gonna push.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:09.380
I was so stunned because the car stopped

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.740
and she flew out.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.260
I'm like, okay, what adventure am I about to go on to?

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.540
Like, is this, like my baby was hit by a truck.

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.620
Could you please take me to the thing?

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.380
You know, I don't even, I'm like,

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.140
and then it slowly turns into this.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.420
You got a serious problem up there, buddy.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.460
The crazy thing is, how long has she lived in LA?

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.260
Has she ever seen a bald LAPD officer?

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.420
And if so, why is she alive?

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.500
If she jumps out of cars and charges people

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.980
with an unknown object in her hand saying,

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:45.740
like, I mean, she like, statistically should be done.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.620
Now this is not necessarily like,

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.060
it's more of a tag than anything.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.580
But, and then I go home and I ordered pizza

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.460
and I get back in and I'm like, I don't need to,

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.460
gotta be bare on my, I'm all pissed off.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.380
And I'm, you know, like, this isn't fair.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.340
People shouldn't talk to other people like that.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.020
That's like, and then ding dong, the pizza's here.

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.780
I go downstairs now.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.620
I don't know if this is related at all

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.220
or whether it was a weird night, whatever.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.140
But the pizza place that I order from,

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.780
it's always the same guy that delivers the pizza.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.420
And he's an Armenian guy and he's like, oh, pizza boy,

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.180
pizza boy, pizza boy, good, oh, good, hot, delicious.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.180
And he's bald, you know, he's like me, you know,

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.020
shaved hair, you know, this time I go down

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.860
and he's wearing a wig

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:45.340
and sunglasses and I, I, you know, walk down there

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:50.260
and I looked at it and I smiled thinking like,

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.220
oh, this is Labor Day, he's gonna be dressing up

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.340
like Bruce Lee or something.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.940
It's Burt Reynolds, it's a Burt Reynolds party,

01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.100
he's going to.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.980
And I was like, and I'm smiling and I'm nodding going,

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.740
ah, I'm getting closer and closer.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.740
That's not a Halloween wig.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.220
That's a real two-pay wig.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:15.220
And I was just like, I had to hold the face.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.820
All right.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.860
Because if I dropped it, you could tell it's not real.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.900
And that in combination with the encounter with that woman

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.460
like made you feel like Jesus Christ.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.060
All Armenians hate bald people.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.460
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.660
He was like, my wife, see you walking,

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.740
try to give you stuff that work for me, look head of hair.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.260
Well, I told you about, I had an Armenian doctor

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.820
that, you know, when I had my ass problem.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.100
Man, don't get us in trouble with the Kardashians

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.100
and this motherfucker.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.300
You know, and then he, he one point said,

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.060
oh, you need, you need hair plugs.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.140
And I was like, I don't think so.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.380
I don't, I don't need them.

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.020
And he goes, he goes, here, let me give you some advice.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.980
Eat what you want to feel good for you.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.660
Look how everybody else wants you to look.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.380
And I went, that is the worst advice I've ever heard.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.220
I'm never coming back.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.740
I think Woodsy Owl said that.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.580
Didn't he?

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.220
There's our Captain Planet, I think we said that.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.780
Put that on a T-shirt.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.660
I was like, get the fuck out of here.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.060
Get the fuck out of your own.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.780
It's a Billy Crystal character.

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.620
Yeah.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:25.940
I was like, what the hell are you talking about?

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.540
Your lungs are so healthy, but so fat.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.660
Yeah.

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:30.500
So fat.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.940
People just like having stuff to talk about, I think.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.900
And it's like, oh yeah, you're bald.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.180
Let's talk about that.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.140
Yeah.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.980
You just think when you're bald, you forget.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:42.820
Yeah.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:43.660
You forget.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.100
You forget until somebody goes,

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.860
dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.700
Right.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.540
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.940
What you're forgetting is the thing that you should forget,

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:56.700
which it's like, not to bald-splain to you, but it's like,

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:01.220
it's like, what you're being reminded of

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.700
is that you're being, that it's their perception.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.220
It's only their opinion of you.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.220
It's nothing to do.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.140
I mean, I know this is all a big didoi,

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.740
but it's, you know, this last couple of years has been.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.940
I mean, for you, I've known you since college,

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.380
and you were, you started losing your hair in college.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.740
And as long as I've known you, I've always been like,

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:28.420
oh, I have this friend who has this different take on,

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.620
like, you know, it's like, we have these opinions about hair

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.500
loss and all this stuff, and we know they're all

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:41.100
unconscious and all this stuff, but now I'm thinning and back,

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.220
and I'm like, I've got my hymns, my forehims.

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.580
Forehims.com.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.820
Forehims.com, like kit, because they're a sponsor sometimes.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.740
I don't support those guys.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.220
Hey, come on, man.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.340
That's not snake oil.

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.740
They're real prescriptions that a real doctor prescribes.

01:04:55.740 --> 01:05:00.540
Hey, hymns, hymns, if you're listening to me, you know,

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.900
all right, give it to me.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.420
Grow my hair back.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.940
Grow my hair back.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.900
Grow my hair back.

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.740
If you grow my hair back, I'll give you $5 million.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.620
What?

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.580
For hair?

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.140
White people.

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:19.260
Cry row therapeutic sessions in minutes.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.100
It's crazy, the things that we say to each other

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:27.260
and say to ourselves, it's like, I'm not, I'm just like,

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.140
I kind of, just because of the age we're living in now,

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.660
where everybody's getting in trouble for everything,

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.180
which you could just cynically go like, I've had it,

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:39.900
I have had it, but also, it also just makes me think about

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.180
everything that's said and everything we're saying

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.540
to each other and all that stuff, but it's like,

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.860
even my own body, the things that I tell myself

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.820
when I look in the mirror, let alone like, just like,

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:56.780
yeah, it's weird, like, I don't know,

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.980
why am I trying to act like that's a big point that I'm

01:05:58.980 --> 01:05:59.460
making?

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:00.020
It is weird.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.140
Is this a new shirt?

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.660
Is this shirt new?

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.940
It's probably old.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.860
I'm probably, I'm going through the closet and I'm like,

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:14.500
I have had guys maybe back me up, guys with fluctuating weight,

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.860
you get a shirt where the buttons are popping,

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.740
and you don't put it in the Goodwill bag right away.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.900
Not if you're fluctuating weight, like, you take it

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.220
and you look at it and you go, I'll be back, motherfucker.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.340
And then slowly over the years, because you keep getting

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.220
fatter, your weight fluctuates, but you keep getting fatter.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:38.220
So if you're lucky enough to have a big enough closet,

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.860
like, you start to, the overall effect

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:44.300
is a large library of shirts that never fit you

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.220
for various reasons.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:50.860
And it, every morning, I have like a 10-minute pad

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.900
that I have to give myself, because I'm like going through

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.380
and going, oh yeah, what's your name?

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.340
When did we meet last?

01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:00.180
All right, Paul, time to take another ride around the fucking

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:00.460
block.

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.940
And then I'm like, OK, still won't work, that's fine.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.820
Put it back.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.220
I'll also just, like, I'll throw them, like, angrily.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.620
Like, so then the, like, they go through the wash

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.180
and probably get smaller, but.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.660
I think I assume this is one of those,

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:21.460
or maybe it's a well-bought, well, Bomfell shirt

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.300
from Bomfell.com.

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.500
Hey, kids, do you want a box of shit to,

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.780
you know what I heard in a podcast?

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:33.060
I, like, well, yeah, here's a generic ad that,

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.140
if you want to personalize ad for your company.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:40.140
Hey, if you like this show, then you know, like me,

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:44.540
what it's like to not have a box of shit delivered to your house.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:50.220
The people at boxofshit.com believe that shit should come

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:54.380
in boxes to your house, whereas they used to not be able to,

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.420
because the fucking infrastructure's changed.

01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.180
So, like, look, we're here today, we might be gone tomorrow,

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.660
we don't know, it's all up to you.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.260
We go to fucking Harmontown, there's a limited offer

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.900
for our listeners, go to boxofshit's gonna come to your house.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.580
And some of the shit's just like, we're like,

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.620
oh my God, of course, thank God.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.220
Like, and we don't know, you got a sprinkle box

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.300
of shit companies over the top of everything

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.900
and see what takes.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.100
That's right.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.340
Like, box of cat toys didn't work.

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.980
We, like, look, maybe my cat hasn't been special this month,

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:28.140
I don't want to give it another fucking box of toys,

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.260
fuck you.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.180
Yeah, the beer of the month box.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.260
You know, Warby Parker and people are like,

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.500
you know what fucking sucks, it's like shopping for glasses

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:38.660
or whatever, yeah, you gotta test it all.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.060
Maybe your toothbrush, I don't know, maybe your foot.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.980
I, hey, want a new foot?

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.860
Hey, it's me, your foot.

01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:45.780
You want to go to the store for your foot?

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:48.540
There's a boxoffoot.com comes to your house.

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.380
You get a foot, whatever, there's a left foot

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.580
or a right foot, you go to your door,

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.420
there's always a foot.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.740
You have a subscription to a foot,

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.780
you can rate it, subscribe to it, you can like it,

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.180
like a, put your foot on YouTube,

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.900
share it with your friends again, with a slender man,

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.780
you can eat your foot, you can tell it to a horror movie

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.540
a week or like a Hannibal Lecter-esque character

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.060
or walk you through which foot you should have.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.900
The, what was I gonna say?

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.660
I forgot, the, I was listening to a podcast,

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:16.700
it was my first, I was like, that's irresponsible.

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.580
Like, cause we're in this Wild West

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.340
with podcast advertising and there's this true crime thing

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.660
I was listening to.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.180
I think it was, it's,

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.940
I think it was a popular one,

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.460
Dr. Death, are you guys listening to Dr. Death?

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.300
No?

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.140
Okay.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.220
Well, I thought, then good, then I'm Prometheus,

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.660
listen to it.

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:39.620
I think it's only three episodes in, it's like a Syria,

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.020
it's one of those things, it's like very, like dirty John,

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.860
he was listening to dirty John.

01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.220
It's like just sort of a, they break up like a very curious-

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.260
Oh man, check that out, dirty John?

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.820
Yeah, listen to dirty John, holy shit.

01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:51.220
Into a bunch of episodes and this guy was like doctor,

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.140
who's not, he's not necessarily just a sociopath

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.300
who pretended to be a doctor,

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.300
but then again, he was never a good doctor,

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.380
but he just kind of bluffed his way

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.340
through the medical system and was like gouging out

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.460
people's spines and like, very interesting.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.060
And like early on in the podcast, the guy goes like,

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.380
and then his, and then he gouged out the spine

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.020
and then the person's leg turned blue

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.660
and then they had a stroke and now they're dead

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.900
and it's like, if you, and then he's paused,

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.660
there's this pause and then the same voice says,

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.980
this podcast may be making you feel very uncomfortable.

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:30.900
But nothing is more comfortable than a good pair of socks.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.460
It was basically that, and I was like,

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:39.460
I was aroused from my bed, I was like, Cody, that's wrong.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.060
That's not right.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:48.060
Like they actually found, like in a world where no one cares,

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.980
like there's something fundamentally wrong about that.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.940
I can't, like where you're like,

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.820
it's back to the 30s or something

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:57.500
where you're just like, you can just now get really like,

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.500
hey, like this podcast is going to offend you

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:07.540
or it's gonna raise your awareness of the civil rights era

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.820
as we go back in time to the 1960s.

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.940
But you know what, it'll take you back in time

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.220
more as like a Reese's kiss.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.940
That's fine, right?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.940
Cause it's like, who cares?

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.500
It's just like a segue.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.500
But why was I offended by the socks making you comfortable?

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.740
Oh, it was because like, what if he said,

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.620
cause there's that podcast advertiser

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.020
that's like the real time shrinky dink,

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.780
like you can like call a number and have a shrink,

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.420
you know, it's like feelfine.org or whatever.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.980
Like you can, it's like, you know, clear, clear,

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.540
clear, clear, fun talk, like talk to somebody.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.740
It's like, don't kill yourself, like talk to this thing.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.060
And true crime podcast will advertise it.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.260
But like, what if he used that say,

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.500
is like, this is going to make you uncomfortable

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.300
talking about this guy gouging out spines

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.300
cause he's not a good doctor.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.060
And like, hey, maybe you'll be next.

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.660
If that upsets you, you should call this company

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:06.660
that profits every time you're freaked out

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.060
and you call the number.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.820
I guess that's what I was thinking is like,

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.180
like that's what triggered me in me.

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.340
It was like, you can't make people uncomfortable

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.340
and then tell them that socks will help.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.540
It hasn't worked that way in years.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.460
That's dangerous.

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.300
That's like a-

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.500
It's like a hamster wheel of necessity.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.020
You can't, yeah, you can't be like,

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.420
if you're listening to this podcast,

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.540
you might, you currently might be afraid

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.420
of leaving your home.

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.100
You should buy a new television.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.380
Okay, I guess that's what we do.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.220
It's fucked up.

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.580
That's exactly what they do though.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.420
That's why you see Taco Bell commercials

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.700
at like one o'clock in the morning

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.180
telling you that you should combo meal their shit

01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.300
cause they know your stuff.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.140
Yeah, I know that.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.220
So why did I, so what was it about the sock thing?

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.060
I guess it was because-

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.900
You liked that segue.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.420
It was because podcasting for me is like a little bit.

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.060
It's both sacred and unsacred.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:53.900
It's sort of like,

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.380
I feel like Al Swearingen looking at his window

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.380
in Deadwood going like,

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.020
God damn, telephone wires, suck my dick.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.020
You know, like,

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.100
I'm gonna stab a Indian in the stomach

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:02.940
cause I have-

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.420
Like, and I'm just like,

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.380
all the fucking senators here, fuck it.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.500
I'm gonna fuck everybody.

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.820
Also, there's gotta be a little bit of love

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.860
for something that's kind of hard to do.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.900
So maybe there's a little bit of admiration in there

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.980
cause it's a corny segue,

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.220
but that motherfucker went for it.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.620
I always thought the podcast business

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.020
was gonna go like,

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.500
okay, everybody spread out

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.180
and say whatever the fuck you can think to say

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.620
to make people listen to you.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.860
And then after we do that for a while,

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:32.620
let's slowly coalesce into networks

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.140
and then let's have those networks

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.980
engage in collective bargaining

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:41.460
with a newly subjugated corporate clientele.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.620
Boy, was I wrong.

01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.500
So, yeah.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.460
What is it instead?

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.300
I don't know.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.140
I wanna describe it.

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:47.980
Is this advertisers?

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.820
Yeah, it's just like,

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.860
it was just more like somebody else

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:52.300
thought that was like me,

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.780
but instead of a guy that likes to talk into a microphone,

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.180
that person loves advertising

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.260
and was like, hey, I'll tell you what, why don't we?

01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.180
I belong to this agency,

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.180
that there's like agencies rounding up

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.100
the corporate clientele that are willing

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.940
to advertise on podcasts,

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.020
which are more high risk for them PR-wise maybe.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.740
You know, it's a Wild West kind of thing.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.100
So you notice the kind of clientele you're getting.

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.100
It's like, it's the kind that your brain goes,

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.260
oh, yeah, they don't risk anything.

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.740
Like Snickers isn't advertising during podcasts yet.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.180
And yeah, so it's like somebody went around

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.340
and gathered all those people up into families

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.900
and then they collectively bargained.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.660
Like, hey, what the fuck's your podcast about?

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.620
What, you fucking getting high and watching movies?

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.940
Yes, so is everybody's.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.700
Come on, what do you got for us?

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.740
Well, I promise I'll tell everybody

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.780
I'll wear your socks for a dollar.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.460
I don't want it to go that way.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.780
There's something worse than just podcast advertising

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.420
about like true crime podcast advertising though,

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:55.260
isn't there?

01:14:55.260 --> 01:15:00.260
It's like, and then like her blood was spread like everywhere

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.780
and no one could find most of it.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:06.660
Also, tied gum, it's gum now.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.500
It's gum now.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.340
Tied gum?

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.300
It's gum now.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.140
It's gum now.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.700
Friends and clean their shirt.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:17.180
Yeah, should have told you that last week.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.980
Your clothes get cleaner as you wear them.

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.420
It's gum now.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.420
It just seems gruesome to be all like,

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:28.420
yeah, man, fucking buy this because all these people died.

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.260
Have you guys heard the thing?

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.100
Have you guys heard the thing?

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.300
The body was wrapped in a soft blanket from Downey.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.220
Is that what we're worried about?

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.900
If he was using the gravity blanket.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.900
There was a pretty fun sophisticated like,

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.740
oh, first people to do it in a comprehensive way,

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.300
like podcast spoof that was like a,

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:48.060
it was a spoof of the podcast that I poked a little fun of

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.660
on here a while back about the,

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.140
and I was like done disappeared or gone up and vanished.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.220
What podcast?

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.740
Up and vanished, I think is the real one, right?

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.620
And then someone did a spoof of up and vanished

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:04.020
that I think was called done disappeared.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.420
And if you haven't heard it, it's really funny.

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:12.340
And it's also like sociologically edifying

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.380
because you're like,

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.260
you're living in the beginning of a new medium.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.220
And this is like one of the first like actual

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:23.180
like kind of yank of vikings like of another.

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.780
It's like, oh, this popular podcast.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.100
And then someone not only just sat there like me

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.140
and went like, you heard this one guy

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.540
needs to get a fucking haircut.

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.260
You know, somebody, somebody like dug in

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.460
and like did a spoof.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.260
And I'm fascinated by that stuff too,

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.820
is we're watching it evolve.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.740
Why do I have to try to take the fun out of everything?

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.260
I remember when I was like in my twenties,

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.540
like I got high with you and Sean McKenna

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.540
and we were talking about something.

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.740
And then like, you guys were talking about like songs

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.580
or something.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:52.860
And then I was like, yeah, it's funny

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.460
because you listened to a first song with then you listen

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.460
and they talked for a while.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.380
And then it was a big pause.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.300
And then you and Sean both went like,

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.660
oh, is that how we enjoy things?

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.340
Thanks.

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.420
We said that in unison.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:08.980
You both went like, you both, you both, you both.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.900
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.260
Well, I mean, worse than that, I was like, I was.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.300
Is it possible that Sean just said that?

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.140
No, it's not.

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:16.980
And I was just sitting next to him.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.820
You're getting me wrong.

01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:19.700
I know, I was being, no, that's exactly why.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.380
I don't remember this story.

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.380
Because it was so important.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.220
Caring.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.460
It was so, you guys both looked at each other

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.900
and both had the same thought

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:32.340
and didn't even need to conspire about it.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.620
That's, and I was like, you know, the old saying

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.740
if somebody calls you a horse's ass,

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.860
maybe they're a horse's ass.

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.260
If two people call you a horse's ass,

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.100
maybe get a saddle or whatever it goes.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.660
Like, it was like, you guys were both like,

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.820
I just finished explaining.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.860
I was just like, I'm always explaining everything.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.940
I'm a fucking explainaholic.

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:52.940
Or, yeah.

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.780
Yeah, no, that's it.

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.620
That was the worst.

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.580
But with booze.

01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.420
Can I ask?

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.740
It's a Simpsons joke.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.700
That's what I was gonna ask you.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.540
That's so hilarious.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.820
Is you beat in quotes.

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:05.940
Oh my God, we beat the Simpsons!

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.460
We beat the Simpsons.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.900
And you beat South Park.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.260
And you beat South Park.

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.100
Yeah.

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.860
And that's pretty fucking amazing.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.340
How does that feel?

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:15.180
How does that feel?

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.660
It feels, like, there's no, right, right.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.500
Does that feel, huh?

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.180
That's a happy for once.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.300
Humbling.

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.140
Humbling.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:23.980
There we go.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:24.900
Really?

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:25.740
Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:26.580
Fuck God, no, no, no, really?

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.420
Deliver me.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.500
Does it feel, cause it feels badass.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.460
It does feel a little badass.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:31.780
It feels badass.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:35.140
What I'm impressed, those guys, those colleagues,

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.380
like they come up to you, you're all at the same party,

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.180
you know, and it's like, it is, it really is like,

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.580
I, you know, you get jaded and you go,

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:45.340
oh, you know, you're never gonna win this fucking thing.

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.500
Cause it's like, and you, you,

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:47.580
Cause it's huge competition.

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.100
And then there's always like people,

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.740
that's all we, it's all we talk about.

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.740
Did you give it a speech?

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.700
No, you get 30 seconds, Justin.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.540
Where did Justin go?

01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.740
I want to thank everyone.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:00.300
Thank you very much.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.940
Thank you for this award for Rick and Morty Morty.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.260
Oh my God, thank you.

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.380
Oh my God.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.060
Thank you for this Emmy.

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:08.180
This Emmy is great.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.060
Thank you for the Emmy, Emmy.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.060
Thank you.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.140
Thank you.

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.260
Thank you.

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.340
Thank you.

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.340
Thank you.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.500
Thank you.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.860
Drag them off.

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.700
Thank you.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.220
We're playing a new score.

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.060
I don't know.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.300
Justin went from saying whatever he said

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.540
to as we're all walking off.

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.180
It's like, I did it wrong.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.340
I did it wrong.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.380
I did it wrong.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.540
I was like, Justin, no one up here heard you.

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.260
We're all freaking the fuck out.

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:34.780
Yeah.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.700
Like no one heard.

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.780
And we'll never know.

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:41.260
Because who in that 11 people that were up there

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.100
is ever going to like, I think I'll find out what he said.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.980
We're the only ones that will never know and don't care.

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:49.140
It's not aired.

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.660
Yeah, I think they're going to edit them together.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:55.180
They'll do like a little shmemy roundup on FXX.

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:58.620
Was there anybody cool there that you got to meet,

01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.900
that you were sort of like?

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.380
Molly Shannon was a presenter.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.100
And she was right in the front row.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.660
And she was like, as I was like coming back from,

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.140
you do this whole conveyor belt when you, if you win one,

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:11.460
and then you, and then you like, at strategic points,

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.380
they open the doors and let you back into your seats.

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.700
And I was crossing.

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:18.140
And Molly Shannon was like, I made eye contact with her.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.220
And she was really sweet and nice.

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:26.620
And I think you're asking what I'm answering,

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:29.100
which is like, did you have any encounters with famous people

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:29.780
that you?

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:31.020
Just the ones you like.

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.940
Just like if there were any moments where you're like,

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.380
holy shit, I was talking to George R. R. Miley.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.940
I mean, I saw, you know, they did this big Star Trek thing.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.460
So LeVar Burton's up there.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.820
And I'm like, I'm going to fucking mad dog.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:43.300
I'm going to tell you, you know,

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.220
like I'm going to make eye contact with this guy.

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.540
Because I was like right in the wings,

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.220
I was coming back to the thing.

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.380
And I was like, and I just looked at LeVar Burton

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.300
and waited for him to look at me as I walked past.

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:54.940
I was like, he's not like, he didn't look.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:57.300
And I was like, well, he's blind, isn't he?

01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.020
Did he have his?

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.140
Right, he's blind.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.460
He didn't have his thing on.

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.180
But I thought it'd be so funny.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.140
Like, how amazing.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.540
It was a low risk, high yield thing.

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.580
Because I was like, I'm going to totally mad dog LeVar Burton.

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:12.940
And on the off chance that he like looks and see,

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.300
because he peripherally like experiences like this,

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.060
like who's staring at me?

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.380
And then like, what if he had like, while he's on stage,

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.940
gone like, hey.

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:25.540
And then like, I had this fantasy in my head of like,

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:27.820
and then people would be like, what the fuck's going on over there?

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.340
Like, why is LeVar Burton like crouching down

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.660
and hugging somebody?

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.460
Who's that?

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.500
Oh, that guy's got an Emmy.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.980
That's Dan Harmon.

01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:39.020
What mountains can't he climb?

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:39.860
He's already got an Emmy.

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.220
Why is he like, well, LeVar Burton was like,

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.700
Jesus, I got to look this guy up.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.100
Oh, he's a pedophile.

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.260
God damn it.

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.340
Well, I didn't know that.

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.940
God damn it, we were on such a great run.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.900
And he just fucked it up.

01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:58.900
Can you explain what is the LeVar Burton thing?

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.140
Oh, well, he was at your podium for a while ago.

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:06.420
Jeff was on an extended like tour.

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.620
And we were on the road.

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:13.460
We did like a fun like string of guest comptrollers, Gilbert

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:17.820
Godfrey, and there was some really fun.

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.220
And LeVar Burton was one of them.

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:20.980
Holy shit.

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.380
It was great.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.300
So even with him.

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.420
I was married to Erin McGathy yet.

01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.060
And he was like, in that podcast, he's like,

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.260
I'm coming to your wedding.

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:32.260
I think we're just shit-faced.

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:36.100
So you still feel a little shy to go over to LeVar Burton?

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:39.500
Well, he never came to my wedding.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.180
So then I'm like, all right, are we beefing?

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.660
What if he googled me after that night?

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.140
All right, I'm coming to your wedding.

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:53.060
Google, oh, I can see through my visor.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.740
This guy's trouble.

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.700
Who would you want to have as a guest comptroller

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.740
if you had any?

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.140
Brandon Johnson.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.500
Like, what do you mean by default?

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.260
Like, if I was about to die?

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.740
You were saying, like, we had a great suite, too sweet,

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:19.380
like none of all these fabulous people on my show

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.420
comptrolling.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.460
It was just so sweet.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.820
I don't know if that was the line reading.

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.980
It was a lot.

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.500
You just made it sound like.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.980
It was LeVar Burton.

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:30.380
Yeah.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.900
He was hosting the show.

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:32.820
I understand that.

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:33.540
I'm saying.

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:34.140
Do you?

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.300
He did reading Rainbow.

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.220
Why do you have a lantern?

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.620
Like, an old, like, train conductor.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.940
It's not even lit.

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.460
It's out of batteries.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:47.860
It's out of batteries.

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.980
It's out.

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.180
OK, great.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.540
That's why you have it there.

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.500
That's why I have it there, to charge.

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.740
All right, lay down and beat.

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.740
Oh, shit.

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:06.600
Yeah.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:18.840
Rhythm 2, the plate rhythm, has a fate, a destiny of time

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.320
gone by.

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.160
I fucked your mama in her eyes.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.600
Didn't mean to, bro.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.440
I fucked a rainbow.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:43.800
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.440
that's the spectrum.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.120
All the colors come in.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:56.120
Rainbow strips of brothers got red talking over it.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.280
Orange saying, yo, orange is like what?

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:05.080
But we try to get along, and recognize

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.320
are the same color all along.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:14.520
Because red can't be red unless it's really dark orange.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.040
And orange eventually has to accept

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.520
that it's kind of a form of red.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.720
That's why it's called the spectrum.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.880
I think, I assume, I don't know.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.240
There's probably actually a definitive delineation

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:36.040
between those colors that are super important scientifically.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.120
But you better prove it.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.280
OK.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.680
Oh, five fingers of death.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.180
Yo.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:52.400
Yo, I ate a sandwich today.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.280
And this is how it went.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.960
Tell them about your sandwich.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.960
I ate so many sandwiches today.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.720
I had to install an extra air vent.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.960
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.160
I got that tempo that lets you rap good.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:22.760
It lets you think about things that rhyme like what?

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.040
Doesn't matter what you do.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.080
I could do my taxes while I say everything.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.280
Well, that's probably going to rhyme with taxes.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.480
Yeah, I'm a slow rapper thinking of the words

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.120
Little Rhyme later.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.680
All right.

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:43.600
I just wanted to give people a segment.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.360
You have to split it just a little bit.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.360
The things that I don't.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.280
New money.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.640
New money.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.880
Like, you know, the definition of our new relationship

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.480
is like, whatever I do for you guys,

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.000
it's not that I resent doing it for you, but it is a favor.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.480
Wow.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.080
Wow.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:07.720
It's not.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.440
It's just a slight.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.960
And look, if it's a deal breaker, I understand.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.440
It would be a deal breaker for me too.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.360
I don't need you.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.120
Can you love someone that doesn't need you?

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.040
Was your relationship reliant on my insecurity?

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.400
I will remain insecure until the day I die.

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.040
Like, I'm going to my EKG or whatever that beepy thing is

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.160
that shows that you're dying.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.680
Like, it's going to go beep.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.680
And I'm going to go, oh, God, I fucked up.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.800
I fucked up so bad.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.240
I fucked up everything.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.160
I'm going to be so insecure.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.680
I'm going to die.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.720
Like, I'm going to go straight to hell

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.440
because it's going to be just the sum of all of the tightness

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.240
that I had and all of the resistance I had to everyone's

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:49.740
love.

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.920
And I'm just going to like forever spiral

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:58.640
into this crazy, like self-created projection of torture.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.560
So don't worry about me getting punished or being humbled

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.400
or figuring out that I did something wrong.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:13.440
I'm sorry that when I say something wrong,

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.440
instead of saying it to three people,

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.000
I say it to 300,000 people.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.280
And therefore, then there's a headline that says,

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.760
DNR, it says something wrong.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.560
And then when I feel bad about it,

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.720
I go, hey, I feel bad about that.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.360
And then it says, DNR, it feels bad about that thing.

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.480
Like, I can understand how you as a person would be like, hmm,

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.760
I think I'll examine who Dan Harmon is.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.280
Oh, he said that.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.480
That's fucked up.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.840
Are you sorry about it?

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.120
Well, that should end that.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:41.620
What?

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.520
He said another thing?

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.000
Well, now he's sorry about that.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.280
Where's this going?

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.040
Life is where it's going.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.640
Life.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.360
I'm alive.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:51.860
Yeah.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.880
I'm alive.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.880
I'm dying.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.400
I'm going to die in front of you.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.920
There's nothing's going to change if that's

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.800
what you want to change.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.520
I'm not going to turn into a cockroach.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.720
I'm not going to slowly turn into a mummy.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.520
I mean, I am.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.720
I am.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.440
But I'm not going to be like, watch me become sting.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.320
He had a publicist.

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.480
It doesn't work the way you think it works

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:24.280
if you're waiting for me to stop being a bad person.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:29.400
That it's like waiting for rain to taste like mint.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.640
It's just it's a great wish, and I back you up on it,

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.080
and it's not going to happen.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.840
And it's your fault for waiting for it.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.800
I know I'm late to the party, but this British baking show

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.120
is fucking great.

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.800
Have you seen the latest season with Noel Fielding?

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.160
It's really good.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:56.560
I sat down episode one and watched it all the way

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.600
through into the end, and I kept eating toast.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.400
That's the one thing is you're talking about advertising.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.120
They don't advertise on Netflix, but if they would clean up,

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.080
if they had bread commercials.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.080
Because I was eating toast all day long.

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:21.880
I was toasting toast, which is weird.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:26.440
You should say toasting bread into toast.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:26.920
OK, anyway.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.600
What is it called?

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.200
What's the?

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.400
British baking show.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.680
It's just called British Bake Off.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.000
It's called the Great British Bake Off.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Great, say again?

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.280
British Bake Off.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.440
Does that suck, I patch nihilist?

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.760
Is that so bad?

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.440
OK.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:49.160
Here's the thing that I noticed right away,

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.160
because I haven't watched a lot of reality television,

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.400
but most of the reality television

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.080
I've watched is American reality TV.

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:02.800
And the thing about the Great British Bake Off show

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.760
is everybody's so nice to each other.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.080
They're helping each other out.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.840
They're just like, oh, you dropped your thing.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.560
Let me hear it.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.240
You can use my fork or whatever you want to use my oven.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.840
They're all helping each other out.

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.840
And even the critique is like, hmm,

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.960
it's a little up-sided, isn't it?

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.880
It's not like, what is this garbage?

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.320
It's like it's very positive.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:30.280
And I think that show would make you happy.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.000
I like the story about that woman costing you at an absolute

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.440
You would have been in fucking hand.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.520
You said this will make you feel better.

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.280
And I forgot to tell you, by the way, that did fucking you.

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.360
That was insane.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.760
Yeah, I've been wanting to tell you for a while

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.560
because I knew it would make you so happy.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:51.000
And I don't think you understand how angry and short I was

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.360
with this woman who was, in her mind, trying to save my life.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.720
And I'm like going, I don't need that.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.640
Get away from me.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:03.840
I was being very angry and curt.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:04.320
Short.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.600
I just kind of endlessly fascinated

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.880
with these cosmetic issues.

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:15.920
That's like a man starts to lose his hair, me.

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.040
And then I go, OK, I'm losing it.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.560
But it's like there's lines between the clinical

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.720
and the cosmetic.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:26.000
And every day we wake up and we go through routines and things

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.080
where we go, well, who I am is not going to work.

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:36.240
And I don't even mean I'm not going all punk rock on you

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.240
and going, oh, why do we wear makeup at all?

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.680
I mean, even people who don't wear makeup,

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.840
you look in the mirror and you have this moment

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.240
where you're like, if there's an eyebrow that's

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.000
shooting out of my head, maybe I would clip it with scissors.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.240
No matter how low maintenance you think you are.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.160
When you get a bald spot that starts to grow in your head,

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:07.120
and it's all just the weirdest thing.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.360
It's this thing that I never see unless there's like,

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.360
I get a haircut and then they show me the mirror thing.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.880
And then I have this like, I go, oh, god,

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.520
is there something I can do about that?

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.920
But I don't even understand why I'm thinking that.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.160
Cody doesn't express anything like, oh, boy,

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.240
can you do something?

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.560
She's more aware than I am.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.920
She's seeing in the back of my head

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.760
along with the rest of everybody more than I am.

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.480
And then you just say, OK, so every day

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.400
with the tweezing and everything,

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:43.000
like we're like, oh, god, I don't know, sorry.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:43.800
It's new.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.040
It's a crazy thing.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.960
It's not new, but I'm new to it, I think.

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:52.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.840
My bald friend, I can't talk about my relationship

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.400
with baldness in front of my bald friend.

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.240
I know, I get it.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.240
Yeah, didn't start losing your hand.

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.440
You can't give me a bald pass.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:07.960
That must have really interfered with your dating life.

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.320
You really probably didn't?

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.800
It's not dating life.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.680
I have a girl I would spend the rest of my life with.

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.200
It's about the I don't understand

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.160
why we have feelings about our scalps.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.560
It scares us to think maybe that's

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.520
what's going on inside, too, a little bit.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.120
I think it scares us to go, well, we're falling apart.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.280
We're decaying in front of the mirror.

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.240
That's what happened.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.160
But what if your culture said that when

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.720
you can start to see a man's scalp,

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.920
that that was called the hardening or something?

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.600
Culture could easily, look at the fucked-up periscopes

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.080
we create for everything.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.080
What does that mean?

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.280
But we're like, oh, shit, time is passing.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.200
That's what that means.

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.600
It means you're not 25, for sure.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.160
No matter how much you've been passing.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.240
Or 22.

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.800
Yes, god damn it, I can't talk about this around you.

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:00.560
I get it.

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.400
No, you can't.

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.680
You're just like a guy that's playing uno

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.000
and you have all reverse cards.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:04.840
Like, I don't know.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.680
Oh, damn.

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.480
It's still a topic I'm allowed to have in my head,

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.200
just because someone's balder.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.080
That doesn't mean I can't talk about it.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:19.440
I didn't say you should stop talking about this horrible problem.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.560
I should pay the ghost, pay the ghost,

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.320
to put it in Nicholas Cage terms.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:24.760
Pay the ghost.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.000
Pay the ghost.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.160
The classic Nicholas Cage movie, Pay the Ghost.

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.280
You're telling me you haven't seen Pay the Ghost?

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.760
I haven't seen Pay the Ghost.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.600
Oh my god.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.400
With Andre Brower.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.120
He said something.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.080
He said something.

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.320
He said, pay the ghost.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.640
Pay the ghost.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.280
Pay the ghost.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280
Yeah, pay the ghost.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.040
It's one of the eight Nicholas Cage movies.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.800
Nicholas Cage in a box is a service

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.760
that can come to your door.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:55.760
You can, the only way to keep up with all of the movies

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.840
Nicholas Cage does every day.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:58.680
In a cage.

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.800
It's the Nick Cage.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.560
It's the Nick Cage.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.560
It comes in a hand cage.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.240
It comes in a box.

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:03.760
Let me out.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.400
Let me out.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.400
It comes with a separate package of bees

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.160
that you activate them with.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:11.640
What's that?

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.200
What's that?

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.480
What is that?

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.360
Did you know that they edit the bees out of the wicker

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.000
man in the regular cut, like the vanilla cut

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.280
that you get on Apple TV?

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.800
Because Cody hadn't seen it.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.040
I'm like, we got to watch Wicker Man.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.920
And no fucking bees.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.400
What?

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.520
So they went to the screening.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.680
And people were like, holy shit.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.880
Right.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.760
Oh, no, not the bees.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.440
Fucking hashtag.com.org.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.520
italics.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.440
Holy fucking trending shit.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.960
Oh, no, not the bees.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.560
And they're like, god damn it.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.520
They're making fun of our movie.

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.920
That's the only reason why it's not Citizen Kane.

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.680
We got to take a little show them.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.720
We'll just take that out.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.160
Thanks for telling us how to get stronger, you rubes.

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.120
Now we're the best movie ever.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.760
Come on, don't take the no, not the bees out.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.840
That's bullshit.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.080
Same thing with the Battlefield Earth.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:11.840
Is about to say.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.680
A lot of shit, man.

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.440
There was a lot.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.080
Schrab and I saw that movie in the theater.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:21.080
It was us in the front row and a lot of strange,

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.720
strangely identical group of people in white polo shirts

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720
on the back that were.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.760
They weren't in white polo shirts.

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:28.200
They were dressed like civilians,

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.120
but it was like happening.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.840
A lot of applause over those opening credits.

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:32.960
Do you realize what's happening?

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.800
We're the only three people in this movie,

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.760
and the back two rows are the Church of Scientology,

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.520
who have been assigned to come see this movie.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.320
And they're like, because we picked up on it

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.160
after a while because like, like, John Travolta would say something

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.720
and we'd laugh.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.400
The three of us are like, ha, ha, ha.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.200
And there's no silence in the back.

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.840
And then John Travolta would say something

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.880
that they'd laugh.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.160
And we're like, well, that wasn't funny.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.240
Yeah, that was his character making a joke.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:37:59.960
I agree with that.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.360
But oh, oh, got it.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.240
All right.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.520
Well, when it was based on the book by L. Ron Humbert,

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.920
and they were all applauding in the back, we were like, ooh.

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.400
But in that movie, there was so much more.

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.240
There was a bunch of crazy shit.

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.520
We watched it, and we were telling everybody about it

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.320
because there were no hashtags back then.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.920
We were just like going into strangers.

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.480
You had to go and hashtag each person back then.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.920
You had to say, hashtag Paul, hashtag Mary, hashtag Sebastian.

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.440
You had to like, every single person, you had to just text them

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.600
and be like, hey, here's the thing I'd like you to be talking about.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.200
What is that hashtag?

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.680
And we were like, yeah.

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.800
But they were like, yeah.

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.520
And then they, like, I bought it on DVD and the scenes were gone.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.640
Yeah, same with the bees.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.600
You can only see the bees.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.680
What was the scene?

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.480
What did Cheville have to say?

01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:01.920
He was like, you said you wouldn't make it appear.

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.680
And it did appear or whatever.

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.720
Yeah, I can't remember.

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.360
I don't want to.

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:07.960
It won't work.

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.720
Were the Scientologists just enjoying the film,

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.800
or was their job to make the film seem better reacted to

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.720
as an audience than it actually was?

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.480
I don't think they thought it through past.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.880
Let's just make sure there's always at least two rows

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.680
of Scientology people.

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.800
Yeah, no, that's what I mean.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.400
Yeah, and so they didn't anticipate it in theater,

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.480
and then two rows of people.

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:34.840
So they didn't have their flow chart stopped there.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:41.680
It wasn't like, if you're the only two rows, don't laugh at every joke,

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.080
because it'll seem weird to everyone, but you.

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.520
Also, please don't sneak out of the Church of Scientology

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.760
in this movie.

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.080
Yeah, don't take this opportunity,

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.320
just because it's a dark room doesn't mean you can go out any door you want.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.920
You will report back to your bus and into your cryo chamber.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.120
Bees were an important part of the Wicker Man.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:08.640
That's it.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.400
That's all I want to say.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.720
The best part of the bees thing is when he goes, wait, what's that?

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.200
What is that?

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.600
What's that buzzing?

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.080
And I said, Cody, the clip, I'm like, this is what you miss.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:24.960
I made you watch the entire Wicker Man,

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.320
because this was supposed to be in there, and it didn't happen.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.040
Here it is.

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.520
I sent it to the YouTube link.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:39.400
Did she, after the credits, were like, Wicker Man, Wicker Man, Wicker Man?

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.120
It's Christmas in the post-pictures.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.240
Don't call it a chair.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.760
It's not something you rock in.

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.320
I've got a thread to the twigs and the spiraling in,

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.920
and I've got a rabbit culture that's a paganistic.

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:54.280
And then Cody was like, I don't understand why you thought it

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.400
was such a bad movie.

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.320
It was really cool.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.400
Yeah, she really dug it.

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.560
I was like, well, you got to see this bee scene.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.720
It's so fucked up.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.320
Yeah, I guess if you would add that, that would be a silly movie.

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.040
But that movie that you watched, the edited film, the vanilla version

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.000
you called it, was great.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.640
That was really good.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.560
That was good.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:21.680
I sent it to the scene, and she said, do you think we didn't see it

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:25.440
because we were fooling around or something like that?

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:28.160
And I thought it was an auto-correct typo.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.680
And I said, are you asking if Nicholas Cage was just

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:34.400
trying to make the crew laugh?

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:39.640
Or are you asking if they were just, in the edit,

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.840
were just having a good time?

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.360
Oh, you mean did we start fucking?

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.200
I thought like, it says it wasn't a typo.

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.680
You were texting her?

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:47.440
Well, because she's sitting next to you?

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:47.960
Well, it was later.

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.360
It was the next day, because I sent her the code.

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.800
I was like, by the way, that movie is what you missed.

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:57.480
So the movie ended, and you just ran to bed and went to sleep.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.440
You didn't like go, this is the thing?

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.320
I said, I said, there's no bees.

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.240
We're here for the bees.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:02.880
There are bees.

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.720
Well, movie's over.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.520
Goodbye.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.920
I'll text you the video.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.840
I'll text you tomorrow.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:12.840
I'm so asleep.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.800
I'm sleeping.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:14.800
I'm sleeping.

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.800
I'm sleeping.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.240
I don't want to see the bees.

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.600
I'm asleep.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.640
I'll race it to tomorrow.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.680
I got there first.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.200
If you were listening to the story,

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.920
the subtext there was that the movie

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:36.720
we didn't make it to the end.

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.600
Because of my active love life.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.360
Oh, OK, sure.

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:44.920
Nice.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:51.640
So you didn't watch until the end of the movie looking at you?

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:52.640
He was burning to death.

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:58.400
And I was probably doing a really good job of fucking it.

01:42:58.400 --> 01:42:58.920
You know?

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.200
I was like, oh, god.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.920
Did you have to hear about how good you eat pussy again?

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.960
I ate it so good.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:08.720
Do we have to sit through another nine-hour dissertation

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.120
when we know how good Dan Harmon eats pussy?

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.160
I've been hearing this story since you were 19.

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.720
Oh, I eat it like a small dick, but I eat pussy.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.240
So fucking good.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.000
Rob Schwab, ladies and gentlemen.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.080
I have no complaints, man.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.360
Worth every penny.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.760
Why they come?

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.480
They keep coming because I eat so much fucking good pussy.

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.560
I'm not going to feel bad about having a small dick.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:41.000
But you eat pussy so good.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.600
I'm sorry you picked up on the fact that I.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.720
I picked up.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.160
You're reminding everybody every five fucking seconds.

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.280
If I got, if I ate pussy again.

01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.000
Dan uses the story so simple.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.440
What did you do Labor Day?

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:58.440
Well, I ate pussy good.

01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.360
That's not true.

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.200
That's not true.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.000
In laws.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.200
That's not true.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.800
The only thing that's true about that

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.520
is that I'm transparent about not having a show.

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:12.560
Or a grower, or a grower frankly.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.480
The truth is you could wait all night.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.960
Like it's not grow, it'll grow.

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:16.880
And then you're like, really?

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.400
Okay, I grow.

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.240
So.

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.960
But the jamming out is I eat the pussy.

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.800
I don't, I don't, I don't.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.760
Like you go home and look it up.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.600
I don't do that.

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.160
Go look it up on the Wikipedia.

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.920
It'll tell you I ate pussy good.

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:34.240
I don't know what else anyone would expect me to be good at

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:35.680
given my situation.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.720
But I, and so I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna be like,

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.200
I'm terrible at eating pussy.

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.520
I don't know.

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:42.760
All right?

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:43.600
That's fair.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.400
But I don't brag about it.

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.480
I'm probably great at it.

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.640
I gotta be great at it.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640
Oh my God.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.480
See?

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.320
This is how you get it.

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.160
I must be.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.720
My dick is so small.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.280
Like I must be amazing.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.400
Like look at the women that have stayed with me

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.840
for more than a year.

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.200
Like they've, they've got to be getting something.

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.840
Like, like, it's, it's, it's, and of course, whenever I ask,

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.000
they always say it's great.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.200
So who would do that?

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.040
Oh, I just heard it.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:10.880
Oh.

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.720
Yeah.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.320
God damn it.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.360
That was my joke.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.680
It was good.

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.400
I'm well aware that if someone asked you,

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.040
did I eat your pussy good,

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.120
you would probably say yes,

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:23.960
whether he did or didn't.

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.000
See, the secret is that you spell the alphabet.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.120
She got the joke.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:32.160
I mean, if a motherfucker bakes a pie

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.480
and it takes like 18 ingredients and they burn it,

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:37.040
you're still going to be like, this is delicious.

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.240
Give me a beat.

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:40.960
Buh-nah-nah-nah-nah.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.160
Let's talk about this pussy.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.000
Eat this.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:44.840
We're going to trade off though, right?

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.800
For the closing number.

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.640
Yeah.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.480
Right.

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.320
Old school.

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.160
Oh shit.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:50.840
Ha-ha.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.680
Ha-ha.

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.520
What's up?

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.720
I'll do the, I'll do the sound, to the sound sample.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:59.720
Oh, love to eat that pussy.

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:04.040
It's, it's like an old forgotten Motown song.

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:04.880
Yeah.

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:05.720
Seriously.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.640
Oh, love to eat that pussy.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.200
She's stopping over.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.520
I'm going to eat that pussy like a Trescan,

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.920
the home to Grover.

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.720
That's what that sounds like.

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:17.000
Grover eating pussy.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.480
You feeling the rock to pussy?

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.920
Like you was rocking Stussy.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.640
I'm passing it to you.

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.200
It's doing old stuff.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.640
Like we used to do.

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:26.760
Pussy, yo.

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.840
First you take your tongue and then you run it up and down

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.040
like a marathon run, son.

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:35.680
I'm going to go the distance up to the clitoris-tis.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.640
I'm going to make you come like listening this.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:41.800
I'm putting my tongue inside and rubbing it around

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.720
like my name was Brahide.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.560
Pussy?

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.200
I know.

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.680
It's, there's no language that's going to go good with this.

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:50.680
Pussy?

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:53.240
If you're waiting for descriptions of pussy eating,

01:46:53.240 --> 01:47:02.600
it becomes somehow attractive and reactive to the fact,

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:05.680
the fundamental fact that talking about it,

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:08.560
like it's a competition, makes it bad.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.240
But anyways, where was I?

01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.440
I licked her mom's pussy so hard I got a fuzzy eye.

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:18.120
I tried looking inside like a periscope

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:19.960
because she opened her mouth wide.

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:22.800
And so I saw an enemy sub, Red October,

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:23.600
coming around.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.120
I said, rub a dub, dub.

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.720
Because I was in the bathtub with your mama eating her out.

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:29.760
Oh, shit.

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.800
Here comes Commander Cloud.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.880
Nice.

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.440
Raw deal.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.640
I'm going to eat that pussy like a meal.

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.120
I licked it down with your poop.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.240
I love to eat the fuck.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.000
My favorite food group.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.400
I drop a mic, but I don't drop a verse.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.560
Almost died.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.840
Get a fucking hearse.

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:50.640
Oh, shit.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.280
Ladies and gentlemen, that has been Harmontown.

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:57.280
We out there eating that pussy.

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:00.360
Rob Schwab, Spencer Crittenden, knowledge for Brieka,

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.280
sitting in for the lovely Steve Levy.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.440
LaShane Orteva, Happy New Year.

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:08.400
Zac McKeever, Kris Boruff, Sarah Hill.

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.320
Thank you so much from the downtown dynasty theater.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.120
We love you, Jeff Davis.

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.400
We miss you so much.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.400
I've been Brandon Johnson.

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:19.120
Good night.

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.200
Two-time Emmy winner, ladies and gentlemen.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.040
Did you get any of that?

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:50.040
It's a good show.
