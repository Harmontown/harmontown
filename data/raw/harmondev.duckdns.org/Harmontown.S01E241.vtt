have a lot of friends coming that's like you know let's bring\n\n05:42.160 --> 05:51.280\nout the harlem globetrotters\n\n05:51.280 --> 06:02.640\nwow that was great that was great i thought i thought metal like lemon was much taller than\n\n06:07.360 --> 06:11.040\nthat was particularly funny to anyone who's never seen the show before i don't know what\n\n06:11.040 --> 06:16.720\nlike like what was that guy what did they was that do they have the globetrotters here\n\n06:16.720 --> 06:23.200\nbut no theme song i was hoping you heard the theme song but i mean you know as i've pointed out\n\n06:23.200 --> 06:28.000\nlike emily you're the george washington of Harmontown like you you said to me at the roost you\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.240\nshould have a podcast and then i was like no i'd rather do a show and then i we've already talked\n\n06:32.240 --> 06:38.000\nabout this but you're you're the you're the you're the reason the show ever was here and existed here\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:44.720\nbecause of your involvement with the meltdown also because this was a brand new space and like\n\n06:44.720 --> 06:49.280\ni was desperately looking for shows and for like voices that didn't have like a stage\n\n06:49.280 --> 06:52.960\nand this is what i thought needed needed a stage and needed an audience and i was just\n\n06:52.960 --> 06:58.240\nremembering actually in the way here they remember the first show we ever had when at eight o'clock\n\n06:58.240 --> 07:04.000\nwhen the show started i was at the grove at the apple store trying to buy something for your laptop\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\noh my god do you remember that because you wanted to like show a video because it was so important\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:12.640\nyeah it's so it's so weird what i thought was important i remember like the first the first\n\n07:12.640 --> 07:18.000\ncouple weeks of doing shows here i would sit with dustin marshall after we started recording\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.960\nin a podcast and i remember go over to his place once a week and sit for like four to six hours\n\n07:23.680 --> 07:29.120\ndon't add anything the ums and urs and if you listen to the first couple episodes maybe\n\n07:29.120 --> 07:33.600\nyou'll hear like a weird stilted i'm like what yeah because that's what this podcast that's it's\n\n07:33.600 --> 07:39.520\nbread and butter is it's concision i don't i don't anyways but yeah at some point we just didn't\n\n07:39.520 --> 07:42.800\nhave the time to do that and it was like wait the standards are way lower than this obama just did\n\n07:42.800 --> 07:50.160\nmarron yeah anything could happen yeah but they did edit the ums and urs when obama did strikes\n\n07:50.160 --> 07:55.200\nand the emails they deleted the emails and it was like 45 minutes of me at the apple store on the\n\n07:55.200 --> 07:59.680\nphone with matt myra of all people trying to like figure out i jack i'm sure you remember this kind\n\n07:59.680 --> 08:04.080\nof yeah and then i came back and i was like oh i'm so sorry dan i couldn't find the thing and you\n\n08:04.080 --> 08:08.480\nwere like that's fine i just want to play the video yeah i was like okay cool let's start the show then\n\n08:08.480 --> 08:12.640\ni think that it was the only reason for whatever that equipment was is that the first show i did\n\n08:12.640 --> 08:17.760\nhere it wasn't podcast but it was like i had spent i stayed up all night designing this flag\n\n08:18.880 --> 08:25.840\non photoshop wait you did this this was like till three a.m and then you did this

dwell in this dii feature world where i don't like it like is there like is there like well\n\n12:57.040 --> 13:02.080\na way to not have to well what we're doing is no because the movie theater is well we'll tell them\n\n13:02.080 --> 13:07.600\nthere's a couple interesting things that we didn't know that now so we're opening only three cities\n\n13:07.600 --> 13:11.840\nand then we're going to slowly expand and they want to go up to like pretty big and you know\n\n13:11.840 --> 13:17.680\nlions gate is releasing it so it's going to get if it can support it it'll get ultimately a pretty\n\n13:17.680 --> 13:23.680\nbig release but it's only starting like a lion like a lion roaring into your theaters yes but\n\n13:23.680 --> 13:30.160\nthere's a thing it's called cinema con and what you do is it's a convention and you go and all the\n\n13:30.160 --> 13:35.600\nmovie theater owners are there and you show them parts of your movie and you try and convince them\n\n13:35.600 --> 13:39.920\nto play it in their theaters well there's two roles they'll have different they'll have celebrities\n\n13:39.920 --> 13:44.800\nthere that are there to like be like rewards for the cinema owners to be like oh my god you guys\n\n13:44.800 --> 13:50.320\nare so great you get the rock and then they have us who are like just begging them to like look how\n\n13:50.320 --> 13:54.880\ngreat we are you want to see this movie right put it in your theater so like we spent the entire time\n\n13:54.880 --> 14:00.240\nthey got wooed by the rock and then we begged them basically those are the two levels wouldn't you\n\n14:00.240 --> 14:06.640\nsay well you begged but you know they were very excited to meet me no they don't they don't give\n\n14:06.640 --> 14:13.280\na shit it was the rock and John Cena and then us and what was funny was the Amazon the Amazon is\n\n14:13.280 --> 14:16.240\nthe one who bought it but they're releasing it in theaters they had they had a thing they're like\n\n14:16.240 --> 14:21.200\nwe're going to do a sketch we're going to be like bring up the marketing head of Amazon and then\n\n14:21.200 --> 14:25.440\nyou come out and you've kidnapped the guy and I was like most people are just going to think oh\n\n14:25.440 --> 14:31.440\nthat's the marketing head of Amazon you do look like a marketing head that's true oh I guess that's\n\n14:31.440 --> 14:38.640\nthe guy he's slightly more comfortable on stage than you would think what is the third city\n\n14:39.520 --> 14:45.440\nChicago okay you know the second city is the third city the second city is the third city\n\n14:45.440 --> 14:53.120\nbut the plan is to keep yeah expanding as much as we can but yeah baby so those of you listening\n\n14:53.120 --> 15:01.280\nRob Schrab has gotten a microphone it's not working though it's fine perfect leave it exactly that's\n\n15:01.280 --> 15:06.240\ngreat that's perfect it should not be hooked up to anything can we get less work can we get less\n\n15:06.240 --> 15:23.680\nRob in the monitors please okay so so today I was at a Dino's Easter dinner party and I was talking\n\n15:23.680 --> 15:29.760\nto somebody that works at the star burns our studio our modest studio and I was running my\n\n15:29.760 --> 15:35.760\nhands blithely through my locks because I was kind of high and then I was like like feeling\n\n15:35.760 --> 15:40.320\nand then everyone's while I felt something like it was like wait what is there a bug in my hair\n\n15:40.320 --> 15:45.200\nI don't know but it's not didn't feel enough like that it was probably a leaf I mean if it was a\n\n15:45.200 --> 15:50.000\nspider and I touched it it'd be gone by now it or it bit me or whatever and then I keep I keep running\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:54.400\nmy hands through my hair and I'm just listening to the conversation and then and this story does\n\n15:54.400 --> 16:01.520\nnot go where you think it's gonna go I am I I've never been more excited for a story no it's gonna\n\n16:01.520 --> 16:06.800\ndisappoint you that you're gonna realize I was turned on my blithely through my locks so I finally\n\n16:06.800 --> 16:13.440\nlike touched something that felt it triggered my fingers to think that like I was like I did\n\n16:13.440 --> 16:18.800\nfeel like it's my body felt like I oh there's a there's something in my hair that's alive or\n\n16:18.800 --> 16:23.840\nthat shouldn't be there and my reaction was my honest to God reaction as I was talking to this\n\n16:23.840 --> 16:31.840\nwoman like I was just talking to her in a driveway and then I was like yeah and then she was like\n\n16:31.840 --> 16:36.880\nlike through it there was it turned out to be nothing but I would have if there had been\n\n16:36.880 --> 16:41.200\nsomething in my hand I would have thrown it onto her so but from her perspective you were just\n\n16:41.200 --> 16:47.520\nlike hey hey yeah yeah she didn't she didn't I was surprised I was telling Dino later it was like\n\n16:47.520 --> 16:52.880\nyeah I was talking to and like I guess she was like I guess she didn't know she'll never know\n\n16:52.880 --> 16:58.480\nthat I'm a horrible coward that would throw a bug on her if it was on my head oh wait what was it\n\n16:59.120 --> 17:03.360\nit was nothing I don't know it was like I was high I was high and so I was like ah damn there was\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:07.200\nthat tree in the backyard that kept like like oh there's probably things falling off yeah there's\n\n17:07.200 --> 17:10.800\nthis little kind of like small brewery flowers that would come out so it was one of those that's\n\n17:10.800 --> 17:16.720\nthat makes that makes sense what what if it was a bunch of little dicks that's a valid question\n\n17:16.720 --> 17:22.800\nwell we gotta my favorite is his smug face after and look at that he's so happy like what if it was a\n\n17:22.800 --> 17:28.160\ncan we get camera seven and rub smug face right now that

what if what if that was you ever think about that yeah ran a mic out for him\n\n17:40.560 --> 17:48.960\nbut then dino said dino said no five people had to scramble to find out a way to get rob a mic\n\n17:48.960 --> 17:58.000\nI had to make it worth it for that but then dino said oh no she no she's very low key she's cool\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.760\nand I said nobody's cool with someone throwing a bug on them because she didn't react at all she\n\n18:01.760 --> 18:06.000\njust thought I went there but she is cool and he's like no no no she's she's she's but what what if\n\n18:06.000

to\n\n18:59.040 --> 19:04.560\nto some degree like I don't I don't want to I don't want to invade this person's privacy or like speak\n\n19:04.560 --> 19:10.480\nspeak for their ideology how dare you but uh I think I think she's like a 12th degree question\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:13.760\nhe said he said she's like she's like a brown belt\n\n19:19.280 --> 19:23.520\nhe said she's very she's very low key and it's because it's because of her beliefs because I was\n\n19:23.520 --> 19:26.880\ntalking to her at one point it was like oh that was very nice of you and she's like oh please\n\n19:26.880 --> 19:32.320\nyou know if I didn't think God was watching I just put my foot on someone's face and just grinded\n\n19:32.320 --> 19:41.600\ninto the cement she said that but God is hearing you say that right but God's like that's the I mean\n\n19:41.600 --> 19:46.240\nyou know it's an extrinsic God he's like thank you for thinking that and then showing some restraint\n\n19:46.240 --> 19:51.280\nI gotta take a poop I'll do it in the toilet I want to grind that person's face into the pavement\n\n19:51.280 --> 19:57.600\nI'm gonna not do that God thanksgiving God is gonna go take a poop in the toilet all right like\n\n19:57.600 --> 20:02.720\nhe's like oh that's interesting I have to take a shit anyway that's what volcanoes are it made me\n\n20:02.720 --> 20:10.160\nwonder is

dicks sorry Kamel's gotta go here but Kamel Najiani everybody\n\n20:35.040 --> 20:40.960\nhe's very hurt my husband is very okay that shit doesn't scan we drove by a hot church today\n\n20:40.960 --> 20:44.720\nyou know the hot church the hot church the hot christian church there's a oh is that\n\n20:44.720 --> 20:49.680\nis that when the girl puts her foot on the back of your head and then your dick goes in your own\n\n20:49.680 --> 21:01.120\nbutt and yes what are you talking about are you talking about mosaic yeah mosaic it's a very la\n\n21:01.120 --> 21:06.640\nchurch that's like hot sexy like hipsters and hipsters wait is that the one on like we want to\n\n21:06.640 --> 21:12.480\nmake a right coming on highland or Hollywood and there's a bunch of like max a bunch of models\n\n21:12.480 --> 21:17.680\nhanging out yeah and they're not inside worshiping god they're all outside getting phone numbers\n\n21:17.680 --> 21:22.240\nand can I say something there was a step and repeat outside of mosaic when we were driving\n\n21:22.240 --> 21:25.680\nhere because it's Easter step and repeat is where you go to like stand in front of like a red carpet\n\n21:25.680 --> 21:32.640\nthey had like a red carpet in front of their church today forgot it's a holiday yeah and there\n\n21:32.640 --> 21:39.040\nwere girls in stripper heels and I was like let them let them worship too you know less G not be\n\n21:39.040 --> 21:51.360\njudge unless you judge less G that's right just like my dad used to say well I guess that's what\n\n21:51.360 --> 21:56.320\nI was your next answer is coming out rendering the season where there's diseases but get your\n\n21:56.320 --> 22:04.400\ndollars out for Magdalene there were really hot people there super hot we were always hot people\n\n22:04.400 --> 22:08.960\nno I make I make a right driving here all the time and sometimes I just want to pull over and start\n\n22:08.960 --> 22:14.960\ngoing to that church everybody's good looking yes that's maybe the way it to christian and also\n\n22:14.960 --> 22:19.360\nthose people probably would grind your face into the pavement if they didn't think that there might\n\n22:19.360 --> 22:25.760\nbe a god that would prevent them from getting phone numbers as long as they're grinding it made me\n\n22:25.760 --> 22:30.640\nit made me think too you know maybe we don't you know we kind of tend to look at like religion and\n\n22:30.640 --> 22:35.680\nas problematic and go like well you know people that take it too seriously they get there they\n\n22:35.680 --> 22:39.760\nthink all kinds of things and they use it to justify like violence against people and oppression\n\n22:39.760 --> 22:46.880\nand all this stuff but how much of it is the glue that holds our nation's many many stupid together\n\n22:47.680 --> 22:51.680\nand just keeps them in their living rooms just and maybe keeps them away from the polls\n\n22:51.680 --> 23:02.480\nwait the stripper or voting yeah which polls oh the stripper both Jesse Jackson and say both\n\n23:04.800 --> 23:09.200\nyou know I mean I look I've come around to the conclusion and I know I'm late on this one but\n\n23:09.200 --> 23:15.520\neveryone's dumb like like like like most people are dumber than you and then I let a lot of then\n\n23:15.520 --> 23:22.800\nyou add into that what's it called the Dunning Dunning Kruger Dunner Kruger what Dunning Kruger yeah\n\n23:22.800 --> 23:28.240\nI've been I've been having that spit at me on Twitter it's when you're an idiot you think that\n\n23:28.240 --> 23:33.360\neveryone else is an idiot because you can't conceive of even average intelligence the the\n\n23:33.360 --> 23:38.000\ndumber you are the smarter you think you are it's the Lake Wobegon effect they used to call it but\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:44.000\nthey actually kind of like where everyone's above average that thing that they they they\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:49.120\nadministered a test to everybody whatever a group of people and uh and then they said\n\n23:49.840 --> 23:53.920\nlast question how you think you did yeah and then they and then they create you know they've\n\n23:53.920 --> 23:59.440\nmathematically proven that yeah the the the more wrong you are the right I'd say dumber because\n\n23:59.440 --> 24:04.000\nthe the interesting thing about the radio lab or not radio lab American life pieces that I was\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:08.000\ntalking about it was that went on to say it was like you could be this is just for anything that\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:14.720\nyou're dumb about like if Stephen Hawking went from astrophysics into how to administer a catheter\n\n24:14.720 --> 24:23.680\nlike like he within two weeks like he's not the guy I would pick even if I don't know much about\n\n24:23.680 --> 24:30.720\nStephen Hawking can I get a little help Stephen Stephen Hawking little help over here look at\n\n24:30.720 --> 24:37.840\nlook at Rob look at Rob I'll try to use less distracting examples by the way that was him\n\n24:37.840 --> 24:46.640\n20 years ago but you would uh he would for all as smart as he is about black holes and as much as\n\n24:46.640 --> 24:51.200\nhe would probably say because he's super smart about black holes he probably assumes you and I\n\n24:51.200 --> 24:55.840\nknow more about black holes than we're capable of that's the other end of the effect is that\n\n24:55.840 --> 25:01.120\nbut he would also within two weeks of learning how to administer a catheter to like as a nurse I\n\n25:01.120 --> 25:05.520\ndidn't like like he would go you know what I got this I could teach this at a university\n\n25:05.520 --> 25:10.320\nbecause he wouldn't know that much about it but he'd think well what it's like that's the that's\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:15.440\nthat effect is the dumber you are at anything the less you know the more the more certain you are\n\n25:15.440 --> 25:20.320\nthat you actually know it really does make sense and it's actually not that is that because you're\n\n25:20.320 --> 25:25.280\nangry or hateful or bigoted it's actually just the nature of stupidity and intelligence makes\n\n25:25.280 --> 25:30.480\nperfect fucking sense absolutely so now that we know that can we just kill all the dumb people\n\n25:30.480 --> 25:40.480\nbefore they kill all of us that's been a show guys good night they're gonna kill us what that's\n\n25:40.480 --> 25:44.720\nreally scary because that means that there are no solutions right I mean it really means that\n\n25:44.720 --> 25:49.120\nthere's no way out oh it you know it's a horrible ringing indoors because they're just gonna get\n\n25:49.120 --> 25:53.680\nmore confident the less they know and then when you and then it doesn't it's not a huge billboard\n\n25:53.680 --> 26:02.640\nfor democracy no it really is not that's thinking about medical care let the masses decide uh well\n\n26:02.640 --> 26:08.480\nmost of us are so dumb we think cancer is a privilege I don't like they don't they're like\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:14.240\nwhy should I pay for other people's cancer I'll never get it no but you're so dumb you're so dumb\n\n26:14.240 --> 26:21.200\nyou're gonna get cancer no I'm not I've thought about this for 30 minutes no but that's less time\n\n26:21.200 --> 26:25.840\nthan a doctor well that's the thing that's not to me about climate change and stuff where they're\n\n26:25.840 --> 26:32.400\nlike all these so-called experts yes they are experts this is what they study you want to be able\n\n26:32.400 --> 26:37.040\nto play Minecraft that means other people have to spend a bunch more time than you think about the\n\n26:37.040 --> 26:43.280\nfucking earth and shit that's right I don't know nothing about no taxes or Medicare or nothing so\n\n26:43.280 --> 26:48.800\njust take my money yeah take my money when your fridge breaks down what do you do you take it to\n\n26:48.800 --> 26:54.000\na person who knows how to fix fridges that's right I'm glad we could agree as wealthy Americans\n\n26:56.560 --> 27:02.000\neveryone needs to wise up and stop being dumb and just make a bunch of money and sit and play video\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:06.240\nno it's all you have to do you guys it's all you have to do I think people have a right to be stupid\n\n27:06.240 --> 27:10.160\nthough if they want to be they do yeah but then don't be confident about it they should be more\n\n27:10.160 --> 27:15.840\nashamed they should be ashamed there was a culture in this country there is a culture in this country\n\n27:15.840 --> 27:20.240\nwhere you are dumb and then you'd hear yourself say something and then you just soon you'd go like\n\n27:20.240 --> 27:27.280\noh I'm stupid oh whoa whoa and then you could go back in your basement amen go back in your basement\n\n27:28.240 --> 27:33.120\nI hear what you're saying but I'm just saying people do have a right to be stupid and there's\n\n27:33.120 --> 27:37.280\nnothing we can really do about it they have more than a right they control the fucking planet yeah\n\n27:37.280 --> 27:41.600\nthey are controlling the planet you're talking like we live in some Logan's run world where we\n\n27:41.600 --> 27:48.400\ncontrol carousel it's like wait where the crosshairs stop staring at me kumail I can't believe the\n\n27:48.400 --> 27:56.240\nthings you've said I do think I think it used to be that stupid people were and I hate I mean\n\n27:56.240 --> 28:00.640\npeople who thought themselves not as smart used to be ashamed of that fact and I do think there is\n\n28:00.640 --> 28:06.240\nthis idea now that like no that's somehow a right like a right that you no one can take\n\n28:06.240 --> 28:11.920\nbeing ignorant has become like a positive trait it's interesting in America we're in the second\n\n28:11.920 --> 28:19.120\nact of a Disney movie like blank check or or a gumdrop tree or or what if you had a car you know\n\n28:19.120 --> 28:25.520\nlike let's say like a Disney movie for for what feels like a kids fantasy where the second act is\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:32.080\nlike you could you mean rick dukeman left a blank check and I could now you have a party at my house\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:37.600\nthat it does the montage of like oh I have no grown-ups allowed there's a giraffe loose in the\n\n28:37.600 --> 28:46.880\nbackyard they're sick and they're sick and tired people are sick and tired of of all these smarty\n\n28:46.880 --> 28:51.680\npants is telling them they're stupid and now we're just living in the in the in the second act of\n\n28:51.680 --> 28:57.040\ntheir their novel well what's gonna happen in action it's their novel right hopefully they're gonna\n\n28:57.040 --> 29:00.160\nlearn their lesson well they're gonna they should learn their lesson hopefully they'll like find\n\n29:00.160 --> 29:06.720\nout that being teen wolf is not worth like your teammates not getting to play basketball I but what\n\n29:06.720 --> 29:12.560\nhappens and what happens in the third act of what if I had a car they run people over I mean\n\n29:12.560 --> 29:21.280\nthere's always a you know it's like wow yeah so what so what's gonna happen what do we do there's\n\n29:21.280 --> 29:28.560\nno this I have never felt this I've always been very optimistic and I still feel pretty optimistic\n\n29:28.560 --> 29:35.200\noverall but my optimism now comes from the fact that at some point we'll all die and earth will\n\n29:35.200 --> 29:43.280\nregenerate itself and millions of years from now new life will start and it won't be look everybody's\n\n29:43.280 --> 29:49.440\nso nihilistic well I've been focusing on my on my Cody like I'm we're just we're just so all we\n\n29:49.440 --> 29:53.440\nknow is that we have each other now and like we're just hoping that the missile hits like right on\n\n29:53.440 --> 30:00.480\nmy house I feel like because I don't want to have to shoot my dogs we were yeah we were literally\n\n30:00.480 --> 30:06.880\nthat's the first thing you're gonna do these dogs gotta go I don't know what's gonna happen\n\n30:06.880 --> 30:11.760\nthat reminds me we have to pick up like it was a hoax man it was a hoax because explaining to them\n\n30:11.760 --> 30:16.960\nthat what I think about explaining to my cat what's happening oh I am so jealous that she has no\n\n30:16.960 --> 30:23.440\nfucking idea she's so happy right now she's just like why can't I go outside in the morning anymore mommy\n\n30:23.440 --> 30:26.960\nyeah but imagine how stoked your cat would be if it really if you could really explain everything\n\n30:26.960 --> 30:32.080\nto it because your cat would also be explained you mean I'm part of a selectively bred species doomed\n\n30:32.080 --> 30:39.200\nto die of renal failure because the price the cost benefit ratio peaks out for my species and like\n\n30:39.200 --> 30:44.320\nI'm gonna I'm gonna spend the last six months of my life trapped in a home walking around yowling\n\n30:44.320 --> 30:51.760\nit but and and while you inject bags into the scruff of my neck like of cat fluid because I've\n\n30:51.760 --> 30:58.640\nbecome nothing more than a cat shaped container for cat fluid isn't that what they always are but\n\n30:58.640 --> 31:03.360\nthen you go isn't that what a cat is a cat shaped container yeah but it's self-generated there's a\n\n31:03.360 --> 31:09.280\npride there I don't know shouldn't everyone adopt the Chinese kid but we don't uh we keep we keep\n\n31:09.280 --> 31:13.760\nwanting it to look like us and the cats like yeah I wish it was my own cat fluid it doesn't like\n\n31:13.760 --> 31:18.160\nthat any more than we do but then you tell it like oh oh no there's a missile that's been launched\n\n31:18.160 --> 31:22.960\nthe cat would be the most stoked thing in your house because it would go like wait I get to go out\n\n31:22.960 --> 31:28.400\nwith humanity yeah instead of being we're all the same now a Chinese takeout container on your\n\n31:28.400 --> 31:36.000\nmantle because you always meant to scatter my ashes yeah totally it's ultimate equality nuclear\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:42.480\nwarfare we're all the fucking same we were in Seattle and we were reading this thing that was\n\n31:42.480 --> 31:49.520\nlike don't worry if Kim Jong Un launches a missile it can only get to Seattle we were literally in\n\n31:49.520 --> 31:56.160\nSeattle we were on the plane and I was like fucking take off right now I literally was\n\n31:56.160 --> 32:00.880\nhow long would it take for a missile from North Korea to get here it would take minutes but who\n\n32:00.880 --> 32:06.480\nknows minutes I don't think that's true who knows I hope just long enough minutes\n\n32:06.480 --> 32:13.280\nI like your response was it feels like what what feels right\n\n32:15.280 --> 32:21.440\nthen why does it take five hours to get to Milwaukee minutes minutes so it's like a\n\n32:21.440 --> 32:28.240\nmissile is super fast if I find out that the that the North Koreans can get to Seattle in\n\n32:28.240 --> 32:36.720\nminutes and it takes me five hours to get to New York that's fucking bullshit I'd rather be blown up\n\n32:36.720 --> 32:43.120\nwell you now you know that so still Schrabs still Schrabs yes go ahead Schrab go ahead Schrab\n\n32:44.400 --> 32:49.520\nhis mic out of his own stand Schrab made the same observation with Milwaukee instead of New York\n\n32:49.520 --> 32:54.160\nyeah well just moments before with the same amount of time you said five hours to Milwaukee\n\n32:54.160 --> 33:01.440\nyou said five hours to New York why is your plane slower I gotta stop in Las Vegas okay sure\n\n33:03.840 --> 33:07.040\nbecause there's a layover to go to Milwaukee you can fly direct to New York\n\n33:07.600 --> 33:12.320\nbut I don't think yeah Las Vegas you gotta see Britney Spears her show's about to finish yeah\n\n33:12.320 --> 33:16.960\nthat makes sense but there is a comfort right to the idea of just like like just going away all this\n\n33:16.960 --> 33:21.120\nhorseshit disappears just

have eight times as much as it's only what the\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:09.760\ndollar is it's what if it was a bunch of little dicks that's right in the future the currency will\n\n35:09.760 --> 35:19.040\nbe a bunch of little dicks that would be like a hundred dollar bill yeah what is the exchange rate\n\n35:19.040 --> 35:28.800\nbetween a bunch of little dicks and some teeth you don't want teeth of your dick so sorry by the\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:35.200\nway you can catch Kumail in Mass Effect Andromeda yes I am in the is that game good I haven't played\n\n35:35.200 --> 35:41.520\nit I'm not I just started playing it I it seems a little chunky like in terms of loading isn't it\n\n35:41.520 --> 35:48.080\nlike a little don't fat shame the game man I'm fat shaming its memory drain or something like\n\n35:48.080 --> 35:54.240\nif you're a console game I shouldn't be experiencing like you're load shaming it what what load load\n\n35:54.240 --> 36:02.400\nload shaming you're because it takes a load shaming it yeah yeah you like that yeah but I mean\n\n36:02.400 --> 36:07.440\nI was like I don't know why it is like I've been on an airplane and saw some movie there's a Franco\n\n36:07.440 --> 36:11.920\nand a Hiblitz or something and then there's you like like a thing it's like I'm like oh there's\n\n36:11.920 --> 36:17.760\nKumail well yeah I mean what what did I think I was gonna see him doing you know it's like oh he's\n\n36:17.760 --> 36:21.440\nin a movie that's his job comedy movie but then when you're playing a video game and you hear\n\n36:21.440 --> 36:26.480\nyour friend's voice it's like really weird it's like it's closer to if you were in a porn movie\n\n36:26.480 --> 36:31.520\nthat I was watching like actually I was in a movie called Mike and Dave need wedding dates and that's\n\n36:31.520 --> 36:39.120\nyeah I was very pornographic yeah is it I've been afraid to play it I you know I asked to be in it\n\n36:39.120 --> 36:43.920\nI there was like a developer of Mass Effect who would like talk to me sometimes and I was just like\n\n36:43.920 --> 36:48.400\nfuck it what's the point yeah I would so I just DM'd and I was like hey can I be in it and it's\n\n36:48.400 --> 36:54.560\ntotally fine if you say no and then I'm the president in the game but now it kind of sucks\n\n36:54.560 --> 36:58.880\nbecause now I don't want to play it because I'm like what if I fucked it up and I fucked up my\n\n36:58.880 --> 37:05.520\nlike favorite video game so I'm like very nervous to very nervous to play it I mean you know it's\n\n37:05.520 --> 37:11.200\na Mass Effect game the only thing you're gonna ruin would be a conversation between right upgrading\n\n37:11.200 --> 37:15.920\nyour armor it's like god damn when I fucked up massive yeah well they made me program the whole\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:24.400\nthing okay so it was very it's a little chunky yeah it was very racist of them to assume\n\n37:25.920 --> 37:30.880\nthat I would be the guy for it but you did it I did it I figured it out I went on Wikipedia\n\n37:31.760 --> 37:37.840\nI could never figure out the chunk problem is the is the uh how far in are you how many\n\n37:37.840 --> 37:44.400\nhours two minutes okay so I show up that early well you're in the I'm not spoiling anything\n\n37:45.520 --> 37:51.120\nI you know your character not your character the royal you your character in Mass Effect the\n\n37:51.120 --> 37:57.360\nprotagonist uh is uh you know it has there's a little kind of a pathfinder where a thing happens\n\n37:57.360 --> 38:02.560\nthat's like kind of a disaster and it puts you in charge and so you're then you come in shortly\n\n38:02.560 --> 38:07.680\nafter when he's sort of like you have to figure out oh I guess I'm the new boss and then you're\n\n38:07.680 --> 38:14.160\nchecking in with your crew is this a game where you get to design your look yes yes I thank you\n\n38:14.160 --> 38:18.800\nfor bringing that up I because I want to know we're just talking about what is wrong with me\n\n38:18.800 --> 38:23.760\nbecause I'm I I can't because I I made a character and I gave him like and I was like well I'm gonna\n\n38:23.760 --> 38:28.240\ngive myself like gray hair because I want to like be old and be in this game turns out it's not an\n\n38:28.240 --> 38:33.440\noption you have a dad that's like so I just gave myself gray hair but I'm like younger than my dad\n\n38:33.440 --> 38:39.520\nbut yeah but but but like I always I try to make it look like myself yeah and then and then but\n\n38:39.520 --> 38:47.360\nJustin Roiland co-creator Rick and Morty season three coming to a time time era near you uh the\n\n38:47.360 --> 38:52.240\nthe uh Justin like I remember going over to his house when he was playing Skyrim and it was like\n\n38:52.240 --> 38:55.840\nwhat the fuck and it's like yeah no I always do I was just trying to make the person look as\n\n38:55.840 --> 39:01.840\nfucked up as possible I'm like so he like he just made he just tried to take with you however close\n\n39:01.840 --> 39:06.960\ntogether the eyes can be however wide the ear you know he'll just make every extreme choice and like\n\n39:06.960 --> 39:12.320\ncome up with this like weird potato man that like and it makes so much more sense to me and while\n\n39:12.320 --> 39:16.560\nI'm making my character in Mass Effect there's some really impressive hairstyles and one of them was\n\n39:16.560 --> 39:22.320\nlike this very like frode out thing so I had already created I'd already made it look a lot like me\n\n39:22.320 --> 39:25.840\nto me as much as I could but then then I was scrolling through the hairs and one of them was\n\n39:25.840 --> 39:32.480\njust was like bam like this like powerful fro like like but all tangled not like not like like a\n\n39:32.480 --> 39:37.760\nlike a statesman in the 70s like a like a like like like this guy was like had bigger fish to\n\n39:37.760 --> 39:44.880\nfry spiritually and uh and and it was so funny it made me laugh out loud but I didn't use it\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:48.720\nand it was like why am I not following my joy literally anything but you're like no no that\n\n39:48.720 --> 39:53.040\nwouldn't be true to the character exactly it's like I didn't want to throw I don't want to come\n\n39:53.040 --> 39:58.720\nas close as I can I agree with you I don't I think if you want to set out to make yourself\n\n39:58.720 --> 40:04.720\nthen make yourself and don't give yourself a fro but what is that narcissistic impulse we're playing\n\n40:04.720 --> 40:09.920\ngames because we want to be someone else right here I'll defend myself it's because it's because\n\n40:09.920 --> 40:14.800\nI think the ironic thing is me like I'm Woody Allen when I'm in the during the Russian revolution\n\n40:14.800 --> 40:19.360\nso like that's why I figure the bigger laughs are to come if it looks just like me which by the way\n\n40:19.360 --> 40:24.800\nit can't because as as Cody Cody watch the room I said did I make it I try to make it look like\n\n40:24.800 --> 40:28.560\nme and she saw it and then she laughed and was just like you can't you can't so you you can't\n\n40:28.560 --> 40:35.120\nmake them fat like you can't that's my problem with video game you can never make them fat I\n\n40:35.120 --> 40:40.640\nwant to make them fat I think a lot of people have had serious kind of uh emotional breakdowns\n\n40:40.640 --> 40:46.080\ndesigning their bodies in these games oh we had a we we we did one where I was trying to\n\n40:46.080 --> 40:51.680\nmake myself for this basketball game and she was giving me advice on what to do and we almost got\n\n40:51.680 --> 40:57.360\ninto a very big fight it was a mistake I was like that's not how I look and she's like move the\n\n40:57.360 --> 41:06.800\neyes closer together Emily Emily I will say that you could fat her face Emily you found other ways\n\n41:06.800 --> 41:12.160\nto say those things this is what I'm talking about when you're having to pick your body type\n\n41:12.160 --> 41:17.120\nfor a video game it's it can be a very it's a good a confrontive thing to do for your emotional\n\n41:17.120 --> 41:22.320\nso I say always make something weird always be a capper do you spend I get sucked in if I have four\n\n41:22.320 --> 41:27.040\nhours to play a video game which is like a big deal oh my god I found four hours yeah and it's\n\n41:27.040 --> 41:33.120\none of those games where prepare to dock with the space station bop bop bop oh uh check the\n\n41:33.120 --> 41:40.160\nmirror see if your face looks all right blip and then uh-huh three and a half I mean I'll I'll\n\n41:40.160 --> 41:44.240\nyeah the whole time every time you try to make it look like you is that right or every time you yeah\n\n41:44.240 --> 41:48.720\nI don't yeah I've never really until unless there's been maybe some games where it was so so clear\n\n41:48.720 --> 41:54.560\nthat I couldn't make it look like me at all that I was able to just make some decision in my head\n\n41:54.560 --> 41:59.360\nthat it didn't have to be me but mostly I'm just like trying to make it look like me I think that's\n\n41:59.360 --> 42:05.200\ngood I think that's totally good if you're playing this game you're in the game it should\n\n42:05.200 --> 42:12.080\nlook like you I totally agree with you and I I I try and do that too except when Emily's around\n\n42:12.080 --> 42:18.880\nbecause that's not good for the basketball game you literally couldn't go as short like in the\n\n42:18.880 --> 42:25.360\nlowest height they had they literally like in the basketball game I couldn't get to my height so I had\n\n42:25.360 --> 42:32.720\nto be one inch taller than I am and they wouldn't let me be my actual age and I they wouldn't let me\n\n42:32.720 --> 42:37.360\nbe my actual age so my dream is over that I'll ever end up in the NBA like even they're like\n\n42:37.360 --> 42:42.320\nand you had you had to be on a different HBO show yeah they were like you gotta be on Veep to\n\n42:42.320 --> 42:46.240\nplay this game they should have by now they should they should I guess it's because there's there's\n\n42:46.240 --> 42:51.600\nnot a standard technology yet because it wouldn't know what their private industry isn't incentivized\n\n42:51.600 --> 42:56.720\nto do this but we have the technology long to do anything yeah you could be at a mall or something\n\n42:56.720 --> 43:01.360\nand you'd go like oh oh I should get one of those because I play a lot of video games one of those\n\n43:01.360 --> 43:06.480\nbeing you step into a kiosk and they just do a scan oh and then you just walk out with a file\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:14.400\nthat every game that's based on an avatar of a human being it's always you so it's always hilarious\n\n43:14.400 --> 43:18.560\nbut then you get to see what you actually look like no that's really funny I mean believe me I try I\n\n43:18.560 --> 43:24.160\ngo to Cheeks it's like I try but it's like that's why it always stops at some weird place where it's\n\n43:24.160 --> 43:29.280\nlike the game has decided you need to be athletic but I want to look like a bowling pin with Randy\n\n43:29.280 --> 43:35.600\nQuaid's head on it what's the what's the machine look like that you do you step in and like a booth\n\n43:35.600 --> 43:41.600\nor do they like a bunch of little dicks it's like it looks like a take give you like a hulu there\n\n43:41.600 --> 43:50.080\nshould be a setting for like a hot bruce valence or a sexy russell croak in the booth is there a\n\n43:50.080 --> 43:57.440\nbooth talking about the booth right now obviously it looks like a ticket booth when you catch all the\n\n43:57.440 --> 44:04.080\ntickets or dollars tsa it's tsa tsa booth it looks like a tsa booth it looks like a say you gotta\n\n44:04.080 --> 44:09.760\nput your arms above your head do you have to go like this is your character so below your head the\n\n44:09.760 --> 44:15.600\nwhole time do you do you keep your clothes on yeah that's a good question actually no your butt looks\n\n44:15.600 --> 44:22.400\nlike you put on like a special like blue like like neoprene bocaps suit yeah I bet Rob you could\n\n44:22.400 --> 44:27.840\nmake yourself in a video game oh Rob I bet you would be easy you'll be the default yeah I can never\n\n44:27.840 --> 44:34.720\nbe like the starter guy you're like done yeah the crash test dummy yeah you know it doesn't even\n\n44:34.720 --> 44:41.040\nhave the option I never yeah it's like this guy's not wearing shorts like he he doesn't have a beard\n\n44:41.040 --> 44:45.920\nit's terrible they don't have good beard options they don't have you know there's never like if there's\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:51.600\na male ponytail or even just you know you can pick female hair options as a male character holy\n\n44:51.600 --> 44:56.880\nshit that's better than most games I play it's just like I always look like a weird like Cheech and\n\n44:56.880 --> 45:04.800\nChong like cigar Indian kind of guy I think so you try to make yourself look like you too well I\n\n45:04.800 --> 45:10.800\ncan't I mean you would like to I would yeah but I had to compromise it's just never occurred to me\n\n45:10.800 --> 45:14.640\nand I don't know if it's because I'm a I don't know if it's because I'm a lady and I never had the\n\n45:14.640 --> 45:20.960\noption up until also now we're all sexist we just exactly thank you but I I mean to me I never\n\n45:20.960 --> 45:25.280\nplayed video games to be me I played video games to be someone else because I never had the option\n\n45:25.280 --> 45:30.240\nto be me until recently but I think that I think I think there's just a real distinction there\n\n45:30.240 --> 45:35.600\nwould I be shocked if we found out you could cross reference it with with gender of modern gamer\n\n45:35.600 --> 45:39.440\nI wouldn't be shocked to see there's a correlation of the data but but I also think it's it just\n\n45:39.440 --> 45:44.880\nseems to me I just think oh this is I'm a narcissist I'm just like look it's a negative word\n\n45:44.880 --> 45:50.880\nnarcissist but well we didn't pull them and say how many but it's not going to be an honest poll because\n\n45:51.760 --> 45:56.560\nbe honest because there's be honest there now it will be an honest everyone close your eyes if\n\n45:56.560 --> 46:01.840\nyou're in it if you're in a third date and you brought her to Harmontown first of all uh don't do\n\n46:01.840 --> 46:09.440\nthat bad bad third date but you're not going to be like yes I'm a narcissist I don't know I mean\n\n46:09.440 --> 46:14.080\nmaybe no but I don't think I I'm not saying that because you want to make yourself in a video game\n\n46:14.080 --> 46:18.960\nyou're a narcissist okay well okay but I put that in their heads I as a like all right so\n\n46:18.960 --> 46:24.160\nby applause when you play video games that let you design the character how many of you strive\n\n46:24.160 --> 46:33.280\nto make it yourself that's a solid number let me call that 50 percent of the there's American\n\n46:33.280 --> 46:46.080\npublic cat people yeah cat people about a bunch of little dicks or vaginas but but again be be\n\n46:46.080 --> 46:50.960\nhonest like how many you would always design your avatar or your player to be something totally\n\n46:50.960 --> 46:57.760\ndifferent than you but they're more extroverted people so they sound like more people I would\n\n46:57.760 --> 47:03.440\ncall that 40 60 though I mean like yeah it's pretty close a lot of little dicks it almost sounded\n\n47:03.440 --> 47:08.640\nlike like like half and half but the people that are more extroverted altruistic that are like I\n\n47:08.640 --> 47:14.000\nwant to be someone else I'm selfless I'm a wonderful person I mean I'm not a big that's a very good\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:20.080\npoint what he said was it's because I hate myself but but he did say it out loud in a room full of\n\n47:20.080 --> 47:27.360\npeople yeah I mean yeah and then you yeah then you subdivide that tree into if when you get to a\n\n47:27.360 --> 47:31.600\npoint of hating yourself when do you consider yourself a biological weapon that you fling at\n\n47:31.600 --> 47:36.560\npeople but I guess we're mostly not trunk voters like wait was I like but that's like that's that\n\n47:36.560 --> 47:42.000\ntroll culture of like of like you know what I'm so gross society's not made for me I'm gonna\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:50.400\nfling myself on you like multiple migs and a fucking reference that is what trolls are they\n\n47:50.400 --> 47:54.800\nweaponize themselves and just like fling themselves yeah look how gross I am that's why\n\n47:54.800 --> 47:59.120\nthat's why the smart people can be into Donald Trump I'm not saying it goes tanned in hand but\n\n47:59.120 --> 48:02.640\nI'm saying that's why it's possible for that archetype to exist because if you feel enough\n\n48:02.640 --> 48:08.000\nlike you know the prom queen's always winning and let's see how she likes it and it's like\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:13.280\nthe more the more he misspells tweets the more he like reveals himself there's a it's that that's\n\n48:13.280 --> 48:19.360\nthat connection however I think his his revealing that he has no interest in net neutrality and also\n\n48:19.360 --> 48:23.440\nonce everyone's I know I think he's losing his computer troll demo because he doesn't really\n\n48:23.440 --> 48:29.760\nstand for anything obviously and so that that's been like it's so I mean there's so much why don't\n\n48:29.760 --> 48:36.400\nyou stop talking about politics get back to doing a podcast hey you know that uh fate fate of the\n\n48:36.400 --> 48:42.000\nfurious did really well this weekend now that's what I'm

character a furious one what and fast so like but like attribute-wise\n\n49:16.080 --> 49:20.320\nyou want to be somebody else but physically you want to still like if you could draw yourself in\n\n49:20.320 --> 49:26.480\nthat world it's you I have you can and he did for harm for Harmon quest I assume you had a say in\n\n49:26.480 --> 49:30.800\nthe design of your character that looked like you well I had a say in the fact that it's funny if\n\n49:30.800 --> 49:35.600\nyou're doing like like recognize the formula need the people need to look like the people but but\n\n49:35.600 --> 49:43.680\nthe uh but in point of fact that when we played dnd here pathfinder uh uh and in heart all that\n\n49:43.680 --> 49:51.600\nstuff I've made a conscious effort to not like I don't try to I haven't played like stealthy assassin\n\n49:51.600 --> 50:00.400\ncoward characters which I usually um I uh note taken like because I because I actually was like I\n\n50:00.400 --> 50:03.760\ndidn't have that thought in my head I was like well when you played when you were a kid you always\n\n50:03.760 --> 50:10.080\nwere like engaged in this weird like oh you're the it's it's you as the coolest guy in the world\n\n50:10.080 --> 50:15.440\nlike that's gonna be your character and then when we started playing uh up here I was like yeah\n\n50:15.440 --> 50:19.920\nwhy don't you do what normal people do and play like a fantasy character that you aren't you know\n\n50:19.920 --> 50:24.400\nso be like a yeah I don't know like a warrior but that's why I want to be like a cleric when we\n\n50:24.400 --> 50:29.600\nstart playing again like a holy person because I want to split the diff and have the right to be\n\n50:29.600 --> 50:35.600\nwrong about shit yeah and not good at stuff by the way we are Dan and I have drawn characters up\n\n50:35.600 --> 50:42.080\nwith Spencer we are starting up a new uh role playing thing coming up we just wanted to we\n\n50:42.080 --> 50:46.800\nwant to time it with our move to the new for a Harmontown oh wow when we go to the other new\n\n50:46.800 --> 50:51.600\nspace we're gonna actually kick off a whole new campaign wow how how do you feel about moving\n\n50:51.600 --> 50:57.840\nDan are you having any sort of emotional feelings emotional feelings as opposed to\n\n50:57.840 --> 51:05.920\nunemotional feelings are you having any sort of emotions what feelings are you having and what\n\n51:05.920 --> 51:12.720\nemotions well I I don't know you know I guess I guess I have like a weird uh intellectual\n\n51:12.720 --> 51:22.720\nversion of an emotion which is that I feel like do you I don't know like I feel like I'm supposed\n\n51:22.720 --> 51:27.440\nto feel stuff and that makes me feel oh no you don't have to no no no I'm just I'm not I'm not\n\n51:27.440 --> 51:31.840\nsaying you're making me pressuring me to have feelings I feel when I think about it I feel\n\n51:31.840 --> 51:37.200\nlike I'm supposed to feel things and then that makes me feel sad just like the remember when\n\n51:37.200 --> 51:42.800\nthe sleep with me our friend came on the podcast that you weren't here but uh it's just part of\n\n51:42.800 --> 51:49.280\nmy endless quest to fill your fucking vacuum um uh we had a we had a guy in here shut up uh\n\n51:49.280 --> 52:00.640\nuh everything's been fine since you left I've

role in our team who is this we were talking about a chorus line the musical it\n\n52:10.400 --> 52:13.760\ndoesn't matter don't get distracted by any of my tangents we were talking about a chorus line\n\n52:13.760 --> 52:19.200\nthe musical and the character in that musical who has that song about how she feels nothing and then\n\n52:19.200 --> 52:23.920\nand the nuances of that about how feeling nothing around actually be the most emotional experience\n\n52:23.920 --> 52:29.280\nyou have that's how I feel about meltdown and meltdown said do you well you've been here for\n\n52:29.280 --> 52:36.400\nfive years and you've done lots of shows and I don't break down in my podcast heart and thought\n\n52:36.400 --> 52:41.040\nI've been in this room for a long time yeah and I look at the pillars that are always in the way\n\n52:41.040 --> 52:51.600\nand I and I said to be a comic and I feel nothing but but but but your show's not going away so it's\n\n52:51.600 --> 52:57.600\nyou don't have to feel like we stopped doing our show in october we did it for six years\n\n52:58.480 --> 53:04.480\nokay how do you guys feel you just heard about it yeah what is your feeling like what's your\n\n53:04.480 --> 53:09.920\nemotional well I was like a bunch I was I was sad when it happened but now even though it's only been\n\n53:09.920 --> 53:15.600\na few months it's kind of to me this sucks it kind of feels like it never happened it's this\n\n53:15.600 --> 53:20.960\nweird thing where when I like every now and then I'll get a ghost of a feeling of what it felt like\n\n53:20.960 --> 53:28.240\nto do that show but for the most part it feels like it never happened like it's sad but okay\n\n53:28.240 --> 53:39.680\nanother mpr piece uh if you these people that have uh uh hu hu uh superior here fuck like why\n\n53:39.680 --> 53:45.760\ndoes it come fucking come superior this my own life graphical memory or something like that uh-huh\n\n53:45.760 --> 53:51.680\nsuit sumac it's they have some it's very similar to photographic memory but they have just like\n\n53:51.680 --> 53:56.640\ninstant recall of any detail from their own life they're not always a hundred percent accurate but\n\n53:56.640 --> 54:02.000\nif they that they they can remember every day and every moment and so you spend this time like\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:07.440\nsuper jealous of them because how could that ever be bad and uh like like they can be like oh what's\n\n54:07.440 --> 54:11.280\nthe best season of friends well I'd have to go back to episode that that's like holy shit that's a\n\n54:11.280 --> 54:15.040\nsuperpower you must be great in a writer's room you would be great at everything you do you'd be\n\n54:15.040 --> 54:21.200\ngreat in a relationship you forgot aha they remember every fucking relationship they remember\n\n54:21.200 --> 54:28.000\nhow in love they were like it was yesterday all right they don't they're not able to forget the day\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:35.040\nit turned from good to bad they're not able to forget how how how it felt to to to to be willing\n\n54:35.040 --> 54:41.040\nto die for somebody and then and then to feel that same way about another person uh two years later\n\n54:41.920 --> 54:47.040\nso they're both and they're just like they're haunted by well that's the thing part of getting\n\n54:47.040 --> 54:53.760\nover something is having to forget some of it you kind of want time is best served ever coldening\n\n54:55.760 --> 55:01.600\nvery like you kind of like life right life is something that you want to happen right now\n\n55:02.160 --> 55:07.520\nnot a while from now right a minute ago you want to you want it to even though it seems to go a\n\n55:07.520 --> 55:13.680\nhuge waste you kind of want to die uh like like eventually you want to have and then when it thinks\n\n55:13.680 --> 55:17.200\nyou're going forward and you have an emotion that feels like when you felt before that's how you\n\n55:17.200 --> 55:22.560\nend up feeling connected to like this like this deeper current of like whatever the emotion is\n\n55:22.560 --> 55:26.800\nlike you and that's a lovely feeling I think when you get just that hint of like oh I've felt this\n\n55:26.800 --> 55:31.840\nbefore whether not it's pain or like happiness or whatever it is like that's the shit to me that's\n\n55:31.840 --> 55:37.280\nlike that taps you into the ocean when you have an emotion now that reminds you of an emotion that\n\n55:37.280 --> 55:41.360\nyou had it's such a it's a big thing in therapy to be like okay when have you felt this way before\n\n55:41.360 --> 55:46.320\nbecause often it you're actually reacting to something that happened like five clicks back\n\n55:47.040 --> 55:51.040\nin your emotions but you're just still you haven't dealt with it yet so it's just coming up now\n\n55:51.920 --> 55:57.120\noh wow I have my my therapist obviously we got missiles are about to drop on us and all the stuff\n\n55:57.120 --> 56:02.000\nso you know she's so who needs therapy yeah so there's a lot of anxiety and like like I don't\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:06.240\nknow for me it's also like I'm 44 and I'm like I'm right I'm right in the fucking crevice I'm right\n\n56:06.240 --> 56:12.480\nin the tile grout between the bathroom tile where you're part of the brotherhood of man\n\n56:13.120 --> 56:18.320\nnot to be exclusionary but and then the the bathroom tile where you're kind of one of\n\n56:18.320 --> 56:22.640\nthese old fogies that we all hate that archetype that's just like well fuck off young folks get\n\n56:22.640 --> 56:27.120\noff my lawn and enjoy Medicaid or whatever like and you're kind of like just like this isn't my\n\n56:27.120 --> 56:32.400\nbattle you wouldn't hire me anyway you're agist and like just like I'm getting close like like\n\n56:32.400 --> 56:38.240\nwhere I can like start ignoring the world and claim that I lived my life and pay my dues but\n\n56:38.240 --> 56:43.760\nI'm yeah I'm right in between there and I never did shit for anybody the first go round and so\n\n56:44.800 --> 56:48.080\nI was explaining this to her I'm like I don't know when to care and when not to care I don't know\n\n56:48.080 --> 56:52.720\nif that's like I feel like the nerve endings deadening in my soul I said like but at the same\n\n56:52.720 --> 56:57.120\ntime I feel like I'm remapping my neurology now I care about people but now I'm just realizing\n\n56:57.120 --> 57:04.480\nhow fucking dumb they truly are and my therapist said like she's like let me tell you the story\n\n57:05.200 --> 57:13.200\njoke I heard and she says so there's this cop and he's walking and and then there's a there's\n\n57:13.200 --> 57:18.880\nhe sees this drunk guy stumbling around in the dark and and the cops goes up to him and says\n\n57:18.880 --> 57:26.640\nuh hey what are you doing uh what's going on I'm a cop and the guy this this therapist is\n\n57:26.640 --> 57:34.800\nterrible at telling jokes and and the guy says like well I'm I'm I'm drunk and I lost my keys\n\n57:34.800 --> 57:41.280\nI'm trying to find my keys I can't find them and the uh and the cop says uh well where was the last\n\n57:41.280 --> 57:46.320\ntime you saw them where'd you have them where'd you lose them and the guy says oh back over there\n\n57:46.320 --> 57:52.720\nuh uh you know down the down the block there and uh the cop says why the hell aren't you looking over\n\n57:52.720 --> 57:59.600\nthere and the guy says well this is where the light is uh and I said and I said to the therapist\n\n57:59.600 --> 58:04.960\nwho believe it or not told the joke pretty much that way that wasn't me I was like well there was\n\n58:04.960 --> 58:09.360\na lot of pipe in that fucking first act like are you sure we shouldn't fade into the police academy\n\n58:09.360 --> 58:15.200\nwhen the the cops like uh but none or more I thought about it I'm like oh I'm the cop that's\n\n58:15.200 --> 58:20.720\nwhat she was inviting me to the atonement with the stupidity like you go you go wait a minute this\n\n58:20.720 --> 58:27.120\nperson dunning dunning Kruger effect whatever like you go uh oh this person doesn't get it\n\n58:27.840 --> 58:31.440\nthey don't know that they should they're not going to find their keys over here just because this\n\n58:31.440 --> 58:35.840\nis where the light is but there's darkness all around us and everyone's drunk and everyone's\n\n58:35.840 --> 58:40.800\nstupid and if you are privileged enough to be a cop it means that you knew somebody or lived long\n\n58:40.800 --> 58:45.200\nenough to like get a badge and you're walking around and part of your job is to like help people\n\n58:45.840 --> 58:52.240\nand like you like they're dumb but you don't have to like you know that that story wouldn't it wouldn't\n\n58:52.240 --> 58:55.520\nmake sense if the cop pulled out his night stick and started beating that man in the head it all\n\n58:55.520 --> 59:01.600\nmakes sense like it is what would happen on facebook but it wouldn't it wouldn't if you were that\n\n59:01.600 --> 59:06.800\ncop you wouldn't do that it wouldn't make sense because he's only just stupid he's not doing\n\n59:06.800 --> 59:14.000\nanything like wrong or and I was like oh yeah I guess and I was like what you but isn't that nihilism\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:17.840\nisn't that just kissing cousins with nihilism and isn't that what the bad guys think nothing\n\n59:17.840 --> 59:22.960\nmatters so let's just fuck shit up and she's like well you can spend your meaningless life\n\n59:22.960 --> 59:29.360\ndoing whatever you want you can care about people or you can you can hurt them and I was like oh\n\n59:29.360 --> 59:34.880\nlike a video game like which is what we do when we're disconnected like some people enjoy their\n\n59:34.880 --> 59:40.960\ndisconnection by hurting things and when I play video games I tend to go like oh I get it that\n\n59:40.960 --> 59:46.240\nfucking prostitute I shouldn't have hit her with a baseball bat like like like you wait but are you\n\n59:46.240 --> 59:50.000\nso bitter with the baseball bat I shouldn't have hurt her I was learning what the buttons did\n\n59:51.760 --> 59:56.640\nthat's what they all say that's what they all say the fan says it to you ladies do not listen to\n\n59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.600\nthat shit get out of there get out of there that makes it easy to hit a prostitute with a baseball\n\n01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.880\nbat yeah it practically happens by default there's a but there's a button that makes you pick up a\n\n01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.800\nbaseball bat and hit a prostitute if you are holding the X it's the X button anyway it's a square\n\n01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.480\nactually no but like I remember playing half-life the first half-life and the first half of half-life\n\n01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:28.080\none fourth life it was quarter life there was a scientist that was like I remember like are you\n\n01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:37.040\nnot gonna react to it I'm still here I'm sorry anyway I was I remember like it took me there was\n\n01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.640\na scientist in my way or something and I had to like I had to shoot I had to shoot him with a\n\n01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:51.280\nshotgun and I Schrab are you gonna miss meltdown yeah sure yeah what are you gonna miss most about\n\n01:00:51.280 --> 01:01:00.960\nhim yeah you crying no I did my spit went down the road it's 9-11 uh this is the only room where\n\n01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:08.000\npeople are like 9-11 Emily and Camille uh like you guys have been in the longest this is your\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.960\nplace like you guys well we haven't we kind of like October is when we did our last show here\n\n01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.400\nand we haven't really been here that much it was weird for me where this place is like I have like\n\n01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.200\na lot of memories about like theaters like like like places you've performed yeah but this place\n\n01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.640\nbecause it's this low dark ceiling it's like it's a little weird like outer space little like\n\n01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:36.640\nlike box I'm not gonna look back on this and be able to draw it's it'll just be empty space\n\n01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.560\nand looking down and seeing Spencer over there and seeing Brandon here and you guys here\n\n01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.200\ndown this line and then the first three rows of people here for better or for worse\n\n01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.480\nand this space is like the opposite of an Indian burial ground it is and this space is magical\n\n01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.080\nit is absolutely magical and the most positive yeah well the first time I came in here when we\n\n01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.320\nwere visiting Los Angeles we came here because a friend of ours said that there was a show here\n\n01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.360\nand I walked in and I was like I just want to be here and the first time I went to that room in the\n\n01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:11.760\nback I I'm like uh yeah it's actually we just walked in because there was a comic book shop\n\n01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.200\nbecause we ate across the street and then when we were here we heard the show yeah we came back\n\n01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.520\nhere and we won't watch the so does that mean the shows that are new place are gonna suck no but\n\n01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.120\nyou'll consecrate it no but what I will take away from this place uh is not like any of it like the\n\n01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:34.320\narchitecture or the geography of this place it'll really be like uh people memories not not physical\n\n01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.120\nlike spatial memories but I bet there will be like like the smell of the place at some point\n\n01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.040\nyears from now you'll walk in here and you'll be like oh my god I didn't know that this place\n\n01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.680\nsmelled like just the feel of the air conditioning yeah or like the fucking cricket you know the\n\n01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.960\ncricket a fucking cricket and by the way there were extra poles here there used to be extra uh\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.720\nthere used to be extra poles here that we got removed but when we leave here what happens to\n\n01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.200\nthis room like when this is not a theater anymore it cools off a little I'll tell you that for nothing\n\n01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.440\nsure like will this be used as this might be a restaurant still be shows here I think what will\n\n01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.920\nthis who's buying this place who what's it going to be oh I don't know I don't know and even if I\n\n01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.920\nyeah is somebody buying the place I don't know why we're leaving I've never really asked that\n\n01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.880\nDan Dan why don't Dan you should buy the place I think we've I think we've overstepped our bounds\n\n01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:40.000\njust the back room though I will say that I will say that it has been my dream for a while to\n\n01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.800\nmove into a venue that was just like the equivalent of I would liken it to\n\n01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.400\ntaking a fish from an aquarium putting in a slightly larger aquarium simply to make sure\n\n01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.240\nwe're not stunting the fish's growth not because we want the fish to turn into a something amazing\n\n01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:03.280\nbut just to just to let organic activity continue to take place like like and part of that is like\n\n01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.320\nthe bandwidth the various like technological things that are kind of boring to talk and think about\n\n01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.920\nbut as we've been doing the the live stream I've just been seeing a potential to like\n\n01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.640\ncomplete a feedback circuit that where the people that are watching the show can be reacting to\n\n01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.960\nlike the odd thing that we throw up whether it's a chart that the audience made or a I don't know\n\n01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.040\nI don't really want to get it like I'm gonna sound like I'm pitching some dumb show like to but but\n\n01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:38.560\nI just I just have me a feedback circuit right now what we have is the ability to show the people\n\n01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.240\nat home like if you know if we if we gave Kris Boruff a photo ahead of time I could go cut to\n\n01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.000\nthat photo and he'd go Roger sir I need cut to that photo I want to get to a place where we can go\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.320\nso then so well anyways yeah but I took a picture of this lady at the bank and then I that's a bad\n\n01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.440\nexample I'm gonna like harass somebody at the bank but like there's a picture of my dog pissing\n\n01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.480\non my girlfriend's feet and then I'll like like pull it up as a better example and then and then\n\n01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.640\neveryone's looking at it at the same time and it's just sort of like like graduating us from a\n\n01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.320\nviewer access cable to late night cable talk having shot three seasons of a tv show here I can say\n\n01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.800\nthat it is it has its limitations for sure and you have to like we brought in extra generators we\n\n01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.480\nhad to bring in like stuff just to like keep it going for sure it wasn't built you had to bring\n\n01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.880\nin a cricket assassin to to get rid of the cricket we didn't we left the cricket in that's a cricket\n\n01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.800\nyou can't I mean they're

when somebody asks you if something's in their teeth and they go like\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.560\nthis uh it's like and they they've thereby revealed that they have so much confidence in their teeth\n\n01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.040\nto begin with like like they're just like do i have something in my teeth and they go uh and it's\n\n01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.000\nlike well i either they do or they don't but in any case they have beautiful teeth no matter what\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.520\nand then and i go like no you don't have anything your teeth and then i and then i'm like well

same reaction yeah it just it just it's amazing the other person is fine like\n\n01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.440\nthey should they've got beautiful teeth and i just like but then i just like oh my god i

that person oh really i hate people like people that like share their\n\n01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.680\nfeet on their headshot they're like look at me yeah hey uh emily emily uh do do i have something\n\n01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:04.640\nin my toes right now i feel good about my feet i feel pretty confident in my feet but i don't\n\n01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.640\nwith my teeth like even though i've had we started going to a dentist who was great\n\n01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.360\nand then they got bought by a cosmetic dentist person yeah so now they're all different like\n\n01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.080\nthey're like um so you think the like what did he told you that my teeth were gentle\n\n01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.600\njacked up i've been going to this place for years and they were like great and they're like oh your\n\n01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.960\nteeth are great great check up and then i went in and they were like well we have this new owner\n\n01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.680\nand this new doctor came in he was like your teeth are jacked up and i was like that's not nice\n\n01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.040\nbut i did let them talk me into getting my teeth whitened with like a laser most painful thing i've\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.240\never had done in my life and i've had lung surgery and it weakens your teeth so like it's beautiful\n\n01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.880\nbut they're more likely to chip yeah they're whitening them by shaving off a layer of yellow\n\n01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.840\ntooth and for days afterwards i would get like these pains that i would just do where she really\n\n01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.160\nwould it was like um it would be like uh it was like you but with no bug in the hair uh she really\n\n01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.760\nwas i'm very confident in my teeth cavity wise i could go to the dentist and they go like oh you\n\n01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.120\ndon't have any cavities and stuff but i just think they look like little kernels of gnarled\n\n01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.320\ncorn you gotta see movies from the 70s though that's so true because jesus yeah those teeth are\n\n01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:20.160\nfucked up and they put white pancake wicker man fancy if you put white any british film holy\n\n01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:26.160\nyeah why is it like that why is that stereotype like because because uh world war two that they\n\n01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.160\nhad no fluoride there was a lot lack of vitamins and so teeth weren't really a priority that there\n\n01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.000\nwas uh children were raised with no vitamins and the teeth were really weak so so laugh it up\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.960\nwow but why does that go down to like our british friends who are younger than us like\n\n01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:50.400\nwhy shouldn't they have fluoride by now i think they just gave up they just found out well hey man\n\n01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.400\nyou could be fucking james bond and not give a fuck and it turns out you don't need it yeah\n\n01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.680\nyeah well yeah i mean it's only a cosmetic thing i just find myself uh thinking about teeth when i\n\n01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.080\nsee some of a beautiful gleaming teeth chiclet teeth though sometimes i like and by the way you\n\n01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:11.520\nknow dentist you know like look there's a ton of really cool it's just like cops there's probably\n\n01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.480\nmore good one more good dentists than bad dentists but there it is like a very if you want to be\n\n01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:24.560\ncorrupt and work anywhere near medicine dentistry is like Erin McGathy worked for one 800 dentists\n\n01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.040\nand like she i don't know am i gonna get in trouble but but no you're okay i think i think she's she\n\n01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.480\nmust have talked about it but like it was like the corruption that like like like like they just like\n\n01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.120\ntell old ladies you need veneers and like they take their social security money and stuff like\n\n01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.000\nthe the yeah i just remembered that she gave me her email address once and it was it was like\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.520\nerin at one 800 dentists and i was like you sure about this one you just gave her email address\n\n01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:55.200\ni don't think she uses it anymore try email her see what happens wow but yeah that's a fucked up\n\n01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.880\nindustry yeah like this dentist then to me would be like yeah you know your your if i did this your\n\n01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:08.720\nyour smile would be better i was like what fuck you the perfect smile i like my dentist i have\n\n01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.440\nlike my front teeth are kind of like the front two go in because of baseball hit me when i was a\n\n01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:19.200\nkid and this one over here it's like jags out because uh i have that too like that one sticks\n\n01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.080\nout because diana matter was seen in my sophomore year of high school not scary farm ran into me at\n\n01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.640\nlike a haunted house and she knocked my tooth up into my head so this one sticks out dear up a bit\n\n01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:35.280\ndidn't hurt her at all she moved my tooth into my brain and she didn't get a nick what part of her\n\n01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:41.440\nbody did that top of her head oh god you would think that would cut a person she she was dazed but\n\n01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.840\nfine my tooth went no and so just like last week i went to the dentist and they gave me an x-ray\n\n01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.400\nlike this like super duper tron x-ray where you can see like i saw you posted it yeah it was weird\n\n01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.680\nit's really weird it was like a 3d rendering and they're like okay that you might have a\n\n01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:05.520\na future abscess on this one tooth right there oh i'm like there i go the one that sticks out that\n\n01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.680\none here i go yeah i said well i got hit there really hard once and they go okay that might be\n\n01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.560\ntrauma maybe that's why but it might be an abscess in the future but they wait are they like pre-cods\n\n01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.520\nabout tooth well they're saying that they they saw like a little dark spot above that tooth\n\n01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.120\ni go well that's the one that sticks up there they go yes this dark up there i said well i got nailed\n\n01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.840\nthere a long time ago and they go oh that might be just that could just be trauma that you might be\n\n01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.920\nfine but or you might get $50,000 surgery yeah but one of my doctors said you know if you want\n\n01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.760\nbecause you're you're an actor like we can have that straightened up for you and the women that\n\n01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.680\nthat clean the teeth are like don't do it like like leave your teeth weird like like like like\n\n01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.120\nleave your teeth weird leave your teeth weird yeah almost always nobody like perfect teeth are a\n\n01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.440\nlittle dreary a little dull but you notice i don't know but sometimes you see someone with\n\n01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:00.880\nperfect teeth and you're like that looks great there's like a hot there's like a it's true like\n\n01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.280\nsometimes i'll have a friend who you he said i'm gonna go get my teeth straightened why not like\n\n01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.280\ndon't do it don't do it and then they come back the next week you're like you look great yeah it's\n\n01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.360\nlike a it's like a hotening i think it happens to actors actually more than actresses but you'll\n\n01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.720\nif you go back and look at uh what's jesse from Breaking Bad Aaron Paul if you look at him early\n\n01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.200\nhe's like a guy if you saw him in the street be like all right fine they did something to him\n\n01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.280\nyeah it happened to Jake Gyllenhaal too he used to be a weird looking little dude and then at some\n\n01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.520\npoint they just like put him in a machine and he came out like a hot actor they have a captain\n\n01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.800\namerica machine that they're exactly they're like Chris Pratt we all know oh yeah what happened to\n\n01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:42.960\nChris Pratt he just went into settings and like changed some sliders and now yeah he looks like a\n\n01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.680\nfucking superstar with your teeth and then somehow your eyes get wider like they do a bunch of things\n\n01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:57.120\nhuh that's yeah the the winner of all is tom cruise that's right he fucking had his front tooth\n\n01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:03.040\nover here and top gun his teeth are like real yeah but then he was famous for being handsome for a\n\n01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.360\nwhile and was part of his personality he was the most handsome guy in the world with hands down\n\n01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:14.560\nbut have you seen him the most the he's got a balloon head he's he did he looks so weird\n\n01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.440\nit happened to him i'm on tom cruise's side robin redford tom cruise doesn't look weird what\n\n01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.920\ndo you mean he's done something he's he did something he's got a balloon head it's like a\n\n01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.600\nhead spread it's that we go years between seeing him so the next time we see him he's like three\n\n01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.920\nyears old but he does have some Scientology stuff going on for sure it was the second jack\n\n01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.120\nreacher thing like no Scientology what the Scientology puts puff puffer fish in his face\n\n01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:46.320\nyeah no they they use bats that are like um they're legal but they're like um uh stem cell\n\n01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.080\nface washes i'm not joking what yeah they're ruining tom cruise i mean i'd like to see him get\n\n01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.160\nold i'd like to watch her get old but i think it's like when wrinkles start they want to like\n\n01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.240\nyou got to fill him in and if you have a balloon that's like losing air you blow it back up you\n\n01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.600\nknow what i mean like that's what they're doing stem cell baths there's a bath of stem cells i'm\n\n01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:13.120\ntelling you there's a face thing you can get with stem cells you can get a hand wash\n\n01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:21.920\nstem cell next to the sun face i like any like you can get a stem cell facelift any there you go\n\n01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.800\nyes but that's just a facelift any famous actors or especially actress what when the like the uh\n\n01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.960\nthe critter is so like demanding to be perfect in every possible way oh yeah when you see somebody\n\n01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.920\nfamous with with flawed teeth or or a wonky like her nose that goes a little bit this way or like\n\n01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:43.600\nsomething unusual and something asymmetrical that's sexy that's like ryan gosling's wonkai\n\n01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:50.960\nkid whoa oh what are you talking about no that wonkai it's nice why does the show always\n\n01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:58.000\nget so shallow when you come on it emily gordon you drag the show he's talking about his teeth\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.840\nattractiveness uh yeah well she wrote a book about uh she wrote a book just for ryan gosling\n\n01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:11.040\nabout how to have higher self-esteem i mean i don't look in the mirror it is it is weird the\n\n01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:17.040\nline between the stuff that we would do or not do like i like like what qualifies is like uh\n\n01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:25.520\ndishonesty and honesty like yeah for men if we start losing our hair if we if we seek to do\n\n01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.640\nsomething to make it look as if we still have it there's a stigma there that that's like well\n\n01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.840\nit's a zero-sum game you get away with it or you're a horrible person for trying right you gotta\n\n01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.240\nstart early and and and it's like and so you're you're you're gonna go to either side of the\n\n01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:49.120\nplace it's like like like you know i've known Schrab for 25 25 years jesus christ i met you when\n\n01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:55.360\nyou were 18 he was he was bald when i met him yeah like like he was just out of college and uh so i\n\n01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:02.720\ngotta yeah we we Schrab has looked the same for 25 years no no if you if you find a photo of him\n\n01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.960\nwith any hair it's so gross you want to puke what was your hair like i agree what was your hair like\n\n01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:14.960\nwhat was i hair like what

it's\n\n01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.760\ninteresting the stuff like like oh that part just kept getting every part of your every part of your\n\n01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.640\nbody that has anything to do with well humanity because all of it will have to do with aging we\n\n01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.840\nit's like we have a tarot card for every single part of our body like like oh i just had some\n\n01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.600\nhand work done like there's no stigma against that right uh or i don't think there's a stigma against\n\n01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.080\nif you get hair transplants and like you said if it's like if it does if it's not super obvious\n\n01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:52.640\ni feel like i feel like everybody gets hair transplants i feel like i'd rather i'd rather\n\n01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.680\nhave a i'd rather have jude law with hair than jude law without hair but but also but it sucks\n\n01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:03.120\nfor jude law because he like he just missed it by like 10 years you know what i mean like same\n\n01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.800\nthing happened to a young pope he's a young double door the weird thing about it though is that what\n\n01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.480\nis it that we want like what it's like we walk this weird line when we even before we have a\n\n01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:20.480\nconversation about it with anybody our perceptions walk this strange razor thin line where we're\n\n01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:30.720\nperceiving another person we want them to have been perfect but so we'll hold it against them\n\n01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.480\nif they've done something to pretend to be perfect but if that something is working out for eight\n\n01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.240\nhours a day they're the best fucking person in the world but if they have no control over it we don't\n\n01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.920\nlike if you're boring like it's just so weird the things we hold against people and that we don't\n\n01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.880\nright working out okay but if you're like losing your hair which you have no control over and you\n\n01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.040\ndo something to obviously get your hair yeah we've never i don't know what it is but it's like\n\n01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.000\nnow i just started like i started i take a picture of the back of my head and then i or i'll see\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.760\nsomething in the back of my head i'll go oh god it's such a shock but it's just like it's just\n\n01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.840\nbecause like oh i didn't i didn't expect that to look that way i didn't expect to see my scalp\n\n01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.520\nso much and it's all it is is just i wanted more control over this i wanted to be like the elves\n\n01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.440\nin the Tolkien universe or i just like decide after a great debate at Rivendell that it's time to\n\n01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:30.800\nproceed yeah but but like i

out\n\n01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.360\nand you want to you want to scrub it away but we all have we all have friends that have horror\n\n01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.960\nstories of stuff that they've tried done and they they come back and they they hate themselves even\n\n01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.600\nmore or but there's probably some stories in there people that just had a grand old time

movie\n\n01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.880\nthat's really autobiographical as opposed to a giant blockbuster that's autobiographical\n\n01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.520\nbut it kind of it's about a world where apes take over the world right it's inspired by\n\n01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.360\ntheir relationship or how it began the quirky it's crazy how good it is have you seen it yeah

heart though it's still got i can't it's still it's still very\n\n01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:05.840\nmoving Doug very moving experience but it's every joke lands it's so funny it's hilarious you've

should\n\n01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.320\nhave done a bit when we found out we had too much show we should have we should have thrown together\n\n01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:18.560\na bit where like police came out and like did a lottery and selected someone for voluntary\n\n01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:28.560\nremoval no and then dragged them off it would have been funny hey hey brandon brandon it's only a bit\n\n01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:36.080\nyeah until we get to the police car and then the jail and then the judge haha did you guys see the\n\n01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:42.960\nthing i it's it's so it's so funny that it has to be like a photoshop fake thing but it was i i\n\n01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:52.240\nit was like the united app updated and somebody and it was somebody retweeted the snap of the united\n\n01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:59.840\napps update where it says like new features uh drag and drop feature i can't be it has to be like\n\n01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.320\njust a photoshop bit but it was so perfect they didn't drop that guy they dragged him though do you\n\n01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.840\nguys ever get so angry at society that you're actually you actually get experience pleasure at\n\n01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.720\nsomething like that like like like just mean deeply confessional don't fucking high road me you millennial\n\n01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:26.720\nshit facts i will say value my candor i will say that flying a lot made me jump to the uh sure\n\n01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.160\nthis guy was being treated poorly but when they said get off our plane and he said no i'm not getting\n\n01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.360\noff the plane he wasn't taking into account all the people on that plane were now going to leave\n\n01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.240\ntwo hours later and the next plane that was going to take off when that plane got to where it was\n\n01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:47.200\ngoing to go is taking off hours later like the longer that guy sat there and resisted getting\n\n01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:54.960\noff the more people he was inconveniencing through his behavior right but but you're right\n\n01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.960\nthey shouldn't oversell the airplane but that's what they do so when somebody comes in and says you\n\n01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.800\nhave to get off now but they but they spent that entire time saying we'll give you an $800 rebate\n\n01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.520\nand all this mouth yeah they could have easily they could have kept going higher but some asshole\n\n01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:18.320\ndecided let's stop it there because we're doing a great job i don't know why they even try to do\n\n01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:24.720\nthat like i don't know why so maybe we agree yeah i thought you were throwing the guy that got beaten\n\n01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.400\nhalf to death under the bus and going like well why didn't that guy consider the needs of all\n\n01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:34.000\ni am saying that when someone with a badge says to get off of this plane unfortunately you have\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.280\nto get off the plane fuck that because because because because at that point that's when it's\n\n01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.880\ngoing to get ugly instead of working it out i think it's important that it got ugly though i mean i\n\n01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.880\ndon't think it was what they should have said okay fucking two thousand five thousands eventually\n\n01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.920\nsomebody goes ten thousand like the highest bidder they lost so much stock yeah what if what if he went\n\n01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.480\nit was stupid not to just keep driving i'll get off for nine hundred if somebody next to him because\n\n01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:04.160\ni'll get off for nine hundred dollars well congress at the limit congress actually set the limit at\n\n01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.680\nthirteen fifty thirteen seventy five so yeah so start there that could have easily been the really\n\n01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.120\nfunny bit you had that twinkle in your eye really thirteen hundred thirteen seventy five\n\n01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:19.440\nbut they were here forty forty five forty five forty five forty five forty five forty five forty five\n\n01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.680\nfifty five fifty five forty five sixty but they did have to set they did have to set a limit\n\n01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.480\nbecause the shit did pop off so much so the truth of the matter is they should have had him up at\n\n01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.800\nlike twelve they should have gone to the limit but he still wouldn't have gone and it's very important\n\n01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.480\nto him to get home for some reason i'm sorry i'm sorry i grabbed this thing it was because i was\n\n01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.680\ngrabbing this holy shit what is that thing i just wanted to say it how many gigawatts is that going\n\n01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:49.920\nmaybe you shouldn't overbook your flights because he's the thing right why is that a business\n\n01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.080\npractice that's because a lot of people don't show up for flights and then they make that money and\n\n01:29:54.080 --> 01:30:00.880\nthen they make that'll i don't know a lot of money then they make that money with an empty seat\n\n01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:09.040\nbut they have chosen to regard an empty seat and free money as lost money because that could\n\n01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:14.560\nhave been another person absolutely and so every christmas they go uh ladies gentlemen just to\n\n01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:21.840\nremind you we do have a full flight no idea how the fuck that happened you motherfucker you you're\n\n01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:31.440\ngreed you're endless bottomless greed yeah i've been yelling about this forever wait but here's\n\n01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.160\nwhat happens dan can here's what happens when they do not allow they're not allowed to overbook\n\n01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.160\nflights anymore oh they go out of business because they're so accountable to the laws of capitalism\n\n01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:47.600\nno they they raise the ticket prices it's gonna cost us money that they can't do that anymore\n\n01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:53.280\nit's just one situation got fucking out of hand one intransigent chinese doctor to fuck it for the\n\n01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:58.560\nwhole group oh and all the other i don't know how this guy likes to he likes to wear a panties on\n\n01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:04.080\nhis head like well his past has nothing to do with what happened there that turned out to be fake\n\n01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:09.840\nwas it was just racism it was some other guy with the same asian sounding name and they're like must\n\n01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.080\nbe the guy listen by the way because they hadn't gotten a statement they didn't know who the guy was\n\n01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.840\nand i don't even know who that guy was but the first thing i thought when i heard his accent and i\n\n01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.520\nsaw and he's blood trickling down and he was going like just kill me just kill me i want to go home\n\n01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:27.280\ni'm like look like like like maybe this is maybe this is also kind of racist of me maybe it's like\n\n01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:32.960\nlike the right kind of racism where i'm like you don't know right when you hold a lottery on a yes\n\n01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:38.480\nthe right kind of racism i.e. consciousness of the possibility of anybody being from yeah he\n\n01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:44.240\nwould they were throwing him off because he was asian well no but i'm saying like you don't know on an international\n\n01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.240\nflight you don't know when you're when you're saying well let's hold a lottery and then let's go up to\n\n01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:54.480\nsomebody like i didn't i was like that do we know about that guy's life like like what trauma he's\n\n01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.800\nendured or his parents or whatever like he could be from anywhere where when that happens it means\n\n01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.040\nyou're fucking dead or it's like emotionally i don't mean like he's like bulky and perfect strangers\n\n01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:09.040\nand he doesn't understand he's a doctor he probably has critical

watching it the way i would which is to sit there and go nice one\n\n01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:09.520\ngood job pick on someone your own size like if i've that may be my one recourse to heroism

they'll admit they're a fucking cartel and an\n\n01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:44.160\nalaskan airline's jet will pull up and have a magic tube got and half the customers will get\n\n01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.360\nsucked aboard and everything will turn out to be totally monopolized and price fixed like maybe\n\n01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.400\nthey can drive their employees across the country there you go like like like maybe they could offer\n\n01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.360\nten thousand dollars twenty thousand thirty thousand forty thousand maybe they should maybe maybe\n\n01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:05.120\nholland oats should come aboard like uh like like maybe maybe the plane should turn into a submarine\n\n01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.760\nall i know is i have no control over it you don't you don't want to be a submarine that's bad because\n\n01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.960\nof that but did they did they did they taze the airlines are too big there's too much going on\n\n01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:23.040\ni i i know but like do you those four or five people made the decision to do that to that guy\n\n01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:28.080\nit wasn't you know i mean they were following like the corporate structure of the rules but\n\n01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:31.840\nthey could have kept offering more money they stopped at eight hundred dollars yeah they\n\n01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.440\nshouldn't have they could have kept going but somebody was like i'm gonna be a good employee\n\n01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:42.320\nand save the company money and fuck that person for like not just going to the limit to stop something\n\n01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.960\nlike this from happening it would also be nice if the police officers didn't respond with some\n\n01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.760\nsort of corporate hypnosis right they just came in and just were like yeah we'll do it we'll just\n\n01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.480\nget this guy out of here and it's like well why so

01:36:07.600\njetway got on the plane and was but how that is an important what i thought you had him you\n\n01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.560\nthey dragged his lifeless body off the plane well i think you can file that under uh end for\n\n01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.800\nnot my department the cops go right oh you dragged him off oh and then they're like\n\n01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.240\nmy job's to

neck you do yours\n\n01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:38.880\ntemple to peck there you know dug dug it sounds like you have a lot of opinions about airplane\n\n01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.960\ntravel yeah about about justice about about the criminal justice system about the way that we enact\n\n01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:51.280\ncorporate power over the paying customer yes um also i think you you know Harmontown well enough\n\n01:36:51.280 --> 01:37:01.120\nto understand that now you are engaged in a angry rap battle oh no yes oh no yes that's all i wanted\n\n01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:07.520\nto do when i get up

groaning\n\n01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:21.520\nbecause you think he's using the uh outdated uh racist slur chinese doctor which is what we used\n\n01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:29.760\nto call italians that hasn't been a racist phrase since the 1860s italian americans are perfectly\n\n01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.680\nfine we don't call them chinese doctors anymore dug dug you don't have to rap but you certainly\n\n01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.760\nhave to be here while it happens because dan has a lot of shit to get off his chest i did want to\n\n01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:45.840\nannounce to thank you to all our new subscribers who since we announced it the the week uh by matching\n\n01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:53.120\nyour donations or matching your sign of fees uh when after we announced it we raised uh 21,950\n\n01:37:53.120 --> 01:38:01.440\ndollars for the aclu oh yeah an argument could be made we were slow on the uptake like that that the\n\n01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.000\naclu you know there was they had a big windfall but another argument could be made i think money\n\n01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.480\nfor the aclu is like toilet paper i don't think it expires and i think it always gets used for\n\n01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:14.880\nsomething very important um that we that we don't want to think about a lot even though i haven't\n\n01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:20.880\njoined yet and i haven't watched fucking atlanta i i i i didn't i need to join the aclu and watch\n\n01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:27.440\nfucking atlanta i did get out get out get out dammit no get out get out yet i'm so it's gotta be\n\n01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.320\non apple tv any day now though i let's go so fast i did not know the amount but that makes me very\n\n01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.560\nhappy i mean like that that's a lot of money and they know exactly where to put that money so\n\n01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:42.400\nthat's very cool yeah and anybody that listen to the show and thinks that uh donations to the aclu\n\n01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:49.760\nis is money misspent i would say fuck straight off into the night well i think it would be a good\n\n01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:53.920\nexercise to use your compulsion for proving things wrong and poking holes with things\n\n01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:01.200\nresearch the aclu go go back and find out if you can find corruption or like malfeasance or anything\n\n01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.480\nand i don't say that rhetorically it's just that i've never when when when trump got elected it was\n\n01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.240\nlike they were like a lighthouse they were there right away and it was like this is gonna be a\n\n01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:16.960\nlegal battle like like like 90 of this battlefront and uh yeah and and and it was uh it was when it\n\n01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.680\nwas at the whatever what am i babbling about whatever but it's it's like there is no there\n\n01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:26.640\nis no aclu gate there is a you will you will see a history of them being vilified because they\n\n01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:34.160\nrepresent civil liberties which sometimes involves defending the rights of people to say and do shit\n\n01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.600\nthat uh makes them people you don't like and and we all have like an emotional some people hate it\n\n01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:45.520\nwhen you defend the oppressed they are not down with it and the aclu is there to do it like we\n\n01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.840\nwill have an emotional like we don't want like like yeah it's like it's hard to be an objective\n\n01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.320\njust like oh you know what i'm in favor of i'm in favor of freedom plain and simple every once in a\n\n01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.400\nwhile that's gonna make you an advocate of of a loudmouth that's saying like really mean nasty\n\n01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.960\nthings uh and stuff like that or or like uh saying that somebody got somebody's trunk we know that\n\n01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.960\nthere's something in there but you know what you don't have a fucking right to search it yet because\n\n01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.720\nthe important the right to search that person's trunk has to hold stronger like you can't you\n\n01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.760\ncan't blow up that right with anything in that trunk even and it's like it's not a popular position\n\n01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:28.080\nsometimes they're an agency that's always a confederacy that's always like i had like been\n\n01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.640\nfighting for us and like there's a lot of tomatoes that has gotten thrown their ways and and and so\n\n01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.760\nlike like i mean they were badasses when i showed up at the airport first yeah that was amazing and\n\n01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:41.600\nthey were miserable because they were there all day and night and people were coming up screaming\n\n01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.480\nat them and like they're doing a shit job for probably not a lot of money or maybe no money at all\n\n01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:54.400\nand uh that was a rough gig and they sat there and got shit done and had people released out of\n\n01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.720\ncustody because they shouldn't have fucking been in the first place um all right and then\n\n01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:07.040\nyou know now and now and now Planned Parenthood is next like we'll have to figure something out we\n\n01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:12.240\ncan't just keep on saying every every dollar that the podcast makes but we'll have to we have to\n\n01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.880\nthat's more of a defensive game where we're like you know the ACLU is like let's put money into\n\n01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.560\nthe pockets of the people that show up at the briefcases when people are being illegally fucked\n\n01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.160\nwith um you know Planned Parenthood is more tragic i'd be quite i'd be quite happy you're\n\n01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.960\ndoing the same thing for Planned Parenthood because they need protection more than anybody\n\n01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:35.040\nright but we can also sort of just want to throw it out local we got to start local it'd be cool if\n\n01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.400\nwe started local too because uh then maybe we can have those people on yeah we could set an example\n\n01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.320\nin LA like like blossom out word like with the Planned Parenthood around here you should think\n\n01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.360\nabout great proofs from the smartest uh uh sparse man in the world podcast he when he travels he has\n\n01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.800\nPlanned Parenthood there at every event like like like organizing and doing stuff like that and i know\n\n01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.360\nthat by saying this on a podcast there'll be six assholes that call us baby killers because they're\n\n01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:06.480\nidiots uh it's it's it's protecting not just women's rights mostly women's healthcare but it's not\n\n01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.040\njust women it's also everybody but mostly it's women's healthcare and the idea that women get\n\n01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.200\nto do what they fucking want and it's also not i mean cody pointed this out to me i didn't i didn't\n\n01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.000\ni don't i don't know nothing from nothing the the the Planned Parenthood they they they've\n\n01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.400\nassociated with you don't walk in and get a free abortion you pay for the fucking abortions that\n\n01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.720\nyou get there it's not it's not why they're there it's also three percent it's healthcare for poor\n\n01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:34.160\npeople it's it's it's it's it's there it's like they're for for for women that aren't they're\n\n01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:39.200\nlooked at as a as a some kind of pre-existing condition um and it's a place where you can get\n\n01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:45.040\nthe shit that's not paid for the the the the idea that it got wrapped up in a oh well yeah but the\n\n01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.800\nabortion thing that's controversial there was nothing controversial about people being taken\n\n01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:53.440\ncare of and they fucking did it again they unplugged the whole thing yeah it's it's it's
