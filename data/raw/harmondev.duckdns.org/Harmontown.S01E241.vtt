who you had naturally what what what what was up with harvey

01:34.400 --> 01:38.400
uh looks like you got a lot of microphones on those chairs there seems like you got plenty

01:38.400 --> 01:44.160
over there where no one is i thought you guys were gonna have two mics over i thought that too

01:44.160 --> 01:55.840
yeah that's what it sounded like well it's uh you know nigel uh he likes to burrow he's like

01:56.880 --> 02:01.520
part sheet zoo he's a foot warm and dog you're blaming nigel for the lack of microphones

02:02.880 --> 02:08.000
did he burrow through them late last night he burrowed down Cody was just starting to get

02:08.000 --> 02:13.440
along with him they were just starting to like each other and uh he burrowed down to the bottom

02:13.440 --> 02:18.480
of the bed and at some point during the night he pissed on her feet under the under the blankets

02:19.840 --> 02:24.240
that's it that's my story about him i wasn't i didn't come here tonight to talk about that i

02:24.240 --> 02:30.400
just like but so Cody hasn't learned to love or nigel yeah that was what i said that was the most

02:30.400 --> 02:34.480
interesting part of that story no they but there's no love lost wait how does that how does that

02:34.480 --> 02:38.720
expression work has there been any love gained there was you have to have loved there was no

02:38.720 --> 02:44.080
animosity between the two it's just like it's just you know nigels can be a little bit of a piece

02:44.080 --> 02:49.920
of shit like he's a he's a he's a he's a garbage dog he's a he's a he's a garbage you know he

02:49.920 --> 02:55.120
causes trouble but when i was first settling down with Cody into a into a monogamous relationship

02:55.120 --> 03:00.080
her first experiences with nigel were her having to scrub him in the bathtub because he darts at

03:00.080 --> 03:07.680
skunks yeah like he like you know he's a he's a he's a he's a waste of space but but but but but he's he's

03:07.680 --> 03:16.560
here in my life forever i would not have adopted one dog let alone two had i see nobody sees divorce

03:16.560 --> 03:20.960
coming i would not look at myself and go like now there's a guy that should have two of anything

03:22.720 --> 03:28.160
and while you're at it make a mammals that that with emotional needs and stuff but but but try

03:28.160 --> 03:32.240
don't get distressed if you're listening to this as a dog lover i know i can't watch hoarders episodes

03:32.240 --> 03:38.320
that involve the animals like i'll just like nope this one's got cats in it nope uh because i know

03:38.320 --> 03:44.960
i the idea of an animal not being taken care of is very distressing right rob yes okay absolutely

03:46.000 --> 03:52.080
so do not listen to this podcast and think oh is dan have attended to dogs that are like like eating

03:52.080 --> 03:59.440
their own feet or anything like that they're not just his friends no i i throw a lot of money at

03:59.440 --> 04:06.800
making my dogs they have a dog sitter who's not at the audio department who's rob steve

04:06.800 --> 04:10.640
leaving informed me that there's a microphone flying in for you right now so you're going to

04:10.640 --> 04:17.040
be well mic'd to uh to the audience's great detriment all right look i don't have anything

04:17.040 --> 04:21.040
it's not like i have an act with a monologue what i mean this is this is sort of a farewell like

04:21.040 --> 04:27.440
we're leaving the meltdown as a venue uh and this is our second to last show as you pointed out uh

04:27.440 --> 04:32.240
and uh so we're saying goodbye to a place that's been our home for five years five years can we

04:32.240 --> 04:39.120
ring the crickets and the people walking overhead yes you never heard the sound of the crickets

04:39.120 --> 04:43.600
and the people go scrump scrump scrump well i never heard the scrump well look it's been five years

04:43.600 --> 04:48.320
and we've been drinking a lot i'm sure a lot of stuff happened that i don't remember you never

04:48.320 --> 04:52.880
heard the ghost of old man higgins haunting this place one thing i definitely remember

04:53.440 --> 04:59.600
is everyone always saying they miss kumail nagyari

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
and emily garden

05:05.600 --> 05:15.600
yeah oh

05:16.880 --> 05:17.600
hello

05:22.000 --> 05:31.280
oh goodness emily emily welcome back kumail the baby's crying kumail welcome back

05:31.280 --> 05:36.720
two two guests the audience missed so much that rob had to sit on the table with no microphone

05:37.440 --> 05:42.160
there's a lot of show tonight we have a lot of friends coming that's like you know let's bring

05:42.160 --> 05:51.280
out the harlem globetrotters

05:51.280 --> 06:02.640
wow that was great that was great i thought i thought metal like lemon was much taller than

06:07.360 --> 06:11.040
that was particularly funny to anyone who's never seen the show before i don't know what

06:11.040 --> 06:16.720
like like what was that guy what did they was that do they have the globetrotters here

06:16.720 --> 06:23.200
but no theme song i was hoping you heard the theme song but i mean you know as i've pointed out

06:23.200 --> 06:28.000
like emily you're the george washington of Harmontown like you you said to me at the roost you

06:28.000 --> 06:32.240
should have a podcast and then i was like no i'd rather do a show and then i we've already talked

06:32.240 --> 06:38.000
about this but you're you're the you're the you're the reason the show ever was here and existed here

06:38.000 --> 06:44.720
because of your involvement with the meltdown also because this was a brand new space and like

06:44.720 --> 06:49.280
i was desperately looking for shows and for like voices that didn't have like a stage

06:49.280 --> 06:52.960
and this is what i thought needed needed a stage and needed an audience and i was just

06:52.960 --> 06:58.240
remembering actually in the way here they remember the first show we ever had when at eight o'clock

06:58.240 --> 07:04.000
when the show started i was at the grove at the apple store trying to buy something for your laptop

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
oh my god do you remember that because you wanted to like show a video because it was so important

07:08.000 --> 07:12.640
yeah it's so it's so weird what i thought was important i remember like the first the first

07:12.640 --> 07:18.000
couple weeks of doing shows here i would sit with dustin marshall after we started recording

07:18.000 --> 07:22.960
in a podcast and i remember go over to his place once a week and sit for like four to six hours

07:23.680 --> 07:29.120
don't add anything the ums and urs and if you listen to the first couple episodes maybe

07:29.120 --> 07:33.600
you'll hear like a weird stilted i'm like what yeah because that's what this podcast that's it's

07:33.600 --> 07:39.520
bread and butter is it's concision i don't i don't anyways but yeah at some point we just didn't

07:39.520 --> 07:42.800
have the time to do that and it was like wait the standards are way lower than this obama just did

07:42.800 --> 07:50.160
marron yeah anything could happen yeah but they did edit the ums and urs when obama did strikes

07:50.160 --> 07:55.200
and the emails they deleted the emails and it was like 45 minutes of me at the apple store on the

07:55.200 --> 07:59.680
phone with matt myra of all people trying to like figure out i jack i'm sure you remember this kind

07:59.680 --> 08:04.080
of yeah and then i came back and i was like oh i'm so sorry dan i couldn't find the thing and you

08:04.080 --> 08:08.480
were like that's fine i just want to play the video yeah i was like okay cool let's start the show then

08:08.480 --> 08:12.640
i think that it was the only reason for whatever that equipment was is that the first show i did

08:12.640 --> 08:17.760
here it wasn't podcast but it was like i had spent i stayed up all night designing this flag

08:18.880 --> 08:25.840
on photoshop wait you did this this was like till three a.m and then you did this yes and you

08:25.840 --> 08:32.720
haven't fixed it no no that's it that's its final form what do you mean fixed it's great well i i'm

08:32.720 --> 08:40.240
so sorry i didn't um it's finished you know it's it's all dithered and shit well okay yeah all right

08:40.240 --> 08:49.600

i try to remember what for our listeners we're talking about the uh the Harmontown uh poster

08:58.960 --> 09:07.280
yeah i feel like it's a city a city founded without tyranny uh or society founded without tyranny

09:07.280 --> 09:14.320
latin written without understanding is that really what it says yeah it says latin wow

09:15.040 --> 09:22.560

11:41.600 --> 11:48.480
understanding and and pay watch when you say it's going up against them do you mean and yeah we're

11:48.480 --> 11:54.960
battling them in what sense for you guys this is how hollywood works they put us in a room and make

11:54.960 --> 11:58.720
us fight each other and then whoever wins wait what's the actual question well you're distributing

11:58.720 --> 12:02.720
your own movies so some people are probably curious about that what do you mean by going up against

12:02.720 --> 12:08.160
like we're opening the same day we're all going wide the same day as planet of the apes which is a

12:08.160 --> 12:16.240
week oh don't do that that's bad oh my god don't do that don't do that don't do that that's like

12:16.240 --> 12:20.720
the fish bank theory you should tell that to do that yeah okay i'll send an email motherfucker

12:22.480 --> 12:29.440

two weeks after transformers also the house which is a will ferrell amy polar comedy these are all

12:34.800 --> 12:40.480
things for you know they call that hollywood they uh they call it the sweet spot right you guys are

12:40.480 --> 12:46.480
right i like everyone's like getting scared here like oh no they shouldn't have done that is there

12:46.480 --> 12:50.960
is there a different league you're allowed to play in if that would be your option good i'm not i

12:50.960 --> 12:57.040
don't dwell in this dii feature world where i don't like it like is there like is there like well

12:57.040 --> 13:02.080
a way to not have to well what we're doing is no because the movie theater is well we'll tell them

13:02.080 --> 13:07.600
there's a couple interesting things that we didn't know that now so we're opening only three cities

13:07.600 --> 13:11.840
and then we're going to slowly expand and they want to go up to like pretty big and you know

13:11.840 --> 13:17.680
lions gate is releasing it so it's going to get if it can support it it'll get ultimately a pretty

13:17.680 --> 13:23.680
big release but it's only starting like a lion like a lion roaring into your theaters yes but

13:23.680 --> 13:30.160
there's a thing it's called cinema con and what you do is it's a convention and you go and all the

13:30.160 --> 13:35.600
movie theater owners are there and you show them parts of your movie and you try and convince them

13:35.600 --> 13:39.920
to play it in their theaters well there's two roles they'll have different they'll have celebrities

13:39.920 --> 13:44.800
there that are there to like be like rewards for the cinema owners to be like oh my god you guys

13:44.800 --> 13:50.320
are so great you get the rock and then they have us who are like just begging them to like look how

13:50.320 --> 13:54.880
great we are you want to see this movie right put it in your theater so like we spent the entire time

13:54.880 --> 14:00.240
they got wooed by the rock and then we begged them basically those are the two levels wouldn't you

14:00.240 --> 14:06.640
say well you begged but you know they were very excited to meet me no they don't they don't give

14:06.640 --> 14:13.280
a shit it was the rock and John Cena and then us and what was funny was the Amazon the Amazon is

14:13.280 --> 14:16.240
the one who bought it but they're releasing it in theaters they had they had a thing they're like

14:16.240 --> 14:21.200
we're going to do a sketch we're going to be like bring up the marketing head of Amazon and then

14:21.200 --> 14:25.440
you come out and you've kidnapped the guy and I was like most people are just going to think oh

14:25.440 --> 14:31.440
that's the marketing head of Amazon you do look like a marketing head that's true oh I guess that's

14:31.440 --> 14:38.640
the guy he's slightly more comfortable on stage than you would think what is the third city

14:39.520 --> 14:45.440
Chicago okay you know the second city is the third city the second city is the third city

14:45.440 --> 14:53.120
but the plan is to keep yeah expanding as much as we can but yeah baby so those of you listening

14:53.120 --> 15:01.280
Rob Schrab has gotten a microphone it's not working though it's fine perfect leave it exactly that's

15:01.280 --> 15:06.240
great that's perfect it should not be hooked up to anything can we get less work can we get less

15:06.240 --> 15:23.680
Rob in the monitors please okay so so today I was at a Dino's Easter dinner party and I was talking

15:23.680 --> 15:29.760
to somebody that works at the star burns our studio our modest studio and I was running my

15:29.760 --> 15:35.760
hands blithely through my locks because I was kind of high and then I was like like feeling

15:35.760 --> 15:40.320
and then everyone's while I felt something like it was like wait what is there a bug in my hair

15:40.320 --> 15:45.200
I don't know but it's not didn't feel enough like that it was probably a leaf I mean if it was a

15:45.200 --> 15:50.000
spider and I touched it it'd be gone by now it or it bit me or whatever and then I keep I keep running

15:50.000 --> 15:54.400
my hands through my hair and I'm just listening to the conversation and then and this story does

15:54.400 --> 16:01.520
not go where you think it's gonna go I am I I've never been more excited for a story no it's gonna

16:01.520 --> 16:06.800
disappoint you that you're gonna realize I was turned on my blithely through my locks so I finally

16:06.800 --> 16:13.440
like touched something that felt it triggered my fingers to think that like I was like I did

16:13.440 --> 16:18.800
feel like it's my body felt like I oh there's a there's something in my hair that's alive or

16:18.800 --> 16:23.840
that shouldn't be there and my reaction was my honest to God reaction as I was talking to this

16:23.840 --> 16:31.840
woman like I was just talking to her in a driveway and then I was like yeah and then she was like

16:31.840 --> 16:36.880
like through it there was it turned out to be nothing but I would have if there had been

16:36.880 --> 16:41.200
something in my hand I would have thrown it onto her so but from her perspective you were just

16:41.200 --> 16:47.520
like hey hey yeah yeah she didn't she didn't I was surprised I was telling Dino later it was like

16:47.520 --> 16:52.880
yeah I was talking to and like I guess she was like I guess she didn't know she'll never know

16:52.880 --> 16:58.480
that I'm a horrible coward that would throw a bug on her if it was on my head oh wait what was it

16:59.120 --> 17:03.360
it was nothing I don't know it was like I was high I was high and so I was like ah damn there was

17:03.360 --> 17:07.200
that tree in the backyard that kept like like oh there's probably things falling off yeah there's

17:07.200 --> 17:10.800
this little kind of like small brewery flowers that would come out so it was one of those that's

17:10.800 --> 17:16.720
that makes that makes sense what what if it was a bunch of little dicks that's a valid question

17:16.720 --> 17:22.800
well we gotta my favorite is his smug face after and look at that he's so happy like what if it was a

17:22.800 --> 17:28.160
can we get camera seven and rub smug face right now that costs five bucks a month that that smug

17:28.160 --> 17:34.800
face otherwise you just have to hear the free audio of what if it was dicks dicks in your hand

17:34.800 --> 17:40.560
yeah okay what if what if that was you ever think about that yeah ran a mic out for him

17:40.560 --> 17:48.960
but then dino said dino said no five people had to scramble to find out a way to get rob a mic

17:48.960 --> 17:58.000
I had to make it worth it for that but then dino said oh no she no she's very low key she's cool

17:58.000 --> 18:01.760
and I said nobody's cool with someone throwing a bug on them because she didn't react at all she

18:01.760 --> 18:06.000
just thought I went there but she is cool and he's like no no no she's she's she's but what what if

18:06.000 --> 18:14.240

18:23.760 --> 18:27.040
well dressed this buck story is riveting yeah

18:28.720 --> 18:34.160
hey you know it's yeah but then then what came up in that story was uh well whatever

18:34.160 --> 18:39.600
now no no no get to it no well I can't because I named her my name now and then I but the like

18:39.600 --> 18:43.280
because I will take the name I actually didn't hear the name oh okay all right yeah maybe we can

18:43.280 --> 18:52.080
bleep out the name her name was Stephanie because then wait wait the one I thought was fascinating

18:52.080 --> 18:59.040
is dino said yeah have you ever really talked to her like she uh she she uh uh is a christian to

18:59.040 --> 19:04.560
to some degree like I don't I don't want to I don't want to invade this person's privacy or like speak

19:04.560 --> 19:10.480
speak for their ideology how dare you but uh I think I think she's like a 12th degree question

19:10.480 --> 19:13.760
he said he said she's like she's like a brown belt

19:19.280 --> 19:23.520
he said she's very she's very low key and it's because it's because of her beliefs because I was

19:23.520 --> 19:26.880
talking to her at one point it was like oh that was very nice of you and she's like oh please

19:26.880 --> 19:32.320
you know if I didn't think God was watching I just put my foot on someone's face and just grinded

19:32.320 --> 19:41.600
into the cement she said that but God is hearing you say that right but God's like that's the I mean

19:41.600 --> 19:46.240
you know it's an extrinsic God he's like thank you for thinking that and then showing some restraint

19:46.240 --> 19:51.280
I gotta take a poop I'll do it in the toilet I want to grind that person's face into the pavement

19:51.280 --> 19:57.600
I'm gonna not do that God thanksgiving God is gonna go take a poop in the toilet all right like

19:57.600 --> 20:02.720
he's like oh that's interesting I have to take a shit anyway that's what volcanoes are it made me

20:02.720 --> 20:10.160
wonder is God taking a poop yeah is he upside down that's too he's inside there God is in the center

20:10.160 --> 20:17.680
of the earth and his shit is like white hot right yeah because he because he eats so sexy yeah he's

20:17.680 --> 20:22.480
all the sins that's what Pompey was they got cotton some shit more like poo pay anyway

20:24.080 --> 20:31.120
little dicks little dicks hey little dicks sorry Kamel's gotta go here but Kamel Najiani everybody

20:35.040 --> 20:40.960
he's very hurt my husband is very okay that shit doesn't scan we drove by a hot church today

20:40.960 --> 20:44.720
you know the hot church the hot church the hot christian church there's a oh is that

20:44.720 --> 20:49.680
is that when the girl puts her foot on the back of your head and then your dick goes in your own

20:49.680 --> 21:01.120
butt and yes what are you talking about are you talking about mosaic yeah mosaic it's a very la

21:01.120 --> 21:06.640
church that's like hot sexy like hipsters and hipsters wait is that the one on like we want to

21:06.640 --> 21:12.480
make a right coming on highland or Hollywood and there's a bunch of like max a bunch of models

21:12.480 --> 21:17.680
hanging out yeah and they're not inside worshiping god they're all outside getting phone numbers

21:17.680 --> 21:22.240
and can I say something there was a step and repeat outside of mosaic when we were driving

21:22.240 --> 21:25.680
here because it's Easter step and repeat is where you go to like stand in front of like a red carpet

21:25.680 --> 21:32.640
they had like a red carpet in front of their church today forgot it's a holiday yeah and there

21:32.640 --> 21:39.040
were girls in stripper heels and I was like let them let them worship too you know less G not be

21:39.040 --> 21:51.360
judge unless you judge less G that's right just like my dad used to say well I guess that's what

21:51.360 --> 21:56.320
I was your next answer is coming out rendering the season where there's diseases but get your

21:56.320 --> 22:04.400
dollars out for Magdalene there were really hot people there super hot we were always hot people

22:04.400 --> 22:08.960
no I make I make a right driving here all the time and sometimes I just want to pull over and start

22:08.960 --> 22:14.960
going to that church everybody's good looking yes that's maybe the way it to christian and also

22:14.960 --> 22:19.360
those people probably would grind your face into the pavement if they didn't think that there might

22:19.360 --> 22:25.760
be a god that would prevent them from getting phone numbers as long as they're grinding it made me

22:25.760 --> 22:30.640
it made me think too you know maybe we don't you know we kind of tend to look at like religion and

22:30.640 --> 22:35.680
as problematic and go like well you know people that take it too seriously they get there they

22:35.680 --> 22:39.760
think all kinds of things and they use it to justify like violence against people and oppression

22:39.760 --> 22:46.880
and all this stuff but how much of it is the glue that holds our nation's many many stupid together

22:47.680 --> 22:51.680
and just keeps them in their living rooms just and maybe keeps them away from the polls

22:51.680 --> 23:02.480
wait the stripper or voting yeah which polls oh the stripper both Jesse Jackson and say both

23:04.800 --> 23:09.200
you know I mean I look I've come around to the conclusion and I know I'm late on this one but

23:09.200 --> 23:15.520
everyone's dumb like like like like most people are dumber than you and then I let a lot of then

23:15.520 --> 23:22.800
you add into that what's it called the Dunning Dunning Kruger Dunner Kruger what Dunning Kruger yeah

23:22.800 --> 23:28.240
I've been I've been having that spit at me on Twitter it's when you're an idiot you think that

23:28.240 --> 23:33.360
everyone else is an idiot because you can't conceive of even average intelligence the the

23:33.360 --> 23:38.000
dumber you are the smarter you think you are it's the Lake Wobegon effect they used to call it but

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
they actually kind of like where everyone's above average that thing that they they they

23:44.000 --> 23:49.120
administered a test to everybody whatever a group of people and uh and then they said

23:49.840 --> 23:53.920
last question how you think you did yeah and then they and then they create you know they've

23:53.920 --> 23:59.440
mathematically proven that yeah the the the more wrong you are the right I'd say dumber because

23:59.440 --> 24:04.000
the the interesting thing about the radio lab or not radio lab American life pieces that I was

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
talking about it was that went on to say it was like you could be this is just for anything that

24:08.000 --> 24:14.720
you're dumb about like if Stephen Hawking went from astrophysics into how to administer a catheter

24:14.720 --> 24:23.680
like like he within two weeks like he's not the guy I would pick even if I don't know much about

24:23.680 --> 24:30.720
Stephen Hawking can I get a little help Stephen Stephen Hawking little help over here look at

24:30.720 --> 24:37.840
look at Rob look at Rob I'll try to use less distracting examples by the way that was him

24:37.840 --> 24:46.640
20 years ago but you would uh he would for all as smart as he is about black holes and as much as

24:46.640 --> 24:51.200
he would probably say because he's super smart about black holes he probably assumes you and I

24:51.200 --> 24:55.840
know more about black holes than we're capable of that's the other end of the effect is that

24:55.840 --> 25:01.120
but he would also within two weeks of learning how to administer a catheter to like as a nurse I

25:01.120 --> 25:05.520
didn't like like he would go you know what I got this I could teach this at a university

25:05.520 --> 25:10.320
because he wouldn't know that much about it but he'd think well what it's like that's the that's

25:10.320 --> 25:15.440
that effect is the dumber you are at anything the less you know the more the more certain you are

25:15.440 --> 25:20.320
that you actually know it really does make sense and it's actually not that is that because you're

25:20.320 --> 25:25.280
angry or hateful or bigoted it's actually just the nature of stupidity and intelligence makes

25:25.280 --> 25:30.480
perfect fucking sense absolutely so now that we know that can we just kill all the dumb people

25:30.480 --> 25:40.480
before they kill all of us that's been a show guys good night they're gonna kill us what that's

25:40.480 --> 25:44.720
really scary because that means that there are no solutions right I mean it really means that

25:44.720 --> 25:49.120
there's no way out oh it you know it's a horrible ringing indoors because they're just gonna get

25:49.120 --> 25:53.680
more confident the less they know and then when you and then it doesn't it's not a huge billboard

25:53.680 --> 26:02.640
for democracy no it really is not that's thinking about medical care let the masses decide uh well

26:02.640 --> 26:08.480
most of us are so dumb we think cancer is a privilege I don't like they don't they're like

26:08.480 --> 26:14.240
why should I pay for other people's cancer I'll never get it no but you're so dumb you're so dumb

26:14.240 --> 26:21.200
you're gonna get cancer no I'm not I've thought about this for 30 minutes no but that's less time

26:21.200 --> 26:25.840
than a doctor well that's the thing that's not to me about climate change and stuff where they're

26:25.840 --> 26:32.400
like all these so-called experts yes they are experts this is what they study you want to be able

26:32.400 --> 26:37.040
to play Minecraft that means other people have to spend a bunch more time than you think about the

26:37.040 --> 26:43.280
fucking earth and shit that's right I don't know nothing about no taxes or Medicare or nothing so

26:43.280 --> 26:48.800
just take my money yeah take my money when your fridge breaks down what do you do you take it to

26:48.800 --> 26:54.000
a person who knows how to fix fridges that's right I'm glad we could agree as wealthy Americans

26:56.560 --> 27:02.000
everyone needs to wise up and stop being dumb and just make a bunch of money and sit and play video

27:02.000 --> 27:06.240
no it's all you have to do you guys it's all you have to do I think people have a right to be stupid

27:06.240 --> 27:10.160
though if they want to be they do yeah but then don't be confident about it they should be more

27:10.160 --> 27:15.840
ashamed they should be ashamed there was a culture in this country there is a culture in this country

27:15.840 --> 27:20.240
where you are dumb and then you'd hear yourself say something and then you just soon you'd go like

27:20.240 --> 27:27.280
oh I'm stupid oh whoa whoa and then you could go back in your basement amen go back in your basement

27:28.240 --> 27:33.120
I hear what you're saying but I'm just saying people do have a right to be stupid and there's

27:33.120 --> 27:37.280
nothing we can really do about it they have more than a right they control the fucking planet yeah

27:37.280 --> 27:41.600
they are controlling the planet you're talking like we live in some Logan's run world where we

27:41.600 --> 27:48.400
control carousel it's like wait where the crosshairs stop staring at me kumail I can't believe the

27:48.400 --> 27:56.240
things you've said I do think I think it used to be that stupid people were and I hate I mean

27:56.240 --> 28:00.640
people who thought themselves not as smart used to be ashamed of that fact and I do think there is

28:00.640 --> 28:06.240
this idea now that like no that's somehow a right like a right that you no one can take

28:06.240 --> 28:11.920
being ignorant has become like a positive trait it's interesting in America we're in the second

28:11.920 --> 28:19.120
act of a Disney movie like blank check or or a gumdrop tree or or what if you had a car you know

28:19.120 --> 28:25.520
like let's say like a Disney movie for for what feels like a kids fantasy where the second act is

28:25.520 --> 28:32.080
like you could you mean rick dukeman left a blank check and I could now you have a party at my house

28:32.080 --> 28:37.600
that it does the montage of like oh I have no grown-ups allowed there's a giraffe loose in the

28:37.600 --> 28:46.880
backyard they're sick and they're sick and tired people are sick and tired of of all these smarty

28:46.880 --> 28:51.680
pants is telling them they're stupid and now we're just living in the in the in the second act of

28:51.680 --> 28:57.040
their their novel well what's gonna happen in action it's their novel right hopefully they're gonna

28:57.040 --> 29:00.160
learn their lesson well they're gonna they should learn their lesson hopefully they'll like find

29:00.160 --> 29:06.720
out that being teen wolf is not worth like your teammates not getting to play basketball I but what

29:06.720 --> 29:12.560
happens and what happens in the third act of what if I had a car they run people over I mean

29:12.560 --> 29:21.280
there's always a you know it's like wow yeah so what so what's gonna happen what do we do there's

29:21.280 --> 29:28.560
no this I have never felt this I've always been very optimistic and I still feel pretty optimistic

29:28.560 --> 29:35.200
overall but my optimism now comes from the fact that at some point we'll all die and earth will

29:35.200 --> 29:43.280
regenerate itself and millions of years from now new life will start and it won't be look everybody's

29:43.280 --> 29:49.440
so nihilistic well I've been focusing on my on my Cody like I'm we're just we're just so all we

29:49.440 --> 29:53.440
know is that we have each other now and like we're just hoping that the missile hits like right on

29:53.440 --> 30:00.480
my house I feel like because I don't want to have to shoot my dogs we were yeah we were literally

30:00.480 --> 30:06.880
that's the first thing you're gonna do these dogs gotta go I don't know what's gonna happen

30:06.880 --> 30:11.760
that reminds me we have to pick up like it was a hoax man it was a hoax because explaining to them

30:11.760 --> 30:16.960
that what I think about explaining to my cat what's happening oh I am so jealous that she has no

30:16.960 --> 30:23.440
fucking idea she's so happy right now she's just like why can't I go outside in the morning anymore mommy

30:23.440 --> 30:26.960
yeah but imagine how stoked your cat would be if it really if you could really explain everything

30:26.960 --> 30:32.080
to it because your cat would also be explained you mean I'm part of a selectively bred species doomed

30:32.080 --> 30:39.200
to die of renal failure because the price the cost benefit ratio peaks out for my species and like

30:39.200 --> 30:44.320
I'm gonna I'm gonna spend the last six months of my life trapped in a home walking around yowling

30:44.320 --> 30:51.760
it but and and while you inject bags into the scruff of my neck like of cat fluid because I've

30:51.760 --> 30:58.640
become nothing more than a cat shaped container for cat fluid isn't that what they always are but

30:58.640 --> 31:03.360
then you go isn't that what a cat is a cat shaped container yeah but it's self-generated there's a

31:03.360 --> 31:09.280
pride there I don't know shouldn't everyone adopt the Chinese kid but we don't uh we keep we keep

31:09.280 --> 31:13.760
wanting it to look like us and the cats like yeah I wish it was my own cat fluid it doesn't like

31:13.760 --> 31:18.160
that any more than we do but then you tell it like oh oh no there's a missile that's been launched

31:18.160 --> 31:22.960
the cat would be the most stoked thing in your house because it would go like wait I get to go out

31:22.960 --> 31:28.400
with humanity yeah instead of being we're all the same now a Chinese takeout container on your

31:28.400 --> 31:36.000
mantle because you always meant to scatter my ashes yeah totally it's ultimate equality nuclear

31:36.000 --> 31:42.480
warfare we're all the fucking same we were in Seattle and we were reading this thing that was

31:42.480 --> 31:49.520
like don't worry if Kim Jong Un launches a missile it can only get to Seattle we were literally in

31:49.520 --> 31:56.160
Seattle we were on the plane and I was like fucking take off right now I literally was

31:56.160 --> 32:00.880
how long would it take for a missile from North Korea to get here it would take minutes but who

32:00.880 --> 32:06.480
knows minutes I don't think that's true who knows I hope just long enough minutes

32:06.480 --> 32:13.280
I like your response was it feels like what what feels right

32:15.280 --> 32:21.440
then why does it take five hours to get to Milwaukee minutes minutes so it's like a

32:21.440 --> 32:28.240
missile is super fast if I find out that the that the North Koreans can get to Seattle in

32:28.240 --> 32:36.720
minutes and it takes me five hours to get to New York that's fucking bullshit I'd rather be blown up

32:36.720 --> 32:43.120
well you now you know that so still Schrabs still Schrabs yes go ahead Schrab go ahead Schrab

32:44.400 --> 32:49.520
his mic out of his own stand Schrab made the same observation with Milwaukee instead of New York

32:49.520 --> 32:54.160
yeah well just moments before with the same amount of time you said five hours to Milwaukee

32:54.160 --> 33:01.440
you said five hours to New York why is your plane slower I gotta stop in Las Vegas okay sure

33:03.840 --> 33:07.040
because there's a layover to go to Milwaukee you can fly direct to New York

33:07.600 --> 33:12.320
but I don't think yeah Las Vegas you gotta see Britney Spears her show's about to finish yeah

33:12.320 --> 33:16.960
that makes sense but there is a comfort right to the idea of just like like just going away all this

33:16.960 --> 33:21.120
horseshit disappears just having a final countdown like lighting a candle with your girlfriend and

33:21.120 --> 33:27.280
like like this is it we have an hour left what do you want to do fuck I never finished Sopranos

33:27.280 --> 33:33.120
we never even started Sopranos yeah it'll be like some kind of like what we got two hours to kill

33:33.120 --> 33:38.560
what do you want to watch yeah it'll be like I'll be like well we should watch gone with the

33:38.560 --> 33:51.760
wind I never watched that 45 minutes arguing about what yeah I'm gonna get anything I want fried

33:51.760 --> 33:58.000
rice fried rice yeah donuts fried rice oh my god I don't know if anyone I'm actually getting

33:58.000 --> 34:04.560
excited for the apocalypse yeah I don't want to make me so hungry to die yeah I don't want to live

34:04.560 --> 34:09.280
through it I don't want to be on a wasteland fighting cannibals or gasoline I want to go yeah

34:09.280 --> 34:13.520
yeah I don't want to use my teeth for money yeah yeah

34:15.360 --> 34:22.000
can I get across the ferry sir that nobody gets across the ferry without paying homage to

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
Armoral Armoral his name is Armoral Armoral Armoral oh you're Armoral he keeps your seat shiny

34:30.000 --> 34:35.920
and the apocalypse a lot of tires aren't shiny enough by the way teeth is a pretty good because

34:35.920 --> 34:40.400
it would have to be something that there's a limited quantity of like what I do with the teeth

34:40.400 --> 34:46.000
though and pre-radiation precious like what do you do with them oh in the future it's for currency

34:46.000 --> 34:50.160
it's money yeah yeah in the future teeth are like pearls and you can wear beautiful necklaces to

34:50.160 --> 34:55.440
show people how far you've gotten in life oh it would only be scarcity that you'd be training on it

34:55.440 --> 35:00.800
would just be like well I know that these are worth I have eight times as much as it's only what the

35:00.800 --> 35:09.760
dollar is it's what if it was a bunch of little dicks that's right in the future the currency will

35:09.760 --> 35:19.040
be a bunch of little dicks that would be like a hundred dollar bill yeah what is the exchange rate

35:19.040 --> 35:28.800
between a bunch of little dicks and some teeth you don't want teeth of your dick so sorry by the

35:28.800 --> 35:35.200
way you can catch Kumail in Mass Effect Andromeda yes I am in the is that game good I haven't played

35:35.200 --> 35:41.520
it I'm not I just started playing it I it seems a little chunky like in terms of loading isn't it

35:41.520 --> 35:48.080
like a little don't fat shame the game man I'm fat shaming its memory drain or something like

35:48.080 --> 35:54.240
if you're a console game I shouldn't be experiencing like you're load shaming it what what load load

35:54.240 --> 36:02.400
load shaming you're because it takes a load shaming it yeah yeah you like that yeah but I mean

36:02.400 --> 36:07.440
I was like I don't know why it is like I've been on an airplane and saw some movie there's a Franco

36:07.440 --> 36:11.920
and a Hiblitz or something and then there's you like like a thing it's like I'm like oh there's

36:11.920 --> 36:17.760
Kumail well yeah I mean what what did I think I was gonna see him doing you know it's like oh he's

36:17.760 --> 36:21.440
in a movie that's his job comedy movie but then when you're playing a video game and you hear

36:21.440 --> 36:26.480
your friend's voice it's like really weird it's like it's closer to if you were in a porn movie

36:26.480 --> 36:31.520
that I was watching like actually I was in a movie called Mike and Dave need wedding dates and that's

36:31.520 --> 36:39.120
yeah I was very pornographic yeah is it I've been afraid to play it I you know I asked to be in it

36:39.120 --> 36:43.920
I there was like a developer of Mass Effect who would like talk to me sometimes and I was just like

36:43.920 --> 36:48.400
fuck it what's the point yeah I would so I just DM'd and I was like hey can I be in it and it's

36:48.400 --> 36:54.560
totally fine if you say no and then I'm the president in the game but now it kind of sucks

36:54.560 --> 36:58.880
because now I don't want to play it because I'm like what if I fucked it up and I fucked up my

36:58.880 --> 37:05.520
like favorite video game so I'm like very nervous to very nervous to play it I mean you know it's

37:05.520 --> 37:11.200
a Mass Effect game the only thing you're gonna ruin would be a conversation between right upgrading

37:11.200 --> 37:15.920
your armor it's like god damn when I fucked up massive yeah well they made me program the whole

37:15.920 --> 37:24.400
thing okay so it was very it's a little chunky yeah it was very racist of them to assume

37:25.920 --> 37:30.880
that I would be the guy for it but you did it I did it I figured it out I went on Wikipedia

37:31.760 --> 37:37.840
I could never figure out the chunk problem is the is the uh how far in are you how many

37:37.840 --> 37:44.400
hours two minutes okay so I show up that early well you're in the I'm not spoiling anything

37:45.520 --> 37:51.120
I you know your character not your character the royal you your character in Mass Effect the

37:51.120 --> 37:57.360
protagonist uh is uh you know it has there's a little kind of a pathfinder where a thing happens

37:57.360 --> 38:02.560
that's like kind of a disaster and it puts you in charge and so you're then you come in shortly

38:02.560 --> 38:07.680
after when he's sort of like you have to figure out oh I guess I'm the new boss and then you're

38:07.680 --> 38:14.160
checking in with your crew is this a game where you get to design your look yes yes I thank you

38:14.160 --> 38:18.800
for bringing that up I because I want to know we're just talking about what is wrong with me

38:18.800 --> 38:23.760
because I'm I I can't because I I made a character and I gave him like and I was like well I'm gonna

38:23.760 --> 38:28.240
give myself like gray hair because I want to like be old and be in this game turns out it's not an

38:28.240 --> 38:33.440
option you have a dad that's like so I just gave myself gray hair but I'm like younger than my dad

38:33.440 --> 38:39.520
but yeah but but but like I always I try to make it look like myself yeah and then and then but

38:39.520 --> 38:47.360
Justin Roiland co-creator Rick and Morty season three coming to a time time era near you uh the

38:47.360 --> 38:52.240
the uh Justin like I remember going over to his house when he was playing Skyrim and it was like

38:52.240 --> 38:55.840
what the fuck and it's like yeah no I always do I was just trying to make the person look as

38:55.840 --> 39:01.840
fucked up as possible I'm like so he like he just made he just tried to take with you however close

39:01.840 --> 39:06.960
together the eyes can be however wide the ear you know he'll just make every extreme choice and like

39:06.960 --> 39:12.320
come up with this like weird potato man that like and it makes so much more sense to me and while

39:12.320 --> 39:16.560
I'm making my character in Mass Effect there's some really impressive hairstyles and one of them was

39:16.560 --> 39:22.320
like this very like frode out thing so I had already created I'd already made it look a lot like me

39:22.320 --> 39:25.840
to me as much as I could but then then I was scrolling through the hairs and one of them was

39:25.840 --> 39:32.480
just was like bam like this like powerful fro like like but all tangled not like not like like a

39:32.480 --> 39:37.760
like a statesman in the 70s like a like a like like like this guy was like had bigger fish to

39:37.760 --> 39:44.880
fry spiritually and uh and and it was so funny it made me laugh out loud but I didn't use it

39:44.880 --> 39:48.720
and it was like why am I not following my joy literally anything but you're like no no that

39:48.720 --> 39:53.040
wouldn't be true to the character exactly it's like I didn't want to throw I don't want to come

39:53.040 --> 39:58.720
as close as I can I agree with you I don't I think if you want to set out to make yourself

39:58.720 --> 40:04.720
then make yourself and don't give yourself a fro but what is that narcissistic impulse we're playing

40:04.720 --> 40:09.920
games because we want to be someone else right here I'll defend myself it's because it's because

40:09.920 --> 40:14.800
I think the ironic thing is me like I'm Woody Allen when I'm in the during the Russian revolution

40:14.800 --> 40:19.360
so like that's why I figure the bigger laughs are to come if it looks just like me which by the way

40:19.360 --> 40:24.800
it can't because as as Cody Cody watch the room I said did I make it I try to make it look like

40:24.800 --> 40:28.560
me and she saw it and then she laughed and was just like you can't you can't so you you can't

40:28.560 --> 40:35.120
make them fat like you can't that's my problem with video game you can never make them fat I

40:35.120 --> 40:40.640
want to make them fat I think a lot of people have had serious kind of uh emotional breakdowns

40:40.640 --> 40:46.080
designing their bodies in these games oh we had a we we we did one where I was trying to

40:46.080 --> 40:51.680
make myself for this basketball game and she was giving me advice on what to do and we almost got

40:51.680 --> 40:57.360
into a very big fight it was a mistake I was like that's not how I look and she's like move the

40:57.360 --> 41:06.800
eyes closer together Emily Emily I will say that you could fat her face Emily you found other ways

41:06.800 --> 41:12.160
to say those things this is what I'm talking about when you're having to pick your body type

41:12.160 --> 41:17.120
for a video game it's it can be a very it's a good a confrontive thing to do for your emotional

41:17.120 --> 41:22.320
so I say always make something weird always be a capper do you spend I get sucked in if I have four

41:22.320 --> 41:27.040
hours to play a video game which is like a big deal oh my god I found four hours yeah and it's

41:27.040 --> 41:33.120
one of those games where prepare to dock with the space station bop bop bop oh uh check the

41:33.120 --> 41:40.160
mirror see if your face looks all right blip and then uh-huh three and a half I mean I'll I'll

41:40.160 --> 41:44.240
yeah the whole time every time you try to make it look like you is that right or every time you yeah

41:44.240 --> 41:48.720
I don't yeah I've never really until unless there's been maybe some games where it was so so clear

41:48.720 --> 41:54.560
that I couldn't make it look like me at all that I was able to just make some decision in my head

41:54.560 --> 41:59.360
that it didn't have to be me but mostly I'm just like trying to make it look like me I think that's

41:59.360 --> 42:05.200
good I think that's totally good if you're playing this game you're in the game it should

42:05.200 --> 42:12.080
look like you I totally agree with you and I I I try and do that too except when Emily's around

42:12.080 --> 42:18.880
because that's not good for the basketball game you literally couldn't go as short like in the

42:18.880 --> 42:25.360
lowest height they had they literally like in the basketball game I couldn't get to my height so I had

42:25.360 --> 42:32.720
to be one inch taller than I am and they wouldn't let me be my actual age and I they wouldn't let me

42:32.720 --> 42:37.360
be my actual age so my dream is over that I'll ever end up in the NBA like even they're like

42:37.360 --> 42:42.320
and you had you had to be on a different HBO show yeah they were like you gotta be on Veep to

42:42.320 --> 42:46.240
play this game they should have by now they should they should I guess it's because there's there's

42:46.240 --> 42:51.600
not a standard technology yet because it wouldn't know what their private industry isn't incentivized

42:51.600 --> 42:56.720
to do this but we have the technology long to do anything yeah you could be at a mall or something

42:56.720 --> 43:01.360
and you'd go like oh oh I should get one of those because I play a lot of video games one of those

43:01.360 --> 43:06.480
being you step into a kiosk and they just do a scan oh and then you just walk out with a file

43:08.480 --> 43:14.400
that every game that's based on an avatar of a human being it's always you so it's always hilarious

43:14.400 --> 43:18.560
but then you get to see what you actually look like no that's really funny I mean believe me I try I

43:18.560 --> 43:24.160
go to Cheeks it's like I try but it's like that's why it always stops at some weird place where it's

43:24.160 --> 43:29.280
like the game has decided you need to be athletic but I want to look like a bowling pin with Randy

43:29.280 --> 43:35.600
Quaid's head on it what's the what's the machine look like that you do you step in and like a booth

43:35.600 --> 43:41.600
or do they like a bunch of little dicks it's like it looks like a take give you like a hulu there

43:41.600 --> 43:50.080
should be a setting for like a hot bruce valence or a sexy russell croak in the booth is there a

43:50.080 --> 43:57.440
booth talking about the booth right now obviously it looks like a ticket booth when you catch all the

43:57.440 --> 44:04.080
tickets or dollars tsa it's tsa tsa booth it looks like a tsa booth it looks like a say you gotta

44:04.080 --> 44:09.760
put your arms above your head do you have to go like this is your character so below your head the

44:09.760 --> 44:15.600
whole time do you do you keep your clothes on yeah that's a good question actually no your butt looks

44:15.600 --> 44:22.400
like you put on like a special like blue like like neoprene bocaps suit yeah I bet Rob you could

44:22.400 --> 44:27.840
make yourself in a video game oh Rob I bet you would be easy you'll be the default yeah I can never

44:27.840 --> 44:34.720
be like the starter guy you're like done yeah the crash test dummy yeah you know it doesn't even

44:34.720 --> 44:41.040
have the option I never yeah it's like this guy's not wearing shorts like he he doesn't have a beard

44:41.040 --> 44:45.920
it's terrible they don't have good beard options they don't have you know there's never like if there's

44:45.920 --> 44:51.600
a male ponytail or even just you know you can pick female hair options as a male character holy

44:51.600 --> 44:56.880
shit that's better than most games I play it's just like I always look like a weird like Cheech and

44:56.880 --> 45:04.800
Chong like cigar Indian kind of guy I think so you try to make yourself look like you too well I

45:04.800 --> 45:10.800
can't I mean you would like to I would yeah but I had to compromise it's just never occurred to me

45:10.800 --> 45:14.640
and I don't know if it's because I'm a I don't know if it's because I'm a lady and I never had the

45:14.640 --> 45:20.960
option up until also now we're all sexist we just exactly thank you but I I mean to me I never

45:20.960 --> 45:25.280
played video games to be me I played video games to be someone else because I never had the option

45:25.280 --> 45:30.240
to be me until recently but I think that I think I think there's just a real distinction there

45:30.240 --> 45:35.600
would I be shocked if we found out you could cross reference it with with gender of modern gamer

45:35.600 --> 45:39.440
I wouldn't be shocked to see there's a correlation of the data but but I also think it's it just

45:39.440 --> 45:44.880
seems to me I just think oh this is I'm a narcissist I'm just like look it's a negative word

45:44.880 --> 45:50.880
narcissist but well we didn't pull them and say how many but it's not going to be an honest poll because

45:51.760 --> 45:56.560
be honest because there's be honest there now it will be an honest everyone close your eyes if

45:56.560 --> 46:01.840
you're in it if you're in a third date and you brought her to Harmontown first of all uh don't do

46:01.840 --> 46:09.440
that bad bad third date but you're not going to be like yes I'm a narcissist I don't know I mean

46:09.440 --> 46:14.080
maybe no but I don't think I I'm not saying that because you want to make yourself in a video game

46:14.080 --> 46:18.960
you're a narcissist okay well okay but I put that in their heads I as a like all right so

46:18.960 --> 46:24.160
by applause when you play video games that let you design the character how many of you strive

46:24.160 --> 46:33.280
to make it yourself that's a solid number let me call that 50 percent of the there's American

46:33.280 --> 46:46.080
public cat people yeah cat people about a bunch of little dicks or vaginas but but again be be

46:46.080 --> 46:50.960
honest like how many you would always design your avatar or your player to be something totally

46:50.960 --> 46:57.760
different than you but they're more extroverted people so they sound like more people I would

46:57.760 --> 47:03.440
call that 40 60 though I mean like yeah it's pretty close a lot of little dicks it almost sounded

47:03.440 --> 47:08.640
like like like half and half but the people that are more extroverted altruistic that are like I

47:08.640 --> 47:14.000
want to be someone else I'm selfless I'm a wonderful person I mean I'm not a big that's a very good

47:14.000 --> 47:20.080
point what he said was it's because I hate myself but but he did say it out loud in a room full of

47:20.080 --> 47:27.360
people yeah I mean yeah and then you yeah then you subdivide that tree into if when you get to a

47:27.360 --> 47:31.600
point of hating yourself when do you consider yourself a biological weapon that you fling at

47:31.600 --> 47:36.560
people but I guess we're mostly not trunk voters like wait was I like but that's like that's that

47:36.560 --> 47:42.000
troll culture of like of like you know what I'm so gross society's not made for me I'm gonna

47:42.000 --> 47:50.400
fling myself on you like multiple migs and a fucking reference that is what trolls are they

47:50.400 --> 47:54.800
weaponize themselves and just like fling themselves yeah look how gross I am that's why

47:54.800 --> 47:59.120
that's why the smart people can be into Donald Trump I'm not saying it goes tanned in hand but

47:59.120 --> 48:02.640
I'm saying that's why it's possible for that archetype to exist because if you feel enough

48:02.640 --> 48:08.000
like you know the prom queen's always winning and let's see how she likes it and it's like

48:08.000 --> 48:13.280
the more the more he misspells tweets the more he like reveals himself there's a it's that that's

48:13.280 --> 48:19.360
that connection however I think his his revealing that he has no interest in net neutrality and also

48:19.360 --> 48:23.440
once everyone's I know I think he's losing his computer troll demo because he doesn't really

48:23.440 --> 48:29.760
stand for anything obviously and so that that's been like it's so I mean there's so much why don't

48:29.760 --> 48:36.400
you stop talking about politics get back to doing a podcast hey you know that uh fate fate of the

48:36.400 --> 48:42.000
furious did really well this weekend now that's what I'm talking about yeah that's why I come to

48:42.000 --> 48:48.560
this podcast I want to hear about recent movies out did that force awakens that uh fate of the

48:48.560 --> 48:55.760
furious uh all right that's that car movie yeah he won get over and get back to your podcast tell

48:55.760 --> 49:01.440
me about the fate of the furious now Dan like when we started with uh with uh Sharpie and quark

49:01.440 --> 49:07.200
back a long time ago in dnd you you you picked like fighter character like like you want to be

49:07.200 --> 49:16.080
like a like a tough warrior character a furious one what and fast so like but like attribute-wise

49:16.080 --> 49:20.320
you want to be somebody else but physically you want to still like if you could draw yourself in

49:20.320 --> 49:26.480
that world it's you I have you can and he did for harm for Harmon quest I assume you had a say in

49:26.480 --> 49:30.800
the design of your character that looked like you well I had a say in the fact that it's funny if

49:30.800 --> 49:35.600
you're doing like like recognize the formula need the people need to look like the people but but

49:35.600 --> 49:43.680
the uh but in point of fact that when we played dnd here pathfinder uh uh and in heart all that

49:43.680 --> 49:51.600
stuff I've made a conscious effort to not like I don't try to I haven't played like stealthy assassin

49:51.600 --> 50:00.400
coward characters which I usually um I uh note taken like because I because I actually was like I

50:00.400 --> 50:03.760
didn't have that thought in my head I was like well when you played when you were a kid you always

50:03.760 --> 50:10.080
were like engaged in this weird like oh you're the it's it's you as the coolest guy in the world

50:10.080 --> 50:15.440
like that's gonna be your character and then when we started playing uh up here I was like yeah

50:15.440 --> 50:19.920
why don't you do what normal people do and play like a fantasy character that you aren't you know

50:19.920 --> 50:24.400
so be like a yeah I don't know like a warrior but that's why I want to be like a cleric when we

50:24.400 --> 50:29.600
start playing again like a holy person because I want to split the diff and have the right to be

50:29.600 --> 50:35.600
wrong about shit yeah and not good at stuff by the way we are Dan and I have drawn characters up

50:35.600 --> 50:42.080
with Spencer we are starting up a new uh role playing thing coming up we just wanted to we

50:42.080 --> 50:46.800
want to time it with our move to the new for a Harmontown oh wow when we go to the other new

50:46.800 --> 50:51.600
space we're gonna actually kick off a whole new campaign wow how how do you feel about moving

50:51.600 --> 50:57.840
Dan are you having any sort of emotional feelings emotional feelings as opposed to

50:57.840 --> 51:05.920
unemotional feelings are you having any sort of emotions what feelings are you having and what

51:05.920 --> 51:12.720
emotions well I I don't know you know I guess I guess I have like a weird uh intellectual

51:12.720 --> 51:22.720
version of an emotion which is that I feel like do you I don't know like I feel like I'm supposed

51:22.720 --> 51:27.440
to feel stuff and that makes me feel oh no you don't have to no no no I'm just I'm not I'm not

51:27.440 --> 51:31.840
saying you're making me pressuring me to have feelings I feel when I think about it I feel

51:31.840 --> 51:37.200
like I'm supposed to feel things and then that makes me feel sad just like the remember when

51:37.200 --> 51:42.800
the sleep with me our friend came on the podcast that you weren't here but uh it's just part of

51:42.800 --> 51:49.280
my endless quest to fill your fucking vacuum um uh we had a we had a guy in here shut up uh

51:49.280 --> 52:00.640
uh everything's been fine since you left I've always been here dad but sleep with me guy he was

52:00.640 --> 52:05.920
he did anyways he was we were talking about what is he was so close to hitting that new

52:05.920 --> 52:10.400
kumail role in our team who is this we were talking about a chorus line the musical it

52:10.400 --> 52:13.760
doesn't matter don't get distracted by any of my tangents we were talking about a chorus line

52:13.760 --> 52:19.200
the musical and the character in that musical who has that song about how she feels nothing and then

52:19.200 --> 52:23.920
and the nuances of that about how feeling nothing around actually be the most emotional experience

52:23.920 --> 52:29.280
you have that's how I feel about meltdown and meltdown said do you well you've been here for

52:29.280 --> 52:36.400
five years and you've done lots of shows and I don't break down in my podcast heart and thought

52:36.400 --> 52:41.040
I've been in this room for a long time yeah and I look at the pillars that are always in the way

52:41.040 --> 52:51.600
and I and I said to be a comic and I feel nothing but but but but your show's not going away so it's

52:51.600 --> 52:57.600
you don't have to feel like we stopped doing our show in october we did it for six years

52:58.480 --> 53:04.480
okay how do you guys feel you just heard about it yeah what is your feeling like what's your

53:04.480 --> 53:09.920
emotional well I was like a bunch I was I was sad when it happened but now even though it's only been

53:09.920 --> 53:15.600
a few months it's kind of to me this sucks it kind of feels like it never happened it's this

53:15.600 --> 53:20.960
weird thing where when I like every now and then I'll get a ghost of a feeling of what it felt like

53:20.960 --> 53:28.240
to do that show but for the most part it feels like it never happened like it's sad but okay

53:28.240 --> 53:39.680
another mpr piece uh if you these people that have uh uh hu hu uh superior here fuck like why

53:39.680 --> 53:45.760
does it come fucking come superior this my own life graphical memory or something like that uh-huh

53:45.760 --> 53:51.680
suit sumac it's they have some it's very similar to photographic memory but they have just like

53:51.680 --> 53:56.640
instant recall of any detail from their own life they're not always a hundred percent accurate but

53:56.640 --> 54:02.000
if they that they they can remember every day and every moment and so you spend this time like

54:02.000 --> 54:07.440
super jealous of them because how could that ever be bad and uh like like they can be like oh what's

54:07.440 --> 54:11.280
the best season of friends well I'd have to go back to episode that that's like holy shit that's a

54:11.280 --> 54:15.040
superpower you must be great in a writer's room you would be great at everything you do you'd be

54:15.040 --> 54:21.200
great in a relationship you forgot aha they remember every fucking relationship they remember

54:21.200 --> 54:28.000
how in love they were like it was yesterday all right they don't they're not able to forget the day

54:28.000 --> 54:35.040
it turned from good to bad they're not able to forget how how how it felt to to to to be willing

54:35.040 --> 54:41.040
to die for somebody and then and then to feel that same way about another person uh two years later

54:41.920 --> 54:47.040
so they're both and they're just like they're haunted by well that's the thing part of getting

54:47.040 --> 54:53.760
over something is having to forget some of it you kind of want time is best served ever coldening

54:55.760 --> 55:01.600
very like you kind of like life right life is something that you want to happen right now

55:02.160 --> 55:07.520
not a while from now right a minute ago you want to you want it to even though it seems to go a

55:07.520 --> 55:13.680
huge waste you kind of want to die uh like like eventually you want to have and then when it thinks

55:13.680 --> 55:17.200
you're going forward and you have an emotion that feels like when you felt before that's how you

55:17.200 --> 55:22.560
end up feeling connected to like this like this deeper current of like whatever the emotion is

55:22.560 --> 55:26.800
like you and that's a lovely feeling I think when you get just that hint of like oh I've felt this

55:26.800 --> 55:31.840
before whether not it's pain or like happiness or whatever it is like that's the shit to me that's

55:31.840 --> 55:37.280
like that taps you into the ocean when you have an emotion now that reminds you of an emotion that

55:37.280 --> 55:41.360
you had it's such a it's a big thing in therapy to be like okay when have you felt this way before

55:41.360 --> 55:46.320
because often it you're actually reacting to something that happened like five clicks back

55:47.040 --> 55:51.040
in your emotions but you're just still you haven't dealt with it yet so it's just coming up now

55:51.920 --> 55:57.120
oh wow I have my my therapist obviously we got missiles are about to drop on us and all the stuff

55:57.120 --> 56:02.000
so you know she's so who needs therapy yeah so there's a lot of anxiety and like like I don't

56:02.000 --> 56:06.240
know for me it's also like I'm 44 and I'm like I'm right I'm right in the fucking crevice I'm right

56:06.240 --> 56:12.480
in the tile grout between the bathroom tile where you're part of the brotherhood of man

56:13.120 --> 56:18.320
not to be exclusionary but and then the the bathroom tile where you're kind of one of

56:18.320 --> 56:22.640
these old fogies that we all hate that archetype that's just like well fuck off young folks get

56:22.640 --> 56:27.120
off my lawn and enjoy Medicaid or whatever like and you're kind of like just like this isn't my

56:27.120 --> 56:32.400
battle you wouldn't hire me anyway you're agist and like just like I'm getting close like like

56:32.400 --> 56:38.240
where I can like start ignoring the world and claim that I lived my life and pay my dues but

56:38.240 --> 56:43.760
I'm yeah I'm right in between there and I never did shit for anybody the first go round and so

56:44.800 --> 56:48.080
I was explaining this to her I'm like I don't know when to care and when not to care I don't know

56:48.080 --> 56:52.720
if that's like I feel like the nerve endings deadening in my soul I said like but at the same

56:52.720 --> 56:57.120
time I feel like I'm remapping my neurology now I care about people but now I'm just realizing

56:57.120 --> 57:04.480
how fucking dumb they truly are and my therapist said like she's like let me tell you the story

57:05.200 --> 57:13.200
joke I heard and she says so there's this cop and he's walking and and then there's a there's

57:13.200 --> 57:18.880
he sees this drunk guy stumbling around in the dark and and the cops goes up to him and says

57:18.880 --> 57:26.640
uh hey what are you doing uh what's going on I'm a cop and the guy this this therapist is

57:26.640 --> 57:34.800
terrible at telling jokes and and the guy says like well I'm I'm I'm drunk and I lost my keys

57:34.800 --> 57:41.280
I'm trying to find my keys I can't find them and the uh and the cop says uh well where was the last

57:41.280 --> 57:46.320
time you saw them where'd you have them where'd you lose them and the guy says oh back over there

57:46.320 --> 57:52.720
uh uh you know down the down the block there and uh the cop says why the hell aren't you looking over

57:52.720 --> 57:59.600
there and the guy says well this is where the light is uh and I said and I said to the therapist

57:59.600 --> 58:04.960
who believe it or not told the joke pretty much that way that wasn't me I was like well there was

58:04.960 --> 58:09.360
a lot of pipe in that fucking first act like are you sure we shouldn't fade into the police academy

58:09.360 --> 58:15.200
when the the cops like uh but none or more I thought about it I'm like oh I'm the cop that's

58:15.200 --> 58:20.720
what she was inviting me to the atonement with the stupidity like you go you go wait a minute this

58:20.720 --> 58:27.120
person dunning dunning Kruger effect whatever like you go uh oh this person doesn't get it

58:27.840 --> 58:31.440
they don't know that they should they're not going to find their keys over here just because this

58:31.440 --> 58:35.840
is where the light is but there's darkness all around us and everyone's drunk and everyone's

58:35.840 --> 58:40.800
stupid and if you are privileged enough to be a cop it means that you knew somebody or lived long

58:40.800 --> 58:45.200
enough to like get a badge and you're walking around and part of your job is to like help people

58:45.840 --> 58:52.240
and like you like they're dumb but you don't have to like you know that that story wouldn't it wouldn't

58:52.240 --> 58:55.520
make sense if the cop pulled out his night stick and started beating that man in the head it all

58:55.520 --> 59:01.600
makes sense like it is what would happen on facebook but it wouldn't it wouldn't if you were that

59:01.600 --> 59:06.800
cop you wouldn't do that it wouldn't make sense because he's only just stupid he's not doing

59:06.800 --> 59:14.000
anything like wrong or and I was like oh yeah I guess and I was like what you but isn't that nihilism

59:14.000 --> 59:17.840
isn't that just kissing cousins with nihilism and isn't that what the bad guys think nothing

59:17.840 --> 59:22.960
matters so let's just fuck shit up and she's like well you can spend your meaningless life

59:22.960 --> 59:29.360
doing whatever you want you can care about people or you can you can hurt them and I was like oh

59:29.360 --> 59:34.880
like a video game like which is what we do when we're disconnected like some people enjoy their

59:34.880 --> 59:40.960
disconnection by hurting things and when I play video games I tend to go like oh I get it that

59:40.960 --> 59:46.240
fucking prostitute I shouldn't have hit her with a baseball bat like like like you wait but are you

59:46.240 --> 59:50.000
so bitter with the baseball bat I shouldn't have hurt her I was learning what the buttons did

59:51.760 --> 59:56.640
that's what they all say that's what they all say the fan says it to you ladies do not listen to

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.600
that shit get out of there get out of there that makes it easy to hit a prostitute with a baseball

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.880
bat yeah it practically happens by default there's a but there's a button that makes you pick up a

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.800
baseball bat and hit a prostitute if you are holding the X it's the X button anyway it's a square

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.480
actually no but like I remember playing half-life the first half-life and the first half of half-life

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:28.080
one fourth life it was quarter life there was a scientist that was like I remember like are you

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:37.040
not gonna react to it I'm still here I'm sorry anyway I was I remember like it took me there was

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.640
a scientist in my way or something and I had to like I had to shoot I had to shoot him with a

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:51.280
shotgun and I Schrab are you gonna miss meltdown yeah sure yeah what are you gonna miss most about

01:00:51.280 --> 01:01:00.960
him yeah you crying no I did my spit went down the road it's 9-11 uh this is the only room where

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:08.000
people are like 9-11 Emily and Camille uh like you guys have been in the longest this is your

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.960
place like you guys well we haven't we kind of like October is when we did our last show here

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.400
and we haven't really been here that much it was weird for me where this place is like I have like

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.200
a lot of memories about like theaters like like like places you've performed yeah but this place

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.640
because it's this low dark ceiling it's like it's a little weird like outer space little like

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:36.640
like box I'm not gonna look back on this and be able to draw it's it'll just be empty space

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.560
and looking down and seeing Spencer over there and seeing Brandon here and you guys here

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.200
down this line and then the first three rows of people here for better or for worse

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.480
and this space is like the opposite of an Indian burial ground it is and this space is magical

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.080
it is absolutely magical and the most positive yeah well the first time I came in here when we

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.320
were visiting Los Angeles we came here because a friend of ours said that there was a show here

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.360
and I walked in and I was like I just want to be here and the first time I went to that room in the

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:11.760
back I I'm like uh yeah it's actually we just walked in because there was a comic book shop

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.200
because we ate across the street and then when we were here we heard the show yeah we came back

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.520
here and we won't watch the so does that mean the shows that are new place are gonna suck no but

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.120
you'll consecrate it no but what I will take away from this place uh is not like any of it like the

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:34.320
architecture or the geography of this place it'll really be like uh people memories not not physical

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.120
like spatial memories but I bet there will be like like the smell of the place at some point

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.040
years from now you'll walk in here and you'll be like oh my god I didn't know that this place

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.680
smelled like just the feel of the air conditioning yeah or like the fucking cricket you know the

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.960
cricket a fucking cricket and by the way there were extra poles here there used to be extra uh

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.720
there used to be extra poles here that we got removed but when we leave here what happens to

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.200
this room like when this is not a theater anymore it cools off a little I'll tell you that for nothing

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.440
sure like will this be used as this might be a restaurant still be shows here I think what will

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.920
this who's buying this place who what's it going to be oh I don't know I don't know and even if I

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.920
yeah is somebody buying the place I don't know why we're leaving I've never really asked that

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.880
Dan Dan why don't Dan you should buy the place I think we've I think we've overstepped our bounds

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:40.000
just the back room though I will say that I will say that it has been my dream for a while to

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.800
move into a venue that was just like the equivalent of I would liken it to

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.400
taking a fish from an aquarium putting in a slightly larger aquarium simply to make sure

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.240
we're not stunting the fish's growth not because we want the fish to turn into a something amazing

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:03.280
but just to just to let organic activity continue to take place like like and part of that is like

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.320
the bandwidth the various like technological things that are kind of boring to talk and think about

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.920
but as we've been doing the the live stream I've just been seeing a potential to like

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.640
complete a feedback circuit that where the people that are watching the show can be reacting to

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.960
like the odd thing that we throw up whether it's a chart that the audience made or a I don't know

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.040
I don't really want to get it like I'm gonna sound like I'm pitching some dumb show like to but but

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:38.560
I just I just have me a feedback circuit right now what we have is the ability to show the people

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.240
at home like if you know if we if we gave Kris Boruff a photo ahead of time I could go cut to

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.000
that photo and he'd go Roger sir I need cut to that photo I want to get to a place where we can go

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.320
so then so well anyways yeah but I took a picture of this lady at the bank and then I that's a bad

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.440
example I'm gonna like harass somebody at the bank but like there's a picture of my dog pissing

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.480
on my girlfriend's feet and then I'll like like pull it up as a better example and then and then

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.640
everyone's looking at it at the same time and it's just sort of like like graduating us from a

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.320
viewer access cable to late night cable talk having shot three seasons of a tv show here I can say

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.800
that it is it has its limitations for sure and you have to like we brought in extra generators we

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.480
had to bring in like stuff just to like keep it going for sure it wasn't built you had to bring

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.880
in a cricket assassin to to get rid of the cricket we didn't we left the cricket in that's a cricket

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.800
you can't I mean they're literally you could look for the cricket for years there's no way to find

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.600
that yeah they're in the ceiling how long do crickets live it's definitely like the great

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.160
grandchild of whatever cricket it was from the oh it's like the phantom like it gets passed on

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.680
that was god damn it you made it yourself for that one that's such a oh nobody knows the phantom

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:53.600
are you talking billy you talking billy zane slam evil phantom yeah but i'm talking about like the

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:59.280
comic strip oh okay i thought you were maybe robert england nobody about the mall kind of no no no

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.000
but i am talking about that phantom the good news uh spencer uh at the new space your table's gonna

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.600
be farther away and lower and i think farther behind everybody they're gonna dig a pit and you

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:16.800
won't have a mic uh you will you will just know you're there i'm learning a semaphore is that what

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:22.000
it's called huckle hey what when somebody asks you if something's in their teeth and they go like

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.560
this uh it's like and they they've thereby revealed that they have so much confidence in their teeth

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.040
to begin with like like they're just like do i have something in my teeth and they go uh and it's

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.000
like well i either they do or they don't but in any case they have beautiful teeth no matter what

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.520
and then and i go like no you don't have anything your teeth and then i and then i'm like well i

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.760
could have a million things in my teeth but whether i do or don't my teeth are gross i will never go

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.720
like this for anybody well by the way you've done it four times well i'm doing it for you know now

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.680
it's for as long as it's for entertainment you think your teeth are gross i think my teeth are gross

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.600
that's something i've never heard anyone say and i know a lot of people who hate them like nobody

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:04.000
looks like the 70s hulk teeth like they're yellow they're just yellow teeth yeah my teeth are yellow

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.480
i think a lot of people get or not get confidence from teeth what are you saying brennan oh i love

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.760
my teeth i also hate that move i when people do that well it's not a move i'm i don't know i just

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.120
say i feel i get the same reaction yeah it just it just it's amazing the other person is fine like

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.440
they should they've got beautiful teeth and i just like but then i just like oh my god i don't understand

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.680
my own teeth are in my teeth always it doesn't matter and i just don't make something take

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.200
a napkin and i go like this i just what and i i'm not gonna let them in on that on on my

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.720
my mouth i look like i'm a monster it's hard to live in los angeles because people all have

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.840
beautiful cosmetic thousands of dollar teeth and feet these are the things that if you see them

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.800
in a headshot it's like man that person oh really i hate people like people that like share their

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.680
feet on their headshot they're like look at me yeah hey uh emily emily uh do do i have something

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:04.640
in my toes right now i feel good about my feet i feel pretty confident in my feet but i don't

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.640
with my teeth like even though i've had we started going to a dentist who was great

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.360
and then they got bought by a cosmetic dentist person yeah so now they're all different like

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.080
they're like um so you think the like what did he told you that my teeth were gentle

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.600
jacked up i've been going to this place for years and they were like great and they're like oh your

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.960
teeth are great great check up and then i went in and they were like well we have this new owner

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.680
and this new doctor came in he was like your teeth are jacked up and i was like that's not nice

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.040
but i did let them talk me into getting my teeth whitened with like a laser most painful thing i've

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.240
ever had done in my life and i've had lung surgery and it weakens your teeth so like it's beautiful

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.880
but they're more likely to chip yeah they're whitening them by shaving off a layer of yellow

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.840
tooth and for days afterwards i would get like these pains that i would just do where she really

01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.160
would it was like um it would be like uh it was like you but with no bug in the hair uh she really

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.760
was i'm very confident in my teeth cavity wise i could go to the dentist and they go like oh you

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.120
don't have any cavities and stuff but i just think they look like little kernels of gnarled

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.320
corn you gotta see movies from the 70s though that's so true because jesus yeah those teeth are

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:20.160
fucked up and they put white pancake wicker man fancy if you put white any british film holy

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:26.160
yeah why is it like that why is that stereotype like because because uh world war two that they

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.160
had no fluoride there was a lot lack of vitamins and so teeth weren't really a priority that there

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.000
was uh children were raised with no vitamins and the teeth were really weak so so laugh it up

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.960
wow but why does that go down to like our british friends who are younger than us like

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:50.400
why shouldn't they have fluoride by now i think they just gave up they just found out well hey man

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.400
you could be fucking james bond and not give a fuck and it turns out you don't need it yeah

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.680
yeah well yeah i mean it's only a cosmetic thing i just find myself uh thinking about teeth when i

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.080
see some of a beautiful gleaming teeth chiclet teeth though sometimes i like and by the way you

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:11.520
know dentist you know like look there's a ton of really cool it's just like cops there's probably

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.480
more good one more good dentists than bad dentists but there it is like a very if you want to be

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:24.560
corrupt and work anywhere near medicine dentistry is like Erin McGathy worked for one 800 dentists

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.040
and like she i don't know am i gonna get in trouble but but no you're okay i think i think she's she

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.480
must have talked about it but like it was like the corruption that like like like like they just like

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.120
tell old ladies you need veneers and like they take their social security money and stuff like

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.000
the the yeah i just remembered that she gave me her email address once and it was it was like

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.520
erin at one 800 dentists and i was like you sure about this one you just gave her email address

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:55.200
i don't think she uses it anymore try email her see what happens wow but yeah that's a fucked up

01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.880
industry yeah like this dentist then to me would be like yeah you know your your if i did this your

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:08.720
your smile would be better i was like what fuck you the perfect smile i like my dentist i have

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.440
like my front teeth are kind of like the front two go in because of baseball hit me when i was a

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:19.200
kid and this one over here it's like jags out because uh i have that too like that one sticks

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.080
out because diana matter was seen in my sophomore year of high school not scary farm ran into me at

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.640
like a haunted house and she knocked my tooth up into my head so this one sticks out dear up a bit

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:35.280
didn't hurt her at all she moved my tooth into my brain and she didn't get a nick what part of her

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:41.440
body did that top of her head oh god you would think that would cut a person she she was dazed but

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.840
fine my tooth went no and so just like last week i went to the dentist and they gave me an x-ray

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.400
like this like super duper tron x-ray where you can see like i saw you posted it yeah it was weird

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.680
it's really weird it was like a 3d rendering and they're like okay that you might have a

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:05.520
a future abscess on this one tooth right there oh i'm like there i go the one that sticks out that

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.680
one here i go yeah i said well i got hit there really hard once and they go okay that might be

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.560
trauma maybe that's why but it might be an abscess in the future but they wait are they like pre-cods

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.520
about tooth well they're saying that they they saw like a little dark spot above that tooth

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.120
i go well that's the one that sticks up there they go yes this dark up there i said well i got nailed

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.840
there a long time ago and they go oh that might be just that could just be trauma that you might be

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.920
fine but or you might get $50,000 surgery yeah but one of my doctors said you know if you want

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.760
because you're you're an actor like we can have that straightened up for you and the women that

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.680
that clean the teeth are like don't do it like like leave your teeth weird like like like like

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.120
leave your teeth weird leave your teeth weird yeah almost always nobody like perfect teeth are a

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.440
little dreary a little dull but you notice i don't know but sometimes you see someone with

01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:00.880
perfect teeth and you're like that looks great there's like a hot there's like a it's true like

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.280
sometimes i'll have a friend who you he said i'm gonna go get my teeth straightened why not like

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.280
don't do it don't do it and then they come back the next week you're like you look great yeah it's

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.360
like a it's like a hotening i think it happens to actors actually more than actresses but you'll

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.720
if you go back and look at uh what's jesse from Breaking Bad Aaron Paul if you look at him early

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.200
he's like a guy if you saw him in the street be like all right fine they did something to him

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.280
yeah it happened to Jake Gyllenhaal too he used to be a weird looking little dude and then at some

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.520
point they just like put him in a machine and he came out like a hot actor they have a captain

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.800
america machine that they're exactly they're like Chris Pratt we all know oh yeah what happened to

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:42.960
Chris Pratt he just went into settings and like changed some sliders and now yeah he looks like a

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.680
fucking superstar with your teeth and then somehow your eyes get wider like they do a bunch of things

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:57.120
huh that's yeah the the winner of all is tom cruise that's right he fucking had his front tooth

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:03.040
over here and top gun his teeth are like real yeah but then he was famous for being handsome for a

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.360
while and was part of his personality he was the most handsome guy in the world with hands down

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:14.560
but have you seen him the most the he's got a balloon head he's he did he looks so weird

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.440
it happened to him i'm on tom cruise's side robin redford tom cruise doesn't look weird what

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.920
do you mean he's done something he's he did something he's got a balloon head it's like a

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.600
head spread it's that we go years between seeing him so the next time we see him he's like three

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.920
years old but he does have some Scientology stuff going on for sure it was the second jack

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.120
reacher thing like no Scientology what the Scientology puts puff puffer fish in his face

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:46.320
yeah no they they use bats that are like um they're legal but they're like um uh stem cell

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.080
face washes i'm not joking what yeah they're ruining tom cruise i mean i'd like to see him get

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.160
old i'd like to watch her get old but i think it's like when wrinkles start they want to like

01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.240
you got to fill him in and if you have a balloon that's like losing air you blow it back up you

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.600
know what i mean like that's what they're doing stem cell baths there's a bath of stem cells i'm

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:13.120
telling you there's a face thing you can get with stem cells you can get a hand wash

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:21.920
stem cell next to the sun face i like any like you can get a stem cell facelift any there you go

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.800
yes but that's just a facelift any famous actors or especially actress what when the like the uh

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.960
the critter is so like demanding to be perfect in every possible way oh yeah when you see somebody

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.920
famous with with flawed teeth or or a wonky like her nose that goes a little bit this way or like

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:43.600
something unusual and something asymmetrical that's sexy that's like ryan gosling's wonkai

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:50.960
kid whoa oh what are you talking about no that wonkai it's nice why does the show always

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:58.000
get so shallow when you come on it emily gordon you drag the show he's talking about his teeth

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.840
attractiveness uh yeah well she wrote a book about uh she wrote a book just for ryan gosling

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:11.040
about how to have higher self-esteem i mean i don't look in the mirror it is it is weird the

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:17.040
line between the stuff that we would do or not do like i like like what qualifies is like uh

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:25.520
dishonesty and honesty like yeah for men if we start losing our hair if we if we seek to do

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.640
something to make it look as if we still have it there's a stigma there that that's like well

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.840
it's a zero-sum game you get away with it or you're a horrible person for trying right you gotta

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.240
start early and and and it's like and so you're you're you're gonna go to either side of the

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:49.120
place it's like like like you know i've known Schrab for 25 25 years jesus christ i met you when

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:55.360
you were 18 he was he was bald when i met him yeah like like he was just out of college and uh so i

01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:02.720
gotta yeah we we Schrab has looked the same for 25 years no no if you if you find a photo of him

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.960
with any hair it's so gross you want to puke what was your hair like i agree what was your hair like

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:14.960
what was i hair like what was your hair like it was like parted down the middle and feathered back

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:22.160
it was like my mass effect character but yeah anyways whatever we were it's i it just it's it's

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.760
interesting the stuff like like oh that part just kept getting every part of your every part of your

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.640
body that has anything to do with well humanity because all of it will have to do with aging we

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.840
it's like we have a tarot card for every single part of our body like like oh i just had some

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.600
hand work done like there's no stigma against that right uh or i don't think there's a stigma against

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.080
if you get hair transplants and like you said if it's like if it does if it's not super obvious

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:52.640
i feel like i feel like everybody gets hair transplants i feel like i'd rather i'd rather

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.680
have a i'd rather have jude law with hair than jude law without hair but but also but it sucks

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:03.120
for jude law because he like he just missed it by like 10 years you know what i mean like same

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.800
thing happened to a young pope he's a young double door the weird thing about it though is that what

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.480
is it that we want like what it's like we walk this weird line when we even before we have a

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:20.480
conversation about it with anybody our perceptions walk this strange razor thin line where we're

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:30.720
perceiving another person we want them to have been perfect but so we'll hold it against them

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.480
if they've done something to pretend to be perfect but if that something is working out for eight

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.240
hours a day they're the best fucking person in the world but if they have no control over it we don't

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.920
like if you're boring like it's just so weird the things we hold against people and that we don't

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.880
right working out okay but if you're like losing your hair which you have no control over and you

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.040
do something to obviously get your hair yeah we've never i don't know what it is but it's like

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.000
now i just started like i started i take a picture of the back of my head and then i or i'll see

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.760
something in the back of my head i'll go oh god it's such a shock but it's just like it's just

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.840
because like oh i didn't i didn't expect that to look that way i didn't expect to see my scalp

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.520
so much and it's all it is is just i wanted more control over this i wanted to be like the elves

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.440
in the Tolkien universe or i just like decide after a great debate at Rivendell that it's time to

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:30.800
proceed yeah but but like i was ever gonna do anything with my sexy mane of flowing hair but

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.800
uh you just see you just see anything that reminds you of the passage of time and you freak out

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.360
and you want to you want to scrub it away but we all have we all have friends that have horror

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.960
stories of stuff that they've tried done and they they come back and they they hate themselves even

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.600
more or but there's probably some stories in there people that just had a grand old time that

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.000
they're just like oh did you heard of you know hey kyle you look amazing i can't figure out

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.960
what it is i haven't seen in six years the truth i had my lobes swapped uh what yeah i've no one

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:07.600
ever you know look you guys are my friends but i've always had weird lobes i swapped them my left

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.200
lobe is my right rope lobe now and you know i'll be god damn you look amazing and he's like yay and

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.480
there's a cake in the shape of an ear and everyone's so happy i thought that he had him swapped with

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:23.840
another person but he just had him swapped with himself that's fine wrong they were on that i'm

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.440
fine with it but if it's another person that's too vain yeah oh and for god's sake i got jane

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.320
sitting in the front row we're all advocates of the of the trans community these are these are

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:40.320
folks that are doing work like it's work that's allowed it's it's not like oh have you heard

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:46.080

let's bring out duck benson everybody duck that's right

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.240
you thought emily and camille couldn't be replaced by one man

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:29.440
don't think it was losing a camille and an emily think of his gaining a benson

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.960
you could just grab your hand yeah yeah yeah i the i was so excited about the tongs and then

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.000
Doug made a beeline straight from the ice bucket filling up the red solo cup i was like i almost

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:48.320
came in a few times before you introduced me just to get some ice for my drink i've never heard of

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:55.440
like taking the ice bucket from the green room to on stage excluding those of us who are not on stage

01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:05.360
yet i'm sorry hey hey dude hey Doug what it is man what's going down oh you know just hanging out

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:12.800
there was emily and camille we're out here i thought of a good one that you've got camille was really

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:21.360
good i thought of kumail lificent would be a good uh hybrid kumanji oh i like kumanji

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.960
it's autobiographical there movie it's a little little indie movie yeah it's a little indie movie

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.880
that's really autobiographical as opposed to a giant blockbuster that's autobiographical

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.520
but it kind of it's about a world where apes take over the world right it's inspired by

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.360
their relationship or how it began the quirky it's crazy how good it is have you seen it yeah it's

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.640
really it's really amazing how like it's it's almost like uh they made a movie with science

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:57.040
but it's still it's still about the heart though it's still got i can't it's still it's still very

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:05.840
moving Doug very moving experience but it's every joke lands it's so funny it's hilarious you've never

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:12.160
seen the movie at it i saw it at south by southwest where i'm pretty sure i saw you guys yeah yeah

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.640
all right well so it is good your story checks out so here's here's some things that aren't

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:30.160
aren't good has anybody been watching the lifetime original mini series Lizzie Borden 2

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.480
it's like a reprise of the Lizzie Borden thing with Christina Ricci but it's like they they did

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:42.560
it again i guess they did a they did a movie and then they i would try to watch the it's it's it's

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.920
rough it's like it's like it's like a sound like black keys soundtrack like they do that thing

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.200
or it's like a period piece but it's like it's like dirty like harmonica like rock and roll kind

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.800
of like wow wow wow wow wow wow wow oh evil woman go to evil evil woman like like like while they're

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:07.200
like riding covered wagons it's like barf barf if dan are you trying to use all the words right now

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.080
because you were saying a lot of things i don't know where i'm supposed to jump in or if any of us

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.240
are supposed to do anything i don't know what are these guys are going to say the scores yeah well i

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:25.680
think are they going to do some color or some updates drug just let it wash over you like a title

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.800
i was wondering when you showed up tonight i was like well we'll have doug coming after

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:36.480
camille and Emily leave so i'll be blackout drunk and he'll be so high it's amazing and then like

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.960
they'll be perfect communication between when worlds when worlds could have maybe collided

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:52.560
like missed each other by a barn with uh yeah let's check in with but i'm drinking just to try to

01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:02.800
fit in look at these guys we changed places it looks better yay it's 936 yeah we wanted to bring

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.920
like you know a little bit of flavor to the second half of the show you know it'd be funny we should

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.320
have done a bit when we found out we had too much show we should have we should have thrown together

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:18.560
a bit where like police came out and like did a lottery and selected someone for voluntary

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:28.560
removal no and then dragged them off it would have been funny hey hey brandon brandon it's only a bit

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:36.080
yeah until we get to the police car and then the jail and then the judge haha did you guys see the

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:42.960
thing i it's it's so it's so funny that it has to be like a photoshop fake thing but it was i i

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:52.240
it was like the united app updated and somebody and it was somebody retweeted the snap of the united

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:59.840
apps update where it says like new features uh drag and drop feature i can't be it has to be like

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.320
just a photoshop bit but it was so perfect they didn't drop that guy they dragged him though do you

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.840
guys ever get so angry at society that you're actually you actually get experience pleasure at

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.720
something like that like like like just mean deeply confessional don't fucking high road me you millennial

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:26.720
shit facts i will say value my candor i will say that flying a lot made me jump to the uh sure

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.160
this guy was being treated poorly but when they said get off our plane and he said no i'm not getting

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.360
off the plane he wasn't taking into account all the people on that plane were now going to leave

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.240
two hours later and the next plane that was going to take off when that plane got to where it was

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:47.200
going to go is taking off hours later like the longer that guy sat there and resisted getting

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:54.960
off the more people he was inconveniencing through his behavior right but but you're right

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.960
they shouldn't oversell the airplane but that's what they do so when somebody comes in and says you

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.800
have to get off now but they but they spent that entire time saying we'll give you an $800 rebate

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.520
and all this mouth yeah they could have easily they could have kept going higher but some asshole

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:18.320
decided let's stop it there because we're doing a great job i don't know why they even try to do

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:24.720
that like i don't know why so maybe we agree yeah i thought you were throwing the guy that got beaten

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.400
half to death under the bus and going like well why didn't that guy consider the needs of all

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:34.000
i am saying that when someone with a badge says to get off of this plane unfortunately you have

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.280
to get off the plane fuck that because because because because at that point that's when it's

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.880
going to get ugly instead of working it out i think it's important that it got ugly though i mean i

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.880
don't think it was what they should have said okay fucking two thousand five thousands eventually

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.920
somebody goes ten thousand like the highest bidder they lost so much stock yeah what if what if he went

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.480
it was stupid not to just keep driving i'll get off for nine hundred if somebody next to him because

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:04.160
i'll get off for nine hundred dollars well congress at the limit congress actually set the limit at

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.680
thirteen fifty thirteen seventy five so yeah so start there that could have easily been the really

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.120
funny bit you had that twinkle in your eye really thirteen hundred thirteen seventy five

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:19.440
but they were here forty forty five forty five forty five forty five forty five forty five forty five

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.680
fifty five fifty five forty five sixty but they did have to set they did have to set a limit

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.480
because the shit did pop off so much so the truth of the matter is they should have had him up at

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.800
like twelve they should have gone to the limit but he still wouldn't have gone and it's very important

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.480
to him to get home for some reason i'm sorry i'm sorry i grabbed this thing it was because i was

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.680
grabbing this holy shit what is that thing i just wanted to say it how many gigawatts is that going

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:49.920
maybe you shouldn't overbook your flights because he's the thing right why is that a business

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.080
practice that's because a lot of people don't show up for flights and then they make that money and

01:29:54.080 --> 01:30:00.880
then they make that'll i don't know a lot of money then they make that money with an empty seat

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:09.040
but they have chosen to regard an empty seat and free money as lost money because that could

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:14.560
have been another person absolutely and so every christmas they go uh ladies gentlemen just to

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:21.840
remind you we do have a full flight no idea how the fuck that happened you motherfucker you you're

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:31.440
greed you're endless bottomless greed yeah i've been yelling about this forever wait but here's

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.160
what happens dan can here's what happens when they do not allow they're not allowed to overbook

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.160
flights anymore oh they go out of business because they're so accountable to the laws of capitalism

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:47.600
no they they raise the ticket prices it's gonna cost us money that they can't do that anymore

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:53.280
it's just one situation got fucking out of hand one intransigent chinese doctor to fuck it for the

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:58.560
whole group oh and all the other i don't know how this guy likes to he likes to wear a panties on

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:04.080
his head like well his past has nothing to do with what happened there that turned out to be fake

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:09.840
was it was just racism it was some other guy with the same asian sounding name and they're like must

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.080
be the guy listen by the way because they hadn't gotten a statement they didn't know who the guy was

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.840
and i don't even know who that guy was but the first thing i thought when i heard his accent and i

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.520
saw and he's blood trickling down and he was going like just kill me just kill me i want to go home

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:27.280
i'm like look like like like maybe this is maybe this is also kind of racist of me maybe it's like

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:32.960
like the right kind of racism where i'm like you don't know right when you hold a lottery on a yes

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:38.480
the right kind of racism i.e. consciousness of the possibility of anybody being from yeah he

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:44.240
would they were throwing him off because he was asian well no but i'm saying like you don't know on an international

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.240
flight you don't know when you're when you're saying well let's hold a lottery and then let's go up to

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:54.480
somebody like i didn't i was like that do we know about that guy's life like like what trauma he's

01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.800
endured or his parents or whatever like he could be from anywhere where when that happens it means

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.040
you're fucking dead or it's like emotionally i don't mean like he's like bulky and perfect strangers

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:09.040
and he doesn't understand he's a doctor he probably has critical thinking but i'm saying emotionally

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:15.440
he could we could be traumatized bulky perfect strangers anyone yes that guy also on the flight

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:22.640
had so many bitty babkas we tell people when they get on an airplane that they're going past a threshold

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:27.680
when they walk onto that airplane we don't tell them we don't treat the threshold of crossing

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.800
into that airplane like it's just going into a bar so you can't bounce people because when you

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.280
walk out of that airplane you are told you are put you're told the entire time when you go into the

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:42.800
fucking airport like okay one more threshold at past this point you're allowed to have your bag

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.520
search oh this is so important for 30 minutes before boarding don't forget take off your shoes

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:52.720
oh it's 95 percent of the guns get through in a test but fuck it whatever hey we redesigned this

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:57.600
to be more convenient to i think the tsa people i don't know these things don't give you cancer the

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:02.880
guy that built them won't go through them but he disappeared the like just just just just come to

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.200
your gate and just do what you're told and you can't take your business elsewhere because you need to

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:12.640
go to a destination and they have a monopoly okay now you're walking down the hall oh class c citizens

keep proceeding to the back of this airlock since we're gonna snap the bags into place you can't keep

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:47.200
your laptop under this on the day they buckle you in if they come up to you and say hey you've been

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:53.920
selected to get the fuck off the plane i reserve the right considering how everyone else on that

01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:00.160
plane dealt with the trauma of watching it the way i would which is to sit there and go nice one

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:09.520
good job pick on someone your own size like if i've that may be my one recourse to heroism is

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:13.920
that i'm the guy that won't get off the fucking plane like and i don't want to think that i'm

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:19.200
inconveniencing everybody at that point i'm gonna be like sorry everybody thanksgiving is

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:24.320
must be celebrating something i know you're all i know you all want to get home to dinner with

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:32.960
your families but maybe this is plymouth rock i i i i'm not i want to see what they do maybe the

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:38.560
plane will grow a third wing what they do maybe they'll admit they're a fucking cartel and an

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:44.160
alaskan airline's jet will pull up and have a magic tube got and half the customers will get

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.360
sucked aboard and everything will turn out to be totally monopolized and price fixed like maybe

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.400
they can drive their employees across the country there you go like like like maybe they could offer

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.360
ten thousand dollars twenty thousand thirty thousand forty thousand maybe they should maybe maybe

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:05.120
holland oats should come aboard like uh like like maybe maybe the plane should turn into a submarine

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.760
all i know is i have no control over it you don't you don't want to be a submarine that's bad because

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.960
of that but did they did they did they taze the airlines are too big there's too much going on

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:23.040
i i i know but like do you those four or five people made the decision to do that to that guy

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:28.080
it wasn't you know i mean they were following like the corporate structure of the rules but

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:31.840
they could have kept offering more money they stopped at eight hundred dollars yeah they

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.440
shouldn't have they could have kept going but somebody was like i'm gonna be a good employee

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:42.320
and save the company money and fuck that person for like not just going to the limit to stop something

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.960
like this from happening it would also be nice if the police officers didn't respond with some

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.760
sort of corporate hypnosis right they just came in and just were like yeah we'll do it we'll just

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.480
get this guy out of here and it's like well why so then when he ran back out of the plane does

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.760
anyone learned yet what happened off camera that like i think he just found his way back down the

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.600
jetway got on the plane and was but how that is an important what i thought you had him you

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.560
they dragged his lifeless body off the plane well i think you can file that under uh end for

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.800
not my department the cops go right oh you dragged him off oh and then they're like

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.240
my job's to drag people off planes we got him off the plane he wants to get back on that's his business

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:30.960

because you think he's using the uh outdated uh racist slur chinese doctor which is what we used

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:29.760
to call italians that hasn't been a racist phrase since the 1860s italian americans are perfectly

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.680
fine we don't call them chinese doctors anymore dug dug you don't have to rap but you certainly

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.760
have to be here while it happens because dan has a lot of shit to get off his chest i did want to

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:45.840
announce to thank you to all our new subscribers who since we announced it the the week uh by matching

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:53.120
your donations or matching your sign of fees uh when after we announced it we raised uh 21,950

01:37:53.120 --> 01:38:01.440
dollars for the aclu oh yeah an argument could be made we were slow on the uptake like that that the

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.000
aclu you know there was they had a big windfall but another argument could be made i think money

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.480
for the aclu is like toilet paper i don't think it expires and i think it always gets used for

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:14.880
something very important um that we that we don't want to think about a lot even though i haven't

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:20.880
joined yet and i haven't watched fucking atlanta i i i i didn't i need to join the aclu and watch

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:27.440
fucking atlanta i did get out get out get out dammit no get out get out yet i'm so it's gotta be

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.320
on apple tv any day now though i let's go so fast i did not know the amount but that makes me very

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.560
happy i mean like that that's a lot of money and they know exactly where to put that money so

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:42.400
that's very cool yeah and anybody that listen to the show and thinks that uh donations to the aclu

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:49.760
is is money misspent i would say fuck straight off into the night well i think it would be a good

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:53.920
exercise to use your compulsion for proving things wrong and poking holes with things

01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:01.200
research the aclu go go back and find out if you can find corruption or like malfeasance or anything

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.480
and i don't say that rhetorically it's just that i've never when when when trump got elected it was

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.240
like they were like a lighthouse they were there right away and it was like this is gonna be a

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:16.960
legal battle like like like 90 of this battlefront and uh yeah and and and it was uh it was when it

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.680
was at the whatever what am i babbling about whatever but it's it's like there is no there

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:26.640
is no aclu gate there is a you will you will see a history of them being vilified because they

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:34.160
represent civil liberties which sometimes involves defending the rights of people to say and do shit

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.600
that uh makes them people you don't like and and we all have like an emotional some people hate it

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:45.520
when you defend the oppressed they are not down with it and the aclu is there to do it like we

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.840
will have an emotional like we don't want like like yeah it's like it's hard to be an objective

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.320
just like oh you know what i'm in favor of i'm in favor of freedom plain and simple every once in a

01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.400
while that's gonna make you an advocate of of a loudmouth that's saying like really mean nasty

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.960
things uh and stuff like that or or like uh saying that somebody got somebody's trunk we know that

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.960
there's something in there but you know what you don't have a fucking right to search it yet because

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.720
the important the right to search that person's trunk has to hold stronger like you can't you

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.760
can't blow up that right with anything in that trunk even and it's like it's not a popular position

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:28.080
sometimes they're an agency that's always a confederacy that's always like i had like been

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.640
fighting for us and like there's a lot of tomatoes that has gotten thrown their ways and and and so

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.760
like like i mean they were badasses when i showed up at the airport first yeah that was amazing and

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:41.600
they were miserable because they were there all day and night and people were coming up screaming

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.480
at them and like they're doing a shit job for probably not a lot of money or maybe no money at all

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:54.400
and uh that was a rough gig and they sat there and got shit done and had people released out of

01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.720
custody because they shouldn't have fucking been in the first place um all right and then

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:07.040
you know now and now and now Planned Parenthood is next like we'll have to figure something out we

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:12.240
can't just keep on saying every every dollar that the podcast makes but we'll have to we have to

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.880
that's more of a defensive game where we're like you know the ACLU is like let's put money into

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.560
the pockets of the people that show up at the briefcases when people are being illegally fucked

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.160
with um you know Planned Parenthood is more tragic i'd be quite i'd be quite happy you're

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.960
doing the same thing for Planned Parenthood because they need protection more than anybody

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:35.040
right but we can also sort of just want to throw it out local we got to start local it'd be cool if

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.400
we started local too because uh then maybe we can have those people on yeah we could set an example

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.320
in LA like like blossom out word like with the Planned Parenthood around here you should think

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.360
about great proofs from the smartest uh uh sparse man in the world podcast he when he travels he has

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.800
Planned Parenthood there at every event like like like organizing and doing stuff like that and i know

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.360
that by saying this on a podcast there'll be six assholes that call us baby killers because they're

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:06.480
idiots uh it's it's it's protecting not just women's rights mostly women's healthcare but it's not

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.040
just women it's also everybody but mostly it's women's healthcare and the idea that women get

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.200
to do what they fucking want and it's also not i mean cody pointed this out to me i didn't i didn't

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.000
i don't i don't know nothing from nothing the the the Planned Parenthood they they they've

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.400
associated with you don't walk in and get a free abortion you pay for the fucking abortions that

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.720
you get there it's not it's not why they're there it's also three percent it's healthcare for poor

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:34.160
people it's it's it's it's it's there it's like they're for for for women that aren't they're

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:39.200
looked at as a as a some kind of pre-existing condition um and it's a place where you can get

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:45.040
the shit that's not paid for the the the the idea that it got wrapped up in a oh well yeah but the

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.800
abortion thing that's controversial there was nothing controversial about people being taken

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:53.440
care of and they fucking did it again they unplugged the whole thing yeah it's it's it's about

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.000
misogyny plain and simple it's uh that women women are the enemy for some strange reason and

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.240
in this regime not just this regime but but for forever and people who made those selling

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:08.480
fetuses videos have been jailed like they've actually been tried and gone to jail and it's

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.120
like a not a not a story people know about well i don't know about it what i don't know about the

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.680
selling well duck knows about it which is why he's about to do a hardcore rap here we go

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:24.080
wait what

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:27.920

yeah i'm a third trimester here to say i'm about to come out in a biological way

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.040
it's not about me usually it's more about me

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:35.520
why is pregnancy viewed as something that can happen to someone other than me

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:42.160
i'm a fetus you see but whether i'm a man or woman i will deal one day with pregnancy

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:49.760
when you're making a workforce for your nation it doesn't matter the celebration

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.480

back to abortion all right okay all right you deflected from the topic peanut joe

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:49.120
when the sperm hits the egg what grows first is a leg then another leg next and then two arms

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:59.280
and then the head comes last so you have 30 trimesters one for each finger all right no

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:09.360
peanut joe peanut jones and a doctor y'all peanut jones never went to school

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:14.000
i'm not a prenatal scientist i'm a peanut

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:23.440
but let me i'll tell you just what i know and you disagree there are 140 trimesters

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:31.200
they they shuffle from every four years if there's a leap trimester

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:42.640
that's when irish people are born every four years also peanut jones is racist

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:52.800
but i love the irish so it's not racism racism develops in the 45th trimester

01:48:52.800 --> 01:49:03.040
it coincides with fingernails and a nervous system because and this isn't a popular opinion

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:10.400
race is real more real than potassium

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:20.000
the mother takes in race and through the umbilical cord race goes into the baby

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.560
