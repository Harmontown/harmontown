Here we go!

00:58.760 --> 01:02.760
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is officially in session.

01:04.760 --> 01:11.760
It is rare that I get the opportunity to introduce true genius.

01:11.760 --> 01:17.760
Please bring to the stage the mayor of Harmontown,

01:17.760 --> 01:35.760
Mr. and Harmontown!

01:35.760 --> 01:44.760
You're looking for a place to put your bag? You got the podium. That's your Comptroller podium.

01:44.760 --> 01:54.760
You're in a position of high stature. Your job is to keep me from going off on too many tangents.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.760
Or you can just sit and listen. That's fine too.

01:57.760 --> 02:05.760
In any case, it's a huge honor to have you here at Guest Comptroller, LeVar Burton.

02:05.760 --> 02:17.760
I'm a child of the 70s, so my mom learned about race from Alex Haley.

02:17.760 --> 02:29.760
My consciousness of race began when my mom, I was playing with Sesame Street figures that I was playing.

02:29.760 --> 02:41.760
I've told the story quite a bit because it summarizes 41-year-old white guilt-driven liberal in the modern era.

02:41.760 --> 02:49.760
This is my origin story. I was playing with a Gordon figure from Sesame Street and a Mr. Whipple figure,

02:49.760 --> 02:56.760
and my mom was watching me play with them, and then she said,

02:56.760 --> 02:59.760
Do you know the difference between those two?

02:59.760 --> 03:07.760
And I said, I don't know the difference. And she said, good.

03:07.760 --> 03:13.760
And then she'd only stopped there. And then I kept playing.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.760
And then she went, because the difference is one of them is black and one of them is white.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.760
And there's going to be people that try to tell you that there's a difference, and that's important,

03:21.760 --> 03:23.760
and you need to ignore them, and blah, blah, blah.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.760
And then my mom would watch mini-series about the Holocaust, and then she'd wake me up,

03:27.760 --> 03:31.760
and she'd sit on the foot of the bed, and she'd say, Wake up! Wake up! What's going on?

03:31.760 --> 03:36.760
Daniel, one day people are going to tell you something called the Holocaust never happened.

03:36.760 --> 03:40.760
It happened. It happened. And then she'd go to bed.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.760
I was a child of the 70s.

03:44.760 --> 03:50.760
Lovar Burton, before he was raising all of you via Reading Rainbow,

03:50.760 --> 03:56.760
he was his first dramatic role,

03:56.760 --> 04:00.760
literally your first thing that you ever auditioned for.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.760
You started being an actor, you went on your first audition,

04:04.760 --> 04:10.760
and you got the role of a character named Kunta Kinte in an adaptation of Alex Haley's Roots,

04:10.760 --> 04:18.760
and you got the part, and were at the forefront of a transition that was happening in the 70s,

04:18.760 --> 04:25.760
of which Norman Lear was a part, in which I was caught in the maelstrom of where my brain was warped by.

04:25.760 --> 04:31.760
And now we live in this 21st century where, I don't know, I don't even know how to talk to the kids anymore.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.760
Now I'm racist because I actually am fascinated with this stuff.

04:35.760 --> 04:43.760
That makes me racist, but you were making my mom think it was okay for all of us to occupy the world together,

04:43.760 --> 04:46.760
and making it okay for her to warp my brain,

04:46.760 --> 04:51.760
and then also teaching everybody to read with this awesome show,

04:51.760 --> 04:54.760
it was mostly the theme song, let's not kid ourselves.

04:54.760 --> 05:04.760
That's like that kind of flangey reverb. Who did that? Who composed that?

05:04.760 --> 05:11.760
That is the work of Steve Horlick, the composer of the Reading Rainbow theme song,

05:11.760 --> 05:20.760
we call it Butterfly in the Sky, and the vocals on the original version of the Reading Rainbow theme song

05:20.760 --> 05:24.760
was done by the very talented Tina Fabrique.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.760
But we all heard that song, and then we were all drawn to the TV,

05:30.760 --> 05:34.760
like Fred Flintstone being drawn by the smell of Bronto burgers,

05:34.760 --> 05:41.760
like kids who otherwise their brains would have just rotted for want of literacy.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.760
Shall we sing the song down?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.760
You know what we ought to do?

05:47.760 --> 05:51.760
You don't have that. Can you cue that up, Dustin?

05:51.760 --> 05:55.760
Can you find the Reading Rainbow theme somehow and cue it up?

05:55.760 --> 05:59.760
There's got to be a way to do like a kind of like, we do the song,

05:59.760 --> 06:02.760
and there's got to be like a way to do like a rap bridge or something.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.760
I'm trying to think of how the song goes.

06:07.760 --> 06:11.760
There's got to be a way I can bastardize your work.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.760
If it's possible, then you will figure it out.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.760
But I mean, I don't know.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.760
You were a founding father of my consciousness,

06:20.760 --> 06:22.760
and I was reading your Wikipedia.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.760
Those are the ways that I was familiar with you.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.760
But then out today because it was like,

06:26.760 --> 06:27.760
oh, he's coming to do the show.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.760
I better not embarrass myself.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.760
I should familiarize myself with Var Burton's career.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.760
So I Wikipediaed you.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.760
And I'm sure meanwhile you were Googling me and going,

06:36.760 --> 06:38.760
what's wrong with Chevy Chase?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.760
Who is this?

06:40.760 --> 06:43.760
I don't understand. Where am I going?

06:43.760 --> 06:47.760
By the way, LaVar is only here because he was signing his children's book,

06:47.760 --> 06:49.760
The Rhino that Swallowed the Storm,

06:49.760 --> 06:50.760
which just came out.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
He was here in Texas,

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
and we were able to get him.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
Also, he's honored to be here.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.760
I am.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.760
No, no, no, no.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.760
That's true.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.760
If I may.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.760
If I may.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.760
Mr. Harmon,

07:02.760 --> 07:04.760
you are responsible, sir,

07:04.760 --> 07:09.760
for one of the most satisfying and fulfilling songs

07:09.760 --> 07:13.760
of my career.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.760
We did it!

07:15.760 --> 07:18.760
It's only because I let you use your eyes.

07:18.760 --> 07:19.760
That's it.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.760
It would have been Star Trek,

07:21.760 --> 07:24.760
but they put a fucking visor on your face.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.760
You showed up the first day.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.760
You're like, oh my God,

07:27.760 --> 07:29.760
I'm the new Chekhov or Spock or Sulu.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.760
I don't know who I am.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.760
I'm the new something.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
And then they're like,

07:32.760 --> 07:33.760
okay.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.760
They put a visor on your face.

07:34.760 --> 07:35.760
You showed up the first day.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.760
You're like, oh my God,

07:36.760 --> 07:38.760
I'm the new Chekhov or Spock or Sulu.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
You're like, okay.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.760
They put a banana clip on my eyes.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.760
And it was all over.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.760
Well, yeah.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.760
I'm smart that way.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.760
But eventually he,

07:49.760 --> 07:51.760
yeah, I don't know.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.760
What was that?

07:52.760 --> 07:53.760
I mean,

07:53.760 --> 07:54.760
I remember seeing,

07:54.760 --> 07:55.760
I saw the Trekkies documentary

07:55.760 --> 07:56.760
when you have the sound bite,

07:56.760 --> 07:57.760
you're like,

07:57.760 --> 08:01.760
give the actor his eyes.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
Did I actually say that?

08:02.760 --> 08:04.760
Did I say it that way?

08:04.760 --> 08:05.760
Well, okay.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.760
Maybe that was an unflattering impression.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.760
That's sort of my actor impression.

08:10.760 --> 08:11.760
But I mean,

08:11.760 --> 08:13.760
I could see how that would be a tremendous bummer.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.760
Did you ever get adjusted to it?

08:15.760 --> 08:17.760
Or was there in the storyline

08:17.760 --> 08:19.760
that when they lost the visor

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
and replaced it with the context,

08:20.760 --> 08:22.760
was that a result of you?

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
Okay.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.760
He's nodding.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.760
Yes.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.760
That was you constantly every day.

08:28.760 --> 08:29.760
Yeah.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.760
JJ Abrams is like,

08:30.760 --> 08:34.760
why is my car keyed again?

08:34.760 --> 08:35.760
Yeah.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.760
I was very insistent that,

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
and Rick Berman,

08:39.760 --> 08:41.760
the executive producer was,

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
and he was right.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.760
The visor was one of the ways that we telegraph

08:45.760 --> 08:48.760
the technological sophistication of the 24th century.

08:48.760 --> 08:49.760
And I always figured,

08:49.760 --> 08:51.760
well, if we're so damn sophisticated,

08:51.760 --> 08:56.760
why can't we just put it in a smaller kind of,

08:56.760 --> 08:57.760
you know.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.760
Yeah.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.760
Yeah.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.760
So.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.760
Yeah.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.760
I remember in that documentary,

09:03.760 --> 09:05.760
talking about the idea that it was like,

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
it was supposed to be very symbolic.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.760
There was a blind man that was at the helm of the ship.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.760
Yes.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.760
Blind man flying the ship.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
Yeah.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.760
One thing I was really excited to talk to you about though,

09:24.760 --> 09:26.760
that I knew nothing about your childhood,

09:26.760 --> 09:30.760
it said that when you were 13 years old,

09:30.760 --> 09:32.760
you went to seminary school.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.760
Yes.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.760
You were raised Catholic.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
I was.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.760
First of all, born in Germany.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.760
We should probably put a pin in that

09:37.760 --> 09:40.760
because that's distracting.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.760
You were born in Germany.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.760
We'll get back to that.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.760
But raised Catholic,

09:46.760 --> 09:47.760
and when you were 13,

09:47.760 --> 09:48.760
you went to seminary school.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.760
You had every intention of being a priest.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.760
I did.

09:51.760 --> 09:52.760
Yeah.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.760
And then in high school,

09:53.760 --> 09:55.760
it says in your Wikipedia,

09:55.760 --> 09:56.760
I don't think that,

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
I don't assume this is accurate,

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
but I was like,

09:59.760 --> 10:00.760
oh my God, I can't wait to,

10:00.760 --> 10:02.760
it says,

10:02.760 --> 10:03.760
I can't remember the exact quote,

10:03.760 --> 10:04.760
but it says,

10:04.760 --> 10:06.760
starting to have doubts

10:06.760 --> 10:08.760
in the Catholic faith

10:08.760 --> 10:11.760
after being exposed to the works of Lao Tzu.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.760
Is that true?

10:13.760 --> 10:14.760
Taoism was a thing for you?

10:14.760 --> 10:17.760
Kirkgaard, Lao Tzu,

10:17.760 --> 10:18.760
the Dao De Jing.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.760
Nietzsche.

10:19.760 --> 10:20.760
I call him Nietzsche.

10:20.760 --> 10:21.760
I call him Nietzsche.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.760
Yeah.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.760
The Nietzsche-ster.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
Lao Tzu, I mean,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.760
The Dao De Jing was a huge thing for me.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.760
Yeah.

10:30.760 --> 10:31.760
In high school.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.760
Yeah.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
I was searching and searching,

10:33.760 --> 10:34.760
and I found the Dao De Jing.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.760
Right.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.760
And it was like a tremendous,

10:37.760 --> 10:39.760
that and Kurt Vonnegut,

10:39.760 --> 10:41.760
those were like these huge things for me.

10:41.760 --> 10:42.760
Right.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.760
And it's so interesting,

10:44.760 --> 10:45.760
when you're a kid,

10:45.760 --> 10:46.760
when you're in your adolescent years,

10:46.760 --> 10:48.760
anything could happen to you.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.760
And then there's these libraries that are filled with these.

10:51.760 --> 10:52.760
It was books.

10:52.760 --> 10:53.760
Yeah.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.760
It was literature.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.760
And it's not always the books

10:55.760 --> 10:56.760
that your teachers are assigning you to read.

10:56.760 --> 10:57.760
Some of those are great.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.760
Right.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.760
A lot of those are great.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.760
Some of them are banned.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.760
But also in those same libraries,

11:04.760 --> 11:05.760
there's these other books

11:05.760 --> 11:08.760
by these profane, horrible,

11:08.760 --> 11:10.760
profane and profound dissidents

11:10.760 --> 11:14.760
or ancient non-Christian mystics.

11:14.760 --> 11:15.760
Right.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.760
Kurt Vonnegut like slammed my brain

11:18.760 --> 11:19.760
against the wall,

11:19.760 --> 11:21.760
smeared it like jelly all over the place.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.760
He has the power.

11:22.760 --> 11:23.760
Yeah.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.760
It was him and David Mamet,

11:26.760 --> 11:28.760
encountering his plays.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.760
I was like,

11:29.760 --> 11:31.760
Are you allowed to write like this?

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
And one of my drama teachers,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.760
Mrs. Lund at Brown Dear High School,

11:34.760 --> 11:35.760
she's like,

11:35.760 --> 11:36.760
yeah, I think that's a thing that you can do.

11:36.760 --> 11:37.760
If you go,

11:37.760 --> 11:38.760
woo, I got a woo for Mrs. Lund.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.760
Right.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.760
I'm kind of babbling.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.760
I feel like this has happened to you a lot.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
I think a lot of people

11:45.760 --> 11:46.760
probably encounter you

11:46.760 --> 11:47.760
and are like,

11:47.760 --> 11:48.760
there's a strange sort of like,

11:48.760 --> 11:50.760
Mr. Rogers meets Sting.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.760
People want to fuck you and please you.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.760
But also don't want to offend you

11:55.760 --> 11:57.760
and kind of like bowing a little bit.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.760
Well, they're like,

11:58.760 --> 12:00.760
I feel that energy happening.

12:00.760 --> 12:01.760
I'm like,

12:01.760 --> 12:03.760
I don't want Lovar Burton to leave mad.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.760
But yeah,

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
I just wanted to know

12:07.760 --> 12:09.760
that I really liked Vonnegut in high school.

12:12.760 --> 12:13.760
But the Dao Deng Jing,

12:13.760 --> 12:14.760
talking about the world's,

12:14.760 --> 12:15.760
the world's,

12:15.760 --> 12:17.760
the world's oldest

12:17.760 --> 12:20.760
book.

12:20.760 --> 12:21.760
And it was,

12:21.760 --> 12:22.760
And it was my drama coach,

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
Lee Bartlett,

12:23.760 --> 12:25.760
who was neither a priest or a brother.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.760
He was a layman.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.760
And

12:27.760 --> 12:29.760
It was the Catholic Seminary after all.

12:33.760 --> 12:34.760
But um, um,

12:36.760 --> 12:37.760
it was,

12:37.760 --> 12:38.760
it was Lee who was the drama teacher

12:38.760 --> 12:40.760
and he was the philosophy teacher.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.760
He taught all my favorite subjects.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.760
He taught me,

12:42.760 --> 12:43.760
he taught English,

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
English,

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
English,

12:45.760 --> 12:46.760
English,

12:46.760 --> 12:47.760
He taught me,

12:47.760 --> 12:48.760
He taught English.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.760
And he had the book list

12:50.760 --> 12:52.760
that really changed

12:52.760 --> 12:54.760
my course and direction in life.

12:55.760 --> 12:56.760
How many people in this room,

12:56.760 --> 12:58.760
save your applause until I finish the question.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.760
There's probably 200 people in this room.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.760
How many people feel

13:02.760 --> 13:04.760
that them being in this room

13:04.760 --> 13:06.760
and being who they are

13:06.760 --> 13:08.760
owes itself in a major way

13:08.760 --> 13:10.760

13:10.760 --> 13:12.760
in their public education path.

그리고ف you threw a pebble into the pond, you're going to get ripples

17:08.140 --> 17:11.480
I think the only constant is change, and it's always slow

17:11.480 --> 17:13.980
anything that happens overnight is lacking foundation

17:13.980 --> 17:16.480
roots is part of a changing trend

17:16.480 --> 17:18.180
and it's still being played out

17:18.800 --> 17:20.960
so that was uh

17:20.960 --> 17:47.960
슬로우 and steady wins the race, kind of like, okay, I don't know how to phrase the question, what I want to ask you is, are young people as annoying to you as they are to me, or do they seem to have somehow lost something, like was there, in the 70s weren't we closer to something, have we taken backwards steps?

17:47.960 --> 18:06.960
I do believe the change is sometimes two steps forward, a step backward, it's hard to see the force for the trees, but in my own defense, the paragraph after that, I mean the very next words go on to talk about, after that very pithy quote, talks about my work in Fantasy Island.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.960
It's very true, yeah.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.960
And Battle of the Network stars, so there's that, Dan.

18:13.960 --> 18:19.960
Well, it's not your job to be a symbol, you never, you weren't born and your parents didn't say, can he please be a symbol?

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
Right.

18:20.960 --> 18:37.960
But you, I mean, but you are a symbol, you, like most of what you do is symbolic, like your role in Reading Rainbow is symbolic, you're, by the way, I'm all over the place, but we should say congratulations to him.

18:37.960 --> 18:53.960
Reading Rainbow, which won like 26 Emmys throughout its 8 billion year career, he's the executive producer of it, then it finally, I don't even want to say the word died, but it passed its natural mortal phase.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.960
No child left behind.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.960
No, no seriously, no child left behind was responsible for Reading Rainbow being taken off the air.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.960
How is that?

19:00.960 --> 19:08.960
Because the federal government made a choice between teaching children how to read and fostering in them a love of a written word.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.960
My brain just exploded.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.960
You're the community of child literacy.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.960
Right?

19:18.960 --> 19:21.960
I was canceled because the Nielsen system doesn't measure real audiences anymore.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.960
Exactly right, sir.

19:23.960 --> 19:33.960
And so like me, kind of, you have taken your shit online, like you did a Kickstarter, their goal was a couple million.

19:33.960 --> 19:46.960
And in three days, they made like 5 million, because everybody in America from $50 donors to $1 million donors like Seth Macfarlane, which kind of mitigates my feelings about him.

19:46.960 --> 19:47.960
Good job.

19:47.960 --> 19:48.960
Right?

19:48.960 --> 19:49.960
I have to be jealous of him.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.960
I have to be.

19:50.960 --> 19:51.960
You don't have to be?

19:51.960 --> 19:52.960
Yes, I do.

19:52.960 --> 19:57.960
He's very successful and sings well.

19:57.960 --> 20:03.960
And my narcissism makes me think I'm in competition for that corner.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.960
It doesn't even make any sense.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.960
Why wouldn't I eat less cookies?

20:08.960 --> 20:12.960
Why do I get up in the morning and go, I got to beat Seth Macfarlane?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.960
Motherfucker jog.

20:14.960 --> 20:23.960
These are the kinds of things I want to confess to LeVar Burton, the father to a generation.

20:23.960 --> 20:29.960
Anyways, it's there, they have, you have obviously successfully resurrected, reading Rainbow in a...

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
Thanks to you all.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.960
Thanks to you, we have.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.960
Thank you.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.960
Alright, let's talk about Austin, huh?

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
Yeah.

20:38.960 --> 20:39.960
City.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.960
There's a governor's race here.

20:41.960 --> 20:42.960
Is it?

20:42.960 --> 20:43.960
Yeah.

20:43.960 --> 20:53.960
From my five minutes of putting on new underwear in the hotel room, letting the governor's ads play, I noticed there's like...

20:53.960 --> 20:56.960
I think it might be a conservative state.

20:56.960 --> 21:07.960
It feels like Austin may be a little bit of an oasis in the middle of a red sea, a red desert.

21:07.960 --> 21:17.960
But you guys have a governor candidate, I was talking with your peeps here in the green room.

21:17.960 --> 21:22.960
So there's this kind of funny, maybe it's not funny to them, it's funny to an outsider.

21:22.960 --> 21:31.960
There's a liberal candidate, Wendy Davis, and there's the conservative candidate, Greg Abbott.

21:31.960 --> 21:36.960
Here's the twist.

21:36.960 --> 21:44.960
It's 2014, so the conservative candidate is in a wheelchair.

21:44.960 --> 21:49.960
Greg Abbott, conservative as he is, wheelchair bound.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.960
How do you get more liberal than that?

21:52.960 --> 21:55.960
The man is in a wheelchair.

21:55.960 --> 22:00.960
It stinks of leftism.

22:00.960 --> 22:05.960
He's the embodiment of altruism.

22:05.960 --> 22:10.960
He's in a wheelchair.

22:10.960 --> 22:19.960
Someone shouted something out, but then more notably, someone next to him went shh.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.960
So Wendy Davis, I got quickly prized.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.960
She's kind of a hero in liberal politics.

22:25.960 --> 22:30.960
If you buy into the bipartisan garbage, which I kind of am very jaded about.

22:30.960 --> 22:35.960
I kind of feel like everybody's just all the same thing, I don't care that much.

22:35.960 --> 22:43.960
But if you choose to choose sides between the Democrats and the Republicans,

22:43.960 --> 22:46.960
obviously the Democrats are the good guys, that's a no brainer.

22:46.960 --> 22:51.960
And Wendy Davis, she did a big filibuster, they were trying to pass some horrible abortion stuff,

22:51.960 --> 22:57.960
and she stood her ground, and she is one of the good guys within that paradigm.

22:57.960 --> 23:02.960
Not with a Noam Chomsky paradigm, she's a tool of the marginalization

23:02.960 --> 23:08.960
of the proletariat by virtue of feeding you the bullshit binary,

23:08.960 --> 23:12.960
which has slowly withered our capacity for dissent.

23:12.960 --> 23:18.960
She's part of the problem, but let's just say she's one of the good guys.

23:18.960 --> 23:23.960
Because everybody knows that abortion and gay stuff and everything.

23:23.960 --> 23:28.960
Very important for the last 40, 50 years or so, have you noticed this is very crucial stuff

23:28.960 --> 23:32.960
in every fucking election, where you're just electing a bunch of rich people

23:32.960 --> 23:34.960
whose job is to tell you what to do.

23:34.960 --> 23:41.960
Wendy Davis ran an ad, it seemed kind of benign, where she was showing these shots.

23:41.960 --> 23:47.960
This is the funny world we live in now, it's 2014, so there's this Wendy Davis governor ad

23:47.960 --> 23:50.960
where they're showing these shots of a wheelchair.

23:50.960 --> 23:58.960
And actually the point that her ads are making are that this guy that's in this wheelchair,

23:58.960 --> 24:01.960
the reason he's in a wheelchair is because he had this accident,

24:01.960 --> 24:07.960
and he actually famously is the beneficiary of a very litigious pursuit.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.960
He got injured, he made a lot of money by suing,

24:10.960 --> 24:13.960
and now he's a foremost advocate for putting a cap on that stuff.

24:13.960 --> 24:19.960
That was the point of her ad, he sides with hospitals in this kind of stuff.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.960
The ad was just sort of trying to say, he's a hypocrite, but the visuals...

24:23.960 --> 24:26.960
It's like Herman Cain running for president.

24:26.960 --> 24:32.960
Yeah, the visuals kind of allowed the conservatives to go,

24:32.960 --> 24:36.960
you're picking, why are you showing that wheelchair?

24:36.960 --> 24:41.960
You're just saying he's crippled, and so it's just a very funny time in Texas, that's it.

24:41.960 --> 24:46.960
It's just funny to me, I don't know, she's the bully,

24:46.960 --> 24:53.960
she's a Democrat, she ran an ad, and it's got a wheelchair in it, and she tried.

24:53.960 --> 24:59.960
And I said, why is Texas, why is it a red state when you go to a city like Austin,

24:59.960 --> 25:05.960
and obviously we're totally biased, I'm sure all the people you met today were probably pretty blue.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.960
Not that you had any way of knowing, but I just have that weird feeling.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.960
You get a sense of that folks.

25:09.960 --> 25:14.960
You're in favor of children reading it, puts you on a decidedly left side of the...

25:14.960 --> 25:17.960
It's already the...

25:17.960 --> 25:20.960
No child left behind.

25:20.960 --> 25:28.960
So the, I guess it's like you kind of tally up all the little tiny little Texas municipalities.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.960
It's like big giant state, and you've got all these little tiny towns in it,

25:33.960 --> 25:40.960
and if you group them all together, and also adjust for all the gerrymandering in the districts and stuff,

25:40.960 --> 25:46.960
like there's no way the state will ever be anything other than a big giant red thing on the map.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.960
But there's Austin, there's that.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.960
There's Austin.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.960
I feel like there should be a civic revolution.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.960
We're having these elections are coming up now.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.960
There's no way to vote for Obama.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.960
There's people who are disillusioned with Obama.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.960
There's people who are...

26:01.960 --> 26:06.960
By and large actually, I feel like this is a theme that happens every four years.

26:06.960 --> 26:11.960
At the very beginning of things, everyone exercises, expresses their jadedness.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.960
Everyone says, well, I'm not going to vote for change again.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.960
We were promised change, and nothing changed.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.960
And I'm always like, yeah, go with that thought, go with that.

26:19.960 --> 26:25.960
But then over the next year, what we're going to see is everybody gets sucked into this Coke versus Pepsi debate.

26:25.960 --> 26:31.960
And I don't know, LaVar.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.960
But the thing is, Dan, you do know, you do know.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.960
I don't LaVar. I don't know.

26:36.960 --> 26:42.960
Oh, is that mood lighting?

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
We should move on.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.960
I should talk about farts or poop or something.

26:45.960 --> 26:46.960
That's what I'm really good at.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.960
I got to get out of this political sand trap.

26:49.960 --> 26:50.960
I just wanted to impress you.

26:50.960 --> 27:01.960
You're very intimidating and gentle and smart and benevolent.

27:01.960 --> 27:10.960
We were upstairs with Aaron, and we told LaVar that if he were to sign a copy of his children's book,

27:10.960 --> 27:15.960
the rhino that swallowed the storm, we wouldn't open it until we had a child.

27:15.960 --> 27:20.960
And if he wanted to, he could name our child by signing the book.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.960
But he let it spill already.

27:24.960 --> 27:30.960
Your first child would be named Kunta Harmon.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.960
Which I'm fine with.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.960
It's kind of an appropriate...

27:34.960 --> 27:43.960
Male or female, Kunta Harmon.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.960
Okay, so I'm trying to get out of there.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.960
I'm looking at my notepad.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.960
I want to get away from the political stuff because I'm just so bad at it.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.960
It's not what makes me interesting.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.960
I can talk about a shit I took, and it's amazing.

27:59.960 --> 28:07.960
Queen Elizabeth tweeted.

28:07.960 --> 28:08.960
I just started on the news.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.960
Queen Elizabeth tweeted.

28:09.960 --> 28:10.960
Apparently she did.

28:10.960 --> 28:11.960
She did.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
The Queen tweeted.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
But a lot of...

28:13.960 --> 28:16.960
The Queen tweeted.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.960
It just sounds funny.

28:18.960 --> 28:19.960
The Queen tweeted.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.960
The Queen tweeted.

28:20.960 --> 28:28.960
But 60% of the coverage of it is dealing with the fact that because they had a big iPad setup for her to tweet.

28:28.960 --> 28:33.960
So she took off her royal glove and tweeted with her finger.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.960
But immediately everyone was going,

28:36.960 --> 28:41.960
Well, your first tweet that you tweeted, it's not sent from an iPad.

28:41.960 --> 28:43.960
It's sent from an iPhone.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.960
They immediately were trolling her.

28:46.960 --> 28:54.960
She's just got on Twitter and she's already having to deal with everything that we have to deal with on Twitter.

28:54.960 --> 29:02.960
I guess there was maybe a chance that they must have some aid in the corner with an iPhone going,

29:02.960 --> 29:05.960
Okay, did she press the prop iPad?

29:05.960 --> 29:08.960
Okay, now I'll send the tweet, the royal tweet.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.960
And the royal tweet is like,

29:10.960 --> 29:13.960
Oh, I'm the queen. I'm tweeting.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.960
But I guess that iPad...

29:15.960 --> 29:17.960
And I kind of think, why is that?

29:17.960 --> 29:20.960
Was there a chance that she might have typed into the iPad?

29:20.960 --> 29:21.960
There was no chance.

29:21.960 --> 29:28.960
Man should not be governed. Run, run for the hills.

29:28.960 --> 29:34.960
You have a right. You were born with all your rights.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.960
All government is a lie.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.960
They had to contain her.

29:40.960 --> 29:44.960
Like maybe she does that sometimes.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.960
The queen tweeted.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.960
You heard it here first.

29:49.960 --> 29:53.960
They have toothbrushes in my hotel room here in Austin.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.960
It already was the best city in the world.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.960
The hotel room has toothbrushes and toothpaste in it.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.960
You don't have to ask.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.960
Go moving on.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.960
It's awesome though.

30:07.960 --> 30:13.960
United Airlines is terrible. It's a terrible airline.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.960
And now you're just pandering.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.960
You must travel a lot.

30:17.960 --> 30:18.960
I do. I'm on the road all the time.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.960
Do you always travel first class? It's okay to say.

30:21.960 --> 30:22.960
No.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.960
You travel coach?

30:24.960 --> 30:29.960
Tomorrow I'm on Sunday. I'm traveling jet blue.

30:29.960 --> 30:33.960
And that's like the gimmick of the whole airline's coach.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.960
I travel southwest all the time.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.960
They're the ones that do the jokes and stuff.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.960
But I do enjoy travel.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.960
But you're okay with me always traveling first class.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.960
I'm okay with it.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.960
Yeah.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.960
You've earned it.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.960
It doesn't make me elitist.

30:55.960 --> 30:56.960
You've earned it.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.960
Now you're making me feel bad.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.960
You teach children to read.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.960
You should fly first class.

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
Why am I in first class?

31:06.960 --> 31:08.960
You're Dan Harmon.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.960
All right.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.960
That means a lot in my book.

31:13.960 --> 31:14.960
Thank you.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.960
No, it does.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.960
We can sing it acapella.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.960
We can just sing it.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.960
Can't we?

31:22.960 --> 31:24.960
Austin.

31:24.960 --> 31:25.960
All right.

31:25.960 --> 31:26.960
Yeah.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.960
I don't know how this is going to work.

31:28.960 --> 31:29.960
But let's just riff.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.960
Let's just go.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.960
What?

31:34.960 --> 31:37.960
Is this like a UK remix?

31:37.960 --> 31:40.960
This is...

31:40.960 --> 31:46.960
So, what that is.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.960
Backstory.

31:48.960 --> 31:49.960
Yeah.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.960
So, Febreeker, whatever her name is.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.960
That is not Tina Febreeker.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.960
But here's the thing.

31:57.960 --> 32:03.960
We did a remake of the Reading Rainbow theme song in the 90s.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.960
In the early 90s.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.960
No, actually it was pretty cool.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.960
In the early 90s.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
No, actually it was the mid 90s.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.960
And I went to my friend Chaka Khan.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.960
And asked her to sing the Reading Rainbow theme song.

32:19.960 --> 32:24.960
Not only did she sing it, she wrote the arrangement and plays drums on the track.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.960
This is Chaka Khan singing the Reading Rainbow theme song.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.960
And so you said, would you please do this?

32:31.960 --> 32:32.960
Chaka Khan.

32:32.960 --> 32:33.960
I would be happy.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.960
Chaka Khan.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.960
Let me rock you Chaka Khan.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.960
She went away with it.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.960
And then she came back Wednesday.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.960
And sat down at Spargos for lunch with you.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.960
And she slid a tape across.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.960
You put the Walkman in and you're listening to it.

32:47.960 --> 32:51.960
And you're like, oh shit.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.960
She redid it.

32:53.960 --> 33:01.960
And then you're like, good job Shaka.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.960
Chaka Khan, he's nodding.

33:04.960 --> 33:10.960
You got it?

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
It's that hook.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.960
We all know the hook, right?

33:13.960 --> 33:16.960
The question is, how do I rap during it?

33:16.960 --> 33:18.960
Because we're all going to want to sing it.

33:18.960 --> 33:19.960
Right.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.960
Maybe it's like, I don't know.

33:21.960 --> 33:42.960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.960
Anything, anywhere.

33:44.960 --> 33:52.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, butterfly, caterpillar.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.960
Oh shit, she's still singing.

33:54.960 --> 34:08.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.960
See, the thing is, then the song ends.

34:10.960 --> 34:11.960
Right.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.960
There's no way to turn it into a rap.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.960
Okay, here's what we're going to do.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.960
No, no, not Chaka Khan's version.

34:19.960 --> 34:24.960
Not her bastardization.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.960
Shaka, you're a musical legend.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.960
You went too far.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.960
LaVar won't say it.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.960
I will.

34:32.960 --> 34:42.960
You fucked up, Shaka.

34:42.960 --> 34:49.960
Is there anybody, I can't imagine there's anyone in Austin that knows how to confidently beatbox.

34:49.960 --> 34:55.960
I saw a hand go up there in the middle and your girlfriend's pointing at you, or maybe just your female friend.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.960
I don't want to judge you.

34:57.960 --> 34:58.960
It's Austin.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.960
Yeah, come on, Jerry, you want to come up?

35:00.960 --> 35:09.960
Do you think, do you think that you could, do you think it's possible for you to, to the tempo of the reading rainbow?

35:09.960 --> 35:11.960
No, come on, come on up, we want to meet you.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.960
Even if you don't, even if the answer is no, you're in a full Batman costume.

35:15.960 --> 35:16.960
Come on up.

35:16.960 --> 35:17.960
Yeah.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.960
What's your name, young man?

35:19.960 --> 35:20.960
Mars.

35:20.960 --> 35:21.960
Mars.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.960
Nothing about your disappoints.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.960
Grab a mic.

35:27.960 --> 35:35.960
Mars is in a onesie, a Batman onesie, but the Batman logo says forum.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.960
Is that a, is there something you're plugging?

35:37.960 --> 35:39.960
No, I found it in thrift store.

35:39.960 --> 35:40.960
Okay.

35:40.960 --> 35:45.960
So there's some backstory to this that you don't even know about, but it fits you like a glove.

35:45.960 --> 35:46.960
I actually looked it up.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.960
I think it's a defunct snowboarding company.

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
Oh, okay.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.960
Well, it's, you're making it work.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.960
Like, I, what am I doing?

35:53.960 --> 35:59.960
I'm just like Kevin Smith and it's like, it's not making, it's not going to help me in any way.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.960
You look good.

36:01.960 --> 36:09.960
Do you think that you could listen to the reading rainbow theme and somehow maintain the tempo so that when they finish singing the lyrics,

36:09.960 --> 36:17.960
then you're still beatboxing to the tempo and then I can come in with my badass science.

36:17.960 --> 36:18.960
And then, okay.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.960
On top of that, Lovar.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.960
Yeah.

36:21.960 --> 36:29.960
After I'm like, I'm rapping and then I'll throw it to you for like a kind of Lovar Burton spoken word bridge.

36:29.960 --> 36:30.960
Nice.

36:30.960 --> 36:39.960
And you can, you can talk about the importance of literacy or no child left behind, whatever you want to talk about.

36:39.960 --> 36:46.960
And then, and then, and then when you're done with that, I guess I'll try to like sew it up with another verse of rapping.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.960
And then we'll all just get out of here.

36:48.960 --> 36:54.960
No, then we'll bring up our, our friends and we'll, we'll, we'll have all kinds of fun.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.960
You think you can do it, Mars?

36:56.960 --> 36:57.960
Sure.

36:57.960 --> 36:58.960
It's not going to be easy.

36:58.960 --> 36:59.960
Let's give it a shot.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.960
Because it's not like the beat is distinct in this thing.

37:02.960 --> 37:03.960
It's like.

37:06.960 --> 37:07.960
Well, let's just try it.

37:07.960 --> 37:08.960
Okay.

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
Yeah, I'm not sure.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.960
I'm not sure.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.960
You guys sing it.

37:27.960 --> 37:28.960
Yeah.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:39.960 --> 37:40.960
Colors.

37:40.960 --> 37:44.960
I can't be anything

37:44.960 --> 37:46.960
Red, yellow, orange, brown, green

37:46.960 --> 37:48.960
Take a look, it's still a book

37:48.960 --> 37:50.960
A green rainbow

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
Yeah, yeah

37:52.960 --> 37:54.960
Green rainbow

37:54.960 --> 37:56.960
Green rainbow

37:56.960 --> 37:58.960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

37:58.960 --> 38:00.960
Pages and pages

38:00.960 --> 38:02.960
Books and books

38:02.960 --> 38:04.960
All the shelves are giving all the looks

38:04.960 --> 38:06.960
I'm gonna be literate

38:06.960 --> 38:08.960
Read every word

38:08.960 --> 38:10.960
Fuck your mama so hard she makes a turd

38:10.960 --> 38:13.960
I fucked your mama in the east and the west

38:13.960 --> 38:16.960
Fuck your mama so hard because I read the best

38:16.960 --> 38:18.960
When you read a book you get to

38:18.960 --> 38:20.960
Fuck everyone's mom

38:20.960 --> 38:23.960
I fucked your mama like her name was Tom

38:23.960 --> 38:26.960
That means I made a man of her

38:26.960 --> 38:29.960
Yo, I fucked her like a Lannister

38:29.960 --> 38:32.960
I always pay all my debts

38:32.960 --> 38:35.960
I fucked your mama so hard she got wet

38:35.960 --> 38:38.960
But that sounded gross

38:38.960 --> 38:42.960
Yo, yo, yo

38:42.960 --> 38:44.960
Spoken word

38:46.960 --> 38:49.960
Dan, I love you

38:49.960 --> 38:52.960
Dan, I love you

38:52.960 --> 38:55.960
Dan Harmon

38:55.960 --> 38:58.960
What is your mother's name?

38:58.960 --> 39:01.960
Faye, yo

39:01.960 --> 39:06.960
Faye, faye, faye

39:06.960 --> 39:10.960
What do I say about your mama Faye?

39:10.960 --> 39:13.960
Here's what I say

39:13.960 --> 39:16.960
She can come any day to my rainbow

39:16.960 --> 39:18.960
And read some rhymes

39:18.960 --> 39:21.960
And we will have a lovely times

39:21.960 --> 39:24.960
And dance her son and what a gun

39:24.960 --> 39:29.960
He's a genius and he's won the lottery

39:29.960 --> 39:34.960
Lottery because he's the man

39:34.960 --> 39:37.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah

39:37.960 --> 39:39.960
I can do anything

39:39.960 --> 39:41.960
Rainbow to rainbow

39:41.960 --> 39:43.960
Fuck your mama so hard

39:43.960 --> 39:45.960
There was a stain though

39:45.960 --> 39:47.960
And then I said sorry

39:47.960 --> 39:50.960
And then I got what the British call a lorry

39:50.960 --> 39:51.960
It's a bus

39:51.960 --> 39:53.960
A two-decker on top

39:53.960 --> 39:54.960
Fuck your mama so hard

39:54.960 --> 39:57.960
The government brought a mop

39:57.960 --> 40:00.960
Government

40:00.960 --> 40:02.960
Sorry, yo

40:02.960 --> 40:04.960
Yo, I can do anything

40:04.960 --> 40:06.960
When I read

40:06.960 --> 40:09.960
Yo, I made a necklace and a bead

40:09.960 --> 40:11.960
Put it all on the string around my neck

40:11.960 --> 40:13.960
And fucked your mama so hard

40:13.960 --> 40:15.960
That her name was

40:15.960 --> 40:16.960
He's back

40:16.960 --> 40:20.960
Back, back, back, back, back, back

40:20.960 --> 40:22.960
His parents are Scientologists

40:22.960 --> 40:24.960
And he respects the faith

40:24.960 --> 40:29.960
He shouldn't judge him for his legacy

40:29.960 --> 40:35.960
Here's some other people whose parents are Scientologists

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
Science fiction guy

40:36.960 --> 40:37.960
What's his name?

40:37.960 --> 40:38.960
L. Ron Hubbard

40:38.960 --> 40:40.960
Well, obviously

40:40.960 --> 40:41.960
No, not him

40:41.960 --> 40:43.960
That's the one science fiction writer

40:43.960 --> 40:49.960
His parents are guaranteed not to be Scientologists

40:49.960 --> 40:52.960
He's definitely getting back at them

40:52.960 --> 40:55.960
No, what's his name?

40:55.960 --> 40:56.960
Everybody loves him

40:56.960 --> 40:58.960
He wrote that Doctor Who episode

40:58.960 --> 41:00.960
That beat my community episode

41:00.960 --> 41:03.960
For the Neil Gaiman's Parents of Scientologists

41:03.960 --> 41:04.960
Yo

41:04.960 --> 41:06.960
And he's very respectful of them

41:06.960 --> 41:07.960
In the press

41:07.960 --> 41:10.960
Even though he's smart enough to know

41:10.960 --> 41:13.960
I think that's pretty cool

41:13.960 --> 41:14.960
Because

41:14.960 --> 41:24.960
Yo, religion doesn't have to be polarizing

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
Take a look

41:25.960 --> 41:26.960
It's in a book

41:26.960 --> 41:28.960
I fucked your mama so hard

41:28.960 --> 41:30.960
I turned a creek into a brook

41:30.960 --> 41:33.960
I turned a river into a lake

41:33.960 --> 41:34.960
I fucked your mama so hard

41:34.960 --> 41:36.960
For goodness' sake

41:36.960 --> 41:38.960
I fucked your mama from the ocean

41:38.960 --> 41:39.960
To the North Pole

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
I fucked your mama like

41:41.960 --> 41:43.960
Fuck, goddammit

41:43.960 --> 41:45.960
I'm on a roll

41:45.960 --> 41:46.960
I gotta wrap this up

41:46.960 --> 41:47.960
Fuck, fuck

41:47.960 --> 41:48.960
Alright

41:48.960 --> 41:50.960
Take a look

41:50.960 --> 41:51.960
It's in a book

41:51.960 --> 41:55.960
Fuck your mama

41:55.960 --> 41:58.960
In a breakfast nook

41:58.960 --> 42:01.960
LeVar Burton's in the house tonight

42:01.960 --> 42:04.960
I fucked your mama loose and tight

42:04.960 --> 42:07.960
I'm glad LeVar Burton's young daughter isn't here

42:07.960 --> 42:08.960
Me too, Dan

42:08.960 --> 42:09.960
Me too

42:09.960 --> 42:10.960
Alright, that's the rap

42:10.960 --> 42:11.960
That's the rap

42:11.960 --> 42:17.960
We did it

42:17.960 --> 42:19.960
I'm sure you're not an avid listener of the podcast

42:19.960 --> 42:21.960
But I tend to default to the fucking mamas

42:21.960 --> 42:22.960
In my rapping

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
Yeah

42:23.960 --> 42:24.960
Yeah

42:24.960 --> 42:25.960
It's all I know

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
It's the go-to

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
It's the go-to

42:27.960 --> 42:30.960
Mars, let's have a little chat with you

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
Okay

42:31.960 --> 42:32.960
Thank you

42:32.960 --> 42:33.960
That was great beatboxing

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
Sure

42:35.960 --> 42:39.960
Are you Austin-eer?

42:39.960 --> 42:40.960
What do they call them?

42:40.960 --> 42:41.960
Austinite

42:41.960 --> 42:42.960
Austinite

42:42.960 --> 42:43.960
Yeah

42:43.960 --> 42:44.960
Are you native?

42:44.960 --> 42:45.960
I'm originally from San Antonio

42:45.960 --> 42:49.960
I've been here three years

42:49.960 --> 42:50.960
Okay

42:50.960 --> 42:51.960
How old are you?

42:51.960 --> 42:52.960
You seem young enough to ask

42:52.960 --> 42:53.960
I'm 26

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
Okay

42:54.960 --> 42:55.960
Good

42:55.960 --> 42:56.960
What's your ambition?

42:56.960 --> 42:58.960
Electronics and music

42:58.960 --> 43:03.960
But you've clearly made electronics and music redundant

43:03.960 --> 43:04.960
Yeah

43:04.960 --> 43:06.960
All you need is your mouth

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
Sure

43:07.960 --> 43:09.960
That's a fallback for you

43:09.960 --> 43:10.960
Yeah

43:10.960 --> 43:11.960
It's a contingency plan

43:11.960 --> 43:13.960
It's like a soldier being a doomsday prepper

43:13.960 --> 43:14.960
They're like

43:14.960 --> 43:15.960
I love the government

43:15.960 --> 43:17.960
But also one day it may fail

43:17.960 --> 43:18.960
It's their hobby

43:18.960 --> 43:19.960
Yeah

43:19.960 --> 43:20.960
Like what I've learned from Uncle Sam

43:20.960 --> 43:23.960
I've learned to ration and store ammunition

43:23.960 --> 43:25.960
So that's your beatboxing

43:25.960 --> 43:28.960
It's like one day there may be no electronics or music

43:28.960 --> 43:29.960
Performance

43:29.960 --> 43:30.960
There's that

43:30.960 --> 43:32.960
The Dick Van Dyke, the one man band

43:32.960 --> 43:35.960
And the Mrs. Poppins

43:35.960 --> 43:37.960
Mary Poppins

43:37.960 --> 43:39.960
My childhood is hazy

43:39.960 --> 43:40.960
But anyway

43:40.960 --> 43:41.960
He's doing the one man band thing

43:41.960 --> 43:42.960
And it was very inspiring

43:42.960 --> 43:43.960
Are you

43:43.960 --> 43:45.960
So

43:45.960 --> 43:46.960
But so

43:46.960 --> 43:48.960
The reason why your ambition is in electronics and music

43:48.960 --> 43:50.960
Do you want to like produce music?

43:50.960 --> 43:52.960
Do you want to like make musical equipment?

43:52.960 --> 43:54.960
Do you want to be around people that make music?

43:54.960 --> 43:55.960
What's the

43:55.960 --> 43:56.960
Is there anything

43:56.960 --> 43:57.960
You don't have to know

43:57.960 --> 44:00.960
You can be 20, whatever you are

44:00.960 --> 44:01.960
Yeah, feeling through it

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
Yeah

44:02.960 --> 44:03.960
Okay, fuck it

44:03.960 --> 44:04.960
All right

44:04.960 --> 44:06.960
That's fine

44:06.960 --> 44:08.960
All right

44:08.960 --> 44:10.960
Do you love your mother?

44:10.960 --> 44:13.960
Yeah, she's great

44:13.960 --> 44:16.960
Do you think I'm required to love my mother?

44:16.960 --> 44:17.960
No

44:17.960 --> 44:19.960
No, I think mothers and parents are difficult

44:19.960 --> 44:21.960
She's not coming to my wedding

44:21.960 --> 44:23.960
Faye is not coming to your wedding?

44:23.960 --> 44:24.960
No

44:24.960 --> 44:25.960
What?

44:25.960 --> 44:27.960
I think because

44:27.960 --> 44:30.960
I think it's because my parents are tired of me

44:30.960 --> 44:34.960
Making public hay out of them having hit me when I was a kid

44:34.960 --> 44:36.960
So I feel like they're going

44:36.960 --> 44:38.960
Why would we want to go to a wedding where Jack Black's going to be like

44:38.960 --> 44:40.960
Is that them?

44:43.960 --> 44:45.960
And I kind of don't blame them for that reason

44:45.960 --> 44:47.960
I want to put this back together, Dan

44:47.960 --> 44:48.960
Are you

44:48.960 --> 44:50.960
You think you could call my mom and repair it?

44:50.960 --> 44:52.960
I would be happy to call Faye

44:52.960 --> 45:00.960
What time is it in Florida?

45:00.960 --> 45:01.960
Early enough

45:01.960 --> 45:02.960
Early enough

45:02.960 --> 45:03.960
No

45:03.960 --> 45:05.960
If it's past six, she's asleep

45:05.960 --> 45:06.960
Yeah

45:06.960 --> 45:07.960
All right

45:07.960 --> 45:08.960
We'll work on it later

45:08.960 --> 45:09.960
Okay

45:09.960 --> 45:11.960
Yeah, I think my mom would find a way to

45:11.960 --> 45:13.960
Turn this into a horrible and uncomfortable thing

45:13.960 --> 45:16.960
It sounds like podcast dynamite calling my mom

45:16.960 --> 45:17.960
With Mark Burton

45:17.960 --> 45:19.960
But I think somehow

45:19.960 --> 45:22.960
It could turn sour

45:22.960 --> 45:24.960
More fish for junta

45:27.960 --> 45:28.960
All right

45:28.960 --> 45:30.960
Let's thank Mars for coming up in beatbox

45:33.960 --> 45:34.960
Oh, thank you sir

45:34.960 --> 45:35.960
Thank you

45:36.960 --> 45:38.960
What a nice young man

45:38.960 --> 45:42.960
What a talented human beatbox

45:42.960 --> 45:46.960
I just need to point out that Mars has a back flap

45:46.960 --> 45:48.960
In his Batman suit

45:48.960 --> 45:49.960
Yeah

45:51.960 --> 45:52.960
Way to go Mars

45:53.960 --> 45:54.960
Nice work

45:54.960 --> 45:56.960
Is it closed or open?

45:56.960 --> 46:00.960
It was closed, but it has snaps for easy access

46:03.960 --> 46:07.960
Let's bring up Spencer Crittenton, the Dungeon Master

46:07.960 --> 46:09.960
Woo!

46:16.960 --> 46:17.960
Oh wait, I have one of these

46:17.960 --> 46:18.960
What up?

46:19.960 --> 46:20.960
I'm going to sit down

46:20.960 --> 46:22.960
So that I'm not like upstaging people

46:22.960 --> 46:24.960
You know, just a few things

46:24.960 --> 46:27.960
You know we met Mars before on the Harmon Tour

46:27.960 --> 46:28.960
He looks familiar

46:28.960 --> 46:29.960
He's even in the movie, right?

46:29.960 --> 46:30.960
Yeah

46:30.960 --> 46:32.960
Great guy, great guy Mars

46:32.960 --> 46:35.960
Also, Lori is not a bus, it's a truck

46:35.960 --> 46:38.960
Oh brother

46:39.960 --> 46:41.960
Do you see the look you got from Levar Burton?

46:41.960 --> 46:42.960
I don't know

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
No, I didn't

46:43.960 --> 46:44.960
No, it was like this

46:46.960 --> 46:48.960
I'm sorry I speak English

46:51.960 --> 46:52.960
It's the same language

46:53.960 --> 46:54.960
What's up you guys?

46:55.960 --> 46:58.960
We're just giddy with the light

46:58.960 --> 47:01.960
I'm sure a lot of people in Austin are excited for you to be here

47:01.960 --> 47:03.960
I'm excited for me

47:03.960 --> 47:05.960
By the way, podcast listeners might want to know

47:05.960 --> 47:07.960
They gave Levar a standing ovation

47:07.960 --> 47:09.960
When he came up, I thought that was really nice

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
Oh yeah

47:14.960 --> 47:17.960
There were some other facts about Levar Burton that kind of struck me

47:19.960 --> 47:25.960
Did you know that he did a little bit of unofficial work for the CIA?

47:25.960 --> 47:26.960
No

47:26.960 --> 47:27.960
Yeah, well he was doing

47:27.960 --> 47:30.960
Because his work, I'm reading from Wikipedia

47:30.960 --> 47:36.960
Because his work for reading Rainbow took him across several borders of hostile countries

47:36.960 --> 47:42.960
Levar Burton was approached by the OSS, the wartime precursor to the CIA

47:42.960 --> 47:44.960
Oh wait, this is Houdini, I'm sorry

47:44.960 --> 47:46.960
Yeah

47:46.960 --> 47:49.960
You get confused all the time

47:49.960 --> 47:51.960
You get confused with Houdini

47:51.960 --> 47:53.960
Contern Houdini

47:53.960 --> 48:00.960
Which is which

48:00.960 --> 48:03.960
So, here's the thing

48:03.960 --> 48:09.960
United Airlines, I already said, they're terrible people

48:09.960 --> 48:11.960
I tweeted that they're terrible

48:11.960 --> 48:13.960
They bumped us from the flight

48:13.960 --> 48:16.960
We all know that airlines, they overbook

48:16.960 --> 48:18.960
Here's the thing about airlines

48:18.960 --> 48:20.960
Here's what they do

48:20.960 --> 48:23.960
They have X amount of seats on their plane

48:23.960 --> 48:25.960
Okay, 100 seats, let's say

48:25.960 --> 48:27.960
Let's keep it simple

48:27.960 --> 48:30.960
How many seats should you sell if you have 100 on your plane?

48:30.960 --> 48:32.960
Why, 100?

48:32.960 --> 48:35.960
Oh, funny, you should say

48:35.960 --> 48:40.960
Because what they do is they sell 115

48:40.960 --> 48:43.960
Because, and they'll be the first to tell you

48:43.960 --> 48:47.960
The reason we do that is because of no shows

48:47.960 --> 48:50.960
We have to do it because of no shows

48:50.960 --> 48:54.960
Oh, oh, oh, do some people not show up?

48:54.960 --> 48:57.960
For your business that you run?

48:57.960 --> 48:59.960
Is that part of your overhead?

48:59.960 --> 49:01.960
Here's the thing

49:01.960 --> 49:03.960
Those people get charged anyway

49:03.960 --> 49:06.960
We've all been no shows, we all get charged

49:06.960 --> 49:09.960
You got 100 seats, you sold 100 tickets

49:09.960 --> 49:11.960
Take your fucking money

49:11.960 --> 49:15.960
They overbook because they have a chance of making more money

49:15.960 --> 49:20.960
A chance, they can't stand the idea of an empty seat on a plane

49:20.960 --> 49:23.960
When they're bringing the peanuts by

49:23.960 --> 49:25.960
They look at the seat and they're like

49:25.960 --> 49:29.960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, delicious money

49:29.960 --> 49:34.960
Oh, the pennies, oh, the nickels we could have had

49:34.960 --> 49:38.960
We could have sucked more blood from the poor

49:38.960 --> 49:42.960
They hate that, that's what pains them

49:42.960 --> 49:45.960
What a wasted seat

49:45.960 --> 49:47.960
It's not because they're victims

49:47.960 --> 49:49.960
It's not like airline piracy

49:49.960 --> 49:51.960
When someone doesn't show up for a flight

49:51.960 --> 49:54.960
So fuck you, every airline in the world

49:54.960 --> 49:56.960
And also it's not fair

49:56.960 --> 49:59.960
Because your companies are like pseudo companies

49:59.960 --> 50:02.960
Because they're not accountable to the normal laws

50:02.960 --> 50:04.960
Of supply and demand or capitalism

50:04.960 --> 50:06.960
They're protected from bankruptcy

50:06.960 --> 50:08.960
They're protected from competition

50:08.960 --> 50:10.960
They have virtual monopolies

50:10.960 --> 50:13.960
They have a box of fake capitalism

50:13.960 --> 50:15.960
Overseen by the government

50:15.960 --> 50:17.960
They're all bullshit companies

50:17.960 --> 50:19.960
I reserve the right to get mad

50:19.960 --> 50:21.960
When I show up at the gate and somebody goes

50:21.960 --> 50:24.960
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a serious situation here

50:24.960 --> 50:26.960
I don't know how this happened

50:26.960 --> 50:30.960
But it seems like there's more people than seats

50:30.960 --> 50:33.960
So at this point in time

50:33.960 --> 50:35.960
We'd like to invite you to come up

50:35.960 --> 50:39.960
And if you want to come up and help us out a little bit

50:39.960 --> 50:42.960
We're kind of fucking us over by being people

50:42.960 --> 50:45.960
This is not like we signed up for this

50:45.960 --> 50:47.960
Just hold tight

50:47.960 --> 50:49.960
And then you go up and you're like

50:49.960 --> 50:50.960
What the fuck are you talking about?

50:50.960 --> 50:51.960
We got to do a show in Austin

50:51.960 --> 50:53.960
They're like, excuse me

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
That's it, that's it

50:55.960 --> 50:57.960
You say, LeVar Burton, you fly coach

50:57.960 --> 50:58.960
You never have a problem with anybody

50:58.960 --> 51:00.960
You're a better person than me, fine

51:02.960 --> 51:04.960
I want to get LeVar Burton mad about something

51:04.960 --> 51:06.960
What makes you mad? No child left behind

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
Fucking let us have it

51:08.960 --> 51:10.960
Both barrels

51:11.960 --> 51:12.960
Really?

51:12.960 --> 51:13.960
Get mad

51:13.960 --> 51:15.960
I want to hear LeVar Burton rant

51:15.960 --> 51:17.960
Like what makes you fucking mad

51:17.960 --> 51:18.960
Like what makes your wife go

51:18.960 --> 51:20.960
LeVar, calm down

51:20.960 --> 51:24.960
Like what makes you kind of hit the mirror on the dresser

51:24.960 --> 51:26.960
At the foot of the bed

51:26.960 --> 51:28.960
You're taking off your beautiful jewelry

51:28.960 --> 51:32.960
At the end of a long day

51:32.960 --> 51:36.960
Teaching children to read

51:36.960 --> 51:37.960
And you're like

51:37.960 --> 51:40.960
LeVar, you're scaring me

51:40.960 --> 51:41.960
Yeah?

51:41.960 --> 51:43.960
You haven't seen the half of it

51:43.960 --> 51:45.960
I can do anything

51:49.960 --> 51:51.960
Take a look motherfucker

51:52.960 --> 51:53.960
I'm a but

51:53.960 --> 51:54.960
What is it?

51:54.960 --> 51:56.960
What's the thing that gets your

51:56.960 --> 52:00.960
Goddamn, really your bright red goat going

52:00.960 --> 52:02.960
Frank Spiner

52:05.960 --> 52:08.960
I am not really fond of ignorant people

52:08.960 --> 52:09.960
Yeah

52:09.960 --> 52:12.960
I get offended by ignorant people

52:12.960 --> 52:13.960
Like you know

52:13.960 --> 52:15.960
Like people get offended when people

52:15.960 --> 52:16.960
You know, say like

52:16.960 --> 52:17.960
Hey asshole

52:17.960 --> 52:20.960
You know, I get offended just when someone's ignorant

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
I'm like

52:21.960 --> 52:22.960
Where do you get off

52:22.960 --> 52:25.960
Not knowing where the stop sign is

52:25.960 --> 52:27.960
That's something most

52:27.960 --> 52:30.960
Well, what kind of, give us an ignorant person

52:30.960 --> 52:36.960
People who are intolerant of other people

52:38.960 --> 52:39.960
Keep going

52:39.960 --> 52:41.960
We gotta get the intolerance out of you

52:43.960 --> 52:45.960
I know it'll seem hypocritical

52:46.960 --> 52:50.960
I want you to be so angry

52:50.960 --> 52:52.960
You want me to be angry Dan?

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
You want me to be angry

52:53.960 --> 52:58.960
Just for funsies

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
Motherfucker

52:59.960 --> 53:02.960
I will cut you

53:02.960 --> 53:04.960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

53:04.960 --> 53:07.960
Shut the fuck up

53:07.960 --> 53:10.960
I will cut you

53:10.960 --> 53:11.960
Me

53:11.960 --> 53:12.960
Bitch

53:12.960 --> 53:13.960
What

53:13.960 --> 53:15.960
Because of my ignorance?

53:15.960 --> 53:16.960
No

53:16.960 --> 53:17.960
No

53:17.960 --> 53:19.960
Not because of your ignorance

53:19.960 --> 53:22.960
Because you want me to be fucking angry

53:22.960 --> 53:24.960
Dan Harmon

53:24.960 --> 53:26.960
You have pushed me over the edge

53:33.960 --> 53:36.960
You're the gentlest man in the world

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
I disagree

53:37.960 --> 53:39.960
That's the kind of intent, quiet intensity

53:39.960 --> 53:41.960
That absolutely makes me shit myself

53:41.960 --> 53:42.960
No, I'm not

53:42.960 --> 53:44.960
I'm not saying it's not scary

53:44.960 --> 53:47.960
Nobody in this room wants to disappoint Levar Burton

53:47.960 --> 53:48.960
I'm not saying like

53:48.960 --> 53:51.960
Oh, you're such a sugar cube

53:51.960 --> 53:52.960
I'm saying like

53:52.960 --> 53:54.960
This guy is so in control

53:54.960 --> 53:56.960
You don't have that

53:56.960 --> 53:57.960
The Poloric Valve

53:57.960 --> 53:59.960
What's that Confederacy of Dunce's guys

53:59.960 --> 54:01.960
Like you don't have the

54:01.960 --> 54:02.960
You don't have the fucking like

54:02.960 --> 54:04.960
Stack to blow

54:04.960 --> 54:07.960
You don't lose control of your anger

54:07.960 --> 54:09.960
You sit on it

54:09.960 --> 54:11.960
Not sit on it, you're not repressed

54:11.960 --> 54:13.960
You're noble

54:13.960 --> 54:15.960
You're a noble creature

54:15.960 --> 54:18.960
You're a noble highly evolved old soul

54:18.960 --> 54:22.960
Does it make you mad when I define you like that?

54:24.960 --> 54:26.960
You fucking noble soul

54:28.960 --> 54:29.960
Come on

54:30.960 --> 54:32.960
I hate you, Dan Harmon

54:33.960 --> 54:34.960
I hate you

54:34.960 --> 54:36.960
You're hate's bullshit

54:36.960 --> 54:38.960
Yeah, I'm sorry, it is, you're right

54:43.960 --> 54:46.960
That's a result that's actually more valuable

54:46.960 --> 54:48.960
Than just getting you to like

54:50.960 --> 54:51.960
We got to confirm

54:51.960 --> 54:54.960
Levar Burton's biosphere doesn't have

54:55.960 --> 54:59.960
The T-Rex on your planet

54:59.960 --> 55:01.960
Has like

55:02.960 --> 55:04.960
He's holding little flowers

55:05.960 --> 55:07.960
And his little hands, the little T-Rex hands

55:08.960 --> 55:10.960
How does he pick them?

55:11.960 --> 55:13.960
That was a bad analogy

55:13.960 --> 55:14.960
It doesn't make any sense

55:14.960 --> 55:15.960
I think it was good

55:15.960 --> 55:17.960
It was visual

55:17.960 --> 55:18.960
It was a visual analogy

55:18.960 --> 55:20.960
I know what'll make you mad if nothing else

55:20.960 --> 55:21.960
Talk to me

55:21.960 --> 55:22.960
Let's get

55:22.960 --> 55:23.960
Because I know

55:23.960 --> 55:25.960
A secret also on

55:25.960 --> 55:26.960
Levar Burton's Wikipedia

55:26.960 --> 55:28.960
He's a rampant misogynist

55:29.960 --> 55:30.960
He hates women

55:30.960 --> 55:33.960
So let's bring up my fiancé, Arie McGathey

55:33.960 --> 55:34.960
Arie McGathey

55:44.960 --> 55:46.960
Take notes, Dan

55:50.960 --> 55:52.960
Levar kind of

55:54.960 --> 55:55.960
He's outclassed me

55:55.960 --> 55:57.960
Brought her up like a gentleman

55:59.960 --> 56:01.960
Yeah, we were at dinner

56:01.960 --> 56:03.960
And Dan and Neil Berkeley

56:03.960 --> 56:04.960
The director of the documentary

56:04.960 --> 56:06.960
Both had flowers in their drink

56:06.960 --> 56:08.960
And Neil very valiantly

56:08.960 --> 56:09.960
Gave me his flower

56:09.960 --> 56:10.960
And I looked at Dan

56:10.960 --> 56:12.960
And he had his and his hair

56:15.960 --> 56:16.960
Yeah

56:16.960 --> 56:17.960
I don't, yeah

56:18.960 --> 56:20.960
But we're going to couples therapy

56:20.960 --> 56:21.960
And we're learning

56:21.960 --> 56:22.960
I'm learning how to

56:22.960 --> 56:25.960
I'm learning how to perceive people

56:25.960 --> 56:27.960
Aaron, have you met Fay?

56:28.960 --> 56:29.960
I have met Fay

56:29.960 --> 56:30.960
And?

56:30.960 --> 56:31.960
Yeah

56:31.960 --> 56:33.960
I met Dan's parents

56:33.960 --> 56:35.960
Only two months into dating him

56:35.960 --> 56:37.960
Because they were visiting

56:37.960 --> 56:38.960
And Dan was very nervous

56:38.960 --> 56:39.960
About hosting for them

56:39.960 --> 56:41.960
So I hosted like a game night

56:43.960 --> 56:44.960
It was very early on

56:44.960 --> 56:47.960
So they were fine and sweet

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
They're good with you?

56:48.960 --> 56:49.960
Oh yeah, yeah

56:49.960 --> 56:50.960
No, they were great

56:50.960 --> 56:51.960
They were

56:51.960 --> 56:52.960
His dad got a little drunk

56:52.960 --> 56:53.960
And at one point Dan said

56:53.960 --> 56:54.960
We were playing

56:54.960 --> 56:55.960
What were you playing?

56:55.960 --> 56:56.960
Catchphrase

56:56.960 --> 56:57.960
The only game we played

56:57.960 --> 56:58.960
I'm so nervous

56:58.960 --> 56:59.960
Being on stage with you

56:59.960 --> 57:00.960
I'm so excited

57:01.960 --> 57:02.960
The butterflies in my stomach

57:02.960 --> 57:03.960
Are flying twice as high

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
But they're in your stomach

57:07.960 --> 57:08.960
So they're just in your esophagus

57:08.960 --> 57:09.960
Yeah, yeah

57:09.960 --> 57:11.960
They're stuck right here

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
Their stomach butterflies

57:12.960 --> 57:13.960
Flying twice as high

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
They're just going to

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
Just going to puke them up

57:16.960 --> 57:18.960
Yeah, it's going to be gross

57:18.960 --> 57:19.960
And beautiful layer

57:19.960 --> 57:20.960
At the same time

57:20.960 --> 57:21.960
Yeah, it's going to be a banksy

57:21.960 --> 57:22.960
On this stage

57:23.960 --> 57:25.960
I, yeah

57:25.960 --> 57:26.960
His, at one point

57:26.960 --> 57:28.960
Dan said something kind of off-color

57:28.960 --> 57:29.960
And his dad, Hermie

57:29.960 --> 57:30.960
Like, very earnestly

57:30.960 --> 57:31.960
He said to him like

57:31.960 --> 57:32.960
Come on, stop it

57:32.960 --> 57:34.960
Or she won't marry you

57:34.960 --> 57:35.960
Something like that

57:35.960 --> 57:36.960
Something along those lines

57:36.960 --> 57:37.960
Do you remember that?

57:37.960 --> 57:38.960
I don't remember that

57:38.960 --> 57:39.960
I logged it away

57:40.960 --> 57:41.960
I liked it

57:41.960 --> 57:43.960
But yeah, they're super

57:43.960 --> 57:44.960
They're good folk

57:44.960 --> 57:46.960
It breaks my heart

57:46.960 --> 57:48.960
That I've somehow

57:49.960 --> 57:50.960
I just

57:50.960 --> 57:52.960
As I have named your first child

57:52.960 --> 57:55.960
Might I get an invitation

57:55.960 --> 57:57.960
To the nuptials?

57:57.960 --> 57:59.960
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:59.960 --> 58:01.960
It's a pretty full wedding

58:01.960 --> 58:03.960
Can we fire our officiant?

58:03.960 --> 58:05.960
Will you marry us?

58:06.960 --> 58:07.960
You know what?

58:07.960 --> 58:09.960
I have been asked before

58:09.960 --> 58:11.960
And if you're serious

58:11.960 --> 58:13.960
I accept

58:19.960 --> 58:20.960
How about this?

58:20.960 --> 58:22.960
Would you be willing to

58:22.960 --> 58:24.960
Because our friend Duncan

58:24.960 --> 58:26.960
Is going to officiate our wedding

58:26.960 --> 58:27.960
But

58:27.960 --> 58:29.960
I don't want to dis-dunk him

58:29.960 --> 58:31.960
Would you please do a reading

58:31.960 --> 58:32.960
At our ceremony?

58:32.960 --> 58:33.960
Yes

58:33.960 --> 58:35.960
Absolutely

58:35.960 --> 58:36.960
Alright

58:36.960 --> 58:37.960
Absolutely

58:37.960 --> 58:38.960
Would you

58:38.960 --> 58:39.960
You could read

58:39.960 --> 58:40.960
Bread is for eating

58:40.960 --> 58:42.960
Bread is for eating

58:42.960 --> 58:44.960
If that's what you like

58:44.960 --> 58:45.960
Yeah

58:45.960 --> 58:47.960
What about Frederick?

58:47.960 --> 58:49.960
Do you have an encyclopedic knowledge

58:49.960 --> 58:50.960
Of children's books?

58:50.960 --> 58:52.960
Do you remember Leo Leone?

58:52.960 --> 58:53.960
Leo Leone

58:53.960 --> 58:54.960
Yeah, okay

58:54.960 --> 58:55.960
Doesn't ring a bell

58:55.960 --> 58:56.960
Yeah

58:58.960 --> 59:00.960
I always thought those kids'

59:00.960 --> 59:01.960
Book reviews

59:01.960 --> 59:03.960
They're too concise

59:04.960 --> 59:06.960
Reader gate

59:08.960 --> 59:09.960
I feel like those kids are like

59:09.960 --> 59:10.960
They're like six

59:10.960 --> 59:11.960
Why are they like

59:11.960 --> 59:13.960
I read the meatball

59:13.960 --> 59:15.960
In the earth sky

59:16.960 --> 59:18.960
It's a great book

59:18.960 --> 59:19.960
I'm like this kid doesn't talk

59:19.960 --> 59:20.960
Like a kid

59:20.960 --> 59:21.960
The fix is in

59:21.960 --> 59:22.960
This is Paola

59:22.960 --> 59:25.960
LaVar as

59:25.960 --> 59:26.960
As the host of Reading Rainbow

59:26.960 --> 59:28.960
And as an author yourself

59:28.960 --> 59:29.960
Are there any children's books

59:29.960 --> 59:30.960
That are really popular

59:30.960 --> 59:31.960
That you're like

59:31.960 --> 59:32.960
Come on

59:32.960 --> 59:33.960
This is bullshit

59:33.960 --> 59:34.960
I don't know

59:34.960 --> 59:35.960
I am a big fan of

59:35.960 --> 59:36.960
Go the fuck to sleep

59:38.960 --> 59:40.960
I remember that being in the press

59:40.960 --> 59:41.960
People being offended by it

59:41.960 --> 59:42.960
But then other

59:42.960 --> 59:43.960
It seems like

59:43.960 --> 59:44.960
I don't want to

59:44.960 --> 59:45.960
I mean

59:45.960 --> 59:47.960
I'm sure there were real parents

59:47.960 --> 59:48.960
That were offended as well

59:48.960 --> 59:50.960
But it kind of felt like

59:50.960 --> 59:52.960
Most real parents

59:52.960 --> 59:53.960
Were big fans of that book

59:53.960 --> 59:55.960
And people who weren't yet parents

59:55.960 --> 59:56.960
Were like

59:56.960 --> 59:57.960
This is offensive

59:57.960 --> 59:58.960
It's like

59:58.960 --> 59:59.960
Come on

59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.960
Go the fuck to sleep

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.960
No, if you're a real parent

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960
If you are a parent

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960
You can relate to that book

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.960
Go the fuck to sleep

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960
I have a wedding ceremony pitch

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960
Seeing as you're

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960
It's traditional at the reception

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.960
For the father of the groom

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:20.960
To give a speech

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960
And your lovely father

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960
Oh, my parents are coming

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960
Will you play my dad

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960
At my wedding?

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
Is that what you were going to suggest?

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960
Yeah

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960
I'm going to cry

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.960
Laver is so unfazed by this

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.960
This is the 20th time

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.960
Someone's asked him to play

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.960
However, this is the first time

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960
I've said yes

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.960
All right

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.960
Laver Burton

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.960
Is going to play the role of my father

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.960
At my wedding

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960
Now we have to get

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960
Like Katherine Keener

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960
To be my mom

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960
Or something

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.960
What?

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.960
She just seems very cold

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960
I don't know

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.960
We can do better, Dan

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960
We can do better

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.960
She's a great actor

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.960
I love her

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.960
But you need more of a

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.960
What about a...

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960
Chaka Khan

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.960
Chaka Khan

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.960
Chaka Khan

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.960
I'll let Laver make that call

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.960
Thank you

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.960
Hey, remember when you fucked up my song

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.960
Now it's time

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960
Time to make it right

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960
You're going to come play

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960
Don't ask

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.960
I'm going to explain the role to you

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.960
You can't ask any questions

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.960
She's just there

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960
I'm already in mourning

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.960
Over my relationship with Chaka

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960
I don't think she listens

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960
I remember my brother listening to that song

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.960
On a loop

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.960
Like from 1982 to 1986

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960
Chaka Khan

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.960
Let me rock it

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960
Let me rock it

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960
Chaka Khan

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960
That was just over and over

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
I was so shocked to find out that

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.960
Chaka Khan was her name

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.960
I thought it was like

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960
Like get down

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.960
Chaka Khan

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.960
Rock and roll

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.960
Chaka Khan

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.960
You thought it was just like a thing

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960
People say

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960
Yeah, I was corrected

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:24.960
Because I said it like at school

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.960
Like I got an equation right

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.960
In math class

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.960
And was like

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960
Chaka Khan

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.960
And they're like

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.960
You know that's her name, right?

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.960
No, I thought

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
You thought it was like Ka-Blam-O

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960
Yeah

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960
Boo-Yah

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960
Boo-Yah Johnson

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960
Yeah

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960
Yeah

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960
Speaking of it

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960
I cannot wait to have a little Kuta Haraman

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.960
You can't wait to

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.960
Are you doing what I'm doing right now

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.960
Which is trying to figure out

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.960
A joke where someone gets

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.960
Kuta's name wrong and kindergarten

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.960
And she has to correct her teacher

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.960
Over and over again

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.960
No, I hadn't thought about that

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.960
Actually, I mean

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.960
Aaron's 12 years younger than me

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.960
Being raised in the 70s

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960
The truth is

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.960
Because we were at that

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.960
Weird event horizon

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.960
Of racial politics

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.960
The name Kuta Kinte

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960
The words

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.960
When you do that joke

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960
LaVar adlib that

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.960
At the end of the community episode

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960
When he goes more fish for Kuta

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
Every time

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960
The word Kuta

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960
Makes my spinal cord

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960
Kind of cringe a little bit

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960
Yeah, there's a definite visual

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960
That goes on

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.960
Well, it was used so much back then

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960
In negative ways

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.960
Because it was a positive thing

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960
It was like

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960
There was like

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.960
I grew up in Milwaukee in the 70s

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960
So if you have a Camaro and a mullet

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.960
And you are

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.960
The words Kuta Kinte were not used

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960
Primarily like

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960
What a great character

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.960
It was like

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960
And I hear the words

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960
And they have a shock to my system

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960
Like

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.960
He said it, not me

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960
I don't know

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.960
Which is why

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.960
My experience on community

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.960
Was one of the best

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.960
Of my professional career

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.960
You let the adlib go

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.960
You let it stay in the picture, Dan

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.960
You left it in the episode

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960
That's more on you

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960
That you was that good

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960
If it was bad, he would have cut it

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.960
I'll cut it if it is funny

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960
And we don't have time

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.960
We tortured you

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.960
When you came back

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960
For the horrible heart-wrenching

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.960
Troy Goodbye episode

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960
Thank you so much for coming back

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960
And doing that

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960
We shot the tag

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960
Where you were sitting in that boat

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960
With Donald

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960
And there's basically two versions of that tag

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960
There's the one where Donald

01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960
That you've seen

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.960
Where Donald pulls out the piece of paper

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960
And he has a thousand questions about Star Trek

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.960
But then there's a whole different one

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.960
Which has blocking and everything

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.960
Where LeVar Burton is just like

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960
Turns out to have a lot of road rage

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.960
And he's just there with Donald

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960
And he's like

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960
They're in traffic

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960
And he's like

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960
I don't know what's taking so long

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.960
And then somebody honks

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960
And he goes up to the window

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.960
And the whole tag is just LeVar Burton yelling

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960
At some unseen lady

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960
Going like

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960
Don't look at your baby

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.960
Your baby's on my side

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960
It's really funny

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.960
But we didn't have time for that version

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.960
Oh, Dan, I really want LeVar to officiate our wedding

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960
No, you can't

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960
Duncan Trussell's going to do a great job

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960
I know, I love him, but it's

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960
Duncan, Duncan will officiate

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960
I know, that's all

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960
Yeah, you don't want to

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960
I will do a reading

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960
Yes, thank you

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960
I will do a reading

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960
It's going to be great

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960
I will do a reading

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960
Frederick

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960
After Duncan says

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960
I now pronounce you man and wave

01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:00.960
Can you also just say it?

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960
I also pronounce you

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960
We'll do a

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960
Yeah, we'll do a

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.960
Like, I know

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.960
You could do a call or a response

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960
I now pronounce you man and wave

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960
And then we'll all look over at LeVar

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.960
And LeVar'll nod

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960
And then, yeah

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960
It'll be like a

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.960
Mr. Miyagi kind of like

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.960
Y'all are married now

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960
For real

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960
Yeah

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.960
My poor father is getting

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.960
My father is a preacher

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960
And I think wanted to be

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960
Involved in the wedding

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960
And he's getting

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.960
Further and further away from

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.960
By the way, you're raised

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960
Catholic, you went to

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960
Seminary school

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.960
How much did that have to do

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.960
With your parents?

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.960
How religious were your parents?

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.960
My mother was not Catholic at all

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960
My mother was a teacher

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960
She was an educator

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960
She knew that the best education

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.960
Available for her three children

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.960
I know there's a single parent

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.960
And I was raised Catholic

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960
Because that was where

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.960
The education was

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.960
Education was the level of the playing field

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.960
She knew that if I was going to

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960
That I would grow up

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.960
And inherit a world that would be hostile

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960
To my presence simply because

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.960
Of the color of my skin

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.960
And the only chance I had

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.960
Was to be able to compete

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:08.960
Levely

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.960
And in education was the key to that

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.960
Smart lady

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.960
What a mom

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960
How did you feel about

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.960
You going to seminary?

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960
When I decided to become a priest

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960
My mother was very nervous

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960
She was like

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.960
Oh my, I've gone too far

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.960
But she supported me

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.960
And then when I decided

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960
Not to become a priest

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960
And become an actor

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.960
She was also very nervous

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960
For me

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960
But it's all worked out

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.960
So Irma Jean's good

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960
She's good

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960
Her name's Irma Jean?

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.960
Irma Jean

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.960
E-R-M-A-G-E-N-E

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.960
Whenever I get an opportunity

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.960
To speak my mother's name

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.960
In front of people I do

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.960
I am

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960
I am the man I am

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960
Because she is the woman she is

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.960
Is she still out there?

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.960
Absolutely

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960
Oh wow

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.960
Did she tell you

01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.960
Like

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.960
Did she tell you

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.960
You can do anything you want

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960
Absolutely

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.960
Yeah

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.960
My mom, by the way

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960
Also did that

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960
Yeah

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960
That's why

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.960
I want to have a conversation with her

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960
She always said

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960
You can do whatever you want

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.960
Right

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.960
She also hit us a little bit

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960
It's not a big deal

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960
Like

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960
I just fall back on that

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.960
I got beat when I was a kid

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960
Yeah, we all did

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.960
Yeah

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.960
Except for these guys

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.960
The way parenting was conducted

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960
Back in the day

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960
That's what my mom said

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.960
Hello

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.960
Yeah

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960
You turned out okay

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960
I'm fine

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.960
I'm a millionaire

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.960
Hello

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960
Yeah

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960
I don't remember

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960
How much it hurts

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.960
I do know

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960
How much money I have

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960
No, you don't

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960
I feel like

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.960
If my parents were like

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.960
You know

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.960
I feel like

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.960
You know

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.960
And

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.960
You would never strike

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960
Conta Harmon

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960
No

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960
No

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.960
I wouldn't

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.960
No, you won't

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.960
I chased my cat once

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960
And I got really upset

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960
I was living alone

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960
I wasn't in a relationship

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960
And my cat kept meowing

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.960
And I got really frustrated

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.960
And I kind of chased her

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.960
And I was screaming

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960
And chasing her

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960
And I was like

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960
Oh, fuck

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.960
I'm gonna beat my kids

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.960
But I think that our parents hit us

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.960
100 times less than their parents hit them

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960
Exactly right

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960
And I think we've got it down now to

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:24.960
Maybe we'll

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.960
Maybe I'll give my kid a wet willy

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.960
I mean, I don't want you to

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960
Chase and frighten our kids around the house

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.960
But I would like to see what that would look like

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.960
I've always figured that

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.960
I would just like

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.960
A one-time dispensation

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960
Just so they know I'm crazy enough

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960
To do it again

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.960
I think that goes a long way

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.960
I think that parents like

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960
My heart goes out to parents today

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960
When you see them at the airport

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.960
And they're like

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960
This generation is committed to the idea

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.960
That there's never a good reason

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.960
To hit your kid

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960
And it's not

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.960
I can see that it's not easy

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960
I can see from the expression on their face

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.960
In the grocery store

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960
I can see that they are

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.960
It's not like they're

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.960
Pussies

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.960
It's not like they're

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:18.960
It's not like they're not doing it

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.960
Because they don't want to

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.960
I can see that it's actually

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960
Discipline

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960
You know, in the part of a generation

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.960
That probably did get walloped a little bit

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960
And they're like

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960
Yeah, it's probably

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.960
Let's experiment

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.960
I do also see a lot of parents that are like

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960
I'm gonna be my kid's best friend

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960
And the kid is like

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960
A fucking horrible nightmare

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960
But I don't judge

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.960
Because I'm not a judgmental person at all

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960
But I do

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.960
I think we're conducting a generation-wide experiment

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.960
Right now

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960
It seems to be successful

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960
I think the time-outs

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960
And all that shit do work

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.960
I think that the kids are gonna be fine

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960
I don't think that

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960
I don't think you need to like

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960
Hit your kid, right?

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.960
That's not a controversial statement

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.960
I'll cover the parenting

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.960
I'll take care of it

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.960
Oh, yeah

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.960
I'll just wake my kid up at 3 in the morning

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960
And be like

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960
Yeah, the Holocaust happened

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960
Six million Jews

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960
It's horrible

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960
Good night

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960
My favorite children's book was

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960
Frederick by Leo Leone

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960
Just put that in the hopper

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.960
For the wedding

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.960
If he really does show up

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960
And really reads a book

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.960
I don't want your favorite book

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.960
Necessarily to be the only one

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.960
In the run

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:38.960
We just give him a pile of books

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.960
Well, someone should make a choice

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960
Maybe it should be based on

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960
The number of awards that the author received

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.960
I believe Leo Leone is

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.960
Highly acclaimed

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.960
And recently deceased

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960
An Italian

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.960
I don't know what this shit you're

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.960
Raised on is

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.960
It's probably some watercolor bullshit

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.960
It's by an AIDS activist with leukemia

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.960
It's fine

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960
It doesn't matter

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960
They're dying, it doesn't matter

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.960
Okay, so we got

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960
If we were to play D&D

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960
We got our Dungeon Master

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960
We got me, we got you

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960
We got LaVar

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960
Do we need an extra person

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.960
To play another part?

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.960
I can't remember

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.960
Yeah, thank you so much

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.960
Okay, so we should make a friend

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.960
Last night in Austin

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960
It hasn't aired yet

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960
But Austin

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960
We're in Austin

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960
San Francisco

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960
Jackass

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960
Last night in San Francisco

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.960
We had two dudes up

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.960
So I want to balance it with

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.960
Someone who at the very least

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.960
Identifies as a female

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.960
New progressive Harmon

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.960
And I think we should base it on somebody

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.960
That let's go with the pain this time

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.960
Who's had a terrible day

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:55.960
Or a terrible month

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.960
Or a terrible...

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.960
Okay, we got a hand shot up

01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960
Do you want to come up

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.960
And will you share

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.960
Your misery with us?

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.960
Okay, it's alright

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.960
If it hits a nice medium

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960
Alright, you take this

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960
What's your name?

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960
Vanessa

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960
Vanessa, okay

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960
Vanessa

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960
What's the...

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.960
What's the medium problem?

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960
I had a really bad week

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.960
I started out on Monday

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.960
I had to work for this commercial

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960
As a PA

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960
I'm not going to say the name

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.960
But for this LA woman

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.960
And yeah, it was like in the beginning

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.960
It was great

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960
But I hired my best friend

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.960
As my code, or co-PA

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.960
He's my co-director

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960
We make small music videos

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960
It was really fun

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.960
But he's like a total stoner

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.960
And we spoke the first day on Monday

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.960
And I think she kind of knew

01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.960
And I felt really bad

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960
Because you're not saying

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960
It's relaxed

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960
Everything's chill

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960
It's okay, we can do everything

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960
We did everything she told us to do

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.960
But I think she knew

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.960
That we were high the first time

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960
So we were like

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960
Okay, whatever, it's fine

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960
And she called us kids

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.960
And she was playing teacher kind of

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:12.960
And she had this thing

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.960
Where she was like

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960
You didn't bring a notebook

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960
You didn't...

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960
Here's this paper

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.960
You're wasting trees

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.960
And she throws away all the food

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.960
That we went to buy her

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.960
All right, this lady is obviously not green

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960
But whatever, from LA

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.960
And then on Tuesday

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.960
We show up again

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:30.960
And we were kind of late

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.960
We woke up that day

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.960
Oh, we had to get a smoothie

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.960
And we showed up like

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.960
Are you also stone for that?

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:38.960
Okay, sorry

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960
We're total stoners

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.960
So we get high again

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.960
We made...

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960
Have you heard of Molen?

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.960
Molen?

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.960
Molen, it's an herb

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.960
Can I reach a crashing when I grow my drink?

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.960
Yeah, yeah

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.960
It's an herb for your lungs

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960
And like lately

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.960
I quit cigarettes like two weeks ago

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.960
And like I've been trying to clear my lungs

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960
Smoking Molen spliffs

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.960
And they're so good

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:01.960
So we like

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.960
Wait, you're smoking something

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.960
To clean your lungs out?

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.960
Yeah, yeah, no

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:06.960
I didn't believe it too

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.960
But I looked it up

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960
And it's like this ancient cowboy thing

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960
Anyways

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960
Ancient cowboys

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.960
Like before science came around

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.960
Ancient cowboys

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.960
Anyways, so then we like get high again

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.960
And she's like

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.960
Making us the whole

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.960
The task for the commercial was

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960
We had to sort positive phrases

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.960
And negative phrases

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.960
And like people basically had to choose

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.960
Like three things they wanted to do

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.960
A future and past

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:31.960
And like

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.960
I got to say like

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960
I graduated college

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960
That's a positive thing

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.960
You know?

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:36.960
And they were like

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.960
My mother died

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960
That's a negative thing

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960
And the positive things were yellow

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960
And then the blue things

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960
Or the negative things were blue

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960
This was a job

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960
Are you sure you...

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960
This was a P.A.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960
Yeah

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.960
A job at like a rehab center?

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.960
Unconvinced you as a music video?

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960
No, no

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960
No, go in there

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.960
Winona Ryder's in there

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.960
She can't wait to meet you

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960
And I'm like

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960
Okay

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.960
No, we're getting paid 225 dollars

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960
I need the cash

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960
I'm like super broke

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960
So I'm doing it

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960
And then anyways

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960
We're like kind of high

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960
So it's kind of funny

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.960
To read some of these things

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960
Because everybody wrote like

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960
I mean

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960
So one of the negative phrases

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960
Like was like Ebola

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.960
And we're like

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:12.960
Readings out loud

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:13.960
We're like oh man

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:14.960
Some of them are so negative

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.960
Everybody wanted a car

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.960
And it was kind of sad

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.960
About the positive phrases

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.960
Were really sad

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960
Because they were all generic

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960
Like there were two or three

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960
Where I'm like

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960
Damn, I really like this person

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.960
Like one person said

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:24.960
I want to write a book

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.960
And I'm like

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.960
For the first like

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.960
Someone finally wants to write a book

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:28.960
Like everybody wants a house

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.960
Or a car

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.960
Like they want to be an actor

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.960
Because they're all extras

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.960
Like the extras

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.960
Were the ones that wrote

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.960
All these things

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.960
So anyways

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.960
We're reading them out loud

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.960
And she was like

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.960
You have no time

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.960
You have no time

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.960
Put them in like

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:41.960
In the bins

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.960
And we're like

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960
Oh my god

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960
But these are great

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.960
저희는 스케줄을 하고 있어요.

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960
저희는 정말 일을 하고 있어요.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.960
다른 LA 여자들은

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.960
가장 의미의 여자들은

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.960
저번에

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960
패드리코, 제 친구가

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.960
저녁에 밥을 먹었을 때

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.960
젤리 words are actually negative, like that's really bad.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.960
And this like woman's like no we're all doing it.

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.960
What is this production?

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.960
You're a PA and they're doing it.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.960
But anyways, so as we save them, no sorry.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.960
As we save them, we're like saving them.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.960
She calls me out and she's like, you know what?

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.960
We're not going to need you on Wednesday.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.960
Like I don't trust you guys.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.960
And you guys are just, I can't vibe with you guys.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.960
I already hired 10 PA's.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.960
And I was like, part of my task was to hire 10 PA's for their actual shoot.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.960
And these women, they were women who put their children in daycare for Wednesday.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960
And then I was like, wait a minute, you're not letting me down.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960
You're letting down like 10 people that I gotta say,

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.960
like now they can't show up for this commercial.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.960
And she's like, well, it's okay.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.960
And then I find out today, I don't know if I'm going to get paid for it.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.960
No, I'm not going to do that.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.960
Don't heckle people.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.960
Anyway, so it was a bad day.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.960
I'm not getting paid.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.960
I don't know if I'm getting paid.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.960
I don't really want to hassle her because she's in LA now.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.960
And I got really angry because it was just like,

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.960
it totally described what LA commercial shit is about.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.960
And Austin vibe.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.960
I'm sorry, Austin and LA didn't get along this time.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.960
I wanted it to get along with her.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.960
I was really nice the entire time.

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.960
We did everything they told us to do.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.960
That sounds really shitty, man.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.960
But let's grow from this opportunity.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.960
When you start a new job,

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.960
wait at least two weeks before you get stoned before you show up.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.960
It wasn't my fault.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.960
Well, I guess, I know.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.960
And I smoke pot it a lot.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.960
Well, I learned this from the hard way.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.960
I guess, well, I was interned for a link later this summer.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.960
And he has a bong in his office.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.960
Even if he does, the first few days, don't let it on.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.960
We're Austin people.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.960
I'm just trying to help you succeed.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960
I guess.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960
We never did anything wrong.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.960
That's the key thing.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.960
One of my best friends, she's going to law school.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960
And she smokes every day.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.960
And she has to because she has a stomach issue.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960
There's nothing wrong with smoking.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.960
It relaxes you.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.960
It gives impressions to people.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.960
And it sounds like the impression the person got from you is not favorable.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:01.960
And that's probably the problem.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.960
But you knew her though.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.960
If you knew her.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960
But that doesn't matter.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.960
She was mean from the start.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.960
She never said, oh, here's my egg.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.960
Yeah, people are awful.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.960
But we got to work around that.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.960
We can't just make them better people.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960
That was my lesson.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.960
Despite being mean or not, no matter what, you just have to...

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960
I think it's the look of judgment.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.960
When you meet someone, you're a mean person.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.960
You can't give that person that look.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960
That's what I learned.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.960
No matter what, even if you are mean, I have to pretend you're not.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.960
That's what I learned.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.960
You seem like you're probably kind of young.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:41.960
Your first jobs are generally very shitty for old people who probably have very personality disorders

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.960
who are going to abuse your youthful vigor.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.960
They're going to fuck around with you and be flawed.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.960
And I don't approve of kissing people's asses at all.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.960
I don't think when you're young, you should go,

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.960
oh, you don't have to be hyper focused on it and be like,

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.960
I'm miserable, but I'm going to keep doing this thing because there's going to be a reward for it.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960
There's a balance in there somewhere.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960
You're trying to balance it with respect the whole time.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.960
I was never being disrespectful.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.960
I was just enjoying my day doing mundane tasks.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.960
Everything we did, we were late for a little bit,

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.960
but even when we were late, nobody was...

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.960
We were late the second time.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960
Being late is a big deal.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.960
I know, but no one was doing anything for two hours and then she gave us a task.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.960
That was the only flaw and I felt really bad.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.960
But at that level of a production like that is the thing.

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.960
It's a huge deal.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960
And it's not entirely fair.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:30.960
We're not very fair to laymen.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.960
No, it's not fair, but it's the institution.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960
But it's like...

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.960
Some of my mom and my dad would say,

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.960
and I understand totally, you guys are right.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.960
I learned my lesson.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960
All right.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.960
Well, you said it was a medium bad day.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.960
She didn't come up and say,

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.960
I deserve a standing ovation for my problems.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.960
She was honest.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.960
Well, I hope you get paid.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960
That's some bullshit.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.960
I don't think I'm going to get paid.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960
Okay.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.960
If I don't get paid,

01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.960
I learn a really good lesson.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.960
Well, then why can't you reveal who it is?

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.960
Did you sign an NDA?

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.960
Because I didn't respect...

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.960
Yeah, she doesn't want to be unprofessional.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.960
Oh man.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960
As I said it,

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.960
I heard it and I was like,

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.960
I would be one to talk.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.960
I mean, believe me.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.960
I never know what I'm doing either.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.960
All right.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960
Well, thank you for...

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.960
Vanessa was it?

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960
Yeah.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.960
We're playing Dungeons & Dragons.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.960
I never played,

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.960
so I really wanted to do it.

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.960
I didn't know how to play.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.960
Yeah, it involves talking.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.960
Okay.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960
But you agreed.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960
I can do that.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.960
Yeah.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960
Can you help me though?

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.960
Because I really don't know how to play.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960
No, no, no.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.960
We'll be able to help you out.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.960
LaVar has never played either.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.960
So what we're going to do

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.960
is hand you these character sheets.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.960
It's got a lot of strange arcane writing on it

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.960
that won't make any sense to you.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.960
Okay.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.960
The character you're playing is...

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960
Is she Chris de Burgh?

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.960
Yeah, just do it in the order.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960
Okay.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960
Oh, just do it.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.960
Yeah, you already...

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.960
I tried to at least.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960
All right, Spencer.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:12.960
I'm just trying.

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.960
Now the tough thing is that we played in San Francisco,

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960
so the story did move forward like five feet.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.960
Luckily, our format allows for me to recap the events

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960
of the last episode

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.960
previous to this one.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.960
So you're Chris de Burgh.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.960
It's just got some stuff.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.960
That's how strong you are.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960
You don't really have to know.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960
Okay.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.960
Am I supposed to know these numbers?

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.960
You're not supposed to know anything.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.960
If you read some stuff off at occasion,

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.960
it'll look great.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.960
There you are, sir.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960
On the second page,

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.960
you can see all the stuff that you have in your backpack,

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960
and the object is mostly to use those things

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.960
to make other things.

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:53.960
Okay.

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.960
Well, not even to make other things.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.960
Also, you can negotiate with any character.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.960
Okay.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.960
I'm just kidding.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.960
How do I figure out what kind of character I am?

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960
You're Chris de Burgh, the human rogue.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.960
Yeah, so you're supposed to know what I have?

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.960
It's okay for me to know what you have.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.960
What is that?

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960
That says...

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960
No cheating, Dan.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.960
You're holding a robot, baby.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.960
All I ever do is I just hold the papers,

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.960
and I just kind of like stare at the stage,

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.960
and I...

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.960
What?

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960
What happened?

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:28.960
Oh, someone spilled her.

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.960
Oh, okay.

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960
Do you need more vodka?

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960
Do you need a new cup?

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960
Sorry.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.960
I think it's the combination of

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960
Lovar Burton being on stage,

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960
and your rainbow dress,

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960
and the cadence of your voice,

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.960
which makes me feel like I'm tripping on mushrooms.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.960
Oh, no!

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.960
I think it's the dress.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960
And the papers,

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960
and the things,

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960
and the...

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.960
I don't know if it's my dream,

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960
or my nightmare,

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.960
that when I die...

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.960
Is it Vanessa?

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.960
Yeah.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960
That will be the character

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
that greets me in the afterlife.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.960
And explains your life to you.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960
Okay, here's the thing.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960
You died, but you didn't do this thing right.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.960
You were a little bit of a cut to maniac

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960
for some of your life,

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960
but you didn't do the thing.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960
I know what you think,

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960
but you don't want to do the thing.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.960
But I guess you masturbated a lot,

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960
but it's self-blushing,

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960
but it's not that big of a deal.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960
It's like you weren't hurting people,

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.960
but you were hurting people,

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.960
but it's kind of like you're hurting yourself

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.960
by hurting other people,

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960
and you don't really care that much.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960
So anyway,

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960
I would just be the whole time,

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960
I'm like,

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960
am I a bad person,

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.960
or a good person?

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960
You're a good person.

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960
Am I in heaven or hell?

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960
What is happening?

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960
You're a good person.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.960
No, it's just another thing.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:30.960
I tend to do that, though.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960
It's just walking through rooms

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.960
with cages of spiders,

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.960
and she's like,

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:34.960
there's cages of spiders here,

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.960
but don't let them bother you.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.960
There are spiders in cages.

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.960
I don't know why I put them in cages,

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.960
because the cages are as small as spiders.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.960
They could get out if they wanted to,

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960
but they stay in there anyway.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.960
I don't get it.

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.960
But you might be God.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.960
I'm not a God.

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.960
I'd say I could be a witch, though.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960
That's what God would say.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.960
But a good witch.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:56.960
A good witch.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960
That's exactly what God would say.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.960
No, a good witch.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960
My birth is in Halloween,

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960
so I'd say a good witch,

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.960
but I could be a witch.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.960
I wouldn't enter anyone's dreams

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.960
with bad spiders.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.960
They'd be like rainbow spiders.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.960
Rainbow spiders don't sound much better.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.960
They sound terrifying.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.960
The colorful creatures are the most poisonous.

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.960
The frogs that have the bright colors.

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.960
I'm not poisonous, though.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.960
I think you said that sincerely.

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960
I'm not a witch.

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.960
I said a good witch.

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.960
No non-poisonous human has ever had to say,

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.960
I'm not poisonous.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.960
I swear to God.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.960
All right, so to get this started,

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960
are we going to improvise a track?

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.960
I would love that.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960
No, well, Dustin's got it.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:48.960
Unless Dustin has got it.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.960
Aaron, I would love that.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:50.960
All right, let's do it.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.960
So, LaVarra, if you want to join in,

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.960
you can listen.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.960
You can listen to the words I'm saying.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.960
I spent time writing.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960
Let's just wait for Dustin to pull up.

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.960
I don't mean to be a negative Nellie,

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.960
but for the last four weeks,

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.960
I've been doing that Skyrim thing.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.960
It's the same song.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.960
I can never hear what Spencer's saying.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:13.960
All right.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.960
I'm sorry.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:16.960
You don't have to.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.960
You're doing so good.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.960
Am I?

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:20.960
It's fine.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.960
You know what?

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.960
I think that somebody in our front row

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.960
would love to improvise an instrumental.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.960
Someone just went, huh?

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.960
Can you do a non-distracting moody?

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.960
You're so excited.

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:34.960
He can.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:35.960
He can do this.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.960
Great.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.960
Am I showing LaVarra Burton my butt right now?

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.960
It's...

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.960
I like to...

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.960
So, what's your name?

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.960
I'm Kenny.

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.960
It's Kenny, everybody.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:52.960
Let's give him a hand.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.960
So, it's just kind of low pitch.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.960
Kind of an ambient...

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.960
What we've been doing is kind of like a...

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.960
Yeah, I like that.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.960
I'm going to start, then.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:33.960
Keep that up, okay?

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960
Okay.

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.960
Was Lil' Baskins...

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960
Could a child truly lead the party?

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.960
And what dangers would they find?

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.960
Find out next, on an all new apartment.

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.960
Alright.

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.960
Kenny, everybody!

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.960
Keep it going for Kenny.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.960
So good.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.960
I don't know how much of the enjoyment his

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.960
deadpan's stare is, like, what he's doing.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.960
스테이크가 좋더라구요.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.960
그게 좋은 파슬라인이야.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.960
그는 그냥

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.960
그는 그는 그는

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.960
그는 그는 그는

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.960
그는 그는 그는

그는 그는 그는

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.960
그는 그는 그는

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.960
그는 그는 그는

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.960
그는 그는

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.960
그는 그는

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.960
그는 그는

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.960
그는 그는

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.960

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.960
그는 그는 그는

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.120
그는 그는 그는 Sage

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.960
그는 그는 그는 그는 그에

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.400

그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는

그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는 그는GUY

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.500
What's up?

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.500
We're following little boy.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:32.500
We're following the little boy.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.500
Yes, yes.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.500
You're on the main road out of Brosebook, which winds its way meandering through the rolling

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.500
grassy hills of the landscape, gently to the northeast.

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.500
Young Bascans.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.500
Have you encountered any curious characters recently?

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.500
Little Bascans swings a stick as if it were a sword and it's like,

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.500
Whoa!

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.500
No!

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500
What do you mean by that?

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.500
You're following the little boys.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.500
We're following the little boys.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:55.500
We're following the little boys.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:56.500
We're following the little boys.

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.500
We're following the little boys.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.500
I'll tell you.

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.500
아니, 무슨 말이야?

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.500
이거 좀 가고 있어

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.500
아니, 아니야, 안 해봐

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.500
where will give it back to you if you promise to not wave it in my direction

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.500
Give me 10 gold pieces or I'm out

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500
What?

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.500
Little baskins
