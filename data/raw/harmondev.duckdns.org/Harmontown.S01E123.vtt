You got the podium. That's your Comptroller podium.\n\n01:44.760 --> 01:54.760\nYou're in a position of high stature. Your job is to keep me from going off on too many tangents.\n\n01:54.760 --> 01:57.760\nOr you can just sit and listen. That's fine too.\n\n01:57.760 --> 02:05.760\nIn any case, it's a huge honor to have you here at Guest Comptroller, LeVar Burton.\n\n02:05.760 --> 02:17.760\nI'm a child of the 70s, so my mom learned about race from Alex Haley.\n\n02:17.760 --> 02:29.760\nMy consciousness of race began when my mom, I was playing with Sesame Street figures that I was playing.\n\n02:29.760 --> 02:41.760\nI've told the story quite a bit because it summarizes 41-year-old white guilt-driven liberal in the modern era.\n\n02:41.760 --> 02:49.760\nThis is my origin story. I was playing with a Gordon figure from Sesame Street and a Mr. Whipple figure,\n\n02:49.760 --> 02:56.760\nand my mom was watching me play with them, and then she said,\n\n02:56.760 --> 02:59.760\nDo you know the difference between those two?\n\n02:59.760 --> 03:07.760\nAnd I said, I don't know the difference. And she said, good.\n\n03:07.760 --> 03:13.760\nAnd then she'd only stopped there. And then I kept playing.\n\n03:13.760 --> 03:17.760\nAnd then she went, because the difference is one of them is black and one of them is white.\n\n03:17.760 --> 03:21.760\nAnd there's going to be people that try to tell you that there's a difference, and that's important,\n\n03:21.760 --> 03:23.760\nand you need to ignore them, and blah, blah, blah.\n\n03:23.760 --> 03:27.760\nAnd then my mom would watch mini-series about the Holocaust, and then she'd wake me up,\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:31.760\nand she'd sit on the foot of the bed, and she'd say, Wake up! Wake up! What's going on?\n\n03:31.760 --> 03:36.760\nDaniel, one day people are going to tell you something called the Holocaust never happened.\n\n03:36.760 --> 03:40.760\nIt happened. It happened. And then she'd go to bed.\n\n03:40.760 --> 03:44.760\nI was a child of the 70s.\n\n03:44.760 --> 03:50.760\nLovar Burton, before he was raising all of you via Reading Rainbow,\n\n03:50.760 --> 03:56.760\nhe was his first dramatic role,\n\n03:56.760 --> 04:00.760\nliterally your first thing that you ever auditioned for.\n\n04:00.760 --> 04:04.760\nYou started being an actor, you went on your first audition,\n\n04:04.760 --> 04:10.760\nand you got the role of a character named Kunta Kinte in an adaptation of Alex Haley's Roots,\n\n04:10.760 --> 04:18.760\nand you got the part, and were at the forefront of a transition that was happening in the 70s,\n\n04:18.760 --> 04:25.760\nof which Norman Lear was a part, in which I was caught in the maelstrom of where my brain was warped by.\n\n04:25.760 --> 04:31.760\nAnd now we live in this 21st century where, I don't know, I don't even know how to talk to the kids anymore.\n\n04:31.760 --> 04:35.760\nNow I'm racist because I actually am fascinated with this stuff.\n\n04:35.760 --> 04:43.760\nThat makes me racist, but you were making my mom think it was okay for all of us to occupy the world together,\n\n04:43.760 --> 04:46.760\nand making it okay for her to warp my brain,\n\n04:46.760 --> 04:51.760\nand then also teaching everybody to read with this awesome show,\n\n04:51.760 --> 04:54.760\nit was mostly the theme song, let's not kid ourselves.\n\n04:54.760 --> 05:04.760\nThat's like that kind of flangey reverb. Who did that? Who composed that?\n\n05:04.760 --> 05:11.760\nThat is the work of Steve Horlick, the composer of the Reading Rainbow theme song,\n\n05:11.760 --> 05:20.760\nwe call it Butterfly in the Sky, and the vocals on the original version of the Reading Rainbow theme song\n\n05:20.760 --> 05:24.760\nwas done by the very talented Tina Fabrique.\n\n05:26.760 --> 05:30.760\nBut we all heard that song, and then we were all drawn to the TV,\n\n05:30.760 --> 05:34.760\nlike Fred Flintstone being drawn by the smell of Bronto burgers,\n\n05:34.760 --> 05:41.760\nlike kids who otherwise their brains would have just rotted for want of literacy.\n\n05:41.760 --> 05:43.760\nShall we sing the song down?\n\n05:45.760 --> 05:47.760\nYou know what we ought to do?\n\n05:47.760 --> 05:51.760\nYou don't have that. Can you cue that up, Dustin?\n\n05:51.760 --> 05:55.760\nCan you find the Reading Rainbow theme somehow and cue it up?\n\n05:55.760 --> 05:59.760\nThere's got to be a way to do like a kind of like, we do the song,\n\n05:59.760 --> 06:02.760\nand there's got to be like a way to do like a rap bridge or something.\n\n06:05.760 --> 06:07.760\nI'm trying to think of how the song goes.\n\n06:07.760 --> 06:11.760\nThere's got to be a way I can bastardize your work.\n\n06:11.760 --> 06:14.760\nIf it's possible, then you will figure it out.\n\n06:14.760 --> 06:16.760\nBut I mean, I don't know.\n\n06:16.760 --> 06:20.760\nYou were a founding father of my consciousness,\n\n06:20.760 --> 06:22.760\nand I was reading your Wikipedia.\n\n06:22.760 --> 06:24.760\nThose are the ways that I was familiar with you.\n\n06:24.760 --> 06:26.760\nBut then out today because it was like,\n\n06:26.760 --> 06:27.760\noh, he's coming to do the show.\n\n06:27.760 --> 06:28.760\nI better not embarrass myself.\n\n06:28.760 --> 06:31.760\nI should familiarize myself with Var Burton's career.\n\n06:31.760 --> 06:33.760\nSo I Wikipediaed you.\n\n06:33.760 --> 06:36.760\nAnd I'm sure meanwhile you were Googling me and going,\n\n06:36.760 --> 06:38.760\nwhat's wrong with Chevy Chase?\n\n06:38.760 --> 06:40.760\nWho is this?\n\n06:40.760 --> 06:43.760\nI don't understand. Where am I going?\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:47.760\nBy the way, LaVar is only here because he was signing his children's book,\n\n06:47.760 --> 06:49.760\nThe Rhino that Swallowed the Storm,\n\n06:49.760 --> 06:50.760\nwhich just came out.\n\n06:50.760 --> 06:51.760\nHe was here in Texas,\n\n06:51.760 --> 06:52.760\nand we were able to get him.\n\n06:52.760 --> 06:53.760\nAlso, he's honored to be here.\n\n06:53.760 --> 06:54.760\nI am.\n\n06:54.760 --> 06:55.760\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n06:55.760 --> 06:57.760\nThat's true.\n\n06:57.760 --> 07:00.760\nIf I may.\n\n07:00.760 --> 07:01.760\nIf I may.\n\n07:01.760 --> 07:02.760\nMr. Harmon,\n\n07:02.760 --> 07:04.760\nyou are responsible, sir,\n\n07:04.760 --> 07:09.760\nfor one of the most satisfying and fulfilling songs\n\n07:09.760 --> 07:13.760\nof my career.\n\n07:13.760 --> 07:15.760\nWe did it!\n\n07:15.760 --> 07:18.760\nIt's only because I let you use your eyes.\n\n07:18.760 --> 07:19.760\nThat's it.\n\n07:19.760 --> 07:21.760\nIt would have been Star Trek,\n\n07:21.760 --> 07:24.760\nbut they put a fucking visor on your face.\n\n07:24.760 --> 07:25.760\nYou showed up the first day.\n\n07:25.760 --> 07:27.760\nYou're like, oh my God,\n\n07:27.760 --> 07:29.760\nI'm the new Chekhov or Spock or Sulu.\n\n07:29.760 --> 07:30.760\nI don't know who I am.\n\n07:30.760 --> 07:31.760\nI'm the new something.\n\n07:31.760 --> 07:32.760\nAnd then they're like,\n\n07:32.760 --> 07:33.760\nokay.\n\n07:33.760 --> 07:34.760\nThey put a visor on your face.\n\n07:34.760 --> 07:35.760\nYou showed up the first day.\n\n07:35.760 --> 07:36.760\nYou're like, oh my God,\n\n07:36.760 --> 07:38.760\nI'm the new Chekhov or Spock or Sulu.\n\n07:38.760 --> 07:39.760\nYou're like, okay.\n\n07:39.760 --> 07:42.760\nThey put a banana clip on my eyes.\n\n07:42.760 --> 07:45.760\nAnd it was all over.\n\n07:45.760 --> 07:46.760\nWell, yeah.\n\n07:46.760 --> 07:48.760\nI'm smart that way.\n\n07:48.760 --> 07:49.760\nBut eventually he,\n\n07:49.760 --> 07:51.760\nyeah, I don't know.\n\n07:51.760 --> 07:52.760\nWhat was that?\n\n07:52.760 --> 07:53.760\nI mean,\n\n07:53.760 --> 07:54.760\nI remember seeing,\n\n07:54.760 --> 07:55.760\nI saw the Trekkies documentary\n\n07:55.760 --> 07:56.760\nwhen you have the sound bite,\n\n07:56.760 --> 07:57.760\nyou're like,\n\n07:57.760 --> 08:01.760\ngive the actor his eyes.\n\n08:01.760 --> 08:02.760\nDid I actually say that?\n\n08:02.760 --> 08:04.760\nDid I say it that way?\n\n08:04.760 --> 08:05.760\nWell, okay.\n\n08:05.760 --> 08:07.760\nMaybe that was an unflattering impression.\n\n08:07.760 --> 08:10.760\nThat's sort of my actor impression.\n\n08:10.760 --> 08:11.760\nBut I mean,\n\n08:11.760 --> 08:13.760\nI could see how that would be a tremendous bummer.\n\n08:13.760 --> 08:15.760\nDid you ever get adjusted to it?\n\n08:15.760 --> 08:17.760\nOr was there in the storyline\n\n08:17.760 --> 08:19.760\nthat when they lost the visor\n\n08:19.760 --> 08:20.760\nand replaced it with the context,\n\n08:20.760 --> 08:22.760\nwas that a result of you?\n\n08:22.760 --> 08:23.760\nOkay.\n\n08:23.760 --> 08:25.760\nHe's nodding.\n\n08:25.760 --> 08:26.760\nYes.\n\n08:26.760 --> 08:28.760\nThat was you constantly every day.\n\n08:28.760 --> 08:29.760\nYeah.\n\n08:29.760 --> 08:30.760\nJJ Abrams is like,\n\n08:30.760 --> 08:34.760\nwhy is my car keyed again?\n\n08:34.760 --> 08:35.760\nYeah.\n\n08:35.760 --> 08:38.760\nI was very insistent that,\n\n08:38.760 --> 08:39.760\nand Rick Berman,\n\n08:39.760 --> 08:41.760\nthe executive producer was,\n\n08:41.760 --> 08:42.760\nand he was right.\n\n08:42.760 --> 08:45.760\nThe visor was one of the ways that we telegraph\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:48.760\nthe technological sophistication of the 24th century.\n\n08:48.760 --> 08:49.760\nAnd I always figured,\n\n08:49.760 --> 08:51.760\nwell, if we're so damn sophisticated,\n\n08:51.760 --> 08:56.760\nwhy can't we just put it in a smaller kind of,\n\n08:56.760 --> 08:57.760\nyou know.\n\n08:57.760 --> 08:58.760\nYeah.\n\n08:58.760 --> 08:59.760\nYeah.\n\n08:59.760 --> 09:00.760\nSo.\n\n09:00.760 --> 09:01.760\nYeah.\n\n09:01.760 --> 09:03.760\nI remember in that documentary,\n\n09:03.760 --> 09:05.760\ntalking about the idea that it was like,\n\n09:05.760 --> 09:06.760\nit was supposed to be very symbolic.\n\n09:06.760 --> 09:09.760\nThere was a blind man that was at the helm of the ship.\n\n09:09.760 --> 09:10.760\nYes.\n\n09:10.760 --> 09:11.760\nBlind man flying the ship.\n\n09:11.760 --> 09:12.760\nYeah.\n\n09:22.760 --> 09:24.760\nOne thing I was really excited to talk to you about though,\n\n09:24.760 --> 09:26.760\nthat I knew nothing about your childhood,\n\n09:26.760 --> 09:30.760\nit said that when you were 13 years old,\n\n09:30.760 --> 09:32.760\nyou went to seminary school.\n\n09:32.760 --> 09:33.760\nYes.\n\n09:33.760 --> 09:34.760\nYou were raised Catholic.\n\n09:34.760 --> 09:35.760\nI was.\n\n09:35.760 --> 09:36.760\nFirst of all, born in Germany.\n\n09:36.760 --> 09:37.760\nWe should probably put a pin in that\n\n09:37.760 --> 09:40.760\nbecause that's distracting.\n\n09:40.760 --> 09:41.760\nYou were born in Germany.\n\n09:41.760 --> 09:44.760\nWe'll get back to that.\n\n09:44.760 --> 09:46.760\nBut raised Catholic,\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:47.760\nand when you were 13,\n\n09:47.760 --> 09:48.760\nyou went to seminary school.\n\n09:48.760 --> 09:50.760\nYou had every intention of being a priest.\n\n09:50.760 --> 09:51.760\nI did.\n\n09:51.760 --> 09:52.760\nYeah.\n\n09:52.760 --> 09:53.760\nAnd then in high school,\n\n09:53.760 --> 09:55.760\nit says in your Wikipedia,\n\n09:55.760 --> 09:56.760\nI don't think that,\n\n09:56.760 --> 09:58.760\nI don't assume this is accurate,\n\n09:58.760 --> 09:59.760\nbut I was like,\n\n09:59.760 --> 10:00.760\noh my God, I can't wait to,\n\n10:00.760 --> 10:02.760\nit says,\n\n10:02.760 --> 10:03.760\nI can't remember the exact quote,\n\n10:03.760 --> 10:04.760\nbut it says,\n\n10:04.760 --> 10:06.760\nstarting to have doubts\n\n10:06.760 --> 10:08.760\nin the Catholic faith\n\n10:08.760 --> 10:11.760\nafter being exposed to the works of Lao Tzu.\n\n10:11.760 --> 10:13.760\nIs that true?\n\n10:13.760 --> 10:14.760\nTaoism was a thing for you?\n\n10:14.760 --> 10:17.760\nKirkgaard, Lao Tzu,\n\n10:17.760 --> 10:18.760\nthe Dao De Jing.\n\n10:18.760 --> 10:19.760\nNietzsche.\n\n10:19.760 --> 10:20.760\nI call him Nietzsche.\n\n10:20.760 --> 10:21.760\nI call him Nietzsche.\n\n10:21.760 --> 10:22.760\nYeah.\n\n10:23.760 --> 10:25.760\nThe Nietzsche-ster.\n\n10:26.760 --> 10:27.760\nLao Tzu, I mean,\n\n10:27.760 --> 10:29.760\nThe Dao De Jing was a huge thing for me.\n\n10:29.760 --> 10:30.760\nYeah.\n\n10:30.760 --> 10:31.760\nIn high school.\n\n10:31.760 --> 10:32.760\nYeah.\n\n10:32.760 --> 10:33.760\nI was searching and searching,\n\n10:33.760 --> 10:34.760\nand I found the Dao De Jing.\n\n10:34.760 --> 10:35.760\nRight.\n\n10:35.760 --> 10:37.760\nAnd it was like a tremendous,\n\n10:37.760 --> 10:39.760\nthat and Kurt Vonnegut,\n\n10:39.760 --> 10:41.760\nthose were like these huge things for me.\n\n10:41.760 --> 10:42.760\nRight.\n\n10:42.760 --> 10:44.760\nAnd it's so interesting,\n\n10:44.760 --> 10:45.760\nwhen you're a kid,\n\n10:45.760 --> 10:46.760\nwhen you're in your adolescent years,\n\n10:46.760 --> 10:48.760\nanything could happen to you.\n\n10:48.760 --> 10:51.760\nAnd then there's these libraries that are filled with these.\n\n10:51.760 --> 10:52.760\nIt was books.\n\n10:52.760 --> 10:53.760\nYeah.\n\n10:53.760 --> 10:54.760\nIt was literature.\n\n10:54.760 --> 10:55.760\nAnd it's not always the books\n\n10:55.760 --> 10:56.760\nthat your teachers are assigning you to read.\n\n10:56.760 --> 10:57.760\nSome of those are great.\n\n10:57.760 --> 10:58.760\nRight.\n\n10:58.760 --> 10:59.760\nA lot of those are great.\n\n10:59.760 --> 11:00.760\nSome of them are banned.\n\n11:00.760 --> 11:04.760\nBut also in those same libraries,\n\n11:04.760 --> 11:05.760\nthere's these other books\n\n11:05.760 --> 11:08.760\nby these profane, horrible,\n\n11:08.760 --> 11:10.760\nprofane and profound dissidents\n\n11:10.760 --> 11:14.760\nor ancient non-Christian mystics.\n\n11:14.760 --> 11:15.760\nRight.\n\n11:15.760 --> 11:18.760\nKurt Vonnegut like slammed my brain\n\n11:18.760 --> 11:19.760\nagainst the wall,\n\n11:19.760 --> 11:21.760\nsmeared it like jelly all over the place.\n\n11:21.760 --> 11:22.760\nHe has the power.\n\n11:22.760 --> 11:23.760\nYeah.\n\n11:23.760 --> 11:26.760\nIt was him and David Mamet,\n\n11:26.760 --> 11:28.760\nencountering his plays.\n\n11:28.760 --> 11:29.760\nI was like,\n\n11:29.760 --> 11:31.760\nAre you allowed to write like this?\n\n11:31.760 --> 11:32.760\nAnd one of my drama teachers,\n\n11:32.760 --> 11:34.760\nMrs. Lund at Brown Dear High School,\n\n11:34.760 --> 11:35.760\nshe's like,\n\n11:35.760 --> 11:36.760\nyeah, I think that's a thing that you can do.\n\n11:36.760 --> 11:37.760\nIf you go,\n\n11:37.760 --> 11:38.760\nwoo, I got a woo for Mrs. Lund.\n\n11:38.760 --> 11:39.760\nRight.\n\n11:41.760 --> 11:42.760\nI'm kind of babbling.\n\n11:42.760 --> 11:44.760\nI feel like this has happened to you a lot.\n\n11:44.760 --> 11:45.760\nI think a lot of people\n\n11:45.760 --> 11:46.760\nprobably encounter you\n\n11:46.760 --> 11:47.760\nand are like,\n\n11:47.760 --> 11:48.760\nthere's a strange sort of like,\n\n11:48.760 --> 11:50.760\nMr. Rogers meets Sting.\n\n11:50.760 --> 11:53.760\nPeople want to fuck you and please you.\n\n11:53.760 --> 11:55.760\nBut also don't want to offend you\n\n11:55.760 --> 11:57.760\nand kind of like bowing a little bit.\n\n11:57.760 --> 11:58.760\nWell, they're like,\n\n11:58.760 --> 12:00.760\nI feel that energy happening.\n\n12:00.760 --> 12:01.760\nI'm like,\n\n12:01.760 --> 12:03.760\nI don't want Lovar Burton to leave mad.\n\n12:05.760 --> 12:06.760\nBut yeah,\n\n12:06.760 --> 12:07.760\nI just wanted to know\n\n12:07.760 --> 12:09.760\nthat I really liked Vonnegut in high school.\n\n12:12.760 --> 12:13.760\nBut the Dao Deng Jing,\n\n12:13.760 --> 12:14.760\ntalking about the

12:22.760\nAnd it was my drama coach,\n\n12:22.760 --> 12:23.760\nLee Bartlett,\n\n12:23.760 --> 12:25.760\nwho was neither a priest or a brother.\n\n12:25.760 --> 12:26.760\nHe was a layman.\n\n12:26.760 --> 12:27.760\nAnd\n\n12:27.760 --> 12:29.760\nIt was the Catholic Seminary after all.\n\n12:33.760 --> 12:34.760\nBut um, um,\n\n12:36.760 --> 12:37.760\nit was,\n\n12:37.760 --> 12:38.760\nit was Lee who was the drama teacher\n\n12:38.760 --> 12:40.760\nand he was the philosophy teacher.\n\n12:40.760 --> 12:41.760\nHe taught all my favorite subjects.\n\n12:41.760 --> 12:42.760\nHe taught me,\n\n12:42.760 --> 12:43.760\nhe taught English,\n\n12:43.760 --> 12:44.760\nEnglish,\n\n12:44.760 --> 12:45.760\nEnglish,\n\n12:45.760 --> 12:46.760\nEnglish,\n\n12:46.760 --> 12:47.760\nHe taught me,\n\n12:47.760 --> 12:48.760\nHe taught English.\n\n12:48.760 --> 12:50.760\nAnd he had the book list\n\n12:50.760 --> 12:52.760\nthat really changed\n\n12:52.760 --> 12:54.760\nmy course and direction in life.\n\n12:55.760 --> 12:56.760\nHow many people in this room,\n\n12:56.760 --> 12:58.760\nsave your applause until I finish the question.\n\n12:58.760 --> 13:00.760\nThere's probably 200 people in this room.\n\n13:00.760 --> 13:02.760\nHow many people feel\n\n13:02.760 --> 13:04.760\nthat them being in this room\n\n13:04.760 --> 13:06.760\nand being who

you threw a pebble into the pond, you're going to get ripples\n\n17:08.140 --> 17:11.480\nI think the only constant is change, and it's always slow\n\n17:11.480 --> 17:13.980\nanything that happens overnight is lacking foundation\n\n17:13.980 --> 17:16.480\nroots is part of a changing trend\n\n17:16.480 --> 17:18.180\nand it's still being played out\n\n17:18.800 --> 17:20.960\nso that was uh\n\n17:20.960 --> 17:47.960\n슬로우 and steady wins the race, kind of like, okay, I don't know how to phrase the question, what I want to ask you is, are young people as annoying to you as they are to me, or do they seem to have somehow lost something, like was there, in the 70s weren't we closer to something, have we taken backwards steps?\n\n17:47.960 --> 18:06.960\nI do believe the change is sometimes two steps forward, a step backward, it's hard to see the force for the trees, but in my own defense, the paragraph after that, I mean the very next words go on to talk about, after that very pithy quote, talks about my work in Fantasy Island.\n\n18:06.960 --> 18:09.960\nIt's very true, yeah.\n\n18:09.960 --> 18:13.960\nAnd Battle of the Network stars, so there's that, Dan.\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:19.960\nWell, it's not your job to be a symbol, you never, you weren't born and your parents didn't say, can he please be a symbol?\n\n18:19.960 --> 18:20.960\nRight.\n\n18:20.960 --> 18:37.960\nBut you, I mean, but you are a symbol, you, like most of what you do is symbolic, like your role in Reading Rainbow is symbolic, you're, by the way, I'm all over the place, but we should say congratulations to him.\n\n18:37.960 --> 18:53.960\nReading Rainbow, which won like 26 Emmys throughout its 8 billion year career, he's the executive producer of it, then it finally, I don't even want to say the word died, but it passed its natural mortal phase.\n\n18:53.960 --> 18:55.960\nNo child left behind.\n\n18:55.960 --> 18:59.960\nNo, no seriously, no child left behind was responsible for Reading Rainbow being taken off the air.\n\n18:59.960 --> 19:00.960\nHow is that?\n\n19:00.960 --> 19:08.960\nBecause the federal government made a choice between teaching children how to read and fostering in them a love of a written word.\n\n19:08.960 --> 19:12.960\nMy brain just exploded.\n\n19:12.960 --> 19:15.960\nYou're the community of child literacy.\n\n19:15.960 --> 19:18.960\nRight?\n\n19:18.960 --> 19:21.960\nI was canceled because the Nielsen system doesn't measure real audiences anymore.\n\n19:21.960 --> 19:23.960\nExactly right, sir.\n\n19:23.960 --> 19:33.960\nAnd so like me, kind of, you have taken your shit online, like you did a Kickstarter, their goal was a couple million.\n\n19:33.960 --> 19:46.960\nAnd in three days, they made like 5 million, because everybody in America from $50 donors to $1 million donors like Seth Macfarlane, which kind of mitigates my feelings about him.\n\n19:46.960 --> 19:47.960\nGood job.\n\n19:47.960 --> 19:48.960\nRight?\n\n19:48.960 --> 19:49.960\nI have to be jealous of him.\n\n19:49.960 --> 19:50.960\nI have to be.\n\n19:50.960 --> 19:51.960\nYou don't have to be?\n\n19:51.960 --> 19:52.960\nYes, I do.\n\n19:52.960 --> 19:57.960\nHe's very successful and sings well.\n\n19:57.960 --> 20:03.960\nAnd my narcissism makes me think I'm in competition for that corner.\n\n20:03.960 --> 20:05.960\nIt doesn't even make any sense.\n\n20:05.960 --> 20:08.960\nWhy wouldn't I eat less cookies?\n\n20:08.960 --> 20:12.960\nWhy do I get up in the morning and go, I got to beat Seth Macfarlane?\n\n20:12.960 --> 20:14.960\nMotherfucker jog.\n\n20:14.960 --> 20:23.960\nThese are the kinds of things I want to confess to LeVar Burton, the father to a generation.\n\n20:23.960 --> 20:29.960\nAnyways, it's there, they have, you have obviously successfully resurrected, reading Rainbow in a...\n\n20:29.960 --> 20:30.960\nThanks to you all.\n\n20:30.960 --> 20:33.960\nThanks to you, we have.\n\n20:33.960 --> 20:35.960\nThank you.\n\n20:35.960 --> 20:37.960\nAlright, let's talk about Austin, huh?\n\n20:37.960 --> 20:38.960\nYeah.\n\n20:38.960 --> 20:39.960\nCity.\n\n20:39.960 --> 20:41.960\nThere's a governor's race here.\n\n20:41.960 --> 20:42.960\nIs it?\n\n20:42.960 --> 20:43.960\nYeah.\n\n20:43.960 --> 20:53.960\nFrom my five minutes of putting on new underwear in the hotel room, letting the governor's ads play, I noticed there's like...\n\n20:53.960 --> 20:56.960\nI think it might be a conservative state.\n\n20:56.960 --> 21:07.960\nIt feels like Austin may be a little bit of an oasis in the middle of a red sea, a red desert.\n\n21:07.960 --> 21:17.960\nBut you guys have a governor candidate, I was talking with your peeps here in the green room.\n\n21:17.960 --> 21:22.960\nSo there's this kind of funny, maybe it's not funny to them, it's funny to an outsider.\n\n21:22.960 --> 21:31.960\nThere's a liberal candidate, Wendy Davis, and there's the conservative candidate, Greg Abbott.\n\n21:31.960 --> 21:36.960\nHere's the twist.\n\n21:36.960 --> 21:44.960\nIt's 2014, so the conservative candidate is in a wheelchair.\n\n21:44.960 --> 21:49.960\nGreg Abbott, conservative as he is, wheelchair bound.\n\n21:49.960 --> 21:52.960\nHow do you get more liberal than that?\n\n21:52.960 --> 21:55.960\nThe man is in a wheelchair.\n\n21:55.960 --> 22:00.960\nIt stinks of leftism.\n\n22:00.960 --> 22:05.960\nHe's the embodiment of altruism.\n\n22:05.960 --> 22:10.960\nHe's in a wheelchair.\n\n22:10.960 --> 22:19.960\nSomeone shouted something out, but then more notably, someone next to him went shh.\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:23.960\nSo Wendy Davis, I got quickly prized.\n\n22:23.960 --> 22:25.960\nShe's kind of a hero in liberal politics.\n\n22:25.960 --> 22:30.960\nIf you buy into the bipartisan garbage, which I kind of am very jaded about.\n\n22:30.960 --> 22:35.960\nI kind of feel like everybody's just all the same thing, I don't care that much.\n\n22:35.960 --> 22:43.960\nBut if you choose to choose sides between the Democrats and the Republicans,\n\n22:43.960 --> 22:46.960\nobviously the Democrats are the good guys, that's a no brainer.\n\n22:46.960 --> 22:51.960\nAnd Wendy Davis, she did a big filibuster, they were trying to pass some horrible abortion stuff,\n\n22:51.960 --> 22:57.960\nand she stood her ground, and she is one of the good guys within that paradigm.\n\n22:57.960 --> 23:02.960\nNot with a Noam Chomsky paradigm, she's a tool of the marginalization\n\n23:02.960 --> 23:08.960\nof the proletariat by virtue of feeding you the bullshit binary,\n\n23:08.960 --> 23:12.960\nwhich has slowly withered our capacity for dissent.\n\n23:12.960 --> 23:18.960\nShe's part of the problem, but let's just say she's one of the good guys.\n\n23:18.960 --> 23:23.960\nBecause everybody knows that abortion and gay stuff and everything.\n\n23:23.960 --> 23:28.960\nVery important for the last 40, 50 years or so, have you noticed this is very crucial stuff\n\n23:28.960 --> 23:32.960\nin every fucking election, where you're just electing a bunch of rich people\n\n23:32.960 --> 23:34.960\nwhose job is to tell you what to do.\n\n23:34.960 --> 23:41.960\nWendy Davis ran an ad, it seemed kind of benign, where she was showing these shots.\n\n23:41.960 --> 23:47.960\nThis is the funny world we live in now, it's 2014, so there's this Wendy Davis governor ad\n\n23:47.960 --> 23:50.960\nwhere they're showing these shots of a wheelchair.\n\n23:50.960 --> 23:58.960\nAnd actually the point that her ads are making are that this guy that's in this wheelchair,\n\n23:58.960 --> 24:01.960\nthe reason he's in a wheelchair is because he had this accident,\n\n24:01.960 --> 24:07.960\nand he actually famously is the beneficiary of a very litigious pursuit.\n\n24:07.960 --> 24:10.960\nHe got injured, he made a lot of money by suing,\n\n24:10.960 --> 24:13.960\nand now he's a foremost advocate for putting a cap on that stuff.\n\n24:13.960 --> 24:19.960\nThat was the point of her ad, he sides with hospitals in this kind of stuff.\n\n24:19.960 --> 24:23.960\nThe ad was just sort of trying to say, he's a hypocrite, but the visuals...\n\n24:23.960 --> 24:26.960\nIt's like Herman Cain running for president.\n\n24:26.960 --> 24:32.960\nYeah, the visuals kind of allowed the conservatives to go,\n\n24:32.960 --> 24:36.960\nyou're picking, why are you showing that wheelchair?\n\n24:36.960 --> 24:41.960\nYou're just saying he's crippled, and so it's just a very funny time in Texas, that's it.\n\n24:41.960 --> 24:46.960\nIt's just funny to me, I don't know, she's the bully,\n\n24:46.960 --> 24:53.960\nshe's a Democrat, she ran an ad, and it's got a wheelchair in it, and she tried.\n\n24:53.960 --> 24:59.960\nAnd I said, why is Texas, why is it a red state when you go to a city like Austin,\n\n24:59.960 --> 25:05.960\nand obviously we're totally biased, I'm sure all the people you met today were probably pretty blue.\n\n25:05.960 --> 25:08.960\nNot that you had any way of knowing, but I just have that weird feeling.\n\n25:08.960 --> 25:09.960\nYou get a sense of that folks.\n\n25:09.960 --> 25:14.960\nYou're in favor of children reading it, puts you on a decidedly left side of the...\n\n25:14.960 --> 25:17.960\nIt's already the...\n\n25:17.960 --> 25:20.960\nNo child left behind.\n\n25:20.960 --> 25:28.960\nSo the, I guess it's like you kind of tally up all the little tiny little Texas municipalities.\n\n25:28.960 --> 25:33.960\nIt's like big giant state, and you've got all these little tiny towns in it,\n\n25:33.960 --> 25:40.960\nand if you group them all together, and also adjust for all the gerrymandering in the districts and stuff,\n\n25:40.960 --> 25:46.960\nlike there's no way the state will ever be anything other than a big giant red thing on the map.\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:48.960\nBut there's Austin, there's that.\n\n25:48.960 --> 25:50.960\nThere's Austin.\n\n25:50.960 --> 25:52.960\nI feel like there should be a civic revolution.\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:54.960\nWe're having these elections are coming up now.\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:57.960\nThere's no way to vote for Obama.\n\n25:57.960 --> 25:59.960\nThere's people who are disillusioned with Obama.\n\n25:59.960 --> 26:01.960\nThere's people who are...\n\n26:01.960 --> 26:06.960\nBy and large actually, I feel like this is a theme that happens every four years.\n\n26:06.960 --> 26:11.960\nAt the very beginning of things, everyone exercises, expresses their jadedness.\n\n26:11.960 --> 26:14.960\nEveryone says, well, I'm not going to vote for change again.\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:16.960\nWe were promised change, and nothing changed.\n\n26:16.960 --> 26:19.960\nAnd I'm always like, yeah, go with that thought, go with that.\n\n26:19.960 --> 26:25.960\nBut then over the next year, what we're going to see is everybody gets sucked into this Coke versus Pepsi debate.\n\n26:25.960 --> 26:31.960\nAnd I don't know, LaVar.\n\n26:31.960 --> 26:34.960\nBut the thing is, Dan, you do know, you do know.\n\n26:34.960 --> 26:36.960\nI don't LaVar. I don't know.\n\n26:36.960 --> 26:42.960\nOh, is that mood lighting?\n\n26:42.960 --> 26:43.960\nWe should move on.\n\n26:43.960 --> 26:45.960\nI should talk about farts or poop or something.\n\n26:45.960 --> 26:46.960\nThat's what I'm really good at.\n\n26:46.960 --> 26:49.960\nI got to get out of this political sand trap.\n\n26:49.960 --> 26:50.960\nI just wanted to impress you.\n\n26:50.960 --> 27:01.960\nYou're very intimidating and gentle and smart and benevolent.\n\n27:01.960 --> 27:10.960\nWe were upstairs with Aaron, and we told LaVar that if he were to sign a copy of his children's book,\n\n27:10.960 --> 27:15.960\nthe rhino that swallowed the storm, we wouldn't open it until we had a child.\n\n27:15.960 --> 27:20.960\nAnd if he wanted to, he could name our child by signing the book.\n\n27:20.960 --> 27:24.960\nBut he let it spill already.\n\n27:24.960 --> 27:30.960\nYour first child would be named Kunta Harmon.\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:32.960\nWhich I'm fine with.\n\n27:32.960 --> 27:34.960\nIt's kind of an appropriate...\n\n27:34.960 --> 27:43.960\nMale or female, Kunta Harmon.\n\n27:43.960 --> 27:47.960\nOkay, so I'm trying to get out of there.\n\n27:47.960 --> 27:48.960\nI'm looking at my notepad.\n\n27:48.960 --> 27:52.960\nI want to get away from the political stuff because I'm just so bad at it.\n\n27:52.960 --> 27:54.960\nIt's not what makes me interesting.\n\n27:54.960 --> 27:59.960\nI can talk about a shit I took, and it's amazing.\n\n27:59.960 --> 28:07.960\nQueen Elizabeth tweeted.\n\n28:07.960 --> 28:08.960\nI just started on the news.\n\n28:08.960 --> 28:09.960\nQueen Elizabeth tweeted.\n\n28:09.960 --> 28:10.960\nApparently she did.\n\n28:10.960 --> 28:11.960\nShe did.\n\n28:11.960 --> 28:12.960\nThe Queen tweeted.\n\n28:12.960 --> 28:13.960\nBut a lot of...\n\n28:13.960 --> 28:16.960\nThe Queen tweeted.\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:18.960\nIt just sounds funny.\n\n28:18.960 --> 28:19.960\nThe Queen tweeted.\n\n28:19.960 --> 28:20.960\nThe Queen tweeted.\n\n28:20.960 --> 28:28.960\nBut 60% of the coverage of it is dealing with the fact that because they had a big iPad setup for her to tweet.\n\n28:28.960 --> 28:33.960\nSo she took off her royal glove and tweeted with her finger.\n\n28:33.960 --> 28:36.960\nBut immediately everyone was going,\n\n28:36.960 --> 28:41.960\nWell, your first tweet that you tweeted, it's not sent from an iPad.\n\n28:41.960 --> 28:43.960\nIt's sent from an iPhone.\n\n28:43.960 --> 28:46.960\nThey immediately were trolling her.\n\n28:46.960 --> 28:54.960\nShe's just got on Twitter and she's already having to deal with everything that we have to deal with on Twitter.\n\n28:54.960 --> 29:02.960\nI guess there was maybe a chance that they must have some aid in the corner with an iPhone going,\n\n29:02.960 --> 29:05.960\nOkay, did she press the prop iPad?\n\n29:05.960 --> 29:08.960\nOkay, now I'll send the tweet, the royal tweet.\n\n29:08.960 --> 29:10.960\nAnd the royal tweet is like,\n\n29:10.960 --> 29:13.960\nOh, I'm the queen. I'm tweeting.\n\n29:13.960 --> 29:15.960\nBut I guess that iPad...\n\n29:15.960 --> 29:17.960\nAnd I kind of think, why is that?\n\n29:17.960 --> 29:20.960\nWas there a chance that she might have typed into the iPad?\n\n29:20.960 --> 29:21.960\nThere was no chance.\n\n29:21.960 --> 29:28.960\nMan should not be governed. Run, run for the hills.\n\n29:28.960 --> 29:34.960\nYou have a right. You were born with all your rights.\n\n29:34.960 --> 29:38.960\nAll government is a lie.\n\n29:38.960 --> 29:40.960\nThey had to contain her.\n\n29:40.960 --> 29:44.960\nLike maybe she does that sometimes.\n\n29:44.960 --> 29:46.960\nThe queen tweeted.\n\n29:46.960 --> 29:49.960\nYou heard it here first.\n\n29:49.960 --> 29:53.960\nThey have toothbrushes in my hotel room here in Austin.\n\n29:53.960 --> 29:56.960\nIt already was the best city in the world.\n\n29:56.960 --> 29:58.960\nThe hotel room has toothbrushes and toothpaste in it.\n\n29:58.960 --> 30:00.960\nYou don't have to ask.\n\n30:00.960 --> 30:04.960\nGo moving on.\n\n30:04.960 --> 30:07.960\nIt's awesome though.\n\n30:07.960 --> 30:13.960\nUnited Airlines is terrible. It's a terrible airline.\n\n30:13.960 --> 30:15.960\nAnd now you're just pandering.\n\n30:15.960 --> 30:17.960\nYou must travel a lot.\n\n30:17.960 --> 30:18.960\nI do. I'm on the road all the time.\n\n30:18.960 --> 30:21.960\nDo you always travel first class? It's okay to say.\n\n30:21.960 --> 30:22.960\nNo.\n\n30:22.960 --> 30:24.960\nYou travel coach?\n\n30:24.960 --> 30:29.960\nTomorrow I'm on Sunday. I'm traveling jet blue.\n\n30:29.960 --> 30:33.960\nAnd that's like the gimmick of the whole airline's coach.\n\n30:33.960 --> 30:36.960\nI travel southwest all the time.\n\n30:36.960 --> 30:41.960\nThey're the ones that do the jokes and stuff.\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:44.960\nBut I do enjoy travel.\n\n30:44.960 --> 30:47.960\nBut you're okay with me always traveling first class.\n\n30:47.960 --> 30:49.960\nI'm okay with it.\n\n30:49.960 --> 30:51.960\nYeah.\n\n30:51.960 --> 30:53.960\nYou've earned it.\n\n30:53.960 --> 30:55.960\nIt doesn't make me elitist.\n\n30:55.960 --> 30:56.960\nYou've earned it.\n\n30:56.960 --> 30:59.960\nNow you're making me feel bad.\n\n30:59.960 --> 31:01.960\nYou teach children to read.\n\n31:01.960 --> 31:05.960\nYou should fly first class.\n\n31:05.960 --> 31:06.960\nWhy am I in first class?\n\n31:06.960 --> 31:08.960\nYou're Dan Harmon.\n\n31:08.960 --> 31:10.960\nAll right.\n\n31:10.960 --> 31:13.960\nThat means a lot in my book.\n\n31:13.960 --> 31:14.960\nThank you.\n\n31:14.960 --> 31:16.960\nNo, it does.\n\n31:16.960 --> 31:18.960\nWe can sing it acapella.\n\n31:18.960 --> 31:20.960\nWe can just sing it.\n\n31:20.960 --> 31:22.960\nCan't we?\n\n31:22.960 --> 31:24.960\nAustin.\n\n31:24.960 --> 31:25.960\nAll right.\n\n31:25.960 --> 31:26.960\nYeah.\n\n31:26.960 --> 31:28.960\nI don't know how this is going to work.\n\n31:28.960 --> 31:29.960\nBut let's just riff.\n\n31:29.960 --> 31:31.960\nLet's just go.\n\n31:31.960 --> 31:34.960\nWhat?\n\n31:34.960 --> 31:37.960\nIs this like a UK remix?\n\n31:37.960 --> 31:40.960\nThis is...\n\n31:40.960 --> 31:46.960\nSo, what that is.\n\n31:46.960 --> 31:48.960\nBackstory.\n\n31:48.960 --> 31:49.960\nYeah.\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:52.960\nSo, Febreeker, whatever her name is.\n\n31:52.960 --> 31:54.960\nThat is not Tina Febreeker.\n\n31:54.960 --> 31:57.960\nBut here's the thing.\n\n31:57.960 --> 32:03.960\nWe did a remake of the Reading Rainbow theme song in the 90s.\n\n32:03.960 --> 32:05.960\nIn the early 90s.\n\n32:05.960 --> 32:07.960\nNo, actually it was pretty cool.\n\n32:07.960 --> 32:10.960\nIn the early 90s.\n\n32:10.960 --> 32:12.960\nNo, actually it was the mid 90s.\n\n32:12.960 --> 32:15.960\nAnd I went to my friend Chaka Khan.\n\n32:15.960 --> 32:19.960\nAnd asked her to sing the Reading Rainbow theme song.\n\n32:19.960 --> 32:24.960\nNot only did she sing it, she wrote the arrangement and plays drums on the track.\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:28.960\nThis is Chaka Khan singing the Reading Rainbow theme song.\n\n32:28.960 --> 32:31.960\nAnd so you said, would you please do this?\n\n32:31.960 --> 32:32.960\nChaka Khan.\n\n32:32.960 --> 32:33.960\nI would be happy.\n\n32:33.960 --> 32:35.960\nChaka Khan.\n\n32:35.960 --> 32:37.960\nLet me rock you Chaka Khan.\n\n32:37.960 --> 32:39.960\nShe went away with it.\n\n32:39.960 --> 32:41.960\nAnd then she came back Wednesday.\n\n32:41.960 --> 32:43.960\nAnd sat down at Spargos for lunch with you.\n\n32:43.960 --> 32:45.960\nAnd she slid a tape across.\n\n32:45.960 --> 32:47.960\nYou put the Walkman in and you're listening to it.\n\n32:47.960 --> 32:51.960\nAnd you're like, oh shit.\n\n32:51.960 --> 32:53.960\nShe redid it.\n\n32:53.960 --> 33:01.960\nAnd then you're like, good job Shaka.\n\n33:01.960 --> 33:04.960\nChaka Khan, he's nodding.\n\n33:04.960 --> 33:10.960\nYou got it?\n\n33:10.960 --> 33:11.960\nIt's that hook.\n\n33:11.960 --> 33:13.960\nWe all know the hook, right?\n\n33:13.960 --> 33:16.960\nThe question is, how do I rap during it?\n\n33:16.960 --> 33:18.960\nBecause we're all going to want to sing it.\n\n33:18.960 --> 33:19.960\nRight.\n\n33:19.960 --> 33:21.960\nMaybe it's like, I don't know.\n\n33:21.960 --> 33:42.960\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n33:42.960 --> 33:44.960\nAnything, anywhere.\n\n33:44.960 --> 33:52.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, butterfly, caterpillar.\n\n33:52.960 --> 33:54.960\nOh shit, she's still singing.\n\n33:54.960 --> 34:08.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n34:08.960 --> 34:10.960\nSee, the thing is, then the song ends.\n\n34:10.960 --> 34:11.960\nRight.\n\n34:11.960 --> 34:13.960\nThere's no way to turn it into a rap.\n\n34:13.960 --> 34:16.960\nOkay, here's what we're going to do.\n\n34:16.960 --> 34:19.960\nNo, no, not Chaka Khan's version.\n\n34:19.960 --> 34:24.960\nNot her bastardization.\n\n34:24.960 --> 34:26.960\nShaka, you're a musical legend.\n\n34:26.960 --> 34:29.960\nYou went too far.\n\n34:29.960 --> 34:31.960\nLaVar won't say it.\n\n34:31.960 --> 34:32.960\nI will.\n\n34:32.960 --> 34:42.960\nYou fucked up, Shaka.\n\n34:42.960 --> 34:49.960\nIs there anybody, I can't imagine there's anyone in Austin that knows how to confidently beatbox.\n\n34:49.960 --> 34:55.960\nI saw a hand go up there in the middle and your girlfriend's pointing at you, or maybe just your female friend.\n\n34:55.960 --> 34:57.960\nI don't want to judge you.\n\n34:57.960 --> 34:58.960\nIt's Austin.\n\n34:58.960 --> 35:00.960\nYeah, come on, Jerry, you want to come up?\n\n35:00.960 --> 35:09.960\nDo you think, do you think that you could, do you think it's possible for you to, to the tempo of the reading rainbow?\n\n35:09.960 --> 35:11.960\nNo, come on, come on up, we want to meet you.\n\n35:11.960 --> 35:15.960\nEven if you don't, even if the answer is no, you're in a full Batman costume.\n\n35:15.960 --> 35:16.960\nCome on up.\n\n35:16.960 --> 35:17.960\nYeah.\n\n35:17.960 --> 35:19.960\nWhat's your name, young man?\n\n35:19.960 --> 35:20.960\nMars.\n\n35:20.960 --> 35:21.960\nMars.\n\n35:21.960 --> 35:24.960\nNothing about your disappoints.\n\n35:24.960 --> 35:27.960\nGrab a mic.\n\n35:27.960 --> 35:35.960\nMars is in a onesie, a Batman onesie, but the Batman logo says forum.\n\n35:35.960 --> 35:37.960\nIs that a, is there something you're plugging?\n\n35:37.960 --> 35:39.960\nNo, I found it in thrift store.\n\n35:39.960 --> 35:40.960\nOkay.\n\n35:40.960 --> 35:45.960\nSo there's some backstory to this that you don't even know about, but it fits you like a glove.\n\n35:45.960 --> 35:46.960\nI actually looked it up.\n\n35:46.960 --> 35:48.960\nI think it's a defunct snowboarding company.\n\n35:48.960 --> 35:49.960\nOh, okay.\n\n35:49.960 --> 35:51.960\nWell, it's, you're making it work.\n\n35:51.960 --> 35:53.960\nLike, I, what am I doing?\n\n35:53.960 --> 35:59.960\nI'm just like Kevin Smith and it's like, it's not making, it's not going to help me in any way.\n\n35:59.960 --> 36:01.960\nYou look good.\n\n36:01.960 --> 36:09.960\nDo you think that you could listen to the reading rainbow theme and somehow maintain the tempo so that when they finish singing the lyrics,\n\n36:09.960 --> 36:17.960\nthen you're still beatboxing to the tempo and then I can come in with my badass science.\n\n36:17.960 --> 36:18.960\nAnd then, okay.\n\n36:18.960 --> 36:20.960\nOn top of that, Lovar.\n\n36:20.960 --> 36:21.960\nYeah.\n\n36:21.960 --> 36:29.960\nAfter I'm like, I'm rapping and then I'll throw it to you for like a kind of Lovar Burton spoken word bridge.\n\n36:29.960 --> 36:30.960\nNice.\n\n36:30.960 --> 36:39.960\nAnd you can, you can talk about the importance of literacy or no child left behind, whatever you want to talk about.\n\n36:39.960 --> 36:46.960\nAnd then, and then, and then when you're done with that, I guess I'll try to like sew it up with another verse of rapping.\n\n36:46.960 --> 36:48.960\nAnd then we'll all just get out of here.\n\n36:48.960 --> 36:54.960\nNo, then we'll bring up our, our friends and we'll, we'll, we'll have all kinds of

listener of the podcast\n\n42:19.960 --> 42:21.960\nBut I tend to default to the fucking mamas\n\n42:21.960 --> 42:22.960\nIn my rapping\n\n42:22.960 --> 42:23.960\nYeah\n\n42:23.960 -->

42:39.960\nAre you Austin-eer?\n\n42:39.960 --> 42:40.960\nWhat do they call them?\n\n42:40.960 --> 42:41.960\nAustinite\n\n42:41.960 --> 42:42.960\nAustinite\n\n42:42.960 -->

42:50.960\nOkay\n\n42:50.960 --> 42:51.960\nHow old are you?\n\n42:51.960 --> 42:52.960\nYou seem young enough to ask\n\n42:52.960 --> 42:53.960\nI'm 26\n\n42:53.960 --> 42:54.960\nOkay\n\n42:54.960 --> 42:55.960\nGood\n\n42:55.960 --> 42:56.960\nWhat's your ambition?\n\n42:56.960 --> 42:58.960\nElectronics and music\n\n42:58.960 --> 43:03.960\nBut you've clearly made electronics and music redundant\n\n43:03.960 --> 43:04.960\nYeah\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:06.960\nAll you need is your mouth\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:07.960\nSure\n\n43:07.960 --> 43:09.960\nThat's a fallback for you\n\n43:09.960 --> 43:10.960\nYeah\n\n43:10.960 --> 43:11.960\nIt's a contingency plan\n\n43:11.960 --> 43:13.960\nIt's like a soldier being a doomsday prepper\n\n43:13.960 --> 43:14.960\nThey're like\n\n43:14.960 --> 43:15.960\nI love the government\n\n43:15.960 --> 43:17.960\nBut also one day it may fail\n\n43:17.960 --> 43:18.960\nIt's their hobby\n\n43:18.960 --> 43:19.960\nYeah\n\n43:19.960 --> 43:20.960\nLike what I've learned from Uncle Sam\n\n43:20.960 --> 43:23.960\nI've learned to ration and store ammunition\n\n43:23.960 --> 43:25.960\nSo that's your beatboxing\n\n43:25.960 --> 43:28.960\nIt's like one day there may be no electronics or music\n\n43:28.960 --> 43:29.960\nPerformance\n\n43:29.960 --> 43:30.960\nThere's that\n\n43:30.960 --> 43:32.960\nThe Dick Van Dyke, the one man band\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:35.960\nAnd the Mrs. Poppins\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:37.960\nMary Poppins\n\n43:37.960 --> 43:39.960\nMy childhood is hazy\n\n43:39.960 --> 43:40.960\nBut anyway\n\n43:40.960 --> 43:41.960\nHe's doing the one man band thing\n\n43:41.960 --> 43:42.960\nAnd it was very inspiring\n\n43:42.960 --> 43:43.960\nAre you\n\n43:43.960 --> 43:45.960\nSo\n\n43:45.960 --> 43:46.960\nBut so\n\n43:46.960 --> 43:48.960\nThe reason why your ambition is in electronics and music\n\n43:48.960 --> 43:50.960\nDo you want to like produce music?\n\n43:50.960 --> 43:52.960\nDo you want to like make musical equipment?\n\n43:52.960 --> 43:54.960\nDo you want to be around people that make music?\n\n43:54.960 --> 43:55.960\nWhat's the\n\n43:55.960 --> 43:56.960\nIs there anything\n\n43:56.960 --> 43:57.960\nYou don't have to know\n\n43:57.960 --> 44:00.960\nYou can be 20, whatever you are\n\n44:00.960 --> 44:01.960\nYeah, feeling through it\n\n44:01.960 --> 44:02.960\nYeah\n\n44:02.960 --> 44:03.960\nOkay, fuck it\n\n44:03.960 --> 44:04.960\nAll right\n\n44:04.960 --> 44:06.960\nThat's fine\n\n44:06.960 --> 44:08.960\nAll right\n\n44:08.960 --> 44:10.960\nDo you love your mother?\n\n44:10.960 --> 44:13.960\nYeah, she's great\n\n44:13.960 --> 44:16.960\nDo you think I'm required to love my mother?\n\n44:16.960 --> 44:17.960\nNo\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:19.960\nNo, I think mothers and parents are difficult\n\n44:19.960 --> 44:21.960\nShe's not coming to my wedding\n\n44:21.960 --> 44:23.960\nFaye is not coming to your wedding?\n\n44:23.960 --> 44:24.960\nNo\n\n44:24.960 --> 44:25.960\nWhat?\n\n44:25.960 --> 44:27.960\nI think because\n\n44:27.960 --> 44:30.960\nI think it's because my parents are tired of me\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:34.960\nMaking public hay out of them having hit me when I was a kid\n\n44:34.960 --> 44:36.960\nSo I feel like they're going\n\n44:36.960 --> 44:38.960\nWhy would we want to go to a wedding where Jack Black's going to be like\n\n44:38.960 --> 44:40.960\nIs that them?\n\n44:43.960 --> 44:45.960\nAnd I kind of don't blame them for that reason\n\n44:45.960 --> 44:47.960\nI want to put this back together, Dan\n\n44:47.960 --> 44:48.960\nAre you\n\n44:48.960 --> 44:50.960\nYou think you could call my mom and repair it?\n\n44:50.960 --> 44:52.960\nI would be happy to call Faye\n\n44:52.960 --> 45:00.960\nWhat time is it in Florida?\n\n45:00.960 --> 45:01.960\nEarly enough\n\n45:01.960 --> 45:02.960\nEarly enough\n\n45:02.960 --> 45:03.960\nNo\n\n45:03.960 --> 45:05.960\nIf it's past six, she's asleep\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:06.960\nYeah\n\n45:06.960 --> 45:07.960\nAll right\n\n45:07.960 --> 45:08.960\nWe'll work on it later\n\n45:08.960 --> 45:09.960\nOkay\n\n45:09.960 --> 45:11.960\nYeah, I think my mom would find a way to\n\n45:11.960 --> 45:13.960\nTurn this into a horrible and uncomfortable thing\n\n45:13.960 --> 45:16.960\nIt sounds like podcast dynamite calling my mom\n\n45:16.960 --> 45:17.960\nWith Mark Burton\n\n45:17.960 --> 45:19.960\nBut I think somehow\n\n45:19.960 --> 45:22.960\nIt could turn sour\n\n45:22.960 --> 45:24.960\nMore fish for junta\n\n45:27.960 --> 45:28.960\nAll right\n\n45:28.960 --> 45:30.960\nLet's thank Mars for coming up in beatbox\n\n45:33.960 --> 45:34.960\nOh, thank you sir\n\n45:34.960 --> 45:35.960\nThank you\n\n45:36.960 --> 45:38.960\nWhat a nice young man\n\n45:38.960 --> 45:42.960\nWhat a talented human beatbox\n\n45:42.960 --> 45:46.960\nI just need to point out that Mars has a back flap\n\n45:46.960 --> 45:48.960\nIn his Batman suit\n\n45:48.960 --> 45:49.960\nYeah\n\n45:51.960 --> 45:52.960\nWay to go Mars\n\n45:53.960 --> 45:54.960\nNice work\n\n45:54.960 --> 45:56.960\nIs it closed or open?\n\n45:56.960 --> 46:00.960\nIt was closed, but it has snaps for easy access\n\n46:03.960 --> 46:07.960\nLet's bring up Spencer Crittenton, the Dungeon Master\n\n46:07.960 --> 46:09.960\nWoo!\n\n46:16.960 --> 46:17.960\nOh wait, I have one of these\n\n46:17.960 --> 46:18.960\nWhat up?\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:20.960\nI'm going to sit down\n\n46:20.960 --> 46:22.960\nSo that I'm not like upstaging people\n\n46:22.960 --> 46:24.960\nYou know, just a few things\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:27.960\nYou know we met Mars before on the Harmon Tour\n\n46:27.960 --> 46:28.960\nHe looks familiar\n\n46:28.960 --> 46:29.960\nHe's even in the movie, right?\n\n46:29.960 --> 46:30.960\nYeah\n\n46:30.960 --> 46:32.960\nGreat guy, great guy Mars\n\n46:32.960 --> 46:35.960\nAlso, Lori is not a bus, it's a truck\n\n46:35.960 --> 46:38.960\nOh brother\n\n46:39.960 --> 46:41.960\nDo you see the look you got from Levar Burton?\n\n46:41.960 --> 46:42.960\nI don't know\n\n46:42.960 --> 46:43.960\nNo, I didn't\n\n46:43.960 --> 46:44.960\nNo, it was like this\n\n46:46.960 --> 46:48.960\nI'm sorry I speak English\n\n46:51.960 --> 46:52.960\nIt's the same language\n\n46:53.960 --> 46:54.960\nWhat's up you guys?\n\n46:55.960 --> 46:58.960\nWe're just giddy with the light\n\n46:58.960 --> 47:01.960\nI'm sure a lot of people in Austin are excited for you to be here\n\n47:01.960 --> 47:03.960\nI'm excited for me\n\n47:03.960 --> 47:05.960\nBy the way, podcast listeners might want to know\n\n47:05.960 --> 47:07.960\nThey gave Levar a standing ovation\n\n47:07.960 --> 47:09.960\nWhen he came up, I thought that was really nice\n\n47:09.960 --> 47:10.960\nOh yeah\n\n47:14.960 --> 47:17.960\nThere were some other facts about Levar Burton that kind of struck me\n\n47:19.960 --> 47:25.960\nDid you know that he did a little bit of unofficial work for the CIA?\n\n47:25.960 --> 47:26.960\nNo\n\n47:26.960 --> 47:27.960\nYeah, well he was doing\n\n47:27.960 --> 47:30.960\nBecause his work, I'm reading from Wikipedia\n\n47:30.960 --> 47:36.960\nBecause his work for reading Rainbow took him across several borders of hostile countries\n\n47:36.960 --> 47:42.960\nLevar Burton was approached by the OSS, the wartime precursor to the CIA\n\n47:42.960 --> 47:44.960\nOh wait, this is Houdini, I'm sorry\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:46.960\nYeah\n\n47:46.960 --> 47:49.960\nYou get confused all the time\n\n47:49.960 --> 47:51.960\nYou get confused with Houdini\n\n47:51.960 --> 47:53.960\nContern Houdini\n\n47:53.960 --> 48:00.960\nWhich is which\n\n48:00.960 --> 48:03.960\nSo, here's the thing\n\n48:03.960 --> 48:09.960\nUnited Airlines, I already said, they're terrible people\n\n48:09.960 --> 48:11.960\nI tweeted that they're terrible\n\n48:11.960 --> 48:13.960\nThey bumped us from the flight\n\n48:13.960 --> 48:16.960\nWe all know that airlines, they overbook\n\n48:16.960 --> 48:18.960\nHere's the thing about airlines\n\n48:18.960 --> 48:20.960\nHere's what they do\n\n48:20.960 --> 48:23.960\nThey have X amount of seats on their plane\n\n48:23.960 --> 48:25.960\nOkay, 100 seats, let's say\n\n48:25.960 --> 48:27.960\nLet's keep it simple\n\n48:27.960 --> 48:30.960\nHow many seats should you sell if you have 100 on your plane?\n\n48:30.960 --> 48:32.960\nWhy, 100?\n\n48:32.960 --> 48:35.960\nOh, funny, you should say\n\n48:35.960 --> 48:40.960\nBecause what they do is they sell 115\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:43.960\nBecause, and they'll be the first to tell you\n\n48:43.960 --> 48:47.960\nThe reason we do that is because of no shows\n\n48:47.960 --> 48:50.960\nWe have to do it because of no shows\n\n48:50.960 --> 48:54.960\nOh, oh, oh, do some people not show up?\n\n48:54.960 --> 48:57.960\nFor your business that you run?\n\n48:57.960 --> 48:59.960\nIs that part of your overhead?\n\n48:59.960 --> 49:01.960\nHere's the thing\n\n49:01.960 --> 49:03.960\nThose people get charged anyway\n\n49:03.960 --> 49:06.960\nWe've all been no shows, we all get charged\n\n49:06.960 --> 49:09.960\nYou got 100 seats, you sold 100 tickets\n\n49:09.960 --> 49:11.960\nTake your fucking money\n\n49:11.960 --> 49:15.960\nThey overbook because they have a chance of making more money\n\n49:15.960 --> 49:20.960\nA chance, they can't stand the idea of an empty seat on a plane\n\n49:20.960 --> 49:23.960\nWhen they're bringing the peanuts by\n\n49:23.960 --> 49:25.960\nThey look at the seat and they're like\n\n49:25.960 --> 49:29.960\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, delicious money\n\n49:29.960 --> 49:34.960\nOh, the pennies, oh, the nickels we could have had\n\n49:34.960 --> 49:38.960\nWe could have sucked more blood from the poor\n\n49:38.960 --> 49:42.960\nThey hate that, that's what pains them\n\n49:42.960 --> 49:45.960\nWhat a wasted seat\n\n49:45.960 --> 49:47.960\nIt's not because they're victims\n\n49:47.960 --> 49:49.960\nIt's not like airline piracy\n\n49:49.960 --> 49:51.960\nWhen someone doesn't show up for a flight\n\n49:51.960 --> 49:54.960\nSo fuck you, every airline in the world\n\n49:54.960 --> 49:56.960\nAnd also it's not fair\n\n49:56.960 --> 49:59.960\nBecause your companies are like pseudo companies\n\n49:59.960 --> 50:02.960\nBecause they're not accountable to the normal laws\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:04.960\nOf supply and demand or capitalism\n\n50:04.960 --> 50:06.960\nThey're protected from bankruptcy\n\n50:06.960 --> 50:08.960\nThey're protected from competition\n\n50:08.960 --> 50:10.960\nThey have virtual monopolies\n\n50:10.960 --> 50:13.960\nThey have a box of fake capitalism\n\n50:13.960 --> 50:15.960\nOverseen by the government\n\n50:15.960 --> 50:17.960\nThey're all bullshit companies\n\n50:17.960 --> 50:19.960\nI reserve the right to get mad\n\n50:19.960 --> 50:21.960\nWhen I show up at the gate and somebody goes\n\n50:21.960 --> 50:24.960\nOh, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a serious situation here\n\n50:24.960 --> 50:26.960\nI don't know how this happened\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:30.960\nBut it seems like there's more people than seats\n\n50:30.960 --> 50:33.960\nSo at this point in time\n\n50:33.960 --> 50:35.960\nWe'd like to invite you to come up\n\n50:35.960 --> 50:39.960\nAnd if you want to come up and help us out a little bit\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:42.960\nWe're kind of fucking us over by being people\n\n50:42.960 --> 50:45.960\nThis is not like we signed up for this\n\n50:45.960 --> 50:47.960\nJust hold tight\n\n50:47.960 --> 50:49.960\nAnd then you go up and you're like\n\n50:49.960 --> 50:50.960\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n50:50.960 --> 50:51.960\nWe got to do a show in Austin\n\n50:51.960 --> 50:53.960\nThey're like, excuse me\n\n50:53.960 --> 50:55.960\nThat's it, that's it\n\n50:55.960 --> 50:57.960\nYou say, LeVar Burton, you fly coach\n\n50:57.960 --> 50:58.960\nYou never have a problem with anybody\n\n50:58.960 --> 51:00.960\nYou're a better person than me, fine\n\n51:02.960 --> 51:04.960\nI want to get LeVar Burton mad about something\n\n51:04.960 --> 51:06.960\nWhat makes you mad? No child left behind\n\n51:06.960 --> 51:08.960\nFucking let us have it\n\n51:08.960 --> 51:10.960\nBoth barrels\n\n51:11.960 --> 51:12.960\nReally?\n\n51:12.960 --> 51:13.960\nGet mad\n\n51:13.960 --> 51:15.960\nI want to hear LeVar Burton rant\n\n51:15.960 --> 51:17.960\nLike what makes you fucking mad\n\n51:17.960 --> 51:18.960\nLike what makes your wife go\n\n51:18.960 --> 51:20.960\nLeVar, calm down\n\n51:20.960 --> 51:24.960\nLike what makes you kind of hit the mirror on the dresser\n\n51:24.960 --> 51:26.960\nAt the foot of the bed\n\n51:26.960 --> 51:28.960\nYou're taking off your beautiful jewelry\n\n51:28.960 --> 51:32.960\nAt the end of a long day\n\n51:32.960 --> 51:36.960\nTeaching children to read\n\n51:36.960 --> 51:37.960\nAnd you're like\n\n51:37.960 --> 51:40.960\nLeVar, you're scaring me\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:41.960\nYeah?\n\n51:41.960 --> 51:43.960\nYou haven't seen the half of it\n\n51:43.960 --> 51:45.960\nI can do anything\n\n51:49.960 --> 51:51.960\nTake a look motherfucker\n\n51:52.960 --> 51:53.960\nI'm a but\n\n51:53.960 --> 51:54.960\nWhat is it?\n\n51:54.960 --> 51:56.960\nWhat's the thing that gets your\n\n51:56.960 --> 52:00.960\nGoddamn, really your bright red goat going\n\n52:00.960 --> 52:02.960\nFrank Spiner\n\n52:05.960 --> 52:08.960\nI am not really fond of ignorant people\n\n52:08.960 --> 52:09.960\nYeah\n\n52:09.960 --> 52:12.960\nI get offended by ignorant people\n\n52:12.960 --> 52:13.960\nLike you know\n\n52:13.960 --> 52:15.960\nLike people get offended when people\n\n52:15.960 --> 52:16.960\nYou know, say like\n\n52:16.960 --> 52:17.960\nHey asshole\n\n52:17.960 --> 52:20.960\nYou know, I get offended just when someone's ignorant\n\n52:20.960 --> 52:21.960\nI'm like\n\n52:21.960 --> 52:22.960\nWhere do you get off\n\n52:22.960 --> 52:25.960\nNot knowing where the stop sign is\n\n52:25.960 --> 52:27.960\nThat's something most\n\n52:27.960 --> 52:30.960\nWell, what kind of, give us an ignorant person\n\n52:30.960 --> 52:36.960\nPeople who are intolerant of other people\n\n52:38.960 --> 52:39.960\nKeep going\n\n52:39.960 --> 52:41.960\nWe gotta get the intolerance out of you\n\n52:43.960 --> 52:45.960\nI know it'll seem hypocritical\n\n52:46.960 --> 52:50.960\nI want you to be so angry\n\n52:50.960 --> 52:52.960\nYou want me to be angry Dan?\n\n52:52.960 --> 52:53.960\nYou want me to be angry\n\n52:53.960 --> 52:58.960\nJust for funsies\n\n52:58.960 --> 52:59.960\nMotherfucker\n\n52:59.960 --> 53:02.960\nI will cut you\n\n53:02.960 --> 53:04.960\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n\n53:04.960 --> 53:07.960\nShut the fuck up\n\n53:07.960 --> 53:10.960\nI will cut you\n\n53:10.960 --> 53:11.960\nMe\n\n53:11.960 --> 53:12.960\nBitch\n\n53:12.960 --> 53:13.960\nWhat\n\n53:13.960 --> 53:15.960\nBecause of my ignorance?\n\n53:15.960 --> 53:16.960\nNo\n\n53:16.960 --> 53:17.960\nNo\n\n53:17.960 --> 53:19.960\nNot because of your ignorance\n\n53:19.960 --> 53:22.960\nBecause you want me to be fucking angry\n\n53:22.960 --> 53:24.960\nDan Harmon\n\n53:24.960 --> 53:26.960\nYou have pushed me over the edge\n\n53:33.960 --> 53:36.960\nYou're the gentlest man in the world\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:37.960\nI disagree\n\n53:37.960 --> 53:39.960\nThat's the kind of intent, quiet intensity\n\n53:39.960 --> 53:41.960\nThat absolutely makes me shit myself\n\n53:41.960 --> 53:42.960\nNo, I'm not\n\n53:42.960 --> 53:44.960\nI'm not saying it's not scary\n\n53:44.960 --> 53:47.960\nNobody in this room wants to disappoint Levar Burton\n\n53:47.960 --> 53:48.960\nI'm not saying like\n\n53:48.960 --> 53:51.960\nOh, you're such a sugar cube\n\n53:51.960 --> 53:52.960\nI'm saying like\n\n53:52.960 --> 53:54.960\nThis guy is so in control\n\n53:54.960 --> 53:56.960\nYou don't have that\n\n53:56.960 --> 53:57.960\nThe Poloric Valve\n\n53:57.960 --> 53:59.960\nWhat's that Confederacy of Dunce's guys\n\n53:59.960 --> 54:01.960\nLike you don't have the\n\n54:01.960 --> 54:02.960\nYou don't have the fucking like\n\n54:02.960 --> 54:04.960\nStack to blow\n\n54:04.960 --> 54:07.960\nYou don't lose control of your anger\n\n54:07.960 --> 54:09.960\nYou sit on it\n\n54:09.960 --> 54:11.960\nNot sit on it, you're not repressed\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:13.960\nYou're noble\n\n54:13.960 --> 54:15.960\nYou're a noble creature\n\n54:15.960 --> 54:18.960\nYou're a noble highly evolved old soul\n\n54:18.960 --> 54:22.960\nDoes it make you mad when I define you like that?\n\n54:24.960 --> 54:26.960\nYou fucking noble soul\n\n54:28.960 --> 54:29.960\nCome on\n\n54:30.960 --> 54:32.960\nI hate you, Dan Harmon\n\n54:33.960 --> 54:34.960\nI hate you\n\n54:34.960 --> 54:36.960\nYou're hate's bullshit\n\n54:36.960 --> 54:38.960\nYeah, I'm sorry, it is, you're right\n\n54:43.960 --> 54:46.960\nThat's a result that's actually more valuable\n\n54:46.960 --> 54:48.960\nThan just getting you to like\n\n54:50.960 --> 54:51.960\nWe got to confirm\n\n54:51.960 --> 54:54.960\nLevar Burton's biosphere doesn't have\n\n54:55.960 --> 54:59.960\nThe T-Rex on your planet\n\n54:59.960 --> 55:01.960\nHas like\n\n55:02.960 --> 55:04.960\nHe's holding little flowers\n\n55:05.960 --> 55:07.960\nAnd his little hands, the little T-Rex hands\n\n55:08.960 --> 55:10.960\nHow does he pick them?\n\n55:11.960 --> 55:13.960\nThat was a bad analogy\n\n55:13.960 --> 55:14.960\nIt doesn't make any sense\n\n55:14.960 --> 55:15.960\nI think it was good\n\n55:15.960 --> 55:17.960\nIt was

01:02:32.960\nYou know that's her name, right?\n\n01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.960\nNo, I thought\n\n01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960\nYou thought it was like Ka-Blam-O\n\n01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960\nYeah\n\n01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960\nBoo-Yah\n\n01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960\nBoo-Yah Johnson\n\n01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960\nYeah\n\n01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960\nYeah\n\n01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960\nSpeaking of it\n\n01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960\nI cannot wait to have a little Kuta Haraman\n\n01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.960\nYou can't wait to\n\n01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.960\nAre you doing what I'm doing right now\n\n01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.960\nWhich is trying to figure out\n\n01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.960\nA joke where someone gets\n\n01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.960\nKuta's name wrong and kindergarten\n\n01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.960\nAnd she has to correct her teacher\n\n01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.960\nOver and over again\n\n01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.960\nNo, I hadn't thought about that\n\n01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.960\nActually, I mean\n\n01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.960\nAaron's 12 years younger than me\n\n01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.960\nBeing raised in the 70s\n\n01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960\nThe truth is\n\n01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.960\nBecause we were at that\n\n01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.960\nWeird event horizon\n\n01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.960\nOf racial politics\n\n01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.960\nThe name Kuta Kinte\n\n01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960\nThe words\n\n01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.960\nWhen you do that joke\n\n01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960\nLaVar adlib that\n\n01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.960\nAt the end of the community episode\n\n01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960\nWhen he goes more fish for Kuta\n\n01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960\nEvery time\n\n01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960\nThe word Kuta\n\n01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960\nMakes my spinal cord\n\n01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960\nKind of cringe a little bit\n\n01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960\nYeah, there's a definite visual\n\n01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960\nThat goes on\n\n01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.960\nWell, it was used so much back then\n\n01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960\nIn negative ways\n\n01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.960\nBecause it was a positive thing\n\n01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960\nIt was like\n\n01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960\nThere was like\n\n01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.960\nI grew up in Milwaukee in the 70s\n\n01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960\nSo if you have a Camaro and a mullet\n\n01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.960\nAnd you are\n\n01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.960\nThe words Kuta Kinte were not used\n\n01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960\nPrimarily like\n\n01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960\nWhat a great character\n\n01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.960\nIt was like\n\n01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960\nAnd I hear the words\n\n01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960\nAnd they have a shock to my system\n\n01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960\nLike\n\n01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.960\nHe said it, not me\n\n01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960\nI don't know\n\n01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.960\nWhich is why\n\n01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.960\nMy experience on community\n\n01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.960\nWas one of the best\n\n01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.960\nOf my professional career\n\n01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.960\nYou let the adlib go\n\n01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.960\nYou let it stay in the picture, Dan\n\n01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.960\nYou left it in the episode\n\n01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960\nThat's more on you\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960\nThat you was that good\n\n01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960\nIf it was bad, he would have cut it\n\n01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.960\nI'll cut it if it is funny\n\n01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960\nAnd we don't have time\n\n01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.960\nWe tortured you\n\n01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.960\nWhen you came back\n\n01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960\nFor the horrible heart-wrenching\n\n01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.960\nTroy Goodbye episode\n\n01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960\nThank you so much for coming back\n\n01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960\nAnd doing that\n\n01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960\nWe shot the tag\n\n01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960\nWhere you were sitting in that boat\n\n01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960\nWith Donald\n\n01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960\nAnd there's basically two versions of that tag\n\n01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960\nThere's the one where Donald\n\n01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960\nThat you've seen\n\n01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.960\nWhere Donald pulls out the piece of paper\n\n01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960\nAnd he has a thousand questions about Star Trek\n\n01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.960\nBut then there's a whole different one\n\n01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.960\nWhich has blocking and everything\n\n01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.960\nWhere LeVar Burton is just like\n\n01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960\nTurns out to have a lot of road rage\n\n01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.960\nAnd he's just there with Donald\n\n01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960\nAnd he's like\n\n01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960\nThey're in traffic\n\n01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960\nAnd he's like\n\n01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960\nI don't know what's taking so long\n\n01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.960\nAnd then somebody honks\n\n01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960\nAnd he goes up to the window\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.960\nAnd the whole tag is just LeVar Burton yelling\n\n01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960\nAt some unseen lady\n\n01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960\nGoing like\n\n01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960\nHey, what do you think you're doing?\n\n01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960\nDon't look at your baby\n\n01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.960\nYour baby's on my side\n\n01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960\nIt's really funny\n\n01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.960\nBut we didn't have time for that version\n\n01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.960\nOh, Dan, I really want LeVar to officiate our wedding\n\n01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960\nNo, you can't\n\n01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960\nDuncan Trussell's going to do a great job\n\n01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960\nI know, I love him, but it's\n\n01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960\nDuncan, Duncan will officiate\n\n01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960\nI know, that's all\n\n01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960\nYeah, you don't want to\n\n01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960\nI will do a reading\n\n01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960\nYes, thank you\n\n01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960\nI will do a reading\n\n01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960\nIt's going to be great\n\n01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960\nI will do a reading\n\n01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960\nFrederick\n\n01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960\nAfter Duncan says\n\n01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960\nI now pronounce you man and wave\n\n01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:00.960\nCan you also just say it?\n\n01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960\nI also pronounce you\n\n01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960\nWe'll do a\n\n01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960\nYeah, we'll do a\n\n01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.960\nLike, I know\n\n01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.960\nYou could do a call or a response\n\n01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960\nI now pronounce you man and wave\n\n01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960\nAnd then we'll all look over at LeVar\n\n01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.960\nAnd LeVar'll nod\n\n01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960\nAnd then, yeah\n\n01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960\nIt'll be like a\n\n01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.960\nMr. Miyagi kind of like\n\n01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.960\nY'all are married now\n\n01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960\nFor real\n\n01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960\nYeah\n\n01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.960\nMy poor father is getting\n\n01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.960\nMy father is a preacher\n\n01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960\nAnd I think wanted to be\n\n01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960\nInvolved in the wedding\n\n01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960\nAnd he's getting\n\n01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.960\nFurther and further away from\n\n01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.960\nBy the way, you're raised\n\n01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960\nCatholic, you went to\n\n01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960\nSeminary school\n\n01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.960\nHow much did that have to do\n\n01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.960\nWith your parents?\n\n01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.960\nHow religious were your parents?\n\n01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.960\nMy mother was not Catholic at all\n\n01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960\nMy mother was a teacher\n\n01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960\nShe was an educator\n\n01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960\nShe knew that the best education\n\n01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.960\nAvailable for her three children\n\n01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.960\nI know there's a single parent\n\n01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.960\nAnd I was raised Catholic\n\n01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960\nBecause that was where\n\n01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.960\nThe education was\n\n01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.960\nEducation was the level of the playing field\n\n01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.960\nShe knew that if I was going to\n\n01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960\nThat I would grow up\n\n01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.960\nAnd inherit a world that would be hostile\n\n01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960\nTo my presence simply because\n\n01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.960\nOf the color of my skin\n\n01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.960\nAnd the only chance I had\n\n01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.960\nWas to be able to compete\n\n01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:08.960\nLevely\n\n01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.960\nAnd in education was the key to that\n\n01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.960\nSmart lady\n\n01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.960\nWhat a mom\n\n01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960\nHow did you feel about\n\n01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.960\nYou going to seminary?\n\n01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960\nWhen I decided to become a priest\n\n01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960\nMy mother was very nervous\n\n01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960\nShe was like\n\n01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.960\nOh my, I've gone too far\n\n01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.960\nBut she supported me\n\n01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.960\nAnd then when I decided\n\n01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960\nNot to become a priest\n\n01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960\nAnd become an actor\n\n01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.960\nShe was also very nervous\n\n01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960\nFor me\n\n01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960\nBut it's all worked out\n\n01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.960\nSo Irma Jean's good\n\n01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960\nShe's good\n\n01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960\nHer name's Irma Jean?\n\n01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.960\nIrma Jean\n\n01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.960\nE-R-M-A-G-E-N-E\n\n01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.960\nWhenever I get an opportunity\n\n01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.960\nTo speak my mother's name\n\n01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.960\nIn front of people I do\n\n01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.960\nI am\n\n01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960\nI am the man I am\n\n01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960\nBecause she is the woman she is\n\n01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.960\nIs she still out there?\n\n01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.960\nAbsolutely\n\n01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960\nOh wow\n\n01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.960\nDid she tell you\n\n01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.960\nLike\n\n01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.960\nDid she tell you\n\n01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.960\nYou can do anything you want\n\n01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960\nAbsolutely\n\n01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.960\nYeah\n\n01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.960\nMy mom, by the way\n\n01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960\nAlso did that\n\n01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960\nYeah\n\n01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960\nThat's why\n\n01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.960\nI want to have a conversation with her\n\n01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960\nShe always said\n\n01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960\nYou can do whatever you want\n\n01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.960\nRight\n\n01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.960\nShe also hit us a little bit\n\n01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960\nIt's not a big deal\n\n01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960\nLike\n\n01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960\nI just fall back on that\n\n01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.960\nI got beat when I was a kid\n\n01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960\nYeah, we all did\n\n01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.960\nYeah\n\n01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.960\nExcept for these guys\n\n01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.960\nThe way parenting was conducted\n\n01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960\nBack in the day\n\n01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960\nThat's what my mom said\n\n01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.960\nHello\n\n01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.960\nYeah\n\n01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960\nYou turned out okay\n\n01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960\nI'm fine\n\n01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.960\nI'm a millionaire\n\n01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.960\nHello\n\n01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960\nYeah\n\n01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960\nI don't remember\n\n01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960\nHow much it hurts\n\n01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.960\nI do know\n\n01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960\nHow much money I have\n\n01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960\nNo, you don't\n\n01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960\nI feel like\n\n01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.960\nIf my parents were like\n\n01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.960\nYou know\n\n01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.960\nI feel like\n\n01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.960\nYou know\n\n01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.960\nAnd\n\n01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.960\nYou would never strike\n\n01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960\nConta Harmon\n\n01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960\nNo\n\n01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960\nNo\n\n01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.960\nI wouldn't\n\n01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.960\nNo, you won't\n\n01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.960\nI chased my cat once\n\n01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960\nAnd I got really upset\n\n01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960\nI was living alone\n\n01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960\nI wasn't in a relationship\n\n01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960\nAnd my cat kept meowing\n\n01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.960\nAnd I got really frustrated\n\n01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.960\nAnd I kind of chased her\n\n01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.960\nAnd I was screaming\n\n01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960\nAnd chasing her\n\n01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960\nAnd I was like\n\n01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960\nOh, fuck\n\n01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.960\nI'm gonna beat my kids\n\n01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.960\nBut I think that our parents hit us\n\n01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.960\n100 times less than their parents hit them\n\n01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960\nExactly right\n\n01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960\nAnd I think we've got it down now to\n\n01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:24.960\nMaybe we'll\n\n01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.960\nMaybe I'll give my kid a wet willy\n\n01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.960\nI mean, I don't want you to\n\n01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960\nChase and frighten our kids around the house\n\n01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.960\nBut I would like to see what that would look like\n\n01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.960\nI've always figured that\n\n01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.960\nI would just like\n\n01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.960\nA one-time dispensation\n\n01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960\nJust so they know I'm crazy enough\n\n01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960\nTo do it again\n\n01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.960\nI think that goes a long way\n\n01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.960\nI think that parents like\n\n01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960\nMy heart goes out to parents today\n\n01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960\nWhen you see them at the airport\n\n01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.960\nAnd they're like\n\n01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960\nThis generation is committed to the idea\n\n01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.960\nThat there's never a good reason\n\n01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.960\nTo hit your kid\n\n01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960\nAnd it's not\n\n01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.960\nI can see that it's not easy\n\n01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960\nI can see from the expression on their face\n\n01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.960\nIn the grocery store\n\n01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960\nI can see that they are\n\n01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.960\nIt's not like they're\n\n01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.960\nPussies\n\n01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.960\nIt's not like they're\n\n01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:18.960\nIt's not like they're not doing it\n\n01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.960\nBecause they don't want to\n\n01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.960\nI can see that it's actually\n\n01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960\nDiscipline\n\n01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960\nYou know, in the part of a generation\n\n01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.960\nThat probably did get walloped a little bit\n\n01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960\nAnd they're like\n\n01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960\nYeah, it's probably\n\n01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.960\nLet's experiment\n\n01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.960\nI do also see a lot of parents that are like\n\n01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960\nI'm gonna be my kid's best friend\n\n01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960\nAnd the kid is like\n\n01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960\nA fucking horrible nightmare\n\n01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960\nBut I don't judge\n\n01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.960\nBecause I'm not a judgmental person at all\n\n01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960\nBut I do\n\n01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.960\nI think we're conducting a generation-wide experiment\n\n01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.960\nRight now\n\n01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960\nIt seems to be successful\n\n01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960\nI think the time-outs\n\n01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960\nAnd all that shit do work\n\n01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.960\nI think that the kids are gonna be fine\n\n01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960\nI don't think that\n\n01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960\nI don't think you need to like\n\n01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960\nHit your kid, right?\n\n01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.960\nThat's not a controversial statement\n\n01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.960\nI'll cover the parenting\n\n01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.960\nI'll take care of it\n\n01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.960\nOh, yeah\n\n01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.960\nI'll just wake my kid up at 3 in the morning\n\n01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960\nAnd be like\n\n01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960\nYeah, the Holocaust happened\n\n01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960\nSix million Jews\n\n01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960\nIt's horrible\n\n01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960\nGood night\n\n01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960\nMy favorite children's book was\n\n01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960\nFrederick by Leo Leone\n\n01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960\nJust put that in the hopper\n\n01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.960\nFor the wedding\n\n01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.960\nIf he really does show up\n\n01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960\nAnd really reads a book\n\n01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.960\nI don't want your favorite book\n\n01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.960\nNecessarily to be the only one\n\n01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.960\nIn the run\n\n01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:38.960\nWe just give him a pile of books\n\n01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.960\nWell, someone should make a choice\n\n01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960\nMaybe it should be based on\n\n01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960\nThe number of awards that the author received\n\n01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.960\nI believe Leo Leone is\n\n01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.960\nHighly acclaimed\n\n01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.960\nAnd recently deceased\n\n01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960\nAn Italian\n\n01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.960\nI don't know what this shit you're\n\n01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.960\nRaised on is\n\n01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.960\nIt's probably some watercolor bullshit\n\n01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.960\nIt's by an AIDS activist with leukemia\n\n01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.960\nIt's fine\n\n01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960\nIt doesn't matter\n\n01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960\nThey're dying, it doesn't matter\n\n01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.960\nOkay, so we got\n\n01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960\nIf we were to play D&D\n\n01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960\nWe got our Dungeon Master\n\n01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960\nWe got me, we got you\n\n01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960\nWe got LaVar\n\n01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960\nDo we need an extra person\n\n01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.960\nTo play another part?\n\n01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.960\nI can't remember\n\n01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.960\nYeah, thank you so much\n\n01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.960\nOkay, so we should make a friend\n\n01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.960\nLast night in Austin\n\n01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960\nIt hasn't aired yet\n\n01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960\nBut Austin\n\n01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960\nWe're in Austin\n\n01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960\nSan Francisco\n\n01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960\nJackass\n\n01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960\nLast night in San Francisco\n\n01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.960\nWe had two dudes up\n\n01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.960\nSo I want to balance it with\n\n01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.960\nSomeone who at the very least\n\n01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.960\nIdentifies as a female\n\n01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.960\nNew progressive Harmon\n\n01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.960\nAnd I think we should base it on somebody\n\n01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.960\nThat let's go with the pain this time\n\n01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.960\nWho's had a terrible day\n\n01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:55.960\nOr a terrible month\n\n01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.960\nOr a terrible...\n\n01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.960\nOkay, we got a hand shot up\n\n01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960\nDo you want to come up\n\n01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.960\nAnd will you share\n\n01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.960\nYour misery with us?\n\n01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.960\nOkay, it's alright\n\n01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.960\nIf it hits a nice medium\n\n01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960\nAlright, you take this\n\n01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960\nVanessa\n\n01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960\nVanessa, okay\n\n01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960\nVanessa\n\n01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960\nWhat's the...\n\n01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.960\nWhat's the medium problem?\n\n01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960\nI had a really bad week\n\n01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.960\nI started out on Monday\n\n01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.960\nI had to work for this commercial\n\n01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960\nAs a PA\n\n01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960\nI'm not going to say the name\n\n01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.960\nBut for this LA woman\n\n01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.960\nAnd yeah, it was like in the beginning\n\n01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.960\nIt was great\n\n01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960\nBut I hired my best friend\n\n01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.960\nAs my code, or co-PA\n\n01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.960\nHe's my co-director\n\n01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960\nWe make small music videos\n\n01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960\nIt was really fun\n\n01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.960\nBut he's like a total stoner\n\n01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.960\nAnd we spoke the first day on Monday\n\n01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.960\nAnd I think she kind of knew\n\n01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.960\nAnd I felt really bad\n\n01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960\nBecause you're not saying\n\n01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960\nIt's relaxed\n\n01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960\nEverything's chill\n\n01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960\nIt's okay, we can do everything\n\n01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960\nWe did everything she told us to do\n\n01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.960\nBut I think she knew\n\n01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.960\nThat we were high the first time\n\n01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960\nSo we were like\n\n01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960\nOkay, whatever, it's fine\n\n01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960\nAnd she called us kids\n\n01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.960\nAnd she was playing teacher kind of\n\n01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:12.960\nAnd she had this thing\n\n01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.960\nWhere she was like\n\n01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960\nYou didn't bring a notebook\n\n01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960\nYou

positive phrases\n\n01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.960\nAnd negative phrases\n\n01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.960\nAnd like people basically had to choose\n\n01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.960\nLike three things they wanted to do\n\n01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.960\nA future and past\n\n01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:31.960\nAnd like\n\n01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.960\nI got to say like\n\n01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960\nI

the blue things\n\n01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960\nOr the negative things were blue\n\n01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960\nThis was a job\n\n01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960\nAre you sure

things\n\n01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960\nBecause everybody wrote like\n\n01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960\nI mean\n\n01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960\nSo one of the negative phrases\n\n01:16:09.960 -->

01:16:17.960\nAbout the positive phrases\n\n01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.960\nWere really sad\n\n01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960\nBecause they were all generic\n\n01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960\nLike there were two or three\n\n01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960\nWhere I'm like\n\n01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960\nDamn, I really like this person\n\n01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.960\nLike one person

they want to be an actor\n\n01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.960\nBecause they're all extras\n\n01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.960\nLike the extras\n\n01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.960\nWere the ones that wrote\n\n01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.960\nAll these things\n\n01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.960\nSo anyways\n\n01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.960\nWe're reading them out loud\n\n01:16:36.960 -->

they were women who put their children in daycare for Wednesday.\n\n01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960\nAnd then I was like, wait a minute, you're not letting me down.\n\n01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960\nYou're letting down like 10 people that I gotta say,\n\n01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.960\nlike now they can't show up for this commercial.\n\n01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.960\nAnd she's like,

that.\n\n01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.960\nDon't heckle people.\n\n01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.960\nAnyway, so it was a bad day.\n\n01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.960\nI'm not getting paid.\n\n01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.960\nI don't know if I'm getting paid.\n\n01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.960\nI don't really want to hassle her because she's in LA now.\n\n01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.960\nAnd I got really angry because it was just like,\n\n01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.960\nit totally described what LA commercial shit is about.\n\n01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.960\nAnd Austin vibe.\n\n01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.960\nI'm sorry, Austin and LA didn't get along this time.\n\n01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.960\nI wanted it to get along with her.\n\n01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.960\nI was really nice the entire time.\n\n01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.960\nWe did everything they told us to do.\n\n01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.960\nThat sounds really shitty, man.\n\n01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.960\nBut let's grow from this opportunity.\n\n01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.960\nWhen you start a new job,\n\n01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.960\nwait at least two weeks before you get stoned before you show up.\n\n01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.960\nIt wasn't my fault.\n\n01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.960\nWell, I guess, I know.\n\n01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.960\nAnd I smoke pot it a lot.\n\n01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.960\nWell, I learned this from the hard way.\n\n01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.960\nI guess, well, I was interned for a link later this summer.\n\n01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.960\nAnd he has a bong in his office.\n\n01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.960\nEven if he does, the first few days, don't let it on.\n\n01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.960\nWe're Austin people.\n\n01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.960\nI'm just trying to help you succeed.\n\n01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960\nI guess.\n\n01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960\nWe never did anything wrong.\n\n01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.960\nThat's the key thing.\n\n01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.960\nOne of my best friends, she's going to law school.\n\n01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960\nAnd she smokes every day.\n\n01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.960\nAnd she has to because she has a stomach issue.\n\n01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960\nThere's nothing wrong with smoking.\n\n01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.960\nIt relaxes you.\n\n01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.960\nIt gives impressions to people.\n\n01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.960\nAnd it sounds like the impression the person got from you is not favorable.\n\n01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:01.960\nAnd that's probably the problem.\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.960\nBut you knew her though.\n\n01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.960\nIf you knew her.\n\n01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960\nBut that doesn't matter.\n\n01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.960\nShe was mean from the start.\n\n01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.960\nShe never said, oh, here's my egg.\n\n01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.960\nYeah, people are awful.\n\n01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.960\nBut we got to work around that.\n\n01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.960\nWe can't just make them better people.\n\n01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960\nThat was my lesson.\n\n01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.960\nDespite being mean or not, no matter what, you just have to...\n\n01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960\nI think it's the look of judgment.\n\n01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.960\nWhen you meet someone, you're a mean person.\n\n01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.960\nYou can't give that person that look.\n\n01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960\nThat's what I learned.\n\n01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.960\nNo matter what, even if you are mean, I have to pretend you're not.\n\n01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.960\nThat's what I learned.\n\n01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.960\nYou seem like you're probably kind of young.\n\n01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:41.960\nYour first jobs are generally very shitty for old people who probably have very personality disorders\n\n01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.960\nwho are going to abuse your youthful vigor.\n\n01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.960\nThey're going to fuck around with you and be flawed.\n\n01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.960\nAnd I don't approve of kissing people's asses at all.\n\n01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.960\nI don't think when you're young, you should go,\n\n01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.960\noh, you don't have to be hyper focused on it and be like,\n\n01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.960\nI'm miserable, but I'm going to keep doing this thing because there's going to be a reward for it.\n\n01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960\nThere's a balance in there somewhere.\n\n01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960\nYou're trying to balance it with respect the whole time.\n\n01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.960\nI was never being disrespectful.\n\n01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.960\nI was just enjoying my day doing mundane tasks.\n\n01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.960\nEverything we did, we were late for a little bit,\n\n01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.960\nbut even when we were late, nobody was...\n\n01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.960\nWe were late the second time.\n\n01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960\nBeing late is a big deal.\n\n01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.960\nI know, but no one was doing anything for two hours and then she gave us a task.\n\n01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.960\nThat was the only flaw and I felt really bad.\n\n01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.960\nBut at that level of a production like that is the thing.\n\n01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.960\nIt's a huge deal.\n\n01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960\nAnd it's not entirely fair.\n\n01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:30.960\nWe're not very fair to laymen.\n\n01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.960\nNo, it's not fair, but it's the institution.\n\n01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960\nBut it's like...\n\n01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.960\nSome of my mom and my dad would say,\n\n01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.960\nand I understand totally, you guys are right.\n\n01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.960\nI learned my lesson.\n\n01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960\nAll right.\n\n01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.960\nWell, you said it was a medium bad day.\n\n01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.960\nShe didn't come up and say,\n\n01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.960\nI deserve a standing ovation for my problems.\n\n01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.960\nShe was honest.\n\n01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.960\nWell, I hope you get paid.\n\n01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960\nThat's some bullshit.\n\n01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.960\nI don't think I'm going to get paid.\n\n01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960\nOkay.\n\n01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.960\nIf I don't get paid,\n\n01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.960\nI learn a really good lesson.\n\n01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.960\nWell, then why can't you reveal who it is?\n\n01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.960\nDid you sign an NDA?\n\n01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.960\nBecause I didn't respect...\n\n01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.960\nYeah, she doesn't want to be unprofessional.\n\n01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960\nYeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.960\nOh man.\n\n01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960\nAs I said it,\n\n01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.960\nI heard it and I was like,\n\n01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.960\nI would be one to talk.\n\n01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.960\nI mean, believe me.\n\n01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.960\nI never know what I'm doing either.\n\n01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.960\nAll right.\n\n01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960\nWell, thank you for...\n\n01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.960\nVanessa was it?\n\n01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960\nYeah.\n\n01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.960\nWe're playing Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.960\nI never played,\n\n01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.960\nso I really wanted to do it.\n\n01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.960\nI didn't know how to play.\n\n01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.960\nYeah, it involves talking.\n\n01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.960\nOkay.\n\n01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960\nBut you agreed.\n\n01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960\nI can do that.\n\n01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.960\nYeah.\n\n01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960\nCan you help me though?\n\n01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.960\nBecause I really don't know how to play.\n\n01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.960\nWe'll be able to help you out.\n\n01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.960\nLaVar has never played either.\n\n01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.960\nSo what we're going to do\n\n01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.960\nis hand you these character sheets.\n\n01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.960\nIt's got a lot of strange arcane writing on it\n\n01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.960\nthat won't make any sense to you.\n\n01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.960\nOkay.\n\n01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.960\nThe character you're playing is...\n\n01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960\nIs she Chris de Burgh?\n\n01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.960\nYeah, just do it in the order.\n\n01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960\nOkay.\n\n01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960\nOh, just do it.\n\n01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.960\nYeah, you already...\n\n01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.960\nI tried to at least.\n\n01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960\nAll right, Spencer.\n\n01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:12.960\nI'm just trying.\n\n01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.960\nNow the tough thing is that we played in San Francisco,\n\n01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960\nso the story did move forward like five feet.\n\n01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.960\nLuckily, our format allows for me to recap the events\n\n01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960\nof the last episode\n\n01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.960\nprevious to this one.\n\n01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.960\nSo you're Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.960\nIt's just got some stuff.\n\n01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.960\nThat's how strong you are.\n\n01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960\nYou don't really have to know.\n\n01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960\nOkay.\n\n01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.960\nAm I supposed to know these numbers?\n\n01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.960\nYou're not supposed to know anything.\n\n01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.960\nIf you read some stuff off at occasion,\n\n01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.960\nit'll look great.\n\n01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.960\nThere you are, sir.\n\n01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960\nOn the second page,\n\n01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.960\nyou can see all the stuff that you have in your backpack,\n\n01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960\nand the object is mostly to use those things\n\n01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.960\nto make other things.\n\n01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:53.960\nOkay.\n\n01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.960\nWell, not even to make other things.\n\n01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.960\nAlso, you can negotiate with any character.\n\n01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.960\nOkay.\n\n01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.960\nI'm just kidding.\n\n01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.960\nHow do I figure out what kind of character I am?\n\n01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960\nYou're Chris de Burgh, the human rogue.\n\n01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.960\nYeah, so you're supposed to know what I have?\n\n01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.960\nIt's okay for me to know what you have.\n\n01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.960\nWhat is that?\n\n01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960\nThat says...\n\n01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960\nNo cheating, Dan.\n\n01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.960\nYou're holding a robot, baby.\n\n01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.960\nAll I ever do is I just hold the papers,\n\n01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.960\nand I just kind of like stare at the stage,\n\n01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.960\nand I...\n\n01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.960\nWhat?\n\n01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960\nWhat happened?\n\n01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:28.960\nOh, someone spilled her.\n\n01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.960\nOh, okay.\n\n01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960\nDo you need more vodka?\n\n01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960\nDo you need a new cup?\n\n01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960\nSorry.\n\n01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.960\nI think it's the combination of\n\n01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960\nLovar Burton being on stage,\n\n01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960\nand your rainbow dress,\n\n01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960\nand the cadence of your voice,\n\n01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.960\nwhich makes me feel like I'm tripping on mushrooms.\n\n01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.960\nOh, no!\n\n01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.960\nI think it's the dress.\n\n01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960\nAnd the papers,\n\n01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960\nand the things,\n\n01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960\nand the...\n\n01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.960\nI don't know if it's my dream,\n\n01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960\nor my nightmare,\n\n01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.960\nthat when I die...\n\n01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.960\nIs it Vanessa?\n\n01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.960\nYeah.\n\n01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960\nThat will be the character\n\n01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960\nthat greets me in the afterlife.\n\n01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.960\nAnd explains your life to you.\n\n01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960\nOkay, here's the thing.\n\n01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960\nYou died, but you didn't do this thing right.\n\n01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.960\nYou were a little bit of a cut to maniac\n\n01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960\nfor some of your life,\n\n01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960\nbut you didn't do the thing.\n\n01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960\nI know what you think,\n\n01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960\nbut you don't want to do the thing.\n\n01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.960\nBut I guess you masturbated a lot,\n\n01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960\nbut it's self-blushing,\n\n01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960\nbut it's not that big of a deal.\n\n01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960\nIt's like you weren't hurting people,\n\n01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.960\nbut you were hurting people,\n\n01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.960\nbut it's kind of like you're hurting yourself\n\n01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.960\nby hurting other people,\n\n01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960\nand you don't really care that much.\n\n01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960\nSo anyway,\n\n01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960\nI would just be the whole time,\n\n01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960\nI'm like,\n\n01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960\nam I a bad person,\n\n01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.960\nor a good person?\n\n01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960\nYou're a good person.\n\n01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960\nAm I in heaven or hell?\n\n01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960\nWhat is happening?\n\n01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960\nYou're a good person.\n\n01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.960\nNo, it's just another thing.\n\n01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:30.960\nI tend to do that, though.\n\n01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960\nIt's just walking through rooms\n\n01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.960\nwith cages of spiders,\n\n01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.960\nand she's like,\n\n01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:34.960\nthere's cages of spiders here,\n\n01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.960\nbut don't let them bother you.\n\n01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.960\nThere are spiders in cages.\n\n01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.960\nI don't know why I put them in cages,\n\n01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.960\nbecause the cages are as small as spiders.\n\n01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.960\nThey could get out if they wanted to,\n\n01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960\nbut they stay in there anyway.\n\n01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.960\nI don't get it.\n\n01:25:47.960 -->
