WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Oh, yeah, it's a little music by our friend Titanic's and Clare, I remember.

00:13.000 --> 00:24.000
From Hollywood, California, the Sunshine State, Harmontown is once again in session.

00:24.000 --> 00:38.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden then, right off the bat.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
It's very kind, very kind people, thank you very much.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Alright, we've got a lot to talk about.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
What should we talk about?

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
It's part of a time strip, I got high.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
I went out of the way, yeah, what are we talking about first?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
You guys, if you want, you can all come back in like 10 minutes.

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
We're going to look through and what will I be mad if Rob interrupts before I bring out Rob?

01:26.000 --> 01:52.000
Let's bring out Rob Schrab, everybody.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I think he might have got bigger applause than the mayor.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
It's all ironic. Everybody loves Loki more than Thor, but they know who the good guy is.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
I'll take that, I will take that, I'll take that comparison.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Brought to you by Dr. Pepper.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
God damn it, this is what you get when you don't talk to me at dinner.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
It was a big booth and you guys were coming across.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Can we talk about our text message exchange?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Sure, I got nothing to hide.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Can we bring Steve Levy out because he has a part in this?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh yeah, Steve Levy.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm sorry if you're here for this.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Clean, shaven, freshly cut Levy.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Look at the biceps of this guy, he's the hottest.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
You look like Captain America.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
One of the guys kind of changing in the background in that locker room scene in Top Gun.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
But you are on Iceman's side.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm just saying this guy's got fantastic.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Also, do you wax your smooth as an eel?

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Geez, what's happening?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
No, I don't wax.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Again, you can subscribe ladies, $5 a month.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Get to see this shit.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay, so I got a text message from Schrab, let's see.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
A couple of them.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I think it was yesterday.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Alright, first text message.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
Yesterday, 326pm, Schrab says, wait, what should we...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I don't even remember.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We should read each our own parts.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
No, no, no, no.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Come on, no.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah, read your fucking text that you sent me.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Open your script, Schrab.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
326pm.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Open your ice grips.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
You want me to?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, read yours.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
This is like being like the Steppenwolf.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
My phone's dead, I mean, I can't.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
My phone's dead.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Go sit next to him and do it together.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
No, no, just read it, just read it.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Man, this is the worst.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, you know, if you would have mentioned something at dinner, we could have had it all planned out.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I didn't know you were going to do this.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Go ahead.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Just sit here and read your fucking text.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
I brought Levy out so Levy could read his in the middle, that's the funny part.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
It's all the worst.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Alright, okay, okay.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
The podcast has become like, we're like the unearned popular kids at the lunch table,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
and it's like we think that the lunch table means we have a TV show.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
We're closing in on our 200th episode, and we still haven't figured it out.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Alright, but there's at least five people in the audience tonight who have never been here,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
and they're like, what the fuck is this?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
What is this?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Like, I thought he, I thought he, where's Chevy Chase?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Where's, what's, alright, just read.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Am I reading you, I mean?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
No, you're reading yourself.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Yesterday, 326 p.m. yesterday.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Just don't touch it.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
See with your eyes, not with your hands.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
It's too small, I'm sorry.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
He's got bad eyesight.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay, where is it, where are we starting?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Where are we starting?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Aren't they adorable?

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
There, yesterday, 326, this is the worst.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Just had brunch with Chris Pratt.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
Kind of a big deal.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh no.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
He's got p-

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah!

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Pratt brunch at Soho House.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Holy shit.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Uh, so I let it go.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Which makes me feel like you didn't get it.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, I got it.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
But I didn't know, I thought you didn't hear it.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
So then, what was it, an hour later?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
What's the time stamp?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
So then I get a text message from Steve Levy.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Some time later.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
This is from Steve.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Uh, hold on.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Because Schrabs?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Here, here.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Where were we?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
God, we text a lot.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
I send you a lot of vines.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
You send me so many vines.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
This is even better than going to see Hamilton.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
This is amazing.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
The fucking stagecraft up here.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It's at the top of the screen.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
This is three hours after that at 6 p.m.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
This is from Steve Levy.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
6.03 p.m.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
Schrabs wants me to tell you he had a, he had brunch with Chris Pratt.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Well, I didn't know you got it, so I wanted to make sure.

06:54.000 --> 07:03.000
In case you were trying to get ahold of me, I had my phone on do not disturb mode while I was having, having, having a meeting with Pratt.

07:03.000 --> 07:12.000
So then I said, my assistant telling me about your brunch with Chris Pratt doesn't make it dinner with Chris Pratt.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
A 10.08 p.m.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
9.14 a.m., so 12 hours later, you said, it's at the top.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Just fucking read it.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It was a great meeting.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
He's super friendly.

07:29.000 --> 07:39.000
And then I said, don't you think it's possible he was acting?

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Why would he do that?

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Maybe that's how actors practice.

07:47.000 --> 07:58.000
Maybe making someone think they're your friend is the acting equivalent of catching a fly with chopsticks.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
Have you been an actor this whole time?

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
No, and that's why my friendship is more valuable to you than his.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
That's all I wanted to know, screen grab.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
All right, that's it.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Thanks, Steve.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
You got it.

08:22.000 --> 08:30.000
Steve Levy.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
When we make this on Broadway, I think the more coveted role is a Steve Levy role.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I think he becomes the whole...

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I ruined it.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I shouldn't have thought, oh, we should read those texts.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I should be organic.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
See, when you go after something, you kill the butterfly.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
All right, so I shit my pants again.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
I went to Palm Springs with...

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah, that's what they're calling it now.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
I went to Palm Springs before I came on stage, man.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
El Compadre.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I was driving there with my lover.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
It's a two-hour drive.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
You've taken a lover?

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Dan Harmon takes a lover.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
He's taken a lover.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
A two-hour ride to Palm Springs.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
All right, it's a story.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, I was giving you a title sequence.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
I took a little hit. I grabbed the vape pen.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Her vape pen is differently configured than mine.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
I took a big, full hit, and then I started coughing.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
During the cough, each cough, as you know, I fart.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Largely, and I was like, those feel like hot farts.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
And I was coughing like horrible coughing.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
There were four in a row that I was like, that was a hot fart.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Four in a row.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And then everything was fine.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Then we went on a two-hour drive. Great time.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I made her a wonderful birthday present. I'm very talented.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
While you were driving?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
No.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
No, I made...

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
She's a fan of the Karina Longworth podcast.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
So you must remember this. I made her a half-hour episode of

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
You Must Remember This.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I want to hear this.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, you can't. It's her birthday present.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So we listened to it. She loved it.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And then she was like, oh, we're almost to the place.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
We're about 10 minutes away.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
This is probably our last chance to stop, grab some snacks,

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
stopped at a Walgreens, and got out and remembered.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
And felt...

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
That you weren't just making birthday presents.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
They weren't hot farts.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
I mean, the opening credits that Rob was making,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Rob didn't know the movie was called Hot Farts.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And I'm saying it's got a Z.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I was like walking around Walgreens.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And then I went, I was like, I don't know what's going on back there,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
but I can tell it's a big deal.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't know for sure. You never know for sure.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm drinking soylent a lot during the weeks, and so...

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Thanks.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Well, I'm just telling you that kind of throwing soylent under the bus

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
because I don't want you to think, Jesus, he's dying.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I do shit my pants more than the average person.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
We've learned that, but I also like, I'm drinking a lot of liquid.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And then I went back to the restroom area,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
and the restroom was closed.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
It was under renovations.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
And there was like one of those key code things in the women's room.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
So I just slashed back out and like...

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Wait, you had already let it rip?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It's already out?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
They were Hot Farts, man!

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm sorry, you're already carrying this.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
He's shed his pants four times!

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I thought you were still like, you didn't know what was about to happen.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
This isn't like a story about like, oh, it leads up,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and then let's celebrate the moment of the shit.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm saying, this is like, oh, I coughed,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
and then each cough I was like, that was a Hot Fart.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Oh, sorry.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
There was a Hot Fart too, there was like four of them,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and I was like, if those were all Hot Farts,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
why doesn't it smell in the whole car?

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
And if they weren't, if they were something else,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
why doesn't it smell?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And then forgot about them, because I wasn't moving around.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
So I was like, like, oh, I guess nothing's wrong.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Got out at the Walgreens, and then felt, I could feel.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Right.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Okay, something happened.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Gotcha.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
You shed your pants.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
And then really, there's almost, well, then I had to,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
because I was like, I shed my pants.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
And it's just like, well, go to the bathroom,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
the bathroom is closed.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
So I was like, we just got to go,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
and I just went back to the car, and I just sat down.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Did you get, I mean, you could get like,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
wet wipes and stuff like that.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I hadn't thought about that, but what was I going to do?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Take them into a dumpster?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It was a desert.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
It was like, stack up rattlesnakes,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and just hide behind the rattlesnakes.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
You can't shit in the desert, man.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Where can you?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I didn't have to shit.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I'd shit my pants.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I'd have to remove my pants, remove the underwear.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
So you went to the, you went, you went to this,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
you went to a wedding?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
You went to a wedding?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Where did you go?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It was a birthday weekend.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
It was a birthday weekend.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Birthday weekend.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Okay.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
All right.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And so, happy birthday.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
So you're back in the car.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I mean, I was telling the story.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
You're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what happened?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
You shit your pants?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Yes.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Then what happened?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'll be right with you.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
All right.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
So you're back in the car now?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I sat in the car.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm like, I don't know.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Like, how, what's going on?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And I just, I just held still and we're in the desert.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And then we pulled up to the thing and she's like,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I'll check in.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm like, yeah, you check in.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I'm not going to move.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I'm just going to sit here in my shit.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And then I was like sitting there and it was like a while

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
because they're hippies, you know,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm out in the desert and there's like some artisanal hotel that

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
probably had to pay in bark or something.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
And like, so I'm sitting there and I just like,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I could swear that I was hallucinating that I could feel

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
something dripping down my leg.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But I wasn't, I couldn't, I didn't want to check.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I didn't want to, I was just sitting there.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I just sat there and then we got to the bathroom or the room

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
and I, and then I like, it's just a little Rorschach.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Okay.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
That's the end of my story.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I shit my pants.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Okay.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
There's a lot to talk about.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
So, can I, I have one question.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
You're telling me that you did four hot farts in the car,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
drove to the wall, Walgreens, Walmart, Walgreens,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and then you got out of the car,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
realized that you had indeed pooped your pants.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Walked around a little while while you're trying to sort it out,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
couldn't get into one restroom,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
didn't know the key code to the ladies restroom.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Go back to the car, sit in the car.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Take another, I'm assuming a few more minute drive back.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
10 minutes.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
On to the crib.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Right.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
She goes into the check-in, paying with bark.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
You're sitting out in a hot desert car,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
possibly poop running on your legs,

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
or you're having like, you're having like a psychosomatic.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
It didn't smell like shit in the car.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
No.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
What?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Cause it really wasn't that immediate.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Cause it's out of the fucking box, it's fucking...

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah, but maybe it's just like, I got a big hairy butt,

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
and it's like, a lot of stuff can be going on up there.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
God knows that you couldn't eat off it right now,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
and the room doesn't stink.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I think the secret is to be a big, wide person

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
with a giant canyon for an ass.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Cause I was on stage doing an improv show a long time ago,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
and one of the improvisers had to run off stage,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
like really unceremoniously just leave the show

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
halfway through, and the whole room smelled like poop.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
But we didn't connect those dots,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
cause it smelled like poop before he left.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
We thought something else was happening,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
but he had indeed completely emptied his drawers on stage.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
So you just let a little...

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
No, I've never done...

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't even remember when I've done that,

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
but I have a lot of stories about like, farts gone awry.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
I probably had said this before,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
and I might be misquoting it either way.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Tommy Lasorta, the ex-manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Wow, I got finger snaps from Dave Kline on that one.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I didn't expect that.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
He had some advice from people,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
and I think there was more than this,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
but he said, never pass...

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
like when you get older,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
never pass a bathroom and never trust a fart.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Right, never trust a fart.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
That's the thing.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I had to learn that in my 30s that I had to stop.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I'd be like, you know what else is on the menu?

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
And then I'd be like, I'll be right back.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
So yeah, you've lost the ability to do...

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah, you can't do it anymore.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
When's the last time you shit your pants, Spencer?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
I think I was like 19 or something.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
It was just a fart gone awry, yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Right outside of a Taco Bell, fittingly.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Wow.

17:19.000 --> 17:26.000
Hey, Jeff, what would the Sam Elliott add for a...

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Wait, what would it...

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Come on down to Palm Springs and go to the all-new Walmart.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
We've closed the men's room

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
because Dan Harmon comes by once in a while.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
Ladies, the passcode is 3421.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Alright, that's Sam Elliott for Walgreens.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's a new segment I want to do.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
It's Sam Elliott...

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Check out Harmon Quest on CISO.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Hey, did you just say Sam Elliott for...

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
I'm going to make you do one, too.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
For Schrabs, Schrabs, Mama's Pussy.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Oh, she was on the show. She was on the show.

18:03.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah, really, you know, really not cool.

18:10.000 --> 18:18.000
All the glitters isn't gold.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
But there's one substance that never tarnishes in my mind,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
and that's Schrabs, Mama's Pussy.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Right, right, right, of course.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I call it the mother load.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Right.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Sam Elliott.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Alright, it's not cool.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Dan Harmon, I heard on the...

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I was listening to a talk radio, which I don't normally do,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
and I heard that...

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Schrabs, give me like a small business of any kind.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Shoe.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
A shoe.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I heard an ad for shoes.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I don't know if it was shoe makers or shoe repairers.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Shoe business.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Shoe as a whole shoe business.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
The shoe business.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
It's called shoe biz.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Shoe business.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Shoe biz.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Also with a Z, just like hot farts.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Shoe biz.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Shoe biz.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
There was a local spot by Ice-T.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh.

19:10.000 --> 19:22.000
Yo.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
Do your feet suffer from no shoeitis?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Remember, it's not personal.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
It's shoe business.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Come on down to shoe.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
We got all manner of foot coverings, boot jacks, flap naps,

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
canvas tops, high backs, round to rounds, mule wedges,

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
pumps, double pumps, non-pumps, neopumps,

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
and the revolutionary air nine.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
At shoe.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Fuck you.

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
All right.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
I guarantee you, as we, you know, we're twang with searching for

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
sponsorship here.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
There's got to be a place called shoe biz.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh, for sure.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I mean, that's just free advertising for shoe biz.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
We're just giving the shit away.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Dr. Pepper's looking right at camera three over there.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
So during the trip, you guys use ways sometimes?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I use that ways, man.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Have you used the Shaquille O'Neal ways voice?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
No.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I haven't heard that.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
Shaquille O'Neal ways voice says, I don't know if I can do an

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
impression of him.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
He's like a big guy.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
And he was like, hazard ahead.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Be careful.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Don't cause a shacksident.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
All right.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
He takes that pause like he's like, get ready.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Does he say about police?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
He says the police thing is police reported ahead.

21:11.000 --> 21:20.000
Don't be shacked in a fool.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
My favorite, they used to have Terry Cruz.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
It was like a Brooklyn nine nine integration and Terry Cruz was

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
the best because he would be like police reported ahead.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It would just be really exciting.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I used to get in your car and it would just be like, turn right.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Like left and then go straight.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
It was great.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Everybody keep your eyes out for a 1998 Toyota Corolla.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
It's a shactor alert.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That's about child abduction.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
A shack doing an amber alert.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Amber.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
A shack.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
A shactor alert.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I thought the car was stolen.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Oh yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
You didn't mention a child.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
Look, we'll pick it up and post.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I haven't eaten much today.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Hey, okay.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
So Game of Thrones, which we're all missing tonight.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Thank you for.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I already saw it.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yay.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
So last week's episode.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
These aren't spoilers.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
I'm not going to.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
I don't think.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
We already did that last episode, I think.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
What?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
We already spoiled some stuff for people.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Did I?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I mean, I don't know about you.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Some people did.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
It's fine.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Let's move past.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
That's why you say spoiler alert.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And they're supposed to put their fingers in the air and go,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah, yeah.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
This episode.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
They're not tonight's, but last week.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
I finally have a girlfriend who also like me likes to watch all

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
television and movies with the subtitles on.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Close caption.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I don't understand what the fuck people are saying, especially in

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
that show.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
You're from house.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
What?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
It's gibberish.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
It's gibberish.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So many names start with the same letter and the same.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
And they're all vowels.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
And I was like, Varar.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
What?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Oh, Varar.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Oh boy.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
And now I know everything.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
What letter do they all start with?

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
You get a Tyrian, a Tywin, a Tomwin, a Timmy Taps, a Toobie

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Dupes.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
So did you see the scene where they're at Kingsland?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I think Toobie Dupes.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
This is his season, by the way.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
They're having the Kingslanding, like the workplace comedy Kingslanding

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
boardroom meetings, you know, where Cersei's kind of like,

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
guys, W.K.R.P. needs to get his profit margins back up.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
You know, it's like they have those scenes where it's like her little,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
like unwilling minions are gathered around the table.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
And the guy, the old guy, the bearded old fucking guy with the

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
bathrobe.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Mr. Toobie Dupes.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
The guy that, the guy that in one episode they revealed when

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
everyone's out of the room, he's, he's only 70, not 90.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Remember that scene where he was like, they left and he was

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
like, oh, wow.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
You're only pretending to be 90, you're 70.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
That's cool.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
That'll come into play.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
That'll pay off.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Yeah.

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
There's going to be an 80 year old chasing him.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
This is my chance.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
He's going to catch him by a decade.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Wait a minute.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
What's going on?

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
It's like, they cut down to the verbal cat Kaiser Soze, like,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
like shot of the feet.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
They're like, wait, that's not a 90 year old's gate.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
That's a hobble.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
That's a full hobble.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
The unit guys in Milwaukee, everyone, we have a serious problem.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
There's a slam dunk contest in 45 minutes.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
The basket will be, of course, lowered each time a round is

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
failed, but it's, the opponent is 85.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
And as we all know, our champion is a sharp 90.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Anyways, that guy was talking shit about, you know,

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
Darth zombie man, the fucking, like, the mountain.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
The mountain.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Got turned into a.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I like Darth.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
This guy.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
And he's talking shit about him.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
He's doing the old, he's right behind me.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Isn't he?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Because he's like, that thing ought to be, you know,

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
put that thing to death.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Like, as far as I'm concerned, that thing's like, oh,

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
crazy.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And it's like, chomp, chomp, chomp.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Coming up in the frame.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
And then he turns and goes.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
And then he, if you're watching it with the subtitles,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
like, you know for sure what, what's about, like,

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
like, he looks and then there's a beat and then he farts.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
The care it says, and it says in the subtitles, farts.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
And there's like a little like sound.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
What's going on at Game of Thrones this season?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Do you think they.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Hot fart.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Do you think they added that?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
They could have, they might, do you think they added that

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
in a poster?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Do you think that was scripted?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, if you knew, if you knew how many farts I had to

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
actively suppress in community, like, like, because God

26:18.000 --> 26:26.000
blessed them, but audio engineers, they're, I mean,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
they, they got to make their own fun.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Like, like, and they, they will have a track of the

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
entire show if they've had time.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Like, and then like, of course we could, you know, well,

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Glenn's in the bathroom.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
We could play the, play it for him and then they play it

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
and it's just like, there's horse winnies and like hooves

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
and farts and everything's a fart and like, the Will

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
Helms scream is all lines of dialogue and like, and it's

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
just like, guys, I love your craft.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
I love what you do.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
It's very important to me, but everyone can't be

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
farting all the time.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
And I think this is like, like, like, yeah, they were like,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
like, they must have like, like, maybe they said like,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
George R.R. Martin and because, you know, we're,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
we're having a debate in the mixed bay and he's like,

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
I'm just the writer.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm working on the books and they're like, there's a

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
fart and he's like, I can't hear you.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I hope we get more young hodor.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I want like a young hodor spinoff.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Remember when he, when he did little, little young

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
teenage hodor?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I hope that whole storyline.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Oh, I'm loving it now.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm loving it now.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
You like, you like the brand.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm loving it now. Yeah.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Now that, now that Branson is awkward years.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Yeah.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm all over the Wikipedia.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
I'm reading stuff.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Things are interesting.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
It's crazy.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Are you being sarcastic?

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
No, no, it's, it seems like it's leading somewhere where

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
it could be leading somewhere that's completely like

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
new, weird territory that's like never done before.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
I hope so.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
I hope it's not more I white animal occupying.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
I don't, I don't, and I don't want to hang out in a tree

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
anymore.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
And I don't want to walk through holodeck flashbacks.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I don't like, look, what am I complaining about?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
It's a good show.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
It just seems like the season's kind of like, hey,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
what if, what if they had a meeting?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
There was a whole season where there was no crows.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I was, I was okay with that.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Like one.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I'm not sure.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm not sure.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
What is it?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Okay.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Well, this is a good question.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Okay.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Unless you're not into Game of Thrones and wandered in here

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
tonight.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
Of the, of the, of the, of the 19 like places you can cut to

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
in a Game of Thrones episode, like what really like,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
like what's the top one for you that you're,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
you're like leaning in.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Give me a moment to think about that.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I recently asked somebody, what would be the shittiest

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
if you were an actor?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Oh, when we had, when we had Grey Wormon,

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
like what was the shittiest gig?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
We talked about that here.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
What would be the best one?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Do you have one already on hand?

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I don't really.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I don't know what my answer to that is.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
I think what's, what's the one where everybody's fancy?

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Like the, where the, where the, where the seat of power is.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
What's that one?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
That's probably King's Landing.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
But, but Dinklage is out of there now.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Like that was my.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, but you can still have a nice outfit.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
That was my favorite was when he was there and he was like,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
he handed the King and he was hanging out and stuff.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Okay.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Anyways, what, what a dumb podcast.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Stupid ass podcast.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
But really, where would you get Game of Thrones conversation

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
if this podcast didn't do it?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
This is your only place on the internet to find out.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
All right, let's get back to the stuff only we can provide.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
So are there any women with big boobs in here?

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
If wait for it, like, do you have a problem with seat belts?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Yeah.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Okay.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
That sounded like a lot of big boob women.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
That sounded like a unanimous consent on that one.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Do you, do you put, how many of those women,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
I don't know how to measure it by,

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
because it's by applause.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
It's by cup size.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I don't want, I don't want to embarrass you.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I want to give you your privacy, but, but like,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
like, I guess you said yes when I said,

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
do you have big boobs?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
You can say it the same way.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Do you put the seat belt behind you?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Yes.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
That was a, that was a, that felt like,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
that felt like there's 12 women with big boobs in here

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
and four to seven of them drive with the seat belt

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
wrapped behind them because it disturbs their boobs.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Just a thought.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
Started dating someone with big boobs and I'm an advocate.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
And I want you to be safe in the car.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Yeah, so we have, so, so one of you,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
the gals that drives with it behind,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
like you're sacrificing the shoulder strap

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
and you're just doing the lap belt?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Basically.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Really?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
The illusion of safety.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
The illusion of safety.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So yeah, you might not be flung out of the car,

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
you'll just be smashed into the dashboard head first.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
That's a bummer.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Is there anybody, is there anybody like a,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
like travel safety, whatever that's called,

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
like working on seat belts that can accommodate that?

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Are you asking if there's anybody in here?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
No, no, I mean, like, no.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
I am Professor Mortimer Xavier Honda.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Are people currently like working on,

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I doubt it.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Remedying that?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Yeah, probably not.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
And I feel like, what?

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
There's that, as seen on TV, where it's like,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
there's a stuffed animal that sits on your boobs.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Oh, oh, oh, like there's like,

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
people sell a, like a, yeah.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Is that supposed to ease the,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
but that doesn't work, I'm assuming.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Wait, okay, so the boobs lift the belt

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
and make it like a braid your neck.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Ah.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
So look, I don't want to white knight the situation,

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
but look, body, body shaming.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm saying like, like if it's not getting addressed,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
it's because, you know, how, you know,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
like we've done a number on women,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
we're going to write to anybody and say,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
I've got giant tits and I've got a problem with that.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Like none of them are going to do it.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
That's like, a lot of them are driving around,

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
like, like,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Has there been no public outcry on that?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
You know of anybody?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
That's, that's crazy.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It's like, and it's like, you know,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
like, like, yeah, like, like,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
I had the same problem with the lap belt.

32:04.000 --> 32:16.000
That's exactly,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
that's the customer service line when you call

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
and you're like, seriously, like you're disturbed

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
because you just had a near accident

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
or you lost a friend and you're like calling

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and you're like kind of crying and like,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
and then the guy's like, ask you like eight questions

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
and then he goes like, okay, I'm just getting this down

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
because it's the same with me and the lap belt

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
that they, and then you hear three guys laughing

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
and then they, and you just hang up

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
and curl up in the corner.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Sob.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah, well, well, ladies with big boobs,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
let it be said here first.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
I am on your side.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
You're welcome.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Ladies with big boobs.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Sam Elliott

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
for big boob seat belts.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
Oh, boy.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
I was going to go to a really dark place.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
What you making this, Rob?

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Uh, jeez.

33:13.000 --> 33:19.000
Shit, sorry.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
I dropped my microphone a little bit.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I dropped it.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
It was on my, got on my foot.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
And then came a guy.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
We here at BMW have a whole new concept

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
about the way cars should be driven

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
and driven in.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
You got some big old hang down floppers.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Do you got some big old out front,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
punch them rounds.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
He's going into the different kinds of

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
breasts.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I don't know.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
Don't make me do a commercial for titty safety.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
What else do you got?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Your bosom deserves the respect.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
Ice tea for titty safety.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Why does he have a rap beat?

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Because he's ice tea.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
I don't play Nashville music

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
when you're doing Sam Elliott.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
If I had it, I would play it.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
I'm not allowed to play licensed music anymore.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Just let me, if you're going to pimp me to do

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
ice tea endorsements, don't play a beat

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
because I'm not going to rap to it.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
It's just a sound.

34:32.000 --> 34:39.000
Ice tea for man space exploration.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
And the funding thereof.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
We've been on this earth for over 5 trillion years.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
And we still can't get off it.

34:51.000 --> 34:59.000
Shit.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
It don't even matter to me personally

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
what's out there.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
It's a principle of the thing.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Gotta get my ass off this planet.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
If you feel the same way, write your congressman.

35:13.000 --> 35:23.000
That was pretty good.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
The beat was fucking me up.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
What else is on here?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I said I had a lot to talk about,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
but I'm realizing it's a bunch of dumb cutesy shit

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
because I was in Love All Weekend.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
And throughout the week also,

35:44.000 --> 36:05.000
I threw it through the floor.

36:05.000 --> 36:15.000
What was that?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Did you talk about it in the show yet?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
The fact that you drove in an Uber with a dude

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
who was full blown flat earth.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Did you talk about that here?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I don't think we did, did I?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Oh dear heaven, I totally forgot about that.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
There's still flat earth people.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
They're down to talk.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
He seemed like a reasonable, rational,

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
sober individual who was articulate.

36:39.000 --> 36:46.000
What music was playing?

36:46.000 --> 36:54.000
This is Ice T.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Ice T stuck his head in the window for a second.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
How did he drive away?

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Sorry, I can see you're busy.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm going on a coffee run.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
I left an ice cream truck or something.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
This was a month and a half or two months ago probably, right?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
I left a Harmontown here and I got into a lift.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
And the dude had, sometimes people put their ways,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
their phone on the dash or on suction cup to the window

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
or up on their visor or different places.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
Where else?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Are there other places?

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
Sometimes, and their passengers, big titties,

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
because he keeps the chafing on the neck.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
But he had another screen up.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
He had one of those giant Samsung-y big ones.

37:41.000 --> 37:46.000
I'm talking about his dick.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
He had a screen up on the visor and when I got in,

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
it was clearly kind of like talk radio but with visuals.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Just pictures and it was guys talking about science stuff.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
And he kind of, not rushed to turn it off,

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
but I got in the car, he got the destination and he turned it off.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm like, what was going on there?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
He had some planets and space.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
He's like, yeah, it's a science thing.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
I listened to it.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
I like science.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
We started talking about stuff.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
And it was revealed at one point that he is a flat earth believer.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Flat earth?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Is there a name for it?

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
And so he's like, the whole thing is a lie.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
The earth is flat.

38:24.000 --> 38:34.000
I tried to come at that citadel wall through the front gate,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
over the top, like tunnel under it.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
You don't want to be a dick, but you're fascinated.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
I was super fascinated.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Also, he was a pleasant guy.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
And I wish I could remember all the details.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
But when you've seen, do you believe we went to the moon?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
He goes, oh, we did go to the moon.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
That's also flat.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
See, that's fucking amazing.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
That was like the fourth.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Well, most flat earth people, from whatever I've read online,

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
they think that they also are moon hoax people.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
I was saying, what do you think happens if you walk in a straight line?

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
And he goes, we don't know, because the polar ice caps are there.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
They're there to keep us from falling.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
I have to go, what if we walk around the equator where there are no,

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
there's no such thing.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
There's no such thing as that.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
But this guy, hardcore environmentalist.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
That's the crazy thing too, is that he's like, he agrees.

39:21.000 --> 39:28.000
If you're dumb enough, you're fucking liberal.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
That's what we've got to do.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
We've got to deny education to conservatives until they become flat earthers

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
and believe that the ice caps are keeping their children dry.

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
I'm sorry, not dry, because what they believe is that if the polar ice caps melt,

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
all the water will fall off the edge of the marble madness level that we live on.

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
So I asked him about, what do you think creates gravity if not that swirling iron core?

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
And he goes, he had a, not a good answer, but he had an answer.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
And it was preposterous and lunatic, but he laid it out nice and simple.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
He talked like this level headed.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Big turtle.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
It's a big, just big turtle, camera.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Big, big turtle.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I said, all right.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Big turtle keeping the water down.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
If you believe that we walked on the moon as human beings, and we took photos,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
do you believe those photos?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
He goes, yeah.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I go, how come you can only see part of that flat disk?

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
How come you can only see Africa or you can only see a certain continent at once?

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
And again, he said, well, that's the photos.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
He goes, that's a good question.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I'll tell you why.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
And then he started making this other weird shit.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
I go, when you go high enough on a plane or a spaceship,

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
you can see the curvature of theirs.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
He goes, no, that's just because the lenses and the cameras are curved.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
The Beastie Boys video theory.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
So then I said, so what you, what you, what you want?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
What you want?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Intergalactic.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
So I said, and I laid down something that I, when I was like drunk and high and talking

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
to Professor Brian Cox about, I said, like, I said, like gravity and all this stuff.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
I explained what, we know what it does, but do we really know what it is?

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
Well, it's like, or like space time and stuff like that.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
We're talking about space time.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
And he goes, gravity curves things in the same way that like if you're walking on a curved surface,

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
like our planet, if you and I stood in a straight line along the equator,

41:21.000 --> 41:27.000
like a hundred, you know, kilometers apart and we walked, we both had a compass

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
and we walked due north.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
We would eventually meet.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
We would eventually touch.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
We would think that we were both walking perfectly straight and we were.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
We didn't know that the world was round.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
You would think that there was some weird force acting upon you.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
It's no, it's just the simple curved nature of space time and planets and anything that has curvature to it.

41:48.000 --> 41:54.000
So I was like, if you and I stood on, like, if you and I, like, if we, if I could come up with the money

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
where you and I could like do this experiment where we drove like a hundred miles apart

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
and had compasses and walked around and he goes, let's do it.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Let's do it.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
I love that this guy's down for anything but research.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
He's like, he'll get on a plane and like meet you.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
What made him, did you ask him what made him like stop believing it or did he never believe it?

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
I think somebody turned him on to this idea that we've all been lied to the whole time.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
It's all been this big bunch of baloney.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
And I said, but like, what's that?

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
Like, who's putting that myth forward?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
And we're like, who's making money off that?

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
This is the heroic one because that one's got it.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You're just making money. The big globe lobby.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Like, as far as I know, unless somebody tells me different, he's really not hurting anybody.

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
And in fact, that whole polar ice cave, that guy wants the polar ice caps to stay there more than we do.

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
And so really, he's really not hurting anybody unless he thinks what keeps the earth flat is hitting children or something.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
At what point?

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
But the crazy thing to me is like that, unlike the climate change denying kind of things or whatever the vaccination crap,

42:59.000 --> 43:07.000
that this is a guy who, like, he has a belief system that is actually incredibly difficult, I would think.

43:07.000 --> 43:14.000
It's beyond like, he has to fucking protect that thing with it.

43:14.000 --> 43:23.000
You couldn't say anything that seemed to me logical that ever got through, like, his force field of what he believed in.

43:23.000 --> 43:33.000
You think whenever he's like, at a movie, you know, and the universal logo comes out, he's like, here we go again.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
Bullshit! Turn it off!

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
That's why he only goes to DreamWorks movies when a kid is sitting in front of a flat.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
Right, right, yes, finally!

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
He's a flat movie.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
But here we go.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
It's a point where closed-mindedness...

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Not me, buddy, I'm not...

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
That guy's so...

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Take it down the road!

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
You have to actually open your mind a bit to get that closed-minded.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
Like, he had to one day, somebody had to say to him, you know, some people who believe the earth is flat,

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
and he had to be like, you know, there has to be some story where he's like, yeah, but fuck those people,

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
and then some spider bit him or something, and he was like, maybe not fuck those people.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
He delivered one of their flat babies in an elevator.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I was like, it's human.

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
Something happened to him where he was like, maybe the earth is flat.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
When I got to my destination, I didn't get out of the car, we talked for maybe five, eight minutes.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
I have so many, we have to keep talking, but he's like, I'd love to.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm like, keep the meter running.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I already turned it off, let's just talk about it.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
That's not a heroic thing.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
He goes, what's your hangout?

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
It's like you're a lunatic, and he's like, what?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I take that back, you're not a lunatic.

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
But this is a lunatic idea for me, and he's like, you have been fed a bunch of lies.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
It's all a bunch of lies.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
I was like, but why?

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
How do you start?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Was this Lyft or Uber?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
This was Lyft.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
That means he's got a podcast.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
On the way there, I said, are you using Google Maps or Waze when he goes, I'm using Waze.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
I'm like, how do you think GPS works?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
If it's flat, you can't.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Jesus Christ.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
What about you can go to the beach and see the ocean, and you can see it curving just with your own naked eyes.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
That's an optical illusion.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Well, then so is anything.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
You could just say, you guys can hang out.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
I would respond to that and say, well, if the earth is round, how come everything seems so flat?

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
Like the answer is just, I would just say,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I get that, but if you could see it curving, I don't know.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Yeah, but I can see it flatting.

45:45.000 --> 45:51.000
And the answer is, well, it's a matter of scale, and it's a different shit happens.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I want to get in there, man.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I want to be one.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I want to be a doomsday.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Did you find out?

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I was like a couple of things.

46:01.000 --> 46:07.000
If there were this flat, on a clear day, if we had a really good telescope, wouldn't we be able to see Mount Everest and everything else?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Eiffel Tower?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
He had all this stuff.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Clouds.

46:13.000 --> 46:21.000
My biggest regret about this whole thing is that right when you get out of the car, I was like, why didn't I invite him on Harmontown?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And not to mock him?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
No, of course not.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
We would have fucking...

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I'd mock him.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
But you wouldn't mock him.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
You would question him.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
You wouldn't bully him.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
There's no need.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
I think you can't just say, oh, you can't just have an answer.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
You could come up with lie answers for anything and not have to prove anything.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Example.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Well, let's make Spencer be a...

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Okay, sure.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Hello, Earther.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Alright.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
Hey, if the Earth is hollow, how come there are holes?

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
Because it spins.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
What?

47:07.000 --> 47:13.000
It keeps the shape that way.

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
I'm supposed to poke holes, right?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I don't know what the exercise became.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
You're trying to ask hard-hitting...

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
I'm trying to disprove hollow Earth theory.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
Well, I don't really know anything in common day that I can point at.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
That's because the government.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Alright.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
See, it's easy.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
You could just say anything.

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
Unless someone has, like, a ruler or something, you can't go out and disprove it.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
This is true.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
We blew it. I blew it.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
How about Sasquatch? Do you want something else?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Sure, sure, sure.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Hey, how come we haven't found Sasquatch skeletons?

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Because they've been hiding them.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Who's they?

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
The Sasquatches.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
They're hiding them.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because that's literally all they do is hide and hide things.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
They hide skeletons and other stuff?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
They're not called Sasparators.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Yeah, they hide the skeletons.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Where?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
In the beach.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
The beach?

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Why the beach?

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Because people think they're whale bones.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
It's fucking easy.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
You just say anything.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Alright, alright.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Spencer.

48:35.000 --> 48:49.000
Let's have Spencer pretend he's someone who believes in the electoral system of the United States.

48:49.000 --> 48:57.000
So how come if I live in New York where 9-11 happened, my vote counts for way less than if I live in Wyoming?

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Because every state gets to determine that.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
Well, how come we can't just use the technology to pick the president now?

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
You could. You just have to vote to make that happen.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
That's the biggest argument about the electoral college.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
It's like, oh, it's broken and fucking vote for it, assholes. It's stupid.

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
How come all the presidents are either rich people, politicians, or people that knew rich people are politicians?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Because that's what it takes.

49:23.000 --> 49:28.000
That's the system that the forefathers wanted.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
They didn't just want anyone to be president.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
It's true they did.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
That's true.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
Yeah, I mean, if anyone was president, a disaster could happen.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
They'd just pick some douchebag from a reality show and pizza commercials.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
I mean, God, mob rule can't happen or else.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I love it. I love what's happening.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
We're not celebrating the total collapse of the Republican Party.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
We're just being afraid that Trump's going to get elected.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
But we're not noticing that the fucking Republican Party...

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
I don't think it's the collapse of anything. I think it's us blossoming into a weird shitty flower that was always coming along.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
It's kind of neat.

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
I said a lot of crappy stuff about the bipartisan system as if it was always going to continue and there was no way for it to ever change.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
But it's not necessarily going to make things better, but at least we're looking at a kind of...

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
It's definitely a shaky year for the bipartisan system.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
They still have the legislature, though. They still got that legislature.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Yeah, where the shit really happens.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
That's the trick. That's what they've realized.

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
They think that if they lose the nomination, they can still win back legislation and still win that way.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Alright.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Alright.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
Alright. I really don't have a lot more. That's getting scary.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
What's going on in Venezuela? I don't know.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Okay.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Seems rough.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
What do you think is going on in Venezuela?

50:46.000 --> 50:53.000
Some kind of horrible apocalyptic economic and health collapse of their entire system.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
There's like a state of emergency.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Dan, that's what they want you to think.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
Just follow the money.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
Yeah, I don't know.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Yeah, I don't know what's going on in Venezuela.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
I don't think they're listening.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
I think something horrible has happened where they're in the dark ages.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Is anybody here legitimately into...

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Don't come up just because you want to be on stage.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Is anybody here into something like Flat Earth, Hollow Earth, Kamen Trails, stuff like that?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Really is a firm-ass believer?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
A firm-ass believer.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
A firm-ass...

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
You believe in firm-ass?

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
You believe when you get a nice tight ass.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
It just seems like a loaded thing.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
Like, yeah, somebody's going to go, oh, if I squint real hard, I can be into Bigfoot.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
And then they come up and they're like, there's a Bigfoot and we're like, really Bigfoot?

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
And they're like, okay, maybe medium-sized foot.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
And we're like, yeah.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
I'm proud of you guys for not volunteering. Thank you.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
I'm proud of you, Jeff, for asking, though.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
But also, I have nothing to talk about, so thank you for trying.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I'll let you down with that.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I'll let you down with that, Milly. I'm trying to help.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
Let's enter the... there's a new segment. It's called Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
Let me give you some... here.

52:07.000 --> 52:16.000
You got a barrel full of content

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
And you dip a ladle in

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
And nothing comes out.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
So you go lower. Okay.

52:25.000 --> 52:31.000
This is Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel, brought to you by Schrab's Momma's Pussy.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
So gross.

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
When you want someone's Momma's Pussy, you need more than the worst. You need the best.

52:41.000 --> 52:48.000
And if you can't get that, go to Schrab's Momma.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
What are we doing?

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
It's just not funny. It's not funny.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
It's not that funny.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
It's kind of cheap. It's not that funny.

53:00.000 --> 53:09.000
Well, I agree, technically, as a comedic craftsman, but at the same time, your attempt to high-road me is...

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
I just don't think it's that funny. It's not that funny. It's just not funny.

53:14.000 --> 53:22.000
We're still in the segment called Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel. This is a subsection of that called

53:22.000 --> 53:32.000
Things I could easily look up and have the answer to in one minute, but decided to write down and then ask on stage.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
How many you got?

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
One.

53:38.000 --> 53:44.000
Let's start with number one.

53:44.000 --> 53:50.000
This is the bottom of the barrel.

53:50.000 --> 53:57.000
You got that barrel.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Where does the word surcharge come from?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I don't know.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
Because if you say service charge, I'm going to ask you, why is it called SUR?

54:07.000 --> 54:12.000
I'm going to guess because it's the bottom of the thing. It's a charge they add to the bottom after all the things are tallyed.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
What's the SUR?

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
SUR is...

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
Wait, I heard too much at once.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Latin for under, bottom.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
What country is this again?

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Like a surreptitious man.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
The country of Latin?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
God, I hate him. I hate him so much.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I don't think so.

54:32.000 --> 54:41.000
Last time I checked, this was America.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Is it the same Latin?

54:43.000 --> 54:49.000
Your phone died. You can't use that. Your phone is dead. You're not allowed to use that as a bailout mechanism.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Stop. Stop it.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Do you want me to charge your phone so you can use that?

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
Would you really? I need to get home.

54:58.000 --> 55:06.000
That text message thing really got under your dandruff.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Are we allowed to know about this Chris Pratt meeting or what was going on there?

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Is he going to be a Lego?

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
Obviously it was just like, Chris Pratt was like, what's taking so long with the Lego movie?

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
You know, like what's going on? Should I even do the voice?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Maybe someone else would do the voice of the Legos.

55:22.000 --> 55:33.000
And they were like, why don't you go eat with Schrab? And then he's like, so anyways, can I get some more cantaloupe?

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
The Legos are going to be on a pirate ship this time.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
And he's like, okay.

55:39.000 --> 55:46.000
Because I can't hear the sound of you over the 800 million movies I should be doing right now.

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
Like if each of my pecs did one movie, that'd be two movies.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
Well, talk to me about Legos.

55:56.000 --> 56:06.000
Like tell me and you're like, wow, they snapped together and could I get another cantaloupe?

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
They're not called Legos.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
The company's called Lego.

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
Don't care. You're never going to be friends with anybody cooler than me.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
It sounds like he had brunch with one.

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
That doesn't make a friendship. That was my point. He's not friends with him. It's just a brunch.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
I think you're terrified that maybe one day he will find somebody cooler than you.

56:29.000 --> 56:35.000
In order for me to be terrified of that, there'd have to be something terrifying happening.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.000
Are you saying Rob's incapable of finding somebody cooler than you?

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
I'm just, yes, I am.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Yes, I am.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
So is it like sir, sir, like surreptitious?

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
No, like sir name.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
Sir name.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
Oh, on.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
On top of.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
Why did they just say that?

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Oh, it's like surretab.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
On the table. I always said I grew up in L.A. and speaking Spanish,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
under the table, that's like when you're drunk.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
I'm glad I asked. I should have looked it up, but I'm glad I asked.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
That's a great. Okay, I have no more of those.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
All right.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
And we got about 50 minutes left.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
I also heard that. What's going on in Venezuela?

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
Speaking of the French and us using their language,

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
supposedly the expression that's the ticket, like, yeah, that's the ticket.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
It comes from a bastardization of that's etiquette.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
French, like that's etiquette. That's the way you do it.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
And is it etiquette based on the word ticket?

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Oh, sorry, I interrupted your take.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
No, no, no.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
Is it etiquette based on the word ticket because they like would put up

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
manner signs like up at places and they'd be tickets.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
It's not funny in any way. Fairly entertaining.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Are you trying to flatter us this right now?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
No, no. That'd be amazing.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
If you just, it's a big loop.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
Anybody see the Civil War Land Civil War Man show?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Yeah.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
What's it? Civil War Man?

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
You see the Civil War Man under Ruse?

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Do we find out why he's calling him under Ruse?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
No.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Dan and Rob, didn't you write a movie called Civil War Land?

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
Yeah, but that's, it isn't ours.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
Who's Civil War Man in the movie?

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
John.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
Do you want to break out?

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
Okay, let's break out. Who considers himself the, like, like, like,

58:43.000 --> 58:48.000
like sort of a, you're, you're, you're a solid.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Yeah. Here we go.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
Feet on the earth, like, like, like, like, you, you went to see Civil War

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
and, and you, and you liked it and you're a big Marvel guy and like,

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
you just kind of, here.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
There's no shortage, no shortage.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I think the hand that went up first was over here.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Why don't you, you, you, you come up, are you willing to come up?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I, I just forgot to ask, are you willing to come up?

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
All right, so we've got a Civil War movie.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
What, what is your name, sir?

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Ben.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Ben?

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
Yeah.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Nice to meet you, Ben.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Ben.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
All right, so no spoilers.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Tell us the entire movie.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
But there probably aren't any spoilers to have, right?

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I mean, they're just, they're just superheroes.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
They're, they're super in the beginning.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
They, they stay relatively super.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
Is he, is he called Underoos in the beginning of the movie?

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
And then he, and he goes, actually it's Spider-Man.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
And I go, oh, I'm sorry.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
I must have, while the car was driving by, I heard Underoos.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
That's so weird.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
You're, you're, everybody is, I'm so embarrassed.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I gotta change my phone now.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Your name in the front.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
All right, he's hung up on the Underoos thing.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
I am, I am.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
It's weird.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And then some kids are playing with a Captain America toy while Black Panther's running through the garage, right?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
What?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
When were they playing with a toy?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You know, when they're running through the garage, Black Panther, it's in the trailer.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I'm assuming that, that scene is still in the movie, right?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Okay, so Black Panther and Captain America are running through the garage,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and then there's like a family and a, and a minivan or whatever, the mom and dad are talking or something like that.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Well, but why, but Rob, why wouldn't there be toys in a universe where the people actually existed when they're,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I guess they have firefighters.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Wait, the firefighter toys, is that what you're saying?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
You're saying that because we don't have firefighter action figures, which we do.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
No, no, no, I'm saying that I'm agreeing with you.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Yeah, so, okay.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Okay, well that's been around since the 80s, the idea that people, that the,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Army men?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Well, no, that's the meta concept of like, oh, if there's a, in a sequel, like, like,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Oh, the people exist in the real world, and then they have the toys, the merchandising.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I don't remember ever seeing that.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
It happens in like every fucking, like,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Name two.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I don't know, man.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Like it, I can't, okay.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I know I can name one, but there'd be like a five minute gap and everyone would get up and leave.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Then don't, then don't.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
That's been, all right.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
So a good movie, Civil War?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Oh yeah, I really enjoyed it.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I've seen it twice now.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Who's side are you on?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Well, I'm always on the side of Captain America because he generally has the most like straightforward logic.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Like Iron Man is a little bit more selfish.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You know, he's out for a lot more, his own agenda type of thing.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So yeah, he agrees.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But I have to say that the first time I saw Civil War, I saw it in this thing, a 4DX.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Have you guys?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
No, what's 4DX?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Okay, so it's this thing that they're trying to, like they're trying to do like the Dolby Atmos and all that kind of stuff.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
But in this, they have chairs that literally like move with the movie, like all the way around.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Like not just like just a little bit.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
What?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Where was it?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Around, like up and down.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
No, where was the place?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Oh, where did I go?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Someone said, where did you go?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Then he said around.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Oh my God.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Cinema.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It was at the Regal Cinema.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But it's this.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
No, where did the chairs move?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Did it go left and right?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I'm sorry.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Did they shake or what?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I don't know the address.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But they shake and move, but the worst part of it is like that.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
So they also blow smoke in your face and water and shit.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And then when people get punched, they literally punch you in the back.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Wait, shut up.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
No, I'm not even joking.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Is this how you saw the movie?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Or what are you?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That's how I saw the movie.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
What?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Yeah.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
What?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
They're just physically abusing people?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It's like a carnival line?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
It's the worst thing ever.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I thought it would be cool.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Wait, human beings come and punch you?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So that's why you want to see it twice, because you were like, how about not knocking my ass

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
around?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And I'll just have some popcorn.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I enjoyed it a lot more the second time.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Hold up, Ben.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Everybody in the theater gets a punch in the back by another human being.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It's by the chair.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
No, it's the chair.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
It's all mechanical.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It works there, named Douglas.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
People work for the theater.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Okay.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
So you're getting like the Bugs Life treatment where there's, you know, this thing.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
But you don't really mean...

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Exactly like that.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
There you are.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000
So at a point where you were, it's actually kidney throttling you, like, is it really

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.200
literally like a character in the movie is getting punched, or is it like we're going

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.280
off a cliff, or does something exploded?

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.400
It happens for a bunch of different things.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.120
Is there any fucking in the movie?

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120
I wish.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120
You can tell...

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120
No?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120
There isn't?

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120
No, not...

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.120
It's a Disney movie.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120
So.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.120
Okay.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.840
By the way, he calls him under risk, because, you know, it's like he's wearing like his

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.120
stuff is made out of underpants.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120
But he made that.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.120
That would be stupid.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.120
I thought he did.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.120
He doesn't make it, though.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120
Iron Man made his suit for him.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.120
That's what I'm saying.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.800
So now he's calling him out by the under...

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.240
That sounds like if I gave you a T-shirt, and I was like, hey, T-shirt, you motherfucker.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240
Yes.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.440
It's like, that's your T-shirt.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.240
You put that on me so you can insult me with it?

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.240
That's terrible.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240
That's like a Monopoly guy.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240
Under...

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.680
Underoos is a product, right.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.960
And he's calling it under...

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.480
Underoos is a product that was in the late 70s that would have like Spider-Man's symbol

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:35.200
on it, and Batman's symbol on it, and he's calling him Underoos, right.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.360
That's Iron Man's style.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.760
He like gives everyone a nickname.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.760
At one point, he calls...

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.960
Dude, I fucking know that.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.440
Yeah, but Schrab, what are you...

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.480
Is Iron Man saying that?

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.720
He's referencing a thing that went out of style like decades ago.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720
Yeah.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720
That's how long...

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.120
Known for like Spider-Man underwear, so he's had to merchandise it since the 70s?

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120
No.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120
Oh, your time...

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.440
Oh, so you're saying that Spider-Man...

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.440
You're thinking that he's time referencing Spider-Man like his own branding?

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.120
His brand of under-roos is what he's saying.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.120
He's looking at him when he's talking to him, right?

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.880
But you're connecting a dot there that I don't think is...

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.000
It's like not all under-roos are Spider-Man under-roos.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Yeah.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So there's Batman under-roos.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So he's going...

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.880
He's like long johns.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.280
Because there's Batman under-roos.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280
Yeah.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280
Spider-Man under-roos.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.280
No.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.640
Because you got a bat on your chest, and you're wearing a gray shirt.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.640
No, it's like tights.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.640
Hey, tights.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.640
Hey, man, who's wearing tights?

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.640
Hey, asshole.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640
That I understand.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640
It's like that, but it's under-roos.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640
But when the...

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.640
Doesn't make sense.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.640
Captain America all the time, because these were in tights.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.920
You're just connecting a dot that they're not connecting for that reason.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.200
It doesn't make sense.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200
It does.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.720
No, it doesn't.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.720
Hello Earth.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:47.400
Are you going to go see it in the movie, at theater or thing?

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.520
Do you want to go watch it with me?

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.040
If you take the seat that punches you in the kidney, I don't want to get...

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.800
We can just go see it regularly, right?

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.040
I don't have to have smoke blown in my face.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.560
My favorite is just seeing it in AMC Prime, because it's really comfy seats, and then they

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.360
have the Dolby Actress, which is enough technology for me.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.600
That's Amazon Prime.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.760
Hey, you know, the guys that directed that movie, they used to direct my show, Community.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760
Oh, really?

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760
Yeah.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.560
You know, they got that job that way.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.400
They showed us the paintball episode.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.760
I don't know why I'm angry.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760
They reference Community.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760
Where's Mike?

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760
Give me a superhero.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.120
There's a Community reference in Civil War.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.600
Well, do you mean Dean Jim Rasheson?

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600
He is the reference.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
Yeah.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.760
It was a very brief cameo, and I was like, oh my God.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.960
I launch a lot of stars, kid.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.960
Underroos are a t-shirt and briefs.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.240
There's no leggings.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.560
There's no armings.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.560
There's no gloves.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.240
There's no hood.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.040
There's t-shirt and briefs.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.800
And sometimes, Wonder Woman, Batman's Spider-Man was a popular one.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800
Doesn't make sense.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.800
Underroos.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800
I'm sorry.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800
It doesn't make sense.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.880
I will say it was a weird area, but I also can't say I could put my money where my mouth

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.920
is as far as what Tony Stark should yell out when calling the Spider-Man.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.360
Spider-Man!

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.440
It's on the cover of this comic book that apparently probably exists in this universe

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440
too.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.520
No, he does, he does like question his name.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.280
Why is his eyes squint?

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.800
It's the robot.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.800
Yeah.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.120
Tony Stark made his suit.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.720
He custom-made it, and there's a part where he's talking about the goggles that he wears,

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.720
and they really obscure your vision, but because his senses are so heightened, they actually

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.120
help him see better.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.400
So I believe Tony Stark made them so that they adjust to his eyes.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.440
So they get squint to give him an expression.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.600
So is this version of Spider-Man, does he have web shooters?

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600
Yeah, he has web shooters.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.160
He made the stuff himself.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.400
So Peter Parker in this version of the Marvel Universe is, in addition to getting bit by

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:04.360
a radioactive spider, also is so smart that he can make web shooters.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.680
Yeah, and that's what actually what makes their relationship really work well in the

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.680
movie.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.680
Because they're both geniuses.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.440
Except one of them is a superhero because he's a genius, the other one is a superhero

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.520
because he's a genius, and also got bit by a spider.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.680
Here's another thing.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.960
Here's another thing.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.640
So he got bit by a spider, and he got all the powers of a spider, he can crawl up walls,

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.320
he's super strong, he can be telepathic, but he can't shoot webs.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.320
Right.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.320
So with the spider, the spiders know they're doing it.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:42.080
How come I can walk on walls and know when danger is coming, ah, typical spider shit.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.600
I'm connecting this dot to that spider that bit me, and as such, I'm gonna use my previously

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.120
untapped ability to create military-grade weaponry.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.000
I mean, that was like, the comic book, it was fine, but I really, I'm just saying, like,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.520
I thought that was like in this world where the movie industry takes comic book properties

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.400
that we love and kind of like demystifies them and like tries to jerk itself off for

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.640
making everything real.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.640
That's nanobots.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.400
That's not just a magical comet.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.320
That's why you're made of stone and she can turn invisible.

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.920
It's like nanotechnology.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:20.320
But one of the rare instances of, I thought, was, you know, the decision to make Peter

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:26.280
Parker just a puberty myth and have him have, like, he mutated and he's shooting like fucking

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280
shit out of his wrists.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:28.280
I thought that was cool.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280
Makes sense.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280
Makes sense.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280
That all comes from the movies, I believe.

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280
Right.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280
The, what's his name?

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280
Toby McGuire.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.280
Yeah, Toby McGuire.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.280
That's what I'm saying.

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.560
I'm being an old man and saying like, I love, I love, no, Toby McGuire spider man.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.560
That's what I'm doing.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.920
I'm saying, I thought that was a cool instance.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:50.520
I wasn't like jumping up and going, in the comic book, he invents, you know, like weird,

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.240
like the stuff with the tensile strength of steel that you could shoot, like the idea

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.800
that a kid could do that.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.400
And then also that's the kid that got bit by a radioactive spider.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.320
Is it true that he could shoot out of his feet, too, in this one?

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.320
If he built a machine for it, they never, they never expressed that at any point.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.320
He might be able to shoot one out of his ass.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320
Yes.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320
Who's your favorite?

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320
Who's, do you have a favorite?

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.320
Oh, come on.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
Oh, sorry.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320
I missed.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320
Hashtag hotfarts.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320
Come on.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320
I missed.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320
I missed off on that.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320
Come on.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320
Oh.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.320
Oh, Ben.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.320
Spiders do it, though.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.320
Oh, Ben.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320
Oh, Ben.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320
Come on.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320
Oh, Ben.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.920
Maybe Spider-Man got bit by a spider that doesn't actually create silk.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.800
Do all, do all spiders spin silk?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.800
No, but you're, you're misunderstanding.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800
You're transless.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800
I don't think.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.960
I'm saying that, I'm not going to keep, it's, I'm saying that I thought it was a clean,

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.960
nice simplification to say, why don't you get all the powers from the Spider-Bite?

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.960
Right.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.960
I agree.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960
Not, not have to have one.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.080
In comic book, in that age of comic books, it was like fine.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.920
It was like, like, that's the point of comic books was like punk rock to be like, like,

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.760
okay, and then he made these things and he doesn't think.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.280
When Tony Stark is seeing Spider-Man, is that the first time he's, they've ever met?

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.760
He's been watching him a bit closely, but it was the first time I met him personally.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.760
Yeah.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760
This is the origin.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760
It's really kind of creepy if you think about it.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.760
It's the origin of Spider-Man then, right?

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760
Yeah.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.760
Well, yeah.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.080
So Tony Stark is aware of a product called Underoos, but didn't know that Spider-Man was

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.080
one of the lions in the 70s.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.080
Oh my God.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:30.360
I think they're going, it's like a slightly alternate universe, like where like the superheroes,

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.440
this is the first time they've ever existed, but like the, all like the products and things

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.360
that we like know and care about still like have happened.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.360
Just without like branding of those characters.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:53.560
A person has volunteered that DC Comics exists in the, well, yeah, because there's the, well,

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.560
and vice versa, right?

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.200
Because there's the joke of, oh, I'm sorry, no, not vice versa, that Toby McGuire movie

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.360
when she says, well, you're not Superman, right?

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360
You're not, okay.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.240
Anyways, the, the, the, what's your favorite, who's your favorite guy?

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
Tony Stark?

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.240
Putting words in my mouth.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240
Uh, yeah.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:18.680
No, I, I mean, like, honestly, Iron Man is the most fun to watch, I think, but, uh, Captain

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.680
America has the best movies.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:25.720
Why do you think it is that, well, yeah, why, why do you think it is that like, like, what,

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:32.880
so if you look at, uh, Batman as folklore, like he's a guy who was born rich, uh, he

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.280
had tragedy before him.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.680
He's like, he's a philanthropist, he's a playboy, he's a billionaire.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.400
He uses his money to make a bunch of shit.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.240
It's like the obvious parallels, Iron Man, like that's the big thing, Marvel, like, even

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.520
though he's not the most super, what do you, do you, do you, have you thought about that?

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.560
Do you, do you think, what, why do you think the, why do we like the superhero characters

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.040
that we like in America?

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.480
What, what, it's okay if you haven't thought about it.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.960
Oh yeah, no, I, I've totally thought about this, uh, especially cause like, a lot of

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.240
people like Batman, uh, the best and Iron Man is obviously like, uh, a very like close

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.720
equivalent, but I think the, one of the reasons why people like Batman better is cause he's

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.240
like a lot darker and like has a lot more like intrigue in his past.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:19.600
But we like the guys who aren't super, even from DC, even to Marvel, it's like we like

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:25.280
the not decidedly non super superheroes, like the superhero got invented, but then we settled

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:33.120
into, well, I like, I like this, but we can't, we can't have, I, I, I dated a, a, a, a victim

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.560
that, uh, uh, was, uh, had a, getting her PhD, nobody even laughed because they're like,

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.960
yes, everyone you date is a victim.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.000
I dated a young lady who, uh, uh, who was full of light when I met her and, uh, and

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.920
was getting her master, had her master's was getting her PhD in media studies and she

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.480
indoctrinated me into this concept of American mythology being, having this really specific

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.840
slant and hero mythology where we like, we can't decide between the outlaw hero and

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.160
the righteous hero.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.680
So in Deadwood, that swear engine and Timothy Ali, uh, character, I can't remember, it's

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.960
I, my brain is Swiss cheese because I'm more of an outlaw hero, but it's like we, we need

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:15.400
our, we love, we love our Han Solo with our Skywalker, like we, it's like caviar on the

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.800
cracker, like we want to, so it's, but, so what I can't figure out is, is that, is that

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:24.560
why we love in comic book mythology, sure we love the fantasy of a guy getting really

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.560
so mad he can turn green and then he can fucking do all this shit that we want to do

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.560
at the bank.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.560
But they can't make a good Hulk movie.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.600
They can't make a good movie out of it because what we really like, ultimately the thing

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.000
that passes hands through all these studios and things, we like, we like rich people because

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.840
we don't want to be, we don't want to be socialists for God's sake.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:50.400
Like we want to, we like rich dudes that are playboys, but then that also decide, what am

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400
I doing with my life?

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.440
I'm going to, I should be out there fighting for truth and justice and they use all their

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.800
money to make like, like stuff and then they beat people up.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.400
So because we don't want to let go of the American dream, which is that one day we're

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.400
going to be Bruce Wayne.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.400
Yeah.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.160
Well, it's still putting someone above you like a God type figure.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.520
But it's also saying like, but it's a fantasy fulfillment.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.560
We don't want to have a, when we, when we do fantasy fulfillment, we don't, we don't,

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.800
we don't imagine ourselves as John Henry, like, we only go like, I want to race a steam engine

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.800
and then die trying.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.680
Like, like, like that's my guy.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.680
You know who I love?

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680
Jesus Christ.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.360
I woke up one morning said, I'm going to cause it like I see it got nailed to a tree.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.680
I love him.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.000
I got him on all my T shirts.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
But it's like, it's like Batman.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.280
He's like, it goes and breaks your spine because his parents got killed in an alley

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.280
and he's like, why me?

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:45.400
And we're like, that's my man be, and I think, I do, I do, I do think it's because it's,

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.960
they have to be rich because not only does that make it feasible for them to do the things

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.720
that they do, but also we have a fixation in our country where we're like, we don't want

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.160
to fetishize the poor.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.560
We want to believe, we don't want to give up on the idea that we're, we're entitled to

01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560
become rich.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.560
Capitalism, capitalism works.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:07.400
So, so, so if there was like a superhero comic that was like, poor man, and it was like,

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:16.440
like, like one day his parents got killed from malnutrition and he decided to put a trash

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:25.120
can lid on his chest and grab a heavy object and go out and fight the real injustice, property.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:31.200
And we would all be like, no, that's terrorism, that's terrible.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.800
It sounds like a Bernie Sanders campaign commercial.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.440
There's a guy with a Bernie shirt there.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440
I'm playing to my...

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.920
Why, why do you, why do you think people like Batman over Iron Man?

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.920
Wait, do they?

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.920
That's what he said.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.680
Oh, well, no, you never said that.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.680
Ben, don't let him put words in your mouth.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.200
I mean, I kind of did, but I didn't...

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.200
Is that Batman?

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.200
Well, Batman don't...

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.960
I hear more people talk about Batman than Iron Man, but especially like the comic book

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.520
version of Batman, because the comic book version, at least up until recently, was

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.360
more interesting, the version of Batman than the comic book version of Iron Man, because

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.400
he was just kind of a rich guy and he didn't have like...

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.840
Iron Man was like, waiting in the wings.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.120
I always loved him, I loved him before, and then I swear to God, I swear to God, he was

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.520
my pixies.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.440
And then Robert Downey Jr. was cast, and it was like, holy shit, but it was also like...

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.360
It kind of coincided with like, well, people my age were like rooting for Robert Downey

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.880
Jr. in a meta sense, it was like, it's a perfect like coalition, or whatever you call it, something,

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:43.480
something with the word co in front of it, and he did great, but that was a recent thing.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:48.840
Iron Man was like, he was handed through different studios and television shows and mediums,

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:56.400
and he just kept enduring, because all he really does is, well, I mean, the things that

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.760
kept accruing as that myth was handed through different studios are the things that popped

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:08.200
for us, like, like, like, it was, it was weird that the Batmobile was part of this mythology

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:13.800
and not part of that, and like, but whatever sticks, it sticks, and then, I don't care,

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.640
I'm boring myself.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.880
Batman's older, he's more like Paul Bunyan, he's closer to being folklore mythology.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.520
Iron Man is like a straight handoff from a comic book property to cinematic property,

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.600
where they nailed it, and now we're really into it, but really what he is, is he's Marvel's

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.600
Batman.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.600
I'm not a comic book guy at all.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.200
Are there any like, awesome, like, women, like, superheroes that you know?

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.200
Yeah, there is.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.200
Nah, nah, nah.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:40.800
Not a single one, are you flattering my question right now?

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.040
No, no, no, there just aren't any women superheroes.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.040
No, there are, are there other ones?

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.200
No, no.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.200
Ben says yes.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.200
Yeah, well the...

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.200
There's Wonder Man.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.200
Wonder Woman, obviously.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.400
Do you have a favorite, do you have a favorite woman?

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.400
Big Red?

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400
Jean Grey.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.720
I like Big Red because the cinnamon flavor was so powerful.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.240
I like She-Hulk actually, she's the lady version of the Hulk.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240
I always thought she was pretty.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240
And a lawyer.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:21.320
Yeah, she's a lawyer and she shows up as the Hulk.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.800
She hulks out in order to defend supervillains, right?

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.280
Yeah, not supervillains, but like, maybe she does, I don't know, I've never read the ones

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.600
where she shows up as the lawyer.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:38.320
All I know is that she like, she got the powers because she was the Hulk's cousin, I think.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.440
And she got into a horrible car accident and she could only live because Bruce Banner was

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.120
the one who had the correct blood type, so he donated his blood and she got the powers

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:56.800
and then was, she liked it, she's like, she's okay with being the Hulk.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.120
But she was already a lawyer before this happened or did she go past the bar as the

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120
Hulk?

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.680
She went, if it's not already comic book line, I would love that.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680
Yeah.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.000
All right, well, I'm going to try to, okay, so Ben, anything you're plugging, you got

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
a new tap dance special coming up for a book you've written?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.800
I actually do, I actually do.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.520
I'm working on my thesis project for school.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.600
You don't need to plug those, but I've got an Indiegogo for it and no one's donating

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600
to it.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.320
Well, I don't understand, your thesis, you need funding?

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.320
Yeah.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320
Have we really gotten that bad?

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:36.040
I thought we just eliminated arts education from grade schools, I didn't know college

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.200
kids were now going, I need, I want to write a thesis about...

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.040
It's going on a really expensive vacation.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.680
It's a short film, it's a, I'm making a, it's a Modern Day Western.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.600
Okay, so you have an Indiegogo, we'll tell them about it and then they'll let them go

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.600
check it out.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.080
Yeah, sure, it's, the project's called Guns Don't Lie, it's a Modern Day Western where

01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:06.040
these two guys like who like idolize the Western, who idolize the whole Western mythos and everything

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.200
dress up as cowboys and pull off a train robbery and then modern technology and stuff gets

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.200
in the way.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.200
Alright.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.560
You can find it on the Indiegogo, just type in Guns Don't Lie.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560
Guns Don't Lie.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560
Alright, thank you Ben for...

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560
Thank you.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.560
Ben also...

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:26.560
Did you notice that Ben around his wrists...

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.280
I was going to ask, Ben you have a series of, it's too late now, you have a lot of,

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:36.320
like, will look like band bracelets, like you got, would you, you come back from...

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.920
I'd like, I'd rather speculate about it.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:43.040
I think he's so young that he's, he's been to that many places in the last week.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.080
Are they all from clubs, bars, like bands, things like that?

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:56.160
Like a Scissors convention, that's for sure.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.160
Shots fired.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:12.440
Alright, well, what I was going to suggest is like, because I'm zeroing it, like what

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:19.320
if we created a, because I figure if a guy's a billionaire, and then he has, like, technology

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:24.520
and he uses it to fight crime, and gets bit by something, no, you're wrong, no, take the

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.800
bite away, gets hit by something.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:37.560
We could create a new superhero mythologies and cash in, but also that's just, I mean,

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.000
that's just me trying to fill.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.800
I got Game of Thrones to watch, we could cut it early.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.680
Do you know the only comic book that I ever read, cover to cover?

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.680
Skud.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:56.240
Dan, did you ever read Skud, cover to cover?

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.560
What was, what was the deal with that bad guy in the beginning?

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.280
Whatever happens to him, he doesn't really come back, yeah.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.760
He came back in the last four.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.120
What happened?

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.880
Got his legs cut off.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.880
Why?

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.040
Fucked with Ben Franklin.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.120
It's a great comic series.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:24.280
Any of you guys follow the Vine account?

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.520
What is it, Amazing Talent?

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.480
Amazing Talent?

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.880
Schrab sends me all these, Schrab sends me these vines.

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.880
Anybody see, it's amazing.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.880
It's amazing.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.720
But I can't believe the amount of people that this planet is generating that are

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.720
falling.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.720
It's amazing.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720
It's heaven.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720
Vine is amazing.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.920
I fully support it.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.000
You can swipe through and it's just people getting hit with things and falling.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.160
I don't like the, we don't like the, you know, if it looks like they really got hurt.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.400
I don't like those either.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.840
Nothing's funnier than people falling down and not getting hurt.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.400
I don't like when they actually get hurt.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.240
When I was at USC, I was sitting on the graph reading a book and it was kind of a lazy day,

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.800
like school wasn't in session and I heard footsteps that sounded like high heels.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.200
And I look up and there's this young girl, I got a lot of books and she just like trucking

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.680
down the cobblestones at USC and she's really moving.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.920
She got to be somewhere.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.320
And she just hit the ground like a mousetrap closing and books everywhere.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.800
I was like, oh, like, do I have to call 911?

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.760
Like I was getting, I was getting up to go see if she needed any help.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.760
But she got up and she was fine.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:33.360
She dusted herself off and I was like, ah, as adults, wiping out is the best.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.560
I don't know how to like, like I get a vine from Schrab and it's always some crazy thing

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.120
and then crazy.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.120
Okay.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.640
And I, I, I, I swipe, if I swipe in different directions and get different results, but

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.800
I don't know what's happening.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.280
I feel like I'm, I'm in a dungeon crawler like, like, like game where I'm just like

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.440
swiping and then like go ahead and like, how come, and I don't understand why if the account

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:59.480
is like Latino people be like, and then, and then it's like, but it's just dogs falling

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.840
downstairs or like a guy farting at an ear of corn and it's like, there's nothing Latino

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840
happening.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.480
But, but, but like that account, I guess maybe got popular and it was like people, we need

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:15.200
to aggregate the, I don't know, but I'm swiping and I don't know what I'm following and what

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.000
I'm browsing, but I know I love vine.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.520
But I, but the weird thing is that most of them are comedically based.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.960
Most of them are based on the six second kind of orgasm of like, you're watching something

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.360
and then something's going to happen.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.000
But then it's like a certain percentage of them are like, there's this one that's like,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.640
I think it's called amazing talent or something like that.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:44.680
And it's just, it's mostly just teenage girls, it's singing.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.420
But there's no irony that a basket, you keep waiting for a basketball to fly in a clobber

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:54.880
room because you're, you're like in this vine traumatic stress disorder mode and you're

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.720
like, wait, wait, so then it's just a girl singing kind of well for six seconds.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:05.200
Like, like, oh, yeah, no, well, that's not a good example that doesn't, they sing well.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.800
But then the caption is just like, oh, she sings so well.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.880
But then it's like, they just keep popping up and it's like, I realized today, I think,

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.400
I think about 40% of the public sings well.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:20.240
And I don't think it's a, I don't think we can call it a talent anymore.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240
Sorry.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.800
I know, I think it's, I think it's, it's like being double jointed or, or, or, or people

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:34.960
like me who like the smell of skunk, like, I think just like 40% of us can carry a tune.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960
Rob, do you sing?

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.080
And I don't, I don't know if you should, I don't know if you should think of it as being

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.080
talented.

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:49.760
I'm just worried, I'm just worried because they're usually singing another person's

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.920
song and they're not playing an instrument and I'm just worried about these young ladies.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.440
I believe that they think you should do that and you should like make, make a chair.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.000
If you're listening to me out there, like, I'm just worried.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.120
You want you to bury your dreams and start making him chairs.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.160
Make Dan Harmon a chair and stop being such a singer.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.560
So when I used to do a vine, do you watch it immediately?

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560
No.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.640
Do you watch it at all?

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.640
Yes.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.200
Okay, all right, so, so when you don't respond, I shouldn't send it again.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.600
What am I supposed to type, ha?

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.480
Viiiing a palooza.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.000
You don't have to, but you know, friendship, I feel like you guys are getting closer before

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
our very eyes.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.400
I feel like it's like you keep, like I think you guys are, it's, it's, it's, it's fake

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.160
to pretend that you guys don't really love each other.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.160
That's right.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160
Sure.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.160
I'm doing my half.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.160
I'm doing it.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:58.400
No, I keep him around because he's confusing, like to me, like I'm going like, what is he

01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.400
doing?

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400
What does he mean?

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.600
But hasn't that always been the case since you guys were youngsters?

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.800
No, I used to, I used to, you know, we were like the two musketeers and then we, and then

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.600
like, like, but now we're really old.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.080
I think our brains are dying and I'm just like, I feel like we're both just like the

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.680
rocking, the rocking chairs of life and like it's getting really funny.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.520
But I'm also like really confused.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.320
I think I'm, I'm not putting on a character when I'm like, what are you talking about?

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.320
Why did you do that today?

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.720
But he's, but Rob's, oh, you've always been like this, Rob.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.720
I feel like, yeah.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.720
No, he's, no, no, it's not true.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.720
He's changed.

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.720
And so have I.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.200
No, he's always been this weird, always.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.600
I don't call it weird.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.280
I wouldn't, I wouldn't call it weird.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.560
There's always some prolonged, huge macro bit going on.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.360
That's always been the case since I've known you guys.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.760
Well, I don't know, man.

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.000
You wouldn't, you wouldn't want to live in a world without it?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:06.760
No, I, look, I, I'm just trying to express, I'm saying like what you see is what you

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.760
get.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.120
Maybe you've lost something inside yourself that you forgot how to translate, Rob's,

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.080
you know, unique qualities into, into what's important to you.

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.840
It's you that's changed, Dan.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.360
I'm, I, I never doubted that.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.880
Yeah, yeah, no, I, yeah, sure.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880
Yeah, sir.

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.880
It's all right.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:24.880
We've gotten very old.

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.440
Did you, did you, did you ever see the vine where there's like the old guy and it hit

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:32.560
like somewhere in Europe and he's like talking to the, it's all foreign language.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.480
But then another old guy like comes out in the background and he goes like meow.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.080
They're like really old.

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:46.520
I always think like that, that could be us, like one day, like on camera and then like

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:50.240
the other guy's going meow, meow and the other guy's like, what are you, what are you, because

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.440
the other guy actually doesn't react.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:56.600
I put my will together, uh, finally, like I finally put, I like hired like a lawyer

01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:02.480
to get like my will together and I put, and, and, and like he came over to our house and

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:08.880
we're going through and he, and he goes, and so, um, if you're like on life support, you're

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:14.400
getting, and, and something God forbid happens to Kate, who do you want to be in charge of

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.280
pulling the plug on, on you if, if, if, if that happens.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.040
And I said, he's looking at his phone right now.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:33.360
And then I said, and I said, I said, Dan Harmon and Kate goes, oh, what the fuck really?

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:43.440
And I go, I go, if, if something after, I mean, you get, you get first dibs on me to

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:48.880
pull the plug, but if you're God forbid something happens to you, Dan's, Dan's in charge.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:54.720
And I, I don't know, I, I, and I said this to, to her with the lawyer who I'm paying

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:59.600
a lot of money to do this, I go, it's just going to be really funny.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:13.000
See, Dan, Dan has always lived, Dan's going to be like, ah, he's going to get Steve.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
He's going to make Steve Levy

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
He come over and do it.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Yeah.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Yeah.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
That's okay.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.400
I'm just picturing like Kate's, Kate's on vacation when it, it happens or something

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400
like that.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.880
And I'm like calling her and going like, are we going to pull the plug or not?

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.200
Like, she's like, it's my, it's my saying, I'm like, yeah, but you're not here.

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.600
Uh, I don't know.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.600
Yeah.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.680
Let's say I did it already.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.000
Would you be upset?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:44.560
The guy in charge of the plug was a Rick and Morty fan and I, we were taking pictures

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.560
of them.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:53.120
We were taking pictures of me pretending to pull the plug and I didn't know if you plugged

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.120
it back in.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.120
It wouldn't just turn back on.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.480
It reboots and I didn't have the password and just make, what's the password?

01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.480
That's what I'm saying.

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:02.840
Kate, what's the password for his heart and lung machine?

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:06.640
Is it too late to make an addendum to, to your will and say that not only is Dan the

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:11.000
guy that does it just in case, but it has to be rigged up so it's an actual plug into

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
a wall.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Yeah.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.320
I want, I'm like, yeah, that's going to be my living will is like, if you're going to

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:24.600
put me out, I want an actual plug and I want, I want the local, the local lions club to

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:31.240
have to like pose and like it's a tug of war during a pancake, but also it's on a big

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240
power strip.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.240
Like, is it the gray one or the big brown one?

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:37.280
Hey, who's messing with the air conditioning in here?

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.720
Or you could do, yeah, it was like, we spent so much time thinking about like the terms

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:46.080
of our, yeah, the terms of your actual like, like, like, or they haven't been like a doomsday

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:50.840
clock and make it just characterize it as if like, as you switch Dan Harmon to off the

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:55.640
world goes to shit, like, you know, there's like sunshine and cows and then it like, there's

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.640
like a midnight point in the middle as it goes from on to off, you know, picturing what

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.640
I'm picturing.

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:01.640
I gotcha.

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.680
And there's like, you know, devils and Sauron and stuff on the thing.

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:08.760
It's like Dan Harmon off and it's like, okay, here we go.

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:13.320
Like, let's, we voluntarily enter a world of darkness.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.360
Do you have, have you made a will then?

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.000
I don't, I don't think so.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.160
Well, you would probably have to have been there.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.160
Yeah.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.160
You probably would know.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.160
Yeah.

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:23.160
It's not something you can knock out.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.160
Yeah.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.160
Steve, did you, did you make me a will, Steve?

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.160
Okay.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.160
Spencer?

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.840
Well, I noticed when you make, we had the, the, the, the restaurant reservations tonight

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.160
and it was under, under Levy, not Harmon.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.440
So I'm just wondering if you made the will and it was like under Levy, not Harmon.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440
Yeah.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440
Oh, damn.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.040
You gotta, you gotta stay vigilant.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.040
These kids.

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:49.040
Does he have like power of attorney over you as he, as he, as he was, I bet he does.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:55.960
I just wish that he just disappeared and you're like, wait, all my money's gone, Steve, Steve.

01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:02.400
But that would be, if Steve Levy cleaned me out and disappeared tomorrow, I would, that's

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.520
money well spent.

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.040
You got, you got to go ahead, buddy.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.160
I always tell, I tell us both, but I've said that to you many times, right?

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.040
Like acting as my assistant, like, like whenever you have to get like cash or petty cash.

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.040
Not in so many words, but yeah.

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.960
But I go like, take something off the, imbecile, for God's sake, like, like, because if I don't

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.440
notice, then it's fine.

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.440
Yeah.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.440
Then you deserve it or something.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.440
Right.

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:27.440
Right.

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.960
Because if it's possible for you to take, if I have so much money that you can take

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:36.400
something I don't notice, then have some because I could die any minute, take my money.

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:43.200
Not you, but, but I'm like, I hear, I'm kind of like a Batman or Iron Man.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.320
Well you clearly love Iron Man.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.320
You keep bringing that up.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.120
You, you, you, you, you identify with the Tony Stark character, right?

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:54.360
Well, I, like, yeah, but I, I, I fight, I fight, I fight, I fight, I fight my own, I

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.320
fight the forces of my own discomfort.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.320
Glurp.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.320
Glurp.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.320
Glurp.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:05.320
No, that was me doing comic strip, like, glurps, glurps.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.320
Sound effects.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.320
What's Iron Man's Lex Luthor?

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.320
Oh.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.320
It's a hammer, right?

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.320
The hammer man?

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.320
No, hammer.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.320
What's his name?

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.320
Hammer.

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:19.720
His problem, his problem is that people steal his suits and then he's like, oh no, that's

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:20.720
my whole deal.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.320
Oh, see, I relate, I relate to that character.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.320
Wait, who, uh, what?

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.320
Somebody, somebody comes in to steal my suits?

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.320
No, for sure you can Tony Stark.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.320
I'll fucking, I'll go crazy, yeah, leave my suits alone.

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.320
Honestly.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.320
I have terrible nightmares about people fucking up my suits.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.320
But if I identified with anybody, the most would be Lex Luthor, I think, like, like, I,

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320
but it's not me.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320
Me?

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.320
Oh.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320
Me.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.320
Okay.

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320
Because Lex Luthor hates Superman.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.320
Iron Man doesn't hate anybody.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.320
Who would you cast Rob as if you had to cast him as a DC or Marvel kind of?

01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:00.320
Gotta go, like, I got definitely, like, getting an Aquaman vibe from him.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.320
I feel like.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.320
How about Spencer?

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.320
Uh, for sure, like, uh, like, uh, like, uh, Tron.

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.320
No, Tron.

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320
Famous superhero.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.320
How about me?

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320
Who'd you cast me as?

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:22.320
You, I think you, you would make a good Black Panther.

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.320
Are they political?

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.320
Why is he a Black Panther?

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.320
Are they just actually Black Panther?

01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.320
I don't know.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.320
I don't like the sound of it, though.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.320
That's why I haven't gone, because I don't see in that, you know, to that lens.

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.320
Schrab looks like Professor Xavier.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.320
Yeah.

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320
I mean, looks like.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.320
He's got the eyebrows.

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:45.320
Who'd you cast Dave Kline as?

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.320
Dave Kline.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.320
Oh, Dave Kline.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.320
Well, he's Thor, right?

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.320
I mean.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.320
He's Sabertooth.

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.320
But are we going with, like, physical looks?

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:55.320
Like, I would say, if I was going to get serious, I would say, okay, Schrab.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.320
Essence-wise.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.320
Essence-wise.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.320
Schrab would be, like, uh, Schrab is, like, he's definitely a villain.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.320
Like, he's like, uh, he's like a Mr. Missile Slacker.

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320
Like, uh.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.320
Dustin said the Riddler from Backstage.

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.320
Yeah, that's good.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.320
Yeah.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.320
Oh.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.320
Yeah.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.320
Sorry, Steve said it.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.320
See?

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320
Yeah.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320
He's stealing Dustin's lens now.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320
Yeah, that's good.

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.320
That's fine.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.320
The Riddler.

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.320
This doesn't seem fruitful.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.320
I don't know.

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.320
Hey, man, we're just making our way in the world.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.320
You okay, then?

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.320
No.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.320
Do you get a little high?

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.320
We're trying.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.320
I'm like Truman Capote on.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.320
No, maybe you became kind of, like, cute and smiley and rolly pole.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.320
Well, I was just running out the clock.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.320
I mean, it really just turns out I didn't really have anything to talk about tonight.

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.320
These people didn't.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320
These people didn't come here to watch you run out the clock.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320
They came here for high grade entertainment.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320
No, I know.

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.320
I'm trying to figure out how to make it.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.320
Give these people entertainment.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.320
I want to.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.320
I do want to.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.320
I don't want to.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.320
I want it to be.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.320
Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice.

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:05.320
Hey, Iron Man.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:09.320
Check out what's going on on Vine.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:13.320
Bring it up on the screen, computer.

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.320
Check this one out.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.320
If you swipe left.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.320
I'm going to eat this donut so.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.320
You motherfucker.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.320
I'm going to eat this donut so.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.320
Breathe it.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.320
Enhance.

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.320
Enhance more.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:34.320
Enhance even more.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.320
Oh, back up a bit.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.320
You enhanced too much.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.320
Iron Man, take a look at that.

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:42.320
Oh, my God.

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.320
It's Doom Nomitron.

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.320
Doom Nomitron is on Vine.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.320
Get your phone out.

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.320
We got to get more hits than he does.

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.320
More loops.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:03.320
I'm not going to improv and just stole a villain's name from an upcoming episode of Rick and Morty.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:08.320
I just stole it.

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:12.320
But I think I wrote it so I think I can steal it.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.320
But I don't remember.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:15.320
Okay.

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.320
Sorry.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.320
You think you have a will.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.320
Let me take another run at that.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.320
Okay, back it up.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:27.320
Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.320
Hey, Batman.

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.320
Oh, I'm Batman.

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.320
Yes.

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.320
What's up lately?

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.320
Doesn't seem to be a lot of crime happening.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:48.320
Well, you start by trying to take back the night in your hometown and then at some point you decide to move into a Hall of Justice.

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.320
Yeah.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:54.320
And suddenly your character takes on a strange weird comic relief quality.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.320
Yeah.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.320
It's a weird time we're living in.

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.320
My whole dichotomy was about innocence and guilt and justice and things.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.320
And now I just hang out with Aquaman.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.320
I know, I know.

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:11.320
Seven corner pocket.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.320
Fuck.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.320
I'm sorry.

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.320
No, I don't like.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.320
Excuse me.

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.320
It's me, Alfred.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320
I just came to see if you were...

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320
What?

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320
Alfred.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320
Alfred.

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320
What?

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.320
Alfred.

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.320
Get the guns!

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.320
I work for you forever.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.320
Alfred, I...

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.320
I'm your...

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.320
Ah!

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.320
Ah!

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.320
Okay.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320
Ah!

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.320
He called me Alfred.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:43.320
Let's put his head on the wall.

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.320
I can't believe Auschwitz would think of coming into the Hall of Justice.

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.320
How did he make it past the...

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:51.320
You know, I like it.

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.320
I like it.

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.320
I like it when the villains come to us.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.320
It's like, it's like E24.

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.320
We don't have to go outside or anything.

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.320
Oh, what the...

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.320
I'm Auschwitz.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.320
Why did you kill your butler, Alfred?

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.320
Oh!

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.320
Awkward!

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.320
Awkward!

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.320
Awkward!

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.320
Awkward!

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.320
Awkward!

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.320
Awkward!

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.320
Awkward!

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.320
Awkward!

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:16.320
