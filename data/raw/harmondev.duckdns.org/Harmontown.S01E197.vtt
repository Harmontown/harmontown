{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.000\nOh, yeah, it's a little music by our friend Titanic's and Clare, I remember.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:24.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, the Sunshine State, Harmontown is once again in session.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:38.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden then, right off the bat.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:46.000\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:52.000\nIt's very kind, very kind people, thank you very much.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:57.000\nAlright, we've got a lot to talk about.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:00.000\nWhat should we talk about?\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:06.000\nIt's part of a time strip, I got high.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:13.000\nI went out of the way, yeah, what are we talking about first?\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:17.000\nYou guys, if you want, you can all come back in like 10 minutes.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:26.000\nWe're going to look through and what will I be mad if Rob interrupts before I bring out Rob?\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:52.000\nLet's bring out Rob Schrab, everybody.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:57.000\nI think he might have got bigger applause than the mayor.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:05.000\nIt's all ironic. Everybody loves Loki more than Thor, but they know who the good guy is.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:11.000\nI'll take that, I will take that, I'll take that comparison.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:16.000\nBrought to you by Dr. Pepper.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:24.000\nGod damn it, this is what you get when you don't talk to me at dinner.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nIt was a big booth and you guys were coming across.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nCan we talk about our text message exchange?\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:34.000\nSure, I got nothing to hide.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:37.000\nCan we bring Steve Levy out because he has a part in this?\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.000\nOh yeah, Steve Levy.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:45.000\nI'm sorry if you're here for this.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nClean, shaven, freshly cut Levy.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nLook at the biceps of this guy, he's the hottest.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:55.000\nYou look like Captain America.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:00.000\nOne of the guys kind of changing in the background in that locker room scene in Top Gun.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:03.000\nBut you are on Iceman's side.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nI'm just saying this guy's got fantastic.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nAlso, do you wax your smooth as an eel?\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nGeez, what's happening?\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nNo, I don't wax.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nAgain, you can subscribe ladies, $5 a month.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nGet to see this shit.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nOkay, so I got a text message from Schrab, let's see.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nA couple of them.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nI think it was yesterday.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nAlright, first text message.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:38.000\nYesterday, 326pm, Schrab says, wait, what should we...\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nI don't even remember.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nWe should read each our own parts.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nCome on, no.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nYeah, read your fucking text that you sent me.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:48.000\nOpen your script, Schrab.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\n326pm.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nOpen your ice grips.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nYou want me to?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nYeah, read yours.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nThis is like being like the Steppenwolf.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nMy phone's dead, I mean, I can't.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nMy phone's dead.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nGo sit next to him and do it together.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nNo, no, just read it, just read it.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nMan, this is the worst.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:13.000\nWell, you know, if you would have mentioned something at dinner, we could have had it all planned out.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nI didn't know you were going to do this.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nGo ahead.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nJust sit here and read your fucking text.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:22.000\nI brought Levy out so Levy could read his in the middle, that's the funny part.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nIt's all the worst.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nAlright, okay, okay.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:32.000\nThe podcast has become like, we're like the unearned popular kids at the lunch table,\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nand it's like we think that the lunch table means we have a TV show.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nWe're closing in on our 200th episode, and we still haven't figured it out.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:46.000\nAlright, but there's at least five people in the audience tonight who have never been here,\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:47.000\nand they're like, what the fuck is this?\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nWhat is this?\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nLike, I thought he, I thought he, where's Chevy Chase?\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nWhere's, what's, alright, just read.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nAm I reading you, I mean?\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nNo, you're reading yourself.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nYesterday, 326 p.m. yesterday.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nJust don't touch it.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nSee with your eyes, not with your hands.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nIt's too small, I'm sorry.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nHe's got bad eyesight.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:14.000\nOkay, where is it, where are we starting?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nWhere are we starting?\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nAren't they adorable?\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:22.000\nThere, yesterday, 326, this is the worst.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nJust had brunch with Chris Pratt.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:30.000\nKind of a big deal.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:35.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nOh no.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:37.000\nHe's got p-\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:43.000\nYeah!\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nPratt brunch at Soho House.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nHoly shit.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nUh, so I let it go.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nWhich makes me feel like you didn't get it.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nOh, I got it.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nBut I didn't know, I thought you didn't hear it.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nSo then, what was it, an hour later?\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nWhat's the time stamp?\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nSo then I get a text message from Steve Levy.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nSome time later.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nThis is from Steve.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nUh, hold on.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nBecause Schrabs?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nHere, here.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nWhere were we?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.000\nGod, we text a lot.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nI send you a lot of vines.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nYou send me so many vines.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nThis is even better than going to see Hamilton.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nThis is amazing.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nThe fucking stagecraft up here.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nIt's at the top of the screen.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nThis is three hours after that at 6 p.m.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nThis is from Steve Levy.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\n6.03 p.m.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:50.000\nSchrabs wants me to tell you he had a, he had brunch with Chris Pratt.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nWell, I didn't know you got it, so I wanted to make sure.\n\n06:54.000 --> 07:03.000\nIn case you were trying to get ahold of me, I had my phone on do not disturb mode while I was having, having, having a meeting with Pratt.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:12.000\nSo then I said, my assistant telling me about your brunch with Chris Pratt doesn't make it dinner with Chris Pratt.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nA 10.08 p.m.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:23.000\n9.14 a.m., so 12 hours later, you said, it's at the top.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:24.000\nJust fucking read it.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nIt was a great meeting.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.000\nHe's super friendly.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:39.000\nAnd then I said, don't you think it's possible he was acting?\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nWhy would he do that?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:47.000\nMaybe that's how actors practice.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:58.000\nMaybe making someone think they're your friend is the acting equivalent of catching a fly with chopsticks.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:05.000\nHave you been an actor this whole time?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:12.000\nNo, and that's why my friendship is more valuable to you than his.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:19.000\nThat's all I wanted to know, screen grab.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nAll right, that's it.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nThanks, Steve.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nYou got it.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:30.000\nSteve Levy.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:36.000\nWhen we make this on Broadway, I think the more coveted role is a Steve Levy role.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nI think he becomes the whole...\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nI ruined it.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nI shouldn't have thought, oh, we should read those texts.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nI should be organic.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nSee, when you go after something, you kill the butterfly.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nAll right, so I shit my pants again.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:55.000\nI went to Palm Springs with...\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:59.000\nYeah, that's what they're calling it now.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:04.000\nI went to Palm Springs before I came on stage, man.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nEl Compadre.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nI was driving there with my lover.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nIt's a two-hour drive.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nYou've taken a lover?\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:18.000\nDan Harmon takes a lover.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nHe's taken a lover.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:24.000\nA two-hour ride to Palm Springs.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nAll right, it's a story.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:32.000\nYeah, I was giving you a title sequence.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:37.000\nI took a little hit. I grabbed the vape pen.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nHer vape pen is differently configured than mine.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:46.000\nI took a big, full hit, and then I started coughing.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:51.000\nDuring the cough, each cough, as you know, I fart.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:55.000\nLargely, and I was like, those feel like hot farts.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:02.000\nAnd I was coughing like horrible coughing.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:06.000\nThere were four in a row that I was like, that was a hot fart.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nFour in a row.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nAnd then everything was fine.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nThen we went on a two-hour drive. Great time.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nI made her a wonderful birthday present. I'm very talented.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nWhile you were driving?\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nNo.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nNo, I made...\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nShe's a fan of the Karina Longworth podcast.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nSo you must remember this. I made her a half-hour episode of\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nYou Must Remember This.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nI want to hear this.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nWell, you can't. It's her birthday present.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nSo we listened to it. She loved it.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:39.000\nAnd then she was like, oh, we're almost to the place.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nWe're about 10 minutes away.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nThis is probably our last chance to stop, grab some snacks,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:52.000\nstopped at a Walgreens, and got out and remembered.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd felt...\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nThat you weren't just making birthday presents.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nThey weren't hot farts.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:03.000\nI mean, the opening credits that Rob was making,\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nRob didn't know the movie was called Hot Farts.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nAnd I'm saying it's got a Z.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nI was like walking around Walgreens.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nAnd then I went, I was like, I don't know what's going on back there,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nbut I can tell it's a big deal.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nI don't know for sure. You never know for sure.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:22.000\nI'm drinking soylent a lot during the weeks, and so...\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nThanks.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nWell, I'm just telling you that kind of throwing soylent under the bus\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\nbecause I don't want you to think, Jesus, he's dying.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nI do shit my pants more than the average person.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:36.000\nWe've learned that, but I also like, I'm drinking a lot of liquid.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nAnd then I went back to the restroom area,\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nand the restroom was closed.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nIt was under renovations.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nAnd there was like one of those key code things in the women's room.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nSo I just slashed back out and like...\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nWait, you had already let it rip?\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nIt's already out?\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nThey were Hot Farts, man!\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:58.000\nI'm sorry, you're already carrying this.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nHe's shed his pants four times!\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nI thought you were still like, you didn't know what was about to happen.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nOh, no, no, no, no.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nThis isn't like a story about like, oh, it leads up,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nand then let's celebrate the moment of the shit.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nI'm saying, this is like, oh, I coughed,\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nand then each cough I was like, that was a Hot Fart.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nThere was a Hot Fart too, there was like four of them,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:22.000\nand I was like, if those were all Hot Farts,\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nwhy doesn't it smell in the whole car?\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd if they weren't, if they were something else,\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nwhy doesn't it smell?\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nAnd then forgot about them, because I wasn't moving around.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nSo I was like, like, oh, I guess nothing's wrong.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nGot out at the Walgreens, and then felt, I could feel.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nRight.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nOkay, something happened.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nGotcha.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nYou shed your pants.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnd then really, there's almost, well, then I had to,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nbecause I was like, I shed my pants.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd it's just like, well, go to the bathroom,\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nthe bathroom is closed.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nSo I was like, we just got to go,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nand I just went back to the car, and I just sat down.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nDid you get, I mean, you could get like,\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nwet wipes and stuff like that.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nI hadn't thought about that, but what was I going to do?\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nTake them into a dumpster?\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nIt was a desert.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nIt was like, stack up rattlesnakes,\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nand just hide behind the rattlesnakes.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nYou can't shit in the desert, man.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:19.000\nWhere can you?\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nI didn't have to shit.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nI'd shit my pants.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nI'd have to remove my pants, remove the underwear.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nSo you went to the, you went, you went to this,\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nyou went to a wedding?\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nYou went to a wedding?\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nWhere did you go?\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nIt was a birthday weekend.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nIt was a birthday weekend.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nBirthday weekend.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nOkay.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nAll right.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nAnd so, happy birthday.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nSo you're back in the car.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nI mean, I was telling the story.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nYou're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what happened?\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nYou shit your pants?\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nYes.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nThen what happened?\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nI'll be right with you.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nAll right.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nSo you're back in the car now?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nI sat in the car.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nI'm like, I don't know.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nLike, how, what's going on?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nAnd I just, I just held still and we're in the desert.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nAnd then we pulled up to the thing and she's like,\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nI'll check in.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nI'm like, yeah, you check in.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nI'm not going to move.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nI'm just going to sit here in my shit.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nAnd then I was like sitting there and it was like a while\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nbecause they're hippies, you know,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nI'm out in the desert and there's like some artisanal hotel that\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nprobably had to pay in bark or something.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:18.000\nAnd like, so I'm sitting there and I just like,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nI could swear that I was hallucinating that I could feel\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nsomething dripping down my leg.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nBut I wasn't, I couldn't, I didn't want to check.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nI didn't want to, I was just sitting there.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nI just sat there and then we got to the bathroom or the room\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nand I, and then I like, it's just a little Rorschach.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nOkay.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nThat's the end of my story.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nI shit my pants.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nOkay.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nThere's a lot to talk about.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:46.000\nSo, can I, I have one question.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.000\nYou're telling me that you did four hot farts in the car,\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:53.000\ndrove to the wall, Walgreens, Walmart, Walgreens,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nand then you got out of the car,\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nrealized that you had indeed pooped your pants.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nYeah.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.000\nWalked around a little while while you're trying to sort it out,\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\ncouldn't get into one restroom,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\ndidn't know the key code to the ladies restroom.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nGo back to the car, sit in the car.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\nTake another, I'm assuming a few more minute drive back.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\n10 minutes.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nOn to the crib.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:15.000\nRight.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nShe goes into the check-in, paying with bark.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nYou're sitting out in a hot desert car,\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\npossibly poop running on your legs,\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:27.000\nor you're having like, you're having like a psychosomatic.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nIt didn't smell like shit in the car.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nNo.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nWhat?\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nCause it really wasn't that immediate.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nCause it's out of the fucking box, it's fucking...\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nYeah, but maybe it's just like, I got a big hairy butt,\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:43.000\nand it's like, a lot of stuff can be going on up there.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nGod knows that you couldn't eat off it right now,\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nand the room doesn't stink.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nI think the secret is to be a big, wide person\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:56.000\nwith a giant canyon for an ass.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nCause I was on stage doing an improv show a long time ago,\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nand one of the improvisers had to run off stage,\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nlike really unceremoniously just leave the show\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:10.000\nhalfway through, and the whole room smelled like poop.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nBut we didn't connect those dots,\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\ncause it smelled like poop before he left.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nWe thought something else was happening,\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:20.000\nbut he had indeed completely emptied his drawers on stage.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nSo you just let a little...\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nNo, I've never done...\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.000\nI don't even remember when I've done that,\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:29.000\nbut I have a lot of stories about like, farts gone awry.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nI probably had said this before,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nand I might be misquoting it either way.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:39.000\nTommy Lasorta, the ex-manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nWow, I got finger snaps from Dave Kline on that one.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nI didn't expect that.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nHe had some advice from people,\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nand I think there was more than this,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nbut he said, never pass...\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nlike when you get older,\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nnever pass a bathroom and never trust a fart.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nRight, never trust a fart.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nI had to learn that in my 30s that I had to stop.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nI'd be like, you know what else is on the menu?\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:02.000\nAnd then I'd be like, I'll be right back.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nSo yeah, you've lost the ability to do...\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nYeah, you can't do it anymore.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nWhen's the last time you shit your pants, Spencer?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nI think I was like 19 or something.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nIt was just a fart gone awry, yeah.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nRight outside of a Taco Bell, fittingly.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nWow.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:26.000\nHey, Jeff, what would the Sam Elliott add for a...\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nWait, what would it...\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:33.000\nCome on down to Palm Springs and go to the all-new Walmart.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nWe've closed the men's room\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:40.000\nbecause Dan Harmon comes by once in a while.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:45.000\nLadies, the passcode is 3421.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nAlright, that's Sam Elliott for Walgreens.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nIt's a new segment I want to do.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nIt's Sam Elliott...\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:55.000\nCheck out Harmon Quest on CISO.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nHey, did you just say Sam Elliott for...\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nI'm going to make you do one, too.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nFor Schrabs, Schrabs, Mama's Pussy.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nOh, she was on the show. She was on the show.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:10.000\nYeah, really, you know, really not cool.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:18.000\nAll the glitters isn't gold.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:21.000\nBut there's one substance that never tarnishes in my mind,\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nand that's Schrabs, Mama's Pussy.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:26.000\nRight, right, right, of course.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nI call it the mother load.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.000\nRight.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nSam Elliott.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:35.000\nAlright, it's not cool.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nDan Harmon, I heard on the...\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nI was listening to a talk radio, which I don't normally do,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nand I heard that...\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nSchrabs, give me like a small business of any kind.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nShoe.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nA shoe.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nI heard an ad for shoes.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nI don't know if it was shoe

22:30.000\nWhat?\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nWe already spoiled some stuff for people.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nDid I?\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nYeah.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nI mean, I don't

alert.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nAnd they're supposed to put their fingers in the air and go,\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nnah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nYeah,

watch all\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.000\ntelevision and movies with the subtitles on.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nClose caption.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nYeah.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nI don't understand what the fuck people are saying, especially in\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nthat show.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nYou're from house.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nWhat?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nIt's gibberish.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nIt's gibberish.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nSo many names start with the same letter and the same.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nAnd they're all vowels.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nAnd I was like, Varar.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nWhat?\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nOh, Varar.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nOh boy.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nAnd now I know everything.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nWhat letter do they all start with?\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:18.000\nYou get a Tyrian, a Tywin, a Tomwin, a Timmy Taps, a Toobie\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nDupes.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:23.000\nSo did you see the scene where they're at Kingsland?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nI think Toobie Dupes.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nThis is his season, by the way.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:32.000\nThey're having the Kingslanding, like the workplace comedy Kingslanding\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:36.000\nboardroom meetings, you know, where Cersei's kind of like,\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:40.000\nguys, W.K.R.P. needs to get his profit margins back up.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:44.000\nYou know, it's like they have those scenes where it's like her little,\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nlike unwilling minions are gathered around the table.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:51.000\nAnd the guy, the old guy, the bearded old fucking guy with the\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nbathrobe.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nMr. Toobie Dupes.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:57.000\nThe guy that, the guy that in one episode they revealed when\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:01.000\neveryone's out of the room, he's, he's only 70, not 90.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:05.000\nRemember that scene where he was like, they left and he was\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:09.000\nlike, oh, wow.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nYou're only pretending to be 90, you're 70.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nThat's cool.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nThat'll come into play.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nThat'll pay off.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nYeah.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:24.000\nThere's going to be an 80 year old chasing him.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.000\nThis is my chance.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nHe's going to catch him by a decade.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nWait a minute.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:35.000\nIt's like, they cut down to the verbal cat Kaiser Soze, like,\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nlike shot of the feet.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:40.000\nThey're like, wait, that's not a 90 year old's gate.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:41.000\nThat's a hobble.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nThat's a full hobble.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:47.000\nThe unit guys in Milwaukee, everyone, we have a serious problem.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:54.000\nThere's a slam dunk contest in 45 minutes.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:58.000\nThe basket will be, of course, lowered each time a round is\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:02.000\nfailed, but it's, the opponent is 85.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:09.000\nAnd as we all know, our champion is a sharp 90.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:14.000\nAnyways, that guy was talking shit about, you know,\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:19.000\nDarth zombie man, the fucking, like, the mountain.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nThe mountain.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nGot turned into a.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nI like Darth.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nThis guy.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nAnd he's talking shit about him.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nHe's doing the old, he's right behind me.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nIsn't he?\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:31.000\nBecause he's like, that thing ought to be, you know,\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nput that thing to death.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:35.000\nLike, as far as I'm concerned, that thing's like, oh,\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\ncrazy.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nAnd it's like, chomp, chomp, chomp.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nComing up in the frame.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nAnd then he turns and goes.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd then he, if you're watching it with the subtitles,\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:49.000\nlike, you know for sure what, what's about, like,\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:54.000\nlike, he looks and then there's a beat and then he farts.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:59.000\nThe care it says, and it says in the subtitles, farts.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:02.000\nAnd there's like a little like sound.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:05.000\nWhat's going on at Game of Thrones this season?\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nDo you think they.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nHot fart.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nDo you think they added that?\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:11.000\nThey could have, they might, do you think they added that\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nin a poster?\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nDo you think that was scripted?\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nWell, if you knew, if you knew how many farts I had to\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nactively suppress in community, like, like, because God\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:26.000\nblessed them, but audio engineers, they're, I mean,\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nthey, they got to make their own fun.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nLike, like, and they, they will have a track of the\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:34.000\nentire show if they've had time.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:37.000\nLike, and then like, of course we could, you know, well,\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nGlenn's in the bathroom.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nWe could play the, play it for him and then they play it\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nand it's just like, there's horse winnies and like hooves\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nand farts and everything's a fart and like, the Will\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:50.000\nHelms scream is all lines of dialogue and like, and it's\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\njust like, guys, I love your craft.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nI love what you do.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nIt's very important to me, but everyone can't be\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nfarting all the time.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nAnd I think this is like, like, like, yeah, they were like,\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:02.000\nlike, they must have like, like, maybe they said like,\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nGeorge R.R. Martin and because, you know, we're,\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nwe're having a debate in the mixed bay and he's like,\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nI'm just the writer.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nI'm working on the books and they're like, there's a\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:14.000\nfart and he's like, I can't hear you.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nI hope we get more young hodor.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nI want like a young hodor spinoff.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nRemember when he, when he did little, little young\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nteenage hodor?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nI hope that whole storyline.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nOh, I'm loving it now.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nI'm loving it now.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nYou like, you like the brand.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:32.000\nI'm loving it now.

it's, it seems like it's leading somewhere where\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:46.000\nit could be leading somewhere that's completely like\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:49.000\nnew, weird territory that's like never done before.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nI hope so.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:54.000\nI hope it's not more I white animal occupying.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:57.000\nI don't, I don't, and I don't want to hang out in a tree\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nanymore.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nAnd I don't want to walk through holodeck flashbacks.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nI don't like, look, what am I complaining about?\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nIt's a good show.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nIt just seems like the season's kind of like, hey,\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nwhat if, what if they had a meeting?\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nYeah.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nThere was a whole season where there was no crows.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nI was, I was okay with that.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nLike one.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nI'm not sure.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nI'm not sure.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:16.000\nWhat is it?\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nOkay.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nWell, this is a good question.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nOkay.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nUnless you're not into Game of Thrones and wandered in here\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\ntonight.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:27.000\nOf the, of the, of the, of the 19 like places you can cut to\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nin a Game of Thrones episode, like what really like,\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nlike what's the top one for you that you're,\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nyou're like leaning in.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nGive me a moment to think about that.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nI recently asked somebody, what would be the shittiest\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nif you were an actor?\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nOh, when we had, when we had Grey Wormon,\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nlike what was the shittiest gig?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nWe talked about that here.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nWhat would be the best one?\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nDo you have one already on hand?\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nI don't really.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nI don't know what my answer to that is.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nI think what's, what's the one where everybody's fancy?\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:53.000\nLike the, where the, where the, where the seat of power is.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nWhat's that one?\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nYeah.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nThat's probably King's Landing.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nBut, but Dinklage is out of there now.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.000\nLike that was my.\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nYeah, but you can still have a nice outfit.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nThat was my favorite was when he was there and he was like,\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:04.000\nhe handed the King and he was hanging out and stuff.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nOkay.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nAnyways, what, what a dumb podcast.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nStupid ass podcast.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:13.000\nBut really, where would you get Game of Thrones conversation\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nif this podcast didn't do it?\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nThis is your only place on the internet to find out.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nAll right, let's get back to the stuff only we can provide.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:22.000\nSo are there any women with big boobs in here?\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:27.000\nIf wait for it, like, do you have a problem with seat belts?\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nYeah.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nOkay.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:32.000\nThat sounded like a lot of big boob women.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:35.000\nThat sounded like a unanimous consent on that one.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.000\nDo you, do you put, how many of those women,\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:41.000\nI don't know how to measure it by,\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:42.000\nbecause it's by applause.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nIt's by cup size.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:45.000\nI don't want, I don't want to embarrass you.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nI want to give you your privacy, but, but like,\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nlike, I guess you said yes when I said,\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\ndo you have big boobs?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nYou can say it the same way.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nDo you put the seat belt behind you?\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:54.000\nYes.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nThat was a, that was a, that felt like,\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:59.000\nthat felt like there's 12 women with big boobs in here\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:03.000\nand four to seven of them drive with the seat belt\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:06.000\nwrapped behind them because it disturbs their boobs.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nJust a thought.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:13.000\nStarted dating someone with big boobs and I'm an advocate.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nAnd I want you to be safe in the car.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nYeah, so we have, so, so one of you,\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nthe gals that drives with it behind,\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nlike you're sacrificing the shoulder strap\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nand you're just doing the lap belt?\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nBasically.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.000\nReally?\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nThe illusion of safety.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nThe illusion of safety.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nSo yeah, you might not be flung out of the car,\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:34.000\nyou'll just be smashed into the dashboard head first.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nThat's a bummer.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:39.000\nIs there anybody, is there anybody like a,\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nlike travel safety, whatever that's called,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:44.000\nlike working on seat belts that can accommodate that?\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nAre you asking if there's anybody in here?\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:48.000\nNo, no, I mean, like, no.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:54.000\nI am Professor Mortimer Xavier Honda.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:57.000\nAre people currently like working on,\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nI doubt it.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nRemedying that?\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nYeah, probably not.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:01.000\nAnd I feel like, what?\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:04.000\nThere's that, as seen on TV, where it's like,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:07.000\nthere's a stuffed animal that sits on your boobs.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nOh, oh, oh, like there's like,\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:13.000\npeople sell a, like a, yeah.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nIs that supposed to ease the,\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:18.000\nbut that doesn't work, I'm assuming.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nWait, okay, so the boobs lift the belt\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nand make it like a braid your neck.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:26.000\nAh.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:29.000\nSo look, I don't want to white knight the situation,\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:34.000\nbut look, body, body shaming.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nI'm saying like, like if it's not getting addressed,\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nit's because, you know, how, you know,\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nlike we've done a number on women,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nwe're going to write to anybody and say,\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:46.000\nI've got giant tits and I've got a problem with that.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nLike none of them are going to do it.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nThat's like, a lot of them are driving around,\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nlike, like,\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nHas there been no public outcry on that?\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nYou know of anybody?\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nThat's, that's crazy.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nIt's like, and it's like, you know,\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nlike, like, yeah, like, like,\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:04.000\nI had the same problem with the lap belt.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:16.000\nThat's exactly,\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\nthat's the customer service line when you call\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nand you're like, seriously, like you're disturbed\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nbecause you just had a near accident\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nor you lost a friend and you're like calling\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nand you're like kind of crying and like,\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nand then the guy's like, ask you like eight questions\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nand then he goes like, okay, I'm just getting this down\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nbecause it's the same with me and the lap belt\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:36.000\nthat they, and then you hear three guys laughing\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nand then they, and you just hang up\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:41.000\nand curl up in the corner.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nSob.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:46.000\nYeah, well, well, ladies with big boobs,\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nlet it be said here first.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:51.000\nI am on your side.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nLadies with big boobs.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Sam Elliott\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nfor big boob seat belts.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:04.000\nOh, boy.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:08.000\nI was going to go to a really dark place.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nWhat you making this, Rob?\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:13.000\nUh, jeez.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:19.000\nShit, sorry.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\nI dropped my microphone a little bit.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nI dropped it.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nIt was on my, got on my foot.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:29.000\nAnd then came a guy.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nWe here at BMW have a whole new concept\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nabout the way cars should be driven\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:36.000\nand driven in.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:39.000\nYou got some big old hang down floppers.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nDo you got some big old out front,\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:44.000\npunch them rounds.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:47.000\nHe's going into the different kinds of\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:50.000\nbreasts.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nI don't know.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:55.000\nDon't make me do a commercial for titty safety.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nWhat else do you got?\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:01.000\nYour bosom deserves the respect.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:04.000\nIce tea for titty safety.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:07.000\nWhy does he have a rap beat?\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:10.000\nBecause he's ice tea.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:15.000\nI don't play Nashville music\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:18.000\nwhen you're doing Sam Elliott.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nIf I had it, I would play it.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:23.000\nI'm not allowed to play licensed music anymore.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nJust let me, if you're going to pimp me to do\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nice tea endorsements, don't play a beat\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nbecause I'm not going to rap to it.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nIt's just a sound.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:39.000\nIce tea for man space exploration.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:43.000\nAnd the funding thereof.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:47.000\nWe've been on this earth for over 5 trillion years.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:51.000\nAnd we still can't get off it.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:59.000\nShit.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nIt don't even matter to me personally\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nwhat's out there.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:06.000\nIt's a principle of the thing.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nGotta get my ass off this planet.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:13.000\nIf you feel the same way, write your congressman.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:23.000\nThat was pretty good.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:28.000\nThe beat was fucking me up.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nWhat else is on here?\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI said I had a lot to talk about,\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nbut I'm realizing it's a bunch of dumb cutesy shit\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.000\nbecause I was in Love All Weekend.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:44.000\nAnd throughout the week also,\n\n35:44.000 --> 36:05.000\nI threw it through the floor.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:15.000\nWhat was that?\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nDid you talk about it in the show yet?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nThe fact that you drove in an Uber with a dude\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nwho was full blown flat earth.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nDid you talk about that here?\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nI don't think we did, did I?\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nOh dear heaven, I totally forgot about that.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nThere's still flat earth people.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nThey're down to talk.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:35.000\nHe seemed like a reasonable, rational,\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:39.000\nsober individual who was articulate.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:46.000\nWhat music was playing?\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:54.000\nThis is Ice T.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:57.000\nIce T stuck his head in the window for a second.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nHow did he drive away?\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:02.000\nSorry, I can see you're busy.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:05.000\nI'm going on a coffee run.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:08.000\nI left an ice cream truck or something.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nThis was a month and a half or two months ago probably, right?\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:13.000\nI left a Harmontown here and I got into a lift.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:16.000\nAnd the dude had, sometimes people put their ways,\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:19.000\ntheir phone on the dash or on suction cup to the window\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nor up on their visor or different places.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.000\nWhere else?\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nAre there other places?\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:31.000\nSometimes, and their passengers, big titties,\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:36.000\nbecause he keeps the chafing on the neck.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nBut he had another screen up.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:41.000\nHe had one of those giant Samsung-y big ones.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:46.000\nI'm talking about his dick.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\nHe had a screen up on the visor and when I got in,\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:55.000\nit was clearly kind of like talk radio but with visuals.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nJust pictures and it was guys talking about science stuff.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nAnd he kind of, not rushed to turn it off,\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:04.000\nbut I got in the car, he got the destination and he turned it off.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nI'm like, what was going on there?\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nHe had some planets and space.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nHe's like, yeah, it's a science thing.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nI listened to it.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:11.000\nI like science.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:12.000\nWe started talking about stuff.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:16.000\nAnd it was revealed at one point that he is a flat earth believer.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nFlat earth?\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:18.000\nIs there a name for it?\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:22.000\nAnd so he's like, the whole thing is a lie.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nThe earth is flat.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:34.000\nI tried to come at that citadel wall through the front gate,\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nover the top, like tunnel under it.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nYou don't want to be a dick, but you're fascinated.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:39.000\nI was super fascinated.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:40.000\nAlso, he was a pleasant guy.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nAnd I wish I could remember all the details.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:45.000\nBut when you've seen, do you believe we went to the moon?\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nHe goes, oh, we did go to the moon.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:51.000\nThat's also flat.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nSee, that's fucking amazing.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nThat was like the fourth.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nWell, most flat earth people, from whatever I've read online,\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:59.000\nthey think that they also are moon hoax people.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:04.000\nI was saying, what do you think happens if you walk in a straight line?\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:07.000\nAnd he goes, we don't know, because the polar ice caps are there.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nThey're there to keep us from falling.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:13.000\nI have to go, what if we walk around the equator where there are no,\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.000\nthere's no such thing.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:15.000\nThere's no such thing as that.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nBut this guy, hardcore environmentalist.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:21.000\nThat's the crazy thing too, is that he's like, he agrees.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:28.000\nIf you're dumb enough, you're fucking liberal.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:31.000\nThat's what we've got to do.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:35.000\nWe've got to deny education to conservatives until they become flat earthers\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:38.000\nand believe that the ice caps are keeping their children dry.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:44.000\nI'm sorry, not dry, because what they believe is that if the polar ice caps melt,\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:48.000\nall the water will fall off the edge of the marble madness level that we live on.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:54.000\nSo I asked him about, what do you think creates gravity if not that swirling iron core?\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:57.000\nAnd he goes, he had a, not a good answer, but he had an answer.\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:01.000\nAnd it was preposterous and lunatic, but he laid it out nice and simple.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nHe talked like this level headed.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:04.000\nBig turtle.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:07.000\nIt's a big, just big turtle, camera.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:08.000\nBig, big turtle.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:09.000\nI said, all right.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nBig turtle keeping the water down.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:16.000\nIf you believe that we walked on the moon as human beings, and we took photos,\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\ndo you believe those photos?\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:19.000\nHe goes, yeah.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nI go, how come you can only see part of that flat disk?\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:24.000\nHow come you can only see Africa or you can only see a certain continent at once?\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nAnd again, he said, well, that's the photos.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nHe goes, that's a good question.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nI'll tell you why.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nAnd then he started making this other weird shit.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:37.000\nI go, when you go high enough on a plane or a spaceship,\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:38.000\nyou can see the curvature of theirs.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:41.000\nHe goes, no, that's just because the lenses and the cameras are curved.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:46.000\nThe Beastie Boys video theory.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:51.000\nSo then I said, so what you, what you, what you want?\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nWhat you want?\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nIntergalactic.\n\n40:55.000 --> 41:00.000\nSo I said, and I laid down something that I, when I was like drunk and high and talking\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:04.000\nto Professor Brian Cox about, I said, like, I said, like gravity and all this stuff.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:07.000\nI explained what, we know what it does, but do we really know what it is?\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:11.000\nWell, it's like, or like space time and stuff like that.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nWe're talking about space time.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:17.000\nAnd he goes, gravity curves things in the same way that like if you're walking on a curved surface,\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:21.000\nlike our planet, if you and I stood in a straight line along the equator,\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:27.000\nlike a hundred, you know, kilometers apart and we walked, we both had a compass\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nand we walked due north.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nWe would eventually meet.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nWe would eventually touch.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:36.000\nWe would think that we were both walking perfectly straight and we were.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nWe didn't know that the world was round.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nYou would think that there was some weird force acting upon you.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:48.000\nIt's no, it's just the simple curved nature of space time and planets and anything that has curvature to it.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:54.000\nSo I was like, if you and I stood on, like, if you and I, like, if we, if I could come up with the money\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:57.000\nwhere you and I could like do this experiment where we drove like a hundred miles apart\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:00.000\nand had compasses and walked around and he goes, let's do it.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nLet's do it.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:06.000\nI love that this guy's down for anything but research.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:09.000\nHe's like, he'll get on a plane and like meet you.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:16.000\nWhat made him, did you ask him what made him like stop believing it or did he never believe it?\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:20.000\nI think somebody turned him on to this idea that we've all been lied to the whole time.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nIt's all been this big bunch of baloney.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.000\nAnd I said, but like, what's that?\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:26.000\nLike, who's putting that myth forward?\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nAnd we're like, who's making money off that?\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:32.000\nThis is the heroic one because that one's got it.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nYou're just making money. The big globe lobby.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:38.000\nLike, as far as I know, unless somebody tells me different, he's really not hurting anybody.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:44.000\nAnd in fact, that whole polar ice cave, that guy wants the polar ice caps to stay there more than we do.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:50.000\nAnd so really, he's really not hurting anybody unless he thinks what keeps the earth flat is hitting children or something.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nAt what point?\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:59.000\nBut the crazy thing to me is like that, unlike the climate change denying kind of things or whatever the vaccination crap,\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:07.000\nthat this is a guy who, like, he has a belief system that is actually incredibly difficult, I would think.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:14.000\nIt's beyond like, he has to fucking protect that thing with it.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:23.000\nYou couldn't say anything that seemed to me logical that ever got through, like, his force field of what he believed in.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:33.000\nYou think whenever he's like, at a movie, you know, and the universal logo comes out, he's like, here we go again.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:36.000\nBullshit! Turn it off!\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:40.000\nThat's why he only goes to DreamWorks movies when a kid is sitting in front of a flat.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:44.000\nRight, right, yes, finally!\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nHe's a flat movie.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nBut here we go.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nIt's a point where closed-mindedness...\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nNot me, buddy, I'm not...\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nThat guy's so...\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nTake it down the road!\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:00.000\nYou have to actually open your mind a bit to get that closed-minded.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:05.000\nLike, he had to one day, somebody had to say to him, you know, some people who believe the earth is flat,\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:10.000\nand he had to be like, you know, there has to be some story where he's like, yeah, but fuck those people,\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:15.000\nand then some spider bit him or something, and he was like, maybe not fuck those people.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:18.000\nHe delivered one of their flat babies in an elevator.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nI was like, it's human.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:25.000\nSomething happened to him where he was like, maybe the earth is flat.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:29.000\nWhen I got to my destination, I didn't get out of the car, we talked for maybe five, eight minutes.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:35.000\nI have so many, we have to keep talking, but he's like, I'd love to.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nI'm like, keep the meter running.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nI already turned it off, let's just talk about it.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nThat's not a heroic thing.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nHe goes, what's your hangout?\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nIt's like you're a lunatic, and he's like, what?\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nI take that back, you're not a lunatic.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:53.000\nBut this is a lunatic idea for me, and he's like, you have been fed a bunch of lies.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nIt's all a bunch of lies.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nI was like, but why?\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nHow do you start?\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nWas this Lyft or Uber?\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nThis was Lyft.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nThat means he's got a podcast.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:11.000\nOn the way there, I said, are you using Google Maps or Waze when he goes, I'm using Waze.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:15.000\nI'm like, how do you think GPS works?\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nIf it's flat, you can't.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:25.000\nWhat about you can go to the beach and see the ocean, and you can see it curving just with your own naked eyes.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nThat's an optical illusion.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nWell, then so is anything.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:33.000\nYou could just say, you guys can hang out.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:37.000\nI would respond to that and say, well, if the earth is round, how come everything seems so flat?\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:41.000\nLike the answer is just, I would just say,\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nI get that, but if you could see it curving, I don't know.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nYeah, but I can see it flatting.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:51.000\nAnd the answer is, well, it's a matter of scale, and it's a different shit happens.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nI want to get in there, man.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nI want to be one.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nI want to be a doomsday.\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nDid you find out?\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nI was like a couple of things.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:07.000\nIf there were this flat, on a clear day, if we had a really good telescope, wouldn't we be able to see Mount Everest and everything else?\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nEiffel Tower?\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nHe had all this stuff.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nClouds.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:21.000\nMy biggest regret about this whole thing is that right when you get out of the car, I was like, why didn't I invite him on Harmontown?\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nAnd not to mock him?\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nNo, of course not.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nWe would have fucking...\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nI'd mock him.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nBut you wouldn't mock him.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nYou would question him.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nYou wouldn't bully him.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nThere's no need.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:41.000\nI think you can't just say, oh, you can't just have an answer.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:45.000\nYou could come up with lie answers for anything and not have to prove anything.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nExample.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nWell, let's make Spencer be a...\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nOkay, sure.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nHello, Earther.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nAlright.\n\n46:55.000 --> 47:01.000\nHey, if the Earth is hollow, how come there are holes?\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:05.000\nBecause it spins.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nWhat?\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:13.000\nIt keeps the shape that way.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:19.000\nI'm supposed to poke holes, right?\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nI don't know what the exercise became.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nYou're trying to ask hard-hitting...\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nI'm trying to disprove hollow Earth theory.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:29.000\nWell, I don't really know anything in common day that I can point at.\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nThat's because the government.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nAlright.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:37.000\nSee, it's easy.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nYou could just say anything.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:45.000\nUnless someone has, like, a ruler or something, you can't go out and disprove it.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:49.000\nThis is true.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nWe blew it. I blew it.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nHow about Sasquatch? Do you want something else?\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nSure, sure, sure.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:59.000\nHey, how come we haven't found Sasquatch skeletons?\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:03.000\nBecause they've been hiding them.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nWho's they?\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nThe Sasquatches.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nThey're hiding them.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nBecause that's literally all they do is hide and hide things.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nThey hide skeletons and other stuff?\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nThey're not called Sasparators.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nYeah, they hide the skeletons.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nWhere?\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nIn the beach.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nThe beach?\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nWhy the beach?\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nBecause people think they're whale bones.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nIt's fucking easy.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nYou just say anything.\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nAlright, alright.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nSpencer.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:49.000\nLet's have Spencer pretend he's someone who believes in the electoral system of the United States.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:57.000\nSo how come if I live in New York where 9-11 happened, my vote counts for way less than if I live in Wyoming?\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nBecause every state gets to determine that.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:04.000\nWell, how come we can't just use the technology to pick the president now?\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:09.000\nYou could. You just have to vote to make that happen.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:12.000\nThat's the biggest argument about the electoral college.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:16.000\nIt's like, oh, it's broken and fucking vote for it, assholes. It's stupid.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:21.000\nHow come all the presidents are either rich people, politicians, or people that knew rich people are politicians?\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nBecause that's what it takes.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:28.000\nThat's the system that the forefathers wanted.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:31.000\nThey didn't just want anyone to be president.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:32.000\nIt's true they did.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:33.000\nThat's true.\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:36.000\nYeah, I mean, if anyone was president, a disaster could happen.\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:40.000\nThey'd just pick some douchebag from a reality show and pizza commercials.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:46.000\nI mean, God, mob rule can't happen or else.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nI love it. I love what's happening.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:51.000\nWe're not celebrating the total collapse of the Republican Party.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nWe're just being afraid that Trump's going to get elected.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nBut we're not noticing that the fucking Republican Party...\n\n49:55.000 --> 50:00.000\nI don't think it's the collapse of anything. I think it's us blossoming into a weird shitty flower that was always coming along.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nIt's kind of neat.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:08.000\nI said a lot of crappy stuff about the bipartisan system as if it was always going to continue and there was no way for it to ever change.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:13.000\nBut it's not necessarily going to make things better, but at least we're looking at a kind of...\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:16.000\nIt's definitely a shaky year for the bipartisan system.\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:20.000\nThey still have the legislature, though. They still got that legislature.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:21.000\nYeah, where the shit really happens.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nThat's the trick. That's what they've realized.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:29.000\nThey think that if they lose the nomination, they can still win back legislation and still win that way.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.000\nYeah.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nAlright.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.000\nAlright.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:36.000\nAlright. I really don't have a lot more. That's getting scary.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nWhat's going on in Venezuela? I don't know.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nOkay.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:43.000\nSeems rough.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:46.000\nWhat do you think is going on in Venezuela?\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:53.000\nSome kind of horrible apocalyptic economic and health collapse of their entire system.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nThere's like a state of emergency.\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:58.000\nDan, that's what they want you to think.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:01.000\nJust follow the money.\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:04.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nYeah, I don't know what's going on in Venezuela.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:07.000\nI don't think they're listening.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:11.000\nI think something horrible has happened where they're in the dark ages.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nIs anybody here legitimately into...\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:16.000\nDon't come up just because you want to be on stage.\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:20.000\nIs anybody here into something like Flat Earth, Hollow Earth, Kamen Trails, stuff like that?\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nReally is a firm-ass believer?\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nA firm-ass believer.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nA firm-ass...\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nYou believe in firm-ass?\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nYou believe when you get a nice tight ass.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nIt just seems like a loaded thing.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:35.000\nLike, yeah, somebody's going to go, oh, if I squint real hard, I can be into Bigfoot.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:38.000\nAnd then they come up and they're like, there's a Bigfoot and we're like, really Bigfoot?\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nAnd they're like, okay, maybe medium-sized foot.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nAnd we're like, yeah.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:47.000\nI'm proud of you guys for not volunteering. Thank you.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:51.000\nI'm proud of you, Jeff, for asking, though.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:55.000\nBut also, I have nothing to talk about, so thank you for trying.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nI'll let you down with that.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nI'll let you down with that, Milly. I'm trying to help.\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:03.000\nLet's enter the... there's a new segment. It's called Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:07.000\nLet me give you some... here.\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:16.000\nYou got a barrel full of content\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:19.000\nAnd you dip a ladle in\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:22.000\nAnd nothing comes out.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:25.000\nSo you go lower. Okay.\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:31.000\nThis is Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel, brought to you by Schrab's Momma's Pussy.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:34.000\nSo gross.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:41.000\nWhen you want someone's Momma's Pussy, you need more than the worst. You need the best.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:48.000\nAnd if you can't get that, go to Schrab's Momma.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:51.000\nWhat are we doing?\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:54.000\nIt's just not funny. It's not funny.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:57.000\nIt's not that funny.\n\n52:57.000 --> 53:00.000\nIt's kind of cheap. It's not that funny.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:09.000\nWell, I agree, technically, as a comedic craftsman, but at the same time, your attempt to high-road me is...\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:14.000\nI just don't think it's that funny. It's not that funny. It's just not funny.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:22.000\nWe're still in the segment called Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel. This is a subsection of that called\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:32.000\nThings I could easily look up and have the answer to in one minute, but decided to write down and then ask on stage.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:35.000\nHow many you got?\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:38.000\nOne.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:44.000\nLet's start with number one.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:50.000\nThis is the bottom of the barrel.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:57.000\nYou got that barrel.\n\n53:57.000 --> 54:01.000\nWhere does the word surcharge come from?\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nI don't know.\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:07.000\nBecause if you say service charge, I'm going to ask you, why is it called SUR?\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:12.000\nI'm going to guess because it's the bottom of the thing. It's a charge they add to the bottom after all the things are tallyed.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nWhat's the SUR?\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nSUR is...\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:19.000\nWait, I heard too much at once.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nLatin for under, bottom.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nWhat country is this again?\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:26.000\nLike a surreptitious man.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nThe country of Latin?\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nGod, I hate him. I hate him so much.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nI don't think so.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:41.000\nLast time I checked, this was America.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nIs it the same Latin?\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:49.000\nYour phone died. You can't use that. Your phone is dead. You're not allowed to use that as a bailout mechanism.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:52.000\nStop. Stop it.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nDo you want me to charge your phone so you can use that?\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:58.000\nWould you really? I need to get home.\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:06.000\nThat text message thing really got under your dandruff.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:09.000\nAre we allowed to know about this Chris Pratt meeting or what was going on there?\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nIs he going to be a Lego?\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:16.000\nObviously it was just like, Chris Pratt was like, what's taking so long with the Lego movie?\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:20.000\nYou know, like what's going on? Should I even do the voice?\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nMaybe someone else would do the voice of the Legos.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:33.000\nAnd they were like, why don't you go eat with Schrab? And then he's like, so anyways, can I get some more cantaloupe?\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:36.000\nThe Legos are going to be on a pirate ship this time.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:39.000\nAnd he's like, okay.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:46.000\nBecause I can't hear the sound of you over the 800 million movies I should be doing right now.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:53.000\nLike if each of my pecs did one movie, that'd be two movies.\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:56.000\nWell, talk to me about Legos.\n\n55:56.000 --> 56:06.000\nLike tell me and you're like, wow, they snapped together and could I get another cantaloupe?\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:10.000\nThey're not called Legos.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:13.000\nThe company's called Lego.\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:18.000\nDon't care. You're never going to be friends with anybody cooler than me.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nIt sounds like he had brunch with one.\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:25.000\nThat doesn't make a friendship. That was my point. He's not friends with him. It's just a brunch.\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:29.000\nI think you're terrified that maybe one day he will find somebody cooler than you.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:35.000\nIn order for me to be terrified of that, there'd have to be something terrifying happening.\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:40.000\nAre you saying Rob's incapable of finding somebody cooler than you?\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:44.000\nI'm just, yes, I am.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nYes, I am.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:49.000\nSo is it like sir, sir, like surreptitious?\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:52.000\nNo, like sir name.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:56.000\nSir name.\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:59.000\nOh, on.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nOn top of.\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:04.000\nWhy did they just say that?\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nOh, it's like surretab.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:10.000\nOn the table. I always said I grew up in L.A. and speaking Spanish,\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:13.000\nunder the table, that's like when you're drunk.\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:17.000\nI'm glad I asked. I should have looked it up, but I'm glad I asked.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:20.000\nThat's a great. Okay, I have no more of those.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nAll right.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:26.000\nAnd we got about 50 minutes left.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:29.000\nI also heard that. What's going on in Venezuela?\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:33.000\nSpeaking of the French and us using their language,\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:36.000\nsupposedly the expression that's the ticket, like, yeah, that's the ticket.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:39.000\nIt comes from a bastardization of that's etiquette.\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:43.000\nFrench, like that's etiquette. That's the way you do it.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.000\nAnd is it etiquette based on the word ticket?\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nOh, sorry, I interrupted your take.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:51.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:55.000\nIs it etiquette based on the word ticket because they like would put up\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:58.000\nmanner signs like up at places and they'd be tickets.\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:01.000\nIt's not funny in any way. Fairly entertaining.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nAre you trying to flatter us this right now?\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nNo, no. That'd be amazing.\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nIf you just, it's a big loop.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:11.000\nAnybody see the Civil War Land Civil War Man show?\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nYeah.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nWhat's it? Civil War Man?\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:18.000\nYou see the Civil War Man under Ruse?\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:21.000\nDo we find out why he's calling him under Ruse?\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nNo.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:26.000\nDan and Rob, didn't you write a movie called Civil War Land?\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:29.000\nYeah, but that's, it isn't ours.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:33.000\nWho's Civil War Man in the movie?\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:36.000\nJohn.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:39.000\nDo you want to break out?\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:43.000\nOkay, let's break out. Who considers himself the, like, like, like,\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:48.000\nlike sort of a, you're, you're, you're a solid.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nYeah. Here we go.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:54.000\nFeet on the earth, like, like, like, like, you, you went to see Civil War\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:58.000\nand, and you, and you liked it and you're a big Marvel guy and like,\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nyou just kind of, here.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nThere's no shortage, no shortage.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nI think the hand that went up first was over here.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nWhy don't you, you, you, you come up, are you willing to come up?\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nI, I just forgot to ask, are you willing to come up?\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:11.000\nAll right, so we've got a Civil War movie.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nWhat, what is your name, sir?\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:14.000\nBen.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:15.000\nBen?\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:16.000\nYeah.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:17.000\nNice to meet you, Ben.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.000\nBen.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nAll right, so no spoilers.\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nTell us the entire movie.\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nBut there probably aren't any spoilers to have, right?\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nI mean, they're just, they're just superheroes.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nThey're, they're super in the beginning.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nThey, they stay relatively super.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:34.000\nIs he, is he called Underoos in the beginning of the movie?\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:38.000\nAnd then he, and he goes, actually it's Spider-Man.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nAnd I go, oh, I'm sorry.\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:44.000\nI must have, while the car was driving by, I heard Underoos.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:45.000\nThat's so weird.\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:48.000\nYou're, you're, everybody is, I'm so embarrassed.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nI gotta change my phone now.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:51.000\nYour name in the front.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nAll right, he's hung up on the Underoos thing.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:54.000\nI am, I am.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:55.000\nIt's weird.\n\n59:55.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nAnd then some kids are playing with a Captain America toy while Black Panther's running through the garage, right?\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nWhat?\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nWhen were they playing with a toy?\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nYou know, when they're running through the garage, Black Panther, it's in the trailer.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nI'm assuming that, that scene is still in the movie, right?\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nOkay, so Black Panther and Captain America are running through the garage,\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nand then there's like a family and a, and a minivan or whatever, the mom and dad are talking or something like that.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nWell, but why, but Rob, why wouldn't there be toys in a universe where the people actually existed when they're,\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nI guess they have firefighters.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nWait, the firefighter toys, is that what you're saying?\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nYou're saying that because we don't have firefighter action figures, which we do.\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nNo, no, no, I'm saying that I'm agreeing with you.\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nYeah, so, okay.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nOkay, well that's been around since the 80s, the idea that people, that the,\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nArmy men?\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nWell, no, that's the meta concept of like, oh, if there's a, in a sequel, like, like,\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nOh, the people exist in the real world, and then they have the toys, the merchandising.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nI don't remember ever seeing that.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nIt happens in like every fucking, like,\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nName two.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nLike it, I can't, okay.\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nI know I can name one, but there'd be like a five minute gap and everyone would get up and leave.\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nThen don't, then don't.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nThat's been, all right.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nSo a good movie, Civil War?\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nOh yeah, I really enjoyed it.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nI've seen it twice now.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nWho's side are you on?\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nWell, I'm always on the side of Captain America because he generally has the most like straightforward logic.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nLike Iron Man is a little bit more selfish.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nYou know, he's out for a lot more, his own agenda type of thing.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nSo yeah, he agrees.\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nBut I have to say that the first time I saw Civil War, I saw it in this thing, a 4DX.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nHave you guys?\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nNo, what's 4DX?\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nOkay, so it's this thing that they're trying to, like they're trying to do like the Dolby Atmos and all that kind of stuff.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nBut in this, they have chairs that literally like move with the movie, like all the way around.\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nLike not just like just a little bit.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nWhat?\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nWhere was it?\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nAround, like up and down.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nNo, where was the place?\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nOh, where did I go?\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nSomeone said, where did you go?\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nThen he said around.\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nOh my God.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nCinema.\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nIt was at the Regal Cinema.\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nBut it's this.\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nNo, where did the chairs move?\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nDid it go left and right?\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nDid they shake or what?\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nI don't know the address.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nBut they shake and move, but the worst part of it is like that.\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nSo they also blow smoke in your face and water and shit.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nAnd then when people get punched, they literally punch you in the back.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nWait, shut up.\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nNo, I'm not even joking.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nIs this how you saw the movie?\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nOr what are you?\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nThat's how I saw the movie.\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nWhat?\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nWhat?\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nThey're just physically abusing people?\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nIt's like a carnival line?\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nIt's the worst thing ever.\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nI thought it would be cool.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nWait, human beings come and punch you?\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nSo that's why you want to see it twice, because you were like, how about not knocking my ass\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000\naround?\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nAnd I'll just have some popcorn.\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nI enjoyed it a lot more the second time.\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nHold up, Ben.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nEverybody in the theater gets a punch in the back by another human being.\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nIt's by the chair.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nNo, it's the chair.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nIt's all mechanical.\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nIt works there, named Douglas.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nPeople work for the theater.\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nOkay.\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nSo you're getting like the Bugs Life treatment where there's, you know, this thing.\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nBut you don't really mean...\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nExactly like that.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nThere you are.\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nSo at a point where you were, it's actually kidney throttling you, like, is it really\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.200\nliterally like a character in the movie is getting punched, or is it like we're going\n\n01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.280\noff a cliff, or does something exploded?\n\n01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.400\nIt happens for a bunch of different things.\n\n01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.120\nIs there any fucking in the movie?\n\n01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120\nI wish.\n\n01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120\nYou can tell...\n\n01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120\nNo?\n\n01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120\nThere isn't?\n\n01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120\nNo, not...\n\n01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.120\nIt's a Disney movie.\n\n01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120\nSo.\n\n01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.120\nOkay.\n\n01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.840\nBy the way, he calls him under risk, because, you know, it's like he's wearing like his\n\n01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.120\nstuff is made out of underpants.\n\n01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120\nBut he made that.\n\n01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.120\nThat would be stupid.\n\n01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.120\nI thought he did.\n\n01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.120\nHe doesn't make it, though.\n\n01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120\nIron Man made his suit for him.\n\n01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.120\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.800\nSo now he's calling him out by the under...\n\n01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.240\nThat sounds like if I gave you a T-shirt, and I was like, hey, T-shirt, you motherfucker.\n\n01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240\nYes.\n\n01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.440\nIt's like, that's your T-shirt.\n\n01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.240\nYou put that on me so you can insult me with it?\n\n01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.240\nThat's terrible.\n\n01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240\nThat's like a Monopoly guy.\n\n01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240\nUnder...\n\n01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.680\nUnderoos is a product, right.\n\n01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.960\nAnd he's calling it under...\n\n01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.480\nUnderoos is a product that was in the late 70s that would have like Spider-Man's symbol\n\n01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:35.200\non it, and Batman's symbol on it, and he's calling him Underoos, right.\n\n01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.360\nThat's Iron Man's style.\n\n01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.760\nHe like gives everyone a nickname.\n\n01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.760\nAt one point, he calls...\n\n01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.960\nDude, I fucking know that.\n\n01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.440\nYeah, but Schrab, what are you...\n\n01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.480\nIs Iron Man saying that?\n\n01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.720\nHe's referencing a thing that went out of style like decades ago.\n\n01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720\nYeah.\n\n01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720\nThat's how long...\n\n01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.120\nKnown for like Spider-Man underwear, so he's had to merchandise it since the 70s?\n\n01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120\nNo.\n\n01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120\nOh, your time...\n\n01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.440\nOh, so you're saying that Spider-Man...\n\n01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.440\nYou're thinking that he's time referencing Spider-Man like his own branding?\n\n01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.120\nHis brand of under-roos is what he's saying.\n\n01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.120\nHe's looking at him when he's talking to him, right?\n\n01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.880\nBut you're connecting a dot there that I don't think is...\n\n01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.000\nIt's like not all under-roos are Spider-Man under-roos.\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nSo there's Batman under-roos.\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nSo he's going...\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.880\nHe's like long johns.\n\n01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.280\nBecause there's Batman under-roos.\n\n01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280\nYeah.\n\n01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280\nSpider-Man under-roos.\n\n01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.280\nNo.\n\n01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.640\nBecause you got a bat on your chest, and you're wearing a gray shirt.\n\n01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.640\nNo, it's like tights.\n\n01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.640\nHey, tights.\n\n01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.640\nHey, man, who's wearing tights?\n\n01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.640\nHey, asshole.\n\n01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640\nThat I understand.\n\n01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640\nIt's like that, but it's under-roos.\n\n01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640\nBut when the...\n\n01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.640\nDoesn't make sense.\n\n01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.640\nCaptain America all the time, because these were in tights.\n\n01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.920\nYou're just connecting a dot that they're not connecting for that reason.\n\n01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.200\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200\nIt does.\n\n01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.720\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.720\nHello Earth.\n\n01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:47.400\nAre you going to go see it in the movie, at theater or thing?\n\n01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.520\nDo you want to go watch it with me?\n\n01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.040\nIf you take the seat that punches you in the kidney, I don't want to get...\n\n01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.800\nWe can just go see it regularly, right?\n\n01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.040\nI don't have to have smoke blown in my face.\n\n01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.560\nMy favorite is just seeing it in AMC Prime, because it's really comfy seats, and then they\n\n01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.360\nhave the Dolby Actress, which is enough technology for me.\n\n01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.600\nThat's Amazon Prime.\n\n01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.760\nHey, you know, the guys that directed that movie, they used to direct my show, Community.\n\n01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760\nOh, really?\n\n01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760\nYeah.\n\n01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.560\nYou know, they got that job that way.\n\n01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.400\nThey showed us the paintball episode.\n\n01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.760\nI don't know why I'm angry.\n\n01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760\nThey reference Community.\n\n01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760\nWhere's Mike?\n\n01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760\nGive me a superhero.\n\n01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.120\nThere's a Community reference in Civil War.\n\n01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.600\nWell, do you mean Dean Jim Rasheson?\n\n01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600\nHe is the reference.\n\n01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600\nYeah.\n\n01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.760\nIt was a very brief cameo, and I was like, oh my God.\n\n01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.960\nI launch a lot of stars, kid.\n\n01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.960\nUnderroos are a t-shirt and briefs.\n\n01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.240\nThere's no leggings.\n\n01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.560\nThere's no armings.\n\n01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.560\nThere's no gloves.\n\n01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.240\nThere's no hood.\n\n01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.040\nThere's t-shirt and briefs.\n\n01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.800\nAnd sometimes, Wonder Woman, Batman's Spider-Man was a popular one.\n\n01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800\nDoesn't make sense.\n\n01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.800\nUnderroos.\n\n01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.880\nI will say it was a weird area, but I also can't say I could put my money where my mouth\n\n01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.920\nis as far as what Tony Stark should yell out when calling the Spider-Man.\n\n01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.360\nSpider-Man!\n\n01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.440\nIt's on the cover of this comic book that apparently probably exists in this universe\n\n01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440\ntoo.\n\n01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.520\nNo, he does, he does like question his name.\n\n01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.280\nWhy is his eyes squint?\n\n01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.800\nIt's the robot.\n\n01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.800\nYeah.\n\n01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.120\nTony Stark made his suit.\n\n01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.720\nHe custom-made it, and there's a part where he's talking about the goggles that he wears,\n\n01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.720\nand they really obscure your vision, but because his senses are so heightened, they actually\n\n01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.120\nhelp him see better.\n\n01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.400\nSo I believe Tony Stark made them so that they adjust to his eyes.\n\n01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.440\nSo they get squint to give him an expression.\n\n01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.600\nSo is this version of Spider-Man, does he have web shooters?\n\n01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600\nYeah, he has web shooters.\n\n01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.160\nHe made the stuff himself.\n\n01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.400\nSo Peter Parker in this version of the Marvel Universe is, in addition to getting bit by\n\n01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:04.360\na radioactive spider, also is so smart that he can make web shooters.\n\n01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.680\nYeah, and that's what actually what makes their relationship really work well in the\n\n01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.680\nmovie.\n\n01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.680\nBecause they're both geniuses.\n\n01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.680\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.440\nExcept one of them is a superhero because he's a genius, the other one is a superhero\n\n01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.520\nbecause he's a genius, and also got bit by a spider.\n\n01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.680\nHere's another thing.\n\n01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.960\nHere's another thing.\n\n01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.640\nSo he got bit by a spider, and he got all the powers of a spider, he can crawl up walls,\n\n01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.320\nhe's super strong, he can be telepathic, but he can't shoot webs.\n\n01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.320\nRight.\n\n01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.320\nSo with the spider, the spiders know they're doing it.\n\n01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:42.080\nHow come I can walk on walls and know when danger is coming, ah, typical spider shit.\n\n01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.600\nI'm connecting this dot to that spider that bit me, and as such, I'm gonna use my previously\n\n01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.120\nuntapped ability to create military-grade weaponry.\n\n01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.000\nI mean, that was like, the comic book, it was fine, but I really, I'm just saying, like,\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.520\nI thought that was like in this world where the movie industry takes comic book properties\n\n01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.400\nthat we love and kind of like demystifies them and like tries to jerk itself off for\n\n01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.640\nmaking everything real.\n\n01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.640\nThat's nanobots.\n\n01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.400\nThat's not just a magical comet.\n\n01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.320\nThat's why you're made of stone and she can turn invisible.\n\n01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.920\nIt's like nanotechnology.\n\n01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:20.320\nBut one of the rare instances of, I thought, was, you know, the decision to make Peter\n\n01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:26.280\nParker just a puberty myth and have him have, like, he mutated and he's shooting like fucking\n\n01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280\nshit out of his wrists.\n\n01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:28.280\nI thought that was cool.\n\n01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280\nMakes sense.\n\n01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280\nMakes sense.\n\n01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280\nThat all comes from the movies, I believe.\n\n01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280\nRight.\n\n01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280\nThe, what's his name?\n\n01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280\nToby McGuire.\n\n01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.280\nYeah, Toby McGuire.\n\n01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.280\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.560\nI'm being an old man and saying like, I love, I love, no, Toby McGuire spider man.\n\n01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.560\nThat's what I'm doing.\n\n01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.920\nI'm saying, I thought that was a cool instance.\n\n01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:50.520\nI wasn't like jumping up and going, in the comic book, he invents, you know, like weird,\n\n01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.240\nlike the stuff with the tensile strength of steel that you could shoot, like the idea\n\n01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.800\nthat a kid could do that.\n\n01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.400\nAnd then also that's the kid that got bit by a radioactive spider.\n\n01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.320\nIs it true that he could shoot out of his feet, too, in this one?\n\n01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.320\nIf he built a machine for it, they never, they never expressed that at any point.\n\n01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.320\nHe might be able to shoot one out of his ass.\n\n01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320\nYes.\n\n01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320\nWho's your favorite?\n\n01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320\nWho's, do you have a favorite?\n\n01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.320\nOh, come on.\n\n01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320\nI missed.\n\n01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320\nHashtag hotfarts.\n\n01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320\nCome on.\n\n01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320\nI missed.\n\n01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320\nI missed off on that.\n\n01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320\nCome on.\n\n01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320\nOh.\n\n01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.320\nOh, Ben.\n\n01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.320\nSpiders do it, though.\n\n01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.320\nOh, Ben.\n\n01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320\nOh, Ben.\n\n01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320\nCome on.\n\n01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320\nOh, Ben.\n\n01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.920\nMaybe Spider-Man got bit by a spider that doesn't actually create silk.\n\n01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.800\nDo all, do all spiders spin silk?\n\n01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.800\nNo, but you're, you're misunderstanding.\n\n01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800\nYou're transless.\n\n01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800\nI don't think.\n\n01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.960\nI'm saying that, I'm not going to keep, it's, I'm saying that I thought it was a clean,\n\n01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.960\nnice simplification to say, why don't you get all the powers from the Spider-Bite?\n\n01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.960\nRight.\n\n01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.960\nI agree.\n\n01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960\nNot, not have to have one.\n\n01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.080\nIn comic book, in that age of comic books, it was like fine.\n\n01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.920\nIt was like, like, that's the point of comic books was like punk rock to be like, like,\n\n01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.760\nokay, and then he made these things and he doesn't think.\n\n01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.280\nWhen Tony Stark is seeing Spider-Man, is that the first time he's, they've ever met?\n\n01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.760\nHe's been watching him a bit closely, but it was the first time I met him personally.\n\n01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.760\nYeah.\n\n01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760\nThis is the origin.\n\n01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760\nIt's really kind of creepy if you think about it.\n\n01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.760\nIt's the origin of Spider-Man then, right?\n\n01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760\nYeah.\n\n01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.760\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.080\nSo Tony Stark is aware of a product called Underoos, but didn't know that Spider-Man was\n\n01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.080\none of the lions in the 70s.\n\n01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.080\nOh my God.\n\n01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:30.360\nI think they're going, it's like a slightly alternate universe, like where like the superheroes,\n\n01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.440\nthis is the first time they've ever existed, but like the, all like the products and things\n\n01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.360\nthat we like know and care about still like have happened.\n\n01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.360\nJust without like branding of those characters.\n\n01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:53.560\nA person has volunteered that DC Comics exists in the, well, yeah, because there's the, well,\n\n01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.560\nand vice versa, right?\n\n01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.200\nBecause there's the joke of, oh, I'm sorry, no, not vice versa, that Toby McGuire movie\n\n01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.360\nwhen she says, well, you're not Superman, right?\n\n01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360\nYou're not, okay.\n\n01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.240\nAnyways, the, the, the, what's your favorite, who's your favorite guy?\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240\nTony Stark?\n\n01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.240\nPutting words in my mouth.\n\n01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:18.680\nNo, I, I mean, like, honestly, Iron Man is the most fun to watch, I think, but, uh, Captain\n\n01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.680\nAmerica has the best movies.\n\n01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:25.720\nWhy do you think it is that, well, yeah, why, why do you think it is that like, like, what,\n\n01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:32.880\nso if you look at, uh, Batman as folklore, like he's a guy who was born rich, uh, he\n\n01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.280\nhad tragedy before him.\n\n01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.680\nHe's like, he's a philanthropist, he's a playboy, he's a billionaire.\n\n01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.400\nHe uses his money to make a bunch of shit.\n\n01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.240\nIt's like the obvious parallels, Iron Man, like that's the big thing, Marvel, like, even\n\n01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.520\nthough he's not the most super, what do you, do you, do you, have you thought about that?\n\n01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.560\nDo you, do you think, what, why do you think the, why do we like the superhero characters\n\n01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.040\nthat we like in America?\n\n01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.480\nWhat, what, it's okay if you haven't thought about it.\n\n01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.960\nOh yeah, no, I, I've totally thought about this, uh, especially cause like, a lot of\n\n01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.240\npeople like Batman, uh, the best and Iron Man is obviously like, uh, a very like close\n\n01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.720\nequivalent, but I think the, one of the reasons why people like Batman better is cause he's\n\n01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.240\nlike a lot darker and like has a lot more like intrigue in his past.\n\n01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:19.600\nBut we like the guys who aren't super, even from DC, even to Marvel, it's like we like\n\n01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:25.280\nthe not decidedly non super superheroes, like the superhero got invented, but then we settled\n\n01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:33.120\ninto, well, I like, I like this, but we can't, we can't have, I, I, I dated a, a, a, a victim\n\n01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.560\nthat, uh, uh, was, uh, had a, getting her PhD, nobody even laughed because they're like,\n\n01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.960\nyes, everyone you date is a victim.\n\n01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.000\nI dated a young lady who, uh, uh, who was full of light when I met her and, uh, and\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.920\nwas getting her master, had her master's was getting her PhD in media studies and she\n\n01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.480\nindoctrinated me into this concept of American mythology being, having this really specific\n\n01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.840\nslant and hero mythology where we like, we can't decide between the outlaw hero and\n\n01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.160\nthe righteous hero.\n\n01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.680\nSo in Deadwood, that swear engine and Timothy Ali, uh, character, I can't remember, it's\n\n01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.960\nI, my brain is Swiss cheese because I'm more of an outlaw hero, but it's like we, we need\n\n01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:15.400\nour, we love, we love our Han Solo with our Skywalker, like we, it's like caviar on the\n\n01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.800\ncracker, like we want to, so it's, but, so what I can't figure out is, is that, is that\n\n01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:24.560\nwhy we love in comic book mythology, sure we love the fantasy of a guy getting really\n\n01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.560\nso mad he can turn green and then he can fucking do all this shit that we want to do\n\n01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.560\nat the bank.\n\n01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.560\nBut they can't make a good Hulk movie.\n\n01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.600\nThey can't make a good movie out of it because what we really like, ultimately the thing\n\n01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.000\nthat passes hands through all these studios and things, we like, we like rich people because\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.840\nwe don't want to be, we don't want to be socialists for God's sake.\n\n01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:50.400\nLike we want to, we like rich dudes that are playboys, but then that also decide, what am\n\n01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400\nI doing with my life?\n\n01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.440\nI'm going to, I should be out there fighting for truth and justice and they use all their\n\n01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.800\nmoney to make like, like stuff and then they beat people up.\n\n01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.400\nSo because we don't want to let go of the American dream, which is that one day we're\n\n01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.400\ngoing to be Bruce Wayne.\n\n01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.400\nYeah.\n\n01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.160\nWell, it's still putting someone above you like a God type figure.\n\n01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.520\nBut it's also saying like, but it's a fantasy fulfillment.\n\n01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.560\nWe don't want to have a, when we, when we do fantasy fulfillment, we don't, we don't,\n\n01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.800\nwe don't imagine ourselves as John Henry, like, we only go like, I want to race a steam engine\n\n01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.800\nand then die trying.\n\n01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.680\nLike, like, like that's my guy.\n\n01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.680\nYou know who I love?\n\n01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.360\nI woke up one morning said, I'm going to cause it like I see it got nailed to a tree.\n\n01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.680\nI love him.\n\n01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.000\nI got him on all my T shirts.\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nBut it's like, it's like Batman.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.280\nHe's like, it goes and breaks your spine because his parents got killed in an alley\n\n01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.280\nand he's like, why me?\n\n01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:45.400\nAnd we're like, that's my man be, and I think, I do, I do, I do think it's because it's,\n\n01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.960\nthey have to be rich because not only does that make it feasible for them to do the things\n\n01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.720\nthat they do, but also we have a fixation in our country where we're like, we don't want\n\n01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.160\nto fetishize the poor.\n\n01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.560\nWe want to believe, we don't want to give up on the idea that we're, we're entitled to\n\n01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560\nbecome rich.\n\n01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.560\nCapitalism, capitalism works.\n\n01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:07.400\nSo, so, so if there was like a superhero comic that was like, poor man, and it was like,\n\n01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:16.440\nlike, like one day his parents got killed from malnutrition and he decided to put a trash\n\n01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:25.120\ncan lid on his chest and grab a heavy object and go out and fight the real injustice, property.\n\n01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:31.200\nAnd we would all be like, no, that's terrorism, that's terrible.\n\n01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.800\nIt sounds like a Bernie Sanders campaign commercial.\n\n01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.440\nThere's a guy with a Bernie shirt there.\n\n01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440\nI'm playing to my...\n\n01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.920\nWhy, why do you, why do you think people like Batman over Iron Man?\n\n01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.920\nWait, do they?\n\n01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.920\nThat's what he said.\n\n01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.680\nOh, well, no, you never said that.\n\n01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.680\nBen, don't let him put words in your mouth.\n\n01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.200\nI mean, I kind of did, but I didn't...\n\n01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.200\nIs that Batman?\n\n01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.200\nWell, Batman don't...\n\n01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.960\nI hear more people talk about Batman than Iron Man, but especially like the comic book\n\n01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.520\nversion of Batman, because the comic book version, at least up until recently, was\n\n01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.360\nmore interesting, the version of Batman than the comic book version of Iron Man, because\n\n01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.400\nhe was just kind of a rich guy and he didn't have like...\n\n01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.840\nIron Man was like, waiting in the wings.\n\n01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.120\nI always loved him, I loved him before, and then I swear to God, I swear to God, he was\n\n01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.520\nmy pixies.\n\n01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.440\nAnd then Robert Downey Jr. was cast, and it was like, holy shit, but it was also like...\n\n01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.360\nIt kind of coincided with like, well, people my age were like rooting for Robert Downey\n\n01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.880\nJr. in a meta sense, it was like, it's a perfect like coalition, or whatever you call it, something,\n\n01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:43.480\nsomething with the word co in front of it, and he did great, but that was a recent thing.\n\n01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:48.840\nIron Man was like, he was handed through different studios and television shows and mediums,\n\n01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:56.400\nand he just kept enduring, because all he really does is, well, I mean, the things that\n\n01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.760\nkept accruing as that myth was handed through different studios are the things that popped\n\n01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:08.200\nfor us, like, like, like, it was, it was weird that the Batmobile was part of this mythology\n\n01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:13.800\nand not part of that, and like, but whatever sticks, it sticks, and then, I don't care,\n\n01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.640\nI'm boring myself.\n\n01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.880\nBatman's older, he's more like Paul Bunyan, he's closer to being folklore mythology.\n\n01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.520\nIron Man is like a straight handoff from a comic book property to cinematic property,\n\n01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.600\nwhere they nailed it, and now we're really into it, but really what he is, is he's Marvel's\n\n01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.600\nBatman.\n\n01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.600\nI'm not a comic book guy at all.\n\n01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.200\nAre there any like, awesome, like, women, like, superheroes that you know?\n\n01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.200\nYeah, there is.\n\n01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.200\nNah, nah, nah.\n\n01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:40.800\nNot a single one, are you flattering my question right now?\n\n01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.040\nNo, no, no, there just aren't any women superheroes.\n\n01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.040\nNo, there are, are there other ones?\n\n01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.200\nNo, no.\n\n01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.200\nBen says yes.\n\n01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.200\nYeah, well the...\n\n01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.200\nThere's Wonder Man.\n\n01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.200\nWonder Woman, obviously.\n\n01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.400\nDo you have a favorite, do you have a favorite woman?\n\n01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.400\nBig Red?\n\n01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400\nJean Grey.\n\n01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.720\nI like Big Red because the cinnamon flavor was so powerful.\n\n01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.240\nI like She-Hulk actually, she's the lady version of the Hulk.\n\n01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240\nI always thought she was pretty.\n\n01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240\nAnd a lawyer.\n\n01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:21.320\nYeah, she's a lawyer and she shows up as the Hulk.\n\n01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.800\nShe hulks out in order to defend supervillains, right?\n\n01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.280\nYeah, not supervillains, but like, maybe she does, I don't know, I've never read the ones\n\n01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.600\nwhere she shows up as the lawyer.\n\n01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:38.320\nAll I know is that she like, she got the powers because she was the Hulk's cousin, I think.\n\n01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.440\nAnd she got into a horrible car accident and she could only live because Bruce Banner was\n\n01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.120\nthe one who had the correct blood type, so he donated his blood and she got the powers\n\n01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:56.800\nand then was, she liked it, she's like, she's okay with being the Hulk.\n\n01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.120\nBut she was already a lawyer before this happened or did she go past the bar as the\n\n01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120\nHulk?\n\n01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.680\nShe went, if it's not already comic book line, I would love that.\n\n01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680\nYeah.\n\n01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.000\nAll right, well, I'm going to try to, okay, so Ben, anything you're plugging, you got\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000\na new tap dance special

01:20:24.600\nYou don't need to plug those, but I've got an Indiegogo for it and no one's donating\n\n01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600\nto it.\n\n01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.320\nWell, I don't understand, your thesis, you need funding?\n\n01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.320\nYeah.\n\n01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320\nHave we really gotten that bad?\n\n01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:36.040\nI thought we just eliminated arts education from grade schools, I didn't know college\n\n01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.200\nkids were now going, I need, I want to write a thesis about...\n\n01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.040\nIt's going on a really expensive vacation.\n\n01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.680\nIt's a short film, it's a, I'm making a, it's a Modern Day Western.\n\n01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.600\nOkay, so you have an Indiegogo, we'll tell them about it and then they'll let them go\n\n01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.600\ncheck it out.\n\n01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.080\nYeah, sure, it's, the project's called Guns Don't Lie, it's a Modern Day Western where\n\n01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:06.040\nthese two guys like who like idolize the Western, who idolize the whole Western mythos and everything\n\n01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.200\ndress up as cowboys and pull off a train robbery and then modern technology and stuff gets\n\n01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.200\nin the way.\n\n01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.200\nAlright.\n\n01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.560\nYou can find it on the Indiegogo, just type in Guns Don't Lie.\n\n01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560\nGuns Don't Lie.\n\n01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560\nAlright, thank you Ben for...\n\n01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560\nThank you.\n\n01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.560\nBen also...\n\n01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:26.560\nDid you notice that Ben around his wrists...\n\n01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.280\nI was going to ask, Ben you have a series of, it's too late now, you have a lot of,\n\n01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:36.320\nlike, will look like band bracelets, like you got, would you, you come back from...\n\n01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.920\nI'd like, I'd rather speculate about it.\n\n01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:43.040\nI think he's so young that he's, he's been to that many places in the last week.\n\n01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.080\nAre they all from clubs, bars, like bands, things like that?\n\n01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:56.160\nLike a Scissors convention, that's for sure.\n\n01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.160\nShots fired.\n\n01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:12.440\nAlright, well, what I was going to suggest is like, because I'm zeroing it, like what\n\n01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:19.320\nif we created a, because I figure if a guy's a billionaire, and then he has, like, technology\n\n01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:24.520\nand he uses it to fight crime, and gets bit by something, no, you're wrong, no, take the\n\n01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.800\nbite away, gets hit by something.\n\n01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:37.560\nWe could create a new superhero mythologies and cash in, but also that's just, I mean,\n\n01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.000\nthat's just me trying to fill.\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.800\nI got Game of Thrones to watch, we could cut it early.\n\n01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.680\nDo you know the only comic book that I ever read, cover to cover?\n\n01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.680\nSkud.\n\n01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:56.240\nDan, did you ever read Skud, cover to cover?\n\n01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.560\nWhat was, what was the deal with that bad guy in the beginning?\n\n01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.280\nWhatever happens to him, he doesn't really come back, yeah.\n\n01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.760\nHe came back in the last four.\n\n01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.120\nWhat happened?\n\n01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.880\nGot his legs cut off.\n\n01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.880\nWhy?\n\n01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.040\nFucked with Ben Franklin.\n\n01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.120\nIt's a great comic series.\n\n01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:24.280\nAny of you guys follow the Vine account?\n\n01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.520\nWhat is it, Amazing Talent?\n\n01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.480\nAmazing Talent?\n\n01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.880\nSchrab sends me all these, Schrab sends me these vines.\n\n01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.880\nAnybody see, it's amazing.\n\n01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.880\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.720\nBut I can't believe the amount of people that this planet is generating that are\n\n01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.720\nfalling.\n\n01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.720\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720\nIt's heaven.\n\n01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720\nVine is amazing.\n\n01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.920\nI fully support it.\n\n01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.000\nYou can swipe through and it's just people getting hit with things and falling.\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.160\nI don't like the, we don't like the, you know, if it looks like they really got hurt.\n\n01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.400\nI don't like those either.\n\n01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.840\nNothing's funnier than people falling down and not getting hurt.\n\n01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.400\nI don't like when they actually get hurt.\n\n01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.240\nWhen I was at USC, I was sitting on the graph reading a book and it was kind of a lazy day,\n\n01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.800\nlike school wasn't in session and I heard footsteps that sounded like high heels.\n\n01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.200\nAnd I look up and there's this young girl, I got a lot of books and she just like trucking\n\n01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.680\ndown the cobblestones at USC and she's really moving.\n\n01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.920\nShe got to be somewhere.\n\n01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.320\nAnd she just hit the ground like a mousetrap closing and books everywhere.\n\n01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.800\nI was like, oh, like, do I have to call 911?\n\n01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.760\nLike I was getting, I was getting up to go see if she needed any help.\n\n01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.760\nBut she got up and she was fine.\n\n01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:33.360\nShe dusted herself off and I was like, ah, as adults, wiping out is the best.\n\n01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.560\nI don't know how to like, like I get a vine from Schrab and it's always some crazy thing\n\n01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.120\nand then crazy.\n\n01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.120\nOkay.\n\n01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.640\nAnd I, I, I, I swipe, if I swipe in different directions and get different results, but\n\n01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.800\nI don't know what's happening.\n\n01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.280\nI feel like I'm, I'm in a dungeon crawler like, like, like game where I'm just like\n\n01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.440\nswiping and then like go ahead and like, how come, and I don't understand why if the account\n\n01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:59.480\nis like Latino people be like, and then, and then it's like, but it's just dogs falling\n\n01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.840\ndownstairs or like a guy farting at an ear of corn and it's like, there's nothing Latino\n\n01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840\nhappening.\n\n01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.480\nBut, but, but like that account, I guess maybe got popular and it was like people, we need\n\n01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:15.200\nto aggregate the, I don't know, but I'm swiping and I don't know what I'm following and what\n\n01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.000\nI'm browsing, but I know I love vine.\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.520\nBut I, but the weird thing is that most of them are comedically based.\n\n01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.960\nMost of them are based on the six second kind of orgasm of like, you're watching something\n\n01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.360\nand then something's going to happen.\n\n01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.000\nBut then it's like a certain percentage of them are like, there's this one that's like,\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.640\nI think it's called amazing talent or something like that.\n\n01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:44.680\nAnd it's just, it's mostly just teenage girls, it's singing.\n\n01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.420\nBut there's no irony that a basket, you keep waiting for a basketball to fly in a clobber\n\n01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:54.880\nroom because you're, you're like in this vine traumatic stress disorder mode and you're\n\n01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.720\nlike, wait, wait, so then it's just a girl singing kind of well for six seconds.\n\n01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:05.200\nLike, like, oh, yeah, no, well, that's not a good example that doesn't, they sing well.\n\n01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.800\nBut then the caption is just like, oh, she sings so well.\n\n01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.880\nBut then it's like, they just keep popping up and it's like, I realized today, I think,\n\n01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.400\nI think about 40% of the public sings well.\n\n01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:20.240\nAnd I don't think it's a, I don't think we can call it a talent anymore.\n\n01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240\nSorry.\n\n01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.800\nI know, I think it's, I think it's, it's like being double jointed or, or, or, or people\n\n01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:34.960\nlike me who like the smell of skunk, like, I think just like 40% of us can carry a tune.\n\n01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960\nRob, do you sing?\n\n01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.080\nAnd I don't, I don't know if you should, I don't know if you should think of it as being\n\n01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.080\ntalented.\n\n01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:49.760\nI'm just worried, I'm just worried because they're usually singing another person's\n\n01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.920\nsong and they're not playing an instrument and I'm just worried about these young ladies.\n\n01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.440\nI believe that they think you should do that and you should like make, make a chair.\n\n01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.000\nIf you're listening to me out there, like, I'm just worried.\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.120\nYou want you to bury your dreams and start making him chairs.\n\n01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.160\nMake Dan Harmon a chair and stop being such a singer.\n\n01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.560\nSo when I used to do a vine, do you watch it immediately?\n\n01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560\nNo.\n\n01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.640\nDo you watch it at all?\n\n01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.640\nYes.\n\n01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.200\nOkay, all right, so, so when you don't respond, I shouldn't send it again.\n\n01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.600\nWhat am I supposed to type, ha?\n\n01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.480\nViiiing a palooza.\n\n01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.600\nYeah, yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.000\nYou don't have to, but you know, friendship, I feel like you guys are getting closer before\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nour very eyes.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.400\nI feel like it's like you keep, like I think you guys are, it's, it's, it's, it's fake\n\n01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.160\nto pretend that you guys don't really love each other.\n\n01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.160\nThat's right.\n\n01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160\nSure.\n\n01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.160\nI'm doing my half.\n\n01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.160\nI'm doing it.\n\n01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:58.400\nNo, I keep him around because he's confusing, like to me, like I'm going like, what is he\n\n01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.400\ndoing?\n\n01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400\nWhat does he mean?\n\n01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.600\nBut hasn't that always been the case since you guys were youngsters?\n\n01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.800\nNo, I used to, I used to, you know, we were like the two musketeers and then we, and then\n\n01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.600\nlike, like, but now we're really old.\n\n01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.080\nI think our brains are dying and I'm just like, I feel like we're both just like the\n\n01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.680\nrocking, the rocking chairs of life and like it's getting really funny.\n\n01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.520\nBut I'm also like really confused.\n\n01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.320\nI think I'm, I'm not putting on a character when I'm like, what are you talking about?\n\n01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.320\nWhy did you do that today?\n\n01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.720\nBut he's, but Rob's, oh, you've always been like this, Rob.\n\n01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.720\nI feel like, yeah.\n\n01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.720\nNo, he's, no, no, it's not true.\n\n01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.720\nHe's changed.\n\n01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.720\nAnd so have I.\n\n01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.200\nNo, he's always been this weird, always.\n\n01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.600\nI don't call it weird.\n\n01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.280\nI wouldn't, I wouldn't call it weird.\n\n01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.560\nThere's always some prolonged, huge macro bit going on.\n\n01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.360\nThat's always been the case since I've known you guys.\n\n01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.760\nWell, I don't know, man.\n\n01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.000\nYou wouldn't, you wouldn't want to live in a world without it?\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:06.760\nNo, I, look, I, I'm just trying to express, I'm saying like what you see is what you\n\n01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.760\nget.\n\n01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.120\nMaybe you've lost something inside yourself that you forgot how to translate, Rob's,\n\n01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.080\nyou know, unique qualities into, into what's important to you.\n\n01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.840\nIt's you that's changed, Dan.\n\n01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.360\nI'm, I, I never doubted that.\n\n01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.880\nYeah, yeah, no, I, yeah, sure.\n\n01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880\nYeah, sir.\n\n01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.880\nIt's all right.\n\n01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:24.880\nWe've gotten very

terms of your actual like, like, like, or they haven't been like a doomsday\n\n01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:50.840\nclock and make it just characterize it as if like, as you switch Dan Harmon to off the\n\n01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:55.640\nworld goes to shit, like, you know, there's like sunshine and cows and then it like, there's\n\n01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.640\nlike a midnight point in the middle

01:33:19.160\nWell, you would probably have to have been there.\n\n01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.160\nYeah.\n\n01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.160\nYou probably would know.\n\n01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.160\nYeah.\n\n01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:23.160\nIt's not something you can knock out.\n\n01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.160\nYeah.\n\n01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.160\nSteve, did you, did you make me a

Levy, not Harmon.\n\n01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440\nYeah.\n\n01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440\nOh, damn.\n\n01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.040\nYou gotta, you gotta stay vigilant.\n\n01:33:43.040 -->

just disappeared and you're like, wait, all my money's gone, Steve, Steve.\n\n01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:02.400\nBut that would be, if Steve Levy cleaned me out and disappeared tomorrow, I would, that's\n\n01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.520\nmoney well spent.\n\n01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.040\nYou got, you got to go ahead, buddy.\n\n01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.160\nI always tell, I tell us both, but I've said that to you many times, right?\n\n01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.040\nLike acting as my assistant, like, like whenever you have to get like cash or petty cash.\n\n01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.040\nNot in so many words, but yeah.\n\n01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.960\nBut I go like, take something off the, imbecile, for God's sake, like, like, because if I don't\n\n01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.440\nnotice, then it's fine.\n\n01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.440\nYeah.\n\n01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.440\nThen you deserve it or something.\n\n01:34:25.440 -->

01:34:36.400\nsomething I don't notice, then have some because I could die any minute, take my money.\n\n01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:43.200\nNot you, but, but I'm like, I hear, I'm kind of like a Batman or

--> 01:35:09.320\nOh.\n\n01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.320\nIt's a hammer, right?\n\n01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.320\nThe hammer man?\n\n01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.320\nNo, hammer.\n\n01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.320\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.320\nHammer.\n\n01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:19.720\nHis problem, his problem is that people steal his suits and then he's like, oh no, that's\n\n01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:20.720\nmy whole deal.\n\n01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.320\nOh, see, I relate, I relate to that character.\n\n01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.320\nWait, who, uh, what?\n\n01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.320\nSomebody, somebody comes in to steal my suits?\n\n01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.320\nNo, for sure you can Tony Stark.\n\n01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.320\nI'll

suits.\n\n01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.320\nBut if I identified with anybody, the most would be Lex Luthor, I think, like, like, I,\n\n01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320\nbut it's not me.\n\n01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320\nMe?\n\n01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.320\nOh.\n\n01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320\nMe.\n\n01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.320\nOkay.\n\n01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320\nBecause Lex Luthor hates Superman.\n\n01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.320\nIron Man doesn't hate anybody.\n\n01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.320\nWho would you cast Rob as if you had to cast him as a DC or Marvel kind of?\n\n01:35:55.320

don't see in that, you know, to that lens.\n\n01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.320\nSchrab looks like Professor Xavier.\n\n01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.320\nYeah.\n\n01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320\nI mean, looks
