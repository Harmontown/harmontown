WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.360
From the Cherokee Casino in West Silam Springs, Oklahoma, only a biscuit toss away from Arkansas,

00:16.360 --> 00:29.280
and next to 17 other states right in the middle of everything, Perman Town is in session.

00:29.280 --> 00:36.280
For your entertainment delectation, let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.

00:36.280 --> 00:50.880
What up Spencer, what up, yeah, and the Mayor of Perman Town from Hollywood, California,

00:50.880 --> 01:05.280
we know him, you reluctantly like him, Dan Harmon, hello, thank you, hello America, Ossio,

01:05.280 --> 01:12.440
I learned that from Jeff, it's either Ossio or Sio, there's a controversy, Ossio, I think,

01:12.440 --> 01:17.240
Cherokee, hello, I know you're all Cherokee, Ossio, now some people say Ossio, some people

01:17.240 --> 01:22.480
say Ossio, Ossio, is it Ossio, oh I said Ossio, I'm already, see, I'm already offending

01:22.480 --> 01:29.480
everybody, no, I was so, thank you so much, it was such a warm welcome, thank you, and

01:29.480 --> 01:33.600
thank you for showing up, and thank you for paying your $15, and thank you for, there's

01:33.600 --> 01:39.200
a slow feedback building, you can mic check all you want, but you can't, you can't fucking,

01:39.200 --> 01:44.960
you can't predict that shit, you hear that, you hear that, fucking, there it is, oh that's

01:44.960 --> 01:58.120
you, everybody, well that's very comforting, we are right, yeah we're right smack in the

01:58.120 --> 02:01.320
middle, I mean even if we, I mean this isn't like we're doing a show in Oklahoma City which

02:01.320 --> 02:07.320
wouldn't be a bad thing to do either, but we are, we're in a part of, yeah Oklahoma City

02:07.320 --> 02:14.920
wouldn't be a bad thing to do, at least neutral, woo, but I'm saying more people there would

02:14.920 --> 02:19.040
be from, you know, you'd be like, oh hey, Oklahomans, and they'd be like, yay, and it'd

02:19.040 --> 02:22.280
be like, there'd be a couple people from out of state, but we are like really, we're in

02:22.280 --> 02:30.360
the Deadwood area, we're in the, we're an unincorporated like treaty turf, like, and it's a beautiful

02:30.360 --> 02:36.640
thing though, it's like a crossroads, it's like a, Jesus Christ, what are you, it's already

02:36.640 --> 02:45.040
9-11, we started the show at 9-05 or 9-06, it's already 9-11, again sometimes you have

02:45.040 --> 02:52.240
to travel to the Oklahoma-Arkansas border for a room full of people to cheer, it's 9-11,

02:52.240 --> 02:56.760
my mind is going to be thinking all night about the 8 to 12 people that bought tickets

02:56.760 --> 03:02.880
just going, let's see some comedy tonight, and I promise you people, like, what do you

03:02.880 --> 03:09.800
mean you people, I mean you, I'm gonna, I will come around to you, I think, you know,

03:09.800 --> 03:15.040
to catch you up, I made a show, I wrote Monster House, I don't know what to tell you, I don't

03:15.040 --> 03:18.520
know what to tell you why I'm here, why I deserve to be up here, it's like, how come

03:18.520 --> 03:22.720
I, just think of it like this, like you had that wedding with your drunk brother-in-law,

03:22.720 --> 03:28.280
he had this many people paying attention to him, why not me, you'll figure it out eventually,

03:28.280 --> 03:31.520
but to everybody else, thank you so much, but I was thinking like, we're right in the

03:31.520 --> 03:35.080
middle, I looked at a map of America and I'm like, you know, we all know Oklahoma is right

03:35.080 --> 03:38.240
above Texas, we could point to it on a map, it's shaped like a frying pan, you think of

03:38.240 --> 03:39.240
like business-

03:39.240 --> 03:40.880
It's not right above it, it's right next to it.

03:40.880 --> 03:41.880
It's both.

03:41.880 --> 03:47.600
What a weird thing to call me out on, that stuff, it's fucking above Texas, like, come

03:47.600 --> 03:53.920
on, don't make me nervous, like, it's right in the spot, like, if you were gonna punch

03:53.920 --> 04:01.400
America, like, it's right in the bladder, it's like, you look at Texas and you're like,

04:01.400 --> 04:06.800
yeah, that funnels down to like, you know, we piss on Mexico and like, it's like Oklahoma

04:06.800 --> 04:13.840
is like right where the processing happens, like, we funnel all of the intoxicants and

04:13.840 --> 04:18.540
things to here and I was like, my dad was born in Oki and he was telling me about the

04:18.540 --> 04:24.400
Trail of Tears and about all these things and like, it was occurring to me that unfortunate

04:24.400 --> 04:30.960
legacy that there was like an actual relocation of people and to here because this is the

04:30.960 --> 04:34.240
place without reservations, this is the place of treaties and there's like, it's just a

04:34.240 --> 04:40.120
spot, if you wikipedia Oklahoma and look at Oklahoma just colored in red, like, right

04:40.120 --> 04:47.200
where America is, it's not directly in the center, it's like right above where you pee

04:47.200 --> 04:52.080
and I don't know what that means but I think it's important to you and it's important to

04:52.080 --> 04:55.680
me while I'm here and then I'm gonna get on a plane and complain about first class and

04:55.680 --> 05:00.640
go back to LA and I didn't even like pay attention to where we were going on this

05:00.640 --> 05:01.640
trip.

05:01.640 --> 05:06.440
While we were connecting in Dallas, it's like you were being peed, you were being filled

05:06.440 --> 05:09.640
down into, my metaphor is apt.

05:09.640 --> 05:15.520
Your metaphor, yeah, it's watertight.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.200
I didn't know where we were going, I thought we were going to Oklahoma City until I found

05:18.200 --> 05:25.320
out, no, we were going to Tulsa and then, but then we're not gonna, then we're driving

05:25.320 --> 05:26.880
all the way to Arkansas.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.960
That's where I'm basically in Arkansas, like, I got up this morning, left the Cherokee casino

05:32.960 --> 05:35.560
and walked to Arkansas, that's fucking amazing.

05:35.560 --> 05:40.360
Yeah, no, you literally did, like I woke up to a bunch of texts, because there was a time

05:40.360 --> 05:45.400
zone difference and my watch didn't reset so I played Minecraft all 4 AM and I thought

05:45.400 --> 05:49.760
it was, I thought I was playing Minecraft all 2 AM and so I slept in and I woke up

05:49.760 --> 05:55.080
to 20 texts from Jeff just going, I walked to Arkansas, it's amazing and I thought you

05:55.080 --> 05:58.360
were kidding, I thought you were trying to make a point, I don't know, like you were

05:58.360 --> 05:59.360
mad.

05:59.360 --> 06:06.760
I made friends, Jesse, Austin and Hannah from In at the Springs over there, hell yeah.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.080
It's a great bar, they had Frenette Branca, it was a fucking paradise.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.280
Yeah, and everyone here has been very nice, if it seems random that we're here, I mean

06:14.280 --> 06:19.400
that's credit that goes to, because it's not random, somebody has to put effort into it,

06:19.400 --> 06:21.760
this casino booked us, they were adamant about it.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.400
The head of marketing here, Lacey.

06:23.400 --> 06:29.320
Lacey, are you here?

06:29.320 --> 06:36.360
We were all, we were all a bit excitedly confused about why are we going to this casino because

06:36.360 --> 06:43.080
the head of marketing at this casino is a Harmontown fan and she made sure, she's such

06:43.080 --> 06:50.240
a big Harmontown fan that it would have made sense if this room was empty, like when we

06:50.240 --> 06:55.520
like, she's like hardcore, like, but still professional, it wasn't like she booked us

06:55.520 --> 07:00.680
to hang out with us, she has shit to do and has been doing it, she's a taskmaster and

07:00.680 --> 07:05.160
a multi-tasker and also a lover of the show and booked us and she was right and it sold

07:05.160 --> 07:06.160
out the room.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.400
Okay, so those 12 people that I was talking about before, they were like, when is he going

07:09.400 --> 07:10.400
to start?

07:10.400 --> 07:11.400
Okay.

07:11.400 --> 07:18.480
All right, so a guy walks into a bar and he says, I want to be with a hooker and the

07:18.480 --> 07:26.760
madam is like, the hooker's cost $8 on Sunday and then the guy says, I'll take two because

07:26.760 --> 07:30.320
my brother's Irish and he says, what does that mean?

07:30.320 --> 07:38.440
He says, well, I quit drinking and my brother's Irish, so I have a hooker for him every Sunday

07:38.440 --> 07:41.840
and so he takes the hooker up and he goes and sleeps with her and he comes, he has a

07:41.840 --> 07:44.640
good time and he comes down and he goes like, thank you, I did that for my brother and he

07:44.640 --> 07:48.360
leaves, I did half for my brother and he leaves and he comes back and he says, can I have another

07:48.360 --> 07:51.080
hooker and he does it twice because you have to do it twice and then he do the third thing

07:51.080 --> 07:56.240
and he comes back the third time and he says, can I have the hooker again and the hooker

07:56.240 --> 08:00.960
lady says, not the hooker lady, that's a hooker, the hooker that runs the hookers, the madam

08:00.960 --> 08:07.240
says, she says, okay, well, why do you just want one this time, why not two?

08:07.240 --> 08:17.360
And he said, because I quit having a hooker sex and I still have it for my brother.

08:17.360 --> 08:27.480
And that joke was for the people that don't know why the fuck they're here.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.800
I think you sorted that out, I think now they know that they're in good comedic hands.

08:30.800 --> 08:39.040
You came to a comedy show and you heard of a joke told very well by me, alright, so that's

08:39.040 --> 08:44.560
about all I had to talk about, I mean, I tried as hard as I could because it wasn't because

08:44.560 --> 08:48.680
I made any assumptions about you folks based on where you live because we have too much

08:48.680 --> 08:52.280
of that happening right now and I've done it too much, it's the people that we can't

08:52.280 --> 08:57.360
see and touch that we're afraid of, that we judge and we go like, oh, well, all those

08:57.360 --> 09:01.640
people over there, they think this way, you know, all this stuff, but for all that reason

09:01.640 --> 09:06.680
I was like, well, probably the polite thing to do is to like not, don't make your show

09:06.680 --> 09:10.720
boring, don't talk about politics, it's like everyone's fucking weary, we're exhausted,

09:10.720 --> 09:15.160
go out and do what you naturally do, it would just be so charming and just talk.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.800
So I tried to like, I was like, yeah, I'm just gonna use the excuse to stay off of Twitter

09:18.800 --> 09:23.920
for two days and like not look at the news, but then I looked last night, holy fuck.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.920
What the fuck is happening?

09:24.920 --> 09:29.800
It's like a fucking sci-fi novel, we're, but I was like, are we going on stage with

09:29.800 --> 09:33.240
the president, we're gonna come off stage with the president on the lamb, like, like,

09:33.240 --> 09:38.040
it's crazy, like, it doesn't matter where you lean politically, these are like crazy

09:38.040 --> 09:39.200
historical times.

09:39.200 --> 09:44.960
The president himself is, is erroneously comparing it to Watergate, I'm like, no, it's, it's

09:44.960 --> 09:51.440
different, like, it's, I wasn't around back then either, but like, it's different, sir,

09:51.440 --> 09:57.560
you're, you're off the mark, this is weirder, you are under investigation for espionage,

09:57.560 --> 09:59.520
you are, this is huge.

09:59.520 --> 10:07.000
Um, anyways, um, back here, you're in a red state, a red state, super duper red.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.680
Look, if you voted for him, you still think it's amazing, he's the first president, he

10:11.680 --> 10:18.160
would become my hero if, like, he went on the lamb, like, like, what if the president

10:18.160 --> 10:23.880
was in South America tweeting and going like, fuck you haters, I'd be like, I know I know

10:23.880 --> 10:29.000
why you voted for him, like, it's this moxie that I get, I just didn't want it in a president,

10:29.000 --> 10:34.480
but I get it, I get it, he's got hutzpah, as the Cherokee say.

10:34.480 --> 10:39.180
You've really assimilated to the culture here.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.180
Yes I have.

10:40.180 --> 10:41.680
I've assimilated.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.680
Ceo.

10:42.680 --> 10:51.040
All right, I'll take that groan, because I don't know what I'm doing, I'll accept it,

10:51.040 --> 10:55.040
I'm not gonna yell at you guys for groaning, I'll call that a good groan, that was a good

10:55.040 --> 10:56.040
groan.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.560
Okay, so Spencer, how are you?

10:57.560 --> 10:58.800
Hey guys, I'm good.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.120
Thank you, thank you.

11:02.120 --> 11:08.840
We got off the airport off the plane in Tulsa at the airport and I lost Spencer for a moment

11:09.080 --> 11:11.080
People were just taking pictures with him

11:13.280 --> 11:17.520
Look, I don't want to keep harping on it, but again he got more applause than me I think yeah, it's weird

11:17.520 --> 11:22.800
I don't get it. I'm fine with it. I'm processing it. Well, it's fine. It makes sense to me. I'm okay with it

11:22.800 --> 11:24.640
I don't get it

11:24.640 --> 11:29.800
But I said hey Spencer, how you doing you were like hey guys you're playing to them. No, that's just it's a bit

11:29.800 --> 11:33.960
It's just that's what I do, but also. No, I say hey guys to you guys

11:35.760 --> 11:42.200
Dance being insecure right now. Yeah, let's complain about first class. You have more Midwest appeal than he does

11:42.200 --> 11:46.600
I don't know. I don't get it. Sometimes the applause is so weird. I try to wear my Spencer's shirt

11:48.680 --> 11:52.280
I was like what's the what's my where's my buffet shirt like where's my

11:53.720 --> 11:55.720
Where's my lumberjack and shirt?

11:55.720 --> 12:01.320
I want to I want these I want these folks to know I'm on their side when I go out drunk and talk about the president

12:01.400 --> 12:03.080
All right, but no

12:03.080 --> 12:11.120
I'm tired Spencer on your floor of this very wonderful very five-star very worth your money hotel and casino

12:11.360 --> 12:17.520
There was a guy walking around with a shirt and no pants. I was wearing pants and no underpants

12:17.680 --> 12:19.280
No, I was wearing underpants

12:19.280 --> 12:24.760
You were the you encountered a guy that was nude from the waist down. No

12:24.760 --> 12:26.360
No

12:26.360 --> 12:33.520
It was on your floor. I might have heard a naked man. Okay, they sound pretty similar though

12:33.520 --> 12:38.880
I thought you were part of that encounter. Lacey said there was a guy. I shouldn't divulge this. Yeah, that's I'm not sure

12:39.280 --> 12:43.920
There was a guy walking around with no pants or no underwear and cookies. He had a box of cookies

12:45.400 --> 12:47.400
That was the that was the apology

12:48.520 --> 12:51.320
I'm sorry. I'm you take the good with the bad. Oh

12:51.320 --> 12:54.480
Hey, oh, I saw your dick. I didn't want to oh

12:56.160 --> 12:58.760
But he was I mean he was removed is the moral of the story

12:58.760 --> 13:01.680
You shouldn't do that here and that guy won't be here when you come

13:03.160 --> 13:05.440
Also the looser slots in, Oklahoma

13:07.320 --> 13:11.200
I love that idea that there's a yeah, there's looser slots. I like that

13:11.920 --> 13:16.920
We had a we had a friend that worked in Vegas your friend and she had explained

13:16.920 --> 13:21.880
She was the manager at the luxe for a while and she was explaining that like there's a whole

13:22.760 --> 13:28.440
Mentality to like where they put which slots and stuff and that they the most interesting thing of all was that she was talking about

13:28.440 --> 13:33.880
How yeah, we don't people think that we're like hoping that a gambling addict would like walk in the door

13:33.880 --> 13:40.280
No, we try to they you they try to spot those people that are having trouble and try to because it's bad marketing

13:40.280 --> 13:47.960
Like you don't want somebody like walking around outside the casino going I lost my house. It's not you want the sign

13:47.960 --> 13:49.960
That says blue man group

13:51.160 --> 13:53.280
You you lose your house while you're watching them

13:53.280 --> 13:56.440
I mean, I'm not trying to be a company man here about the Cherokee casino

13:56.440 --> 13:59.840
Which is putting us up and treating us very nicely, but somebody won a house last night

13:59.840 --> 14:03.800
No, I think I know that's the big bang theory slot machine will give you a house if you get three besingas

14:03.800 --> 14:10.040
Are you mad at yes, because it's bigger than my house and it's it's not even their house

14:10.040 --> 14:13.040
It's bigger than mine. You win it if you like their show

14:13.040 --> 14:17.640
How many seasons more of community would there have to be to get a community slot machine?

14:17.640 --> 14:22.600
Do you think I think we wouldn't have to do an 8,000 seasons and then submit a form like

14:23.120 --> 14:29.360
To Sony they would be like explain to us again why we should tell the casino to put us community slot machine in there

14:29.360 --> 14:31.360
There should be a Rick and Morty slot machine

14:31.360 --> 14:33.360
Oh

14:33.680 --> 14:39.600
There should be a Rick and Morty pinball machine. That would be badass or a slot machine

14:42.040 --> 14:46.880
So there's table those are there just listening there's tables here. We're in this like like like

14:47.560 --> 14:49.680
Splendid ballroom. We've never done this kind of show

14:49.680 --> 14:56.000
It's like a it has an old-timey Vegas feel because all the audience they get they get their own tables and the tables have numbers

14:56.000 --> 14:58.760
We got Dean Martin Internet Lena Horne's over there at table five

14:58.760 --> 15:05.320
So I want I don't know how many tables there are do they go up to what do they go up to who's who thinks they have the highest table number

15:05.320 --> 15:07.320

Six okay six can we beat six?

15:14.400 --> 15:18.200
66 oh 66 oh, so it curls around

15:20.600 --> 15:22.600
Nobody I

15:22.600 --> 15:28.960
I think it's snakes around and I think you guys are like oh, it's the it's kind of the worst seat because I'm like

15:31.760 --> 15:34.440
What's the where the numbers over here high or are they low?

15:35.120 --> 15:44.360
That's one and that's 15. It goes around the coils around like a cobra ready to strike and then 25 that doesn't beat 66 sir

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
66

15:48.200 --> 15:53.720
How did you guys get 66? That's amazing. They must have added one look where the table is they they roll

They're like come on. You can get us in their VIPs. They're what do they call them like whales VIPs big big big big gamblers

16:00.800 --> 16:07.200
What do you call them whales whales? All right. Yeah, hi rollers. Hi rollers. Just walked in here with your own table

16:08.760 --> 16:13.440
Dan Dan is in a bad mood because he feels guilty that his friend and assistant Steve Levy

16:13.720 --> 16:15.720
It was his birthday last night and Dan

16:15.720 --> 16:22.040
Chose to not know that and spend the night playing Minecraft in his room. He chose to not know that

16:23.680 --> 16:30.240
He woke up one morning and said fuck that we're talking about the birthday of a man whose job is to remind me of birthdays

16:32.160 --> 16:37.480
So I I wanted it's very obvious to me that this is a story about his failing

16:39.000 --> 16:41.840
This is how Dan's pissy mood manifests

16:41.840 --> 16:48.240
It's just me explaining the facts like yeah, I remember everyone's birthday, but here is guess why?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
He fucked up

16:55.880 --> 17:00.640
I fucked up three times here what hold on just tell tell everybody about

17:01.920 --> 17:07.960
Dungeons and Dragons for a second. Oh, man. I was watching Teen Titans go this morning in the hotel

17:07.960 --> 17:15.000
Is Dan going to take a shit? Well, I'm sure we'll find out he just ran off stage. Yeah, like a panther

17:15.000 --> 17:20.480
What what what could there's ice back there? Oh shit? There's flammable fluids back there

17:21.520 --> 17:23.520
What else?

17:23.640 --> 17:30.160
How is your Oklahoma experience been so far Teen Titans go in the hotel room. It was great. Oh, man

17:30.160 --> 17:37.680
Oh, yeah, no, I just watch I don't watch. I don't have TV. So I only watch OT TV at hotels and it's amazing. Oh

17:38.800 --> 17:40.800
It's a cake

17:40.840 --> 17:42.840
Happy birthday Steve Levy

17:51.360 --> 17:52.640
I

17:52.640 --> 17:55.160
Brought you a cake from the kitchen

17:55.160 --> 18:03.200
Where Lacey got it because she saw on Instagram that it was his birthday. Did you did you grab a slice while you were back there?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.040
And it's the slice that had the word Steve on it. Yeah

18:08.280 --> 18:11.040
Wait, but it was delicious because I love Steve

18:12.240 --> 18:13.520
Sure

18:13.520 --> 18:18.320
Anyways, I brought out plates and stuff too. Why don't you cut it up and slice it up for table 66?

18:19.240 --> 18:22.920
All right table 66. Let's start with you. We'll give you a Steve Levy cake

18:22.920 --> 18:25.520
It'll be the best comedy show in the world

18:28.080 --> 18:31.880
All right, sorry you guys voted for Trump

18:34.840 --> 18:40.720
You know, come on we all are embarrassed. It's okay. I fuck up, too

18:42.840 --> 18:47.240
You know, I've broken up with girls because I wanted to play Skyrim

18:48.640 --> 18:51.200
But then two hours later, I was like, what am I doing?

18:51.200 --> 18:55.160
Will you get back together with me? No, what you fucker?

18:56.360 --> 18:59.080
You know, come on admit it. That's what you did electorally

19:02.000 --> 19:03.840
Wait

19:03.840 --> 19:08.620
impugned Oklahoma as being the state that played Skyrim

19:09.120 --> 19:12.360
Oklahoma is an artificial construct. Most of these people are from Arkansas

19:16.360 --> 19:18.360
It's a state of mind

19:18.360 --> 19:24.520
What like like like Oklahoma, do you know that old you know the Elton John song Oklahoma is a state of mind?

19:26.440 --> 19:30.000
Oklahoma is what unites all of us. We're all Oklahoma tonight

19:31.560 --> 19:38.000
What I can't see what's happening right now. I can't see Dan is pretending to slice cake. He's me. He's making them do it

19:39.520 --> 19:41.520
He's turned them into their own assistants

19:41.520 --> 19:49.640
I've never done this before. You know, you might have done is given Steve the first slice of that cake before you

19:50.200 --> 19:52.200
I don't know where Steve is. He's

19:52.800 --> 19:54.800
Probably crying because you forgot his birthday

19:55.720 --> 19:59.320
Steve Levy. Are you in the house? He's over by Lacey. Levy get up here

19:59.320 --> 20:11.280
And you're the only Jewish guy in Oklahoma

20:16.240 --> 20:18.240
What's up Levy

20:18.360 --> 20:22.200
Steve Levy, we'll get happy birthday man. There it is. Thank you

20:22.200 --> 20:28.600
Now when I left you last night at the card tables, you were 150 up and then you yeah, you ended 50 down. Yes, it's okay

20:29.120 --> 20:34.560
It was it was a really fun. I it was my birthday. We we listened to some country music at the bar

20:34.560 --> 20:39.680
We did we heard some Dwight Joachim cover soon. You guys know Travis Tritt here in March

20:42.440 --> 20:44.600
He's in the small room, but you know

20:46.160 --> 20:50.240
But he tweeted that he'd like us all to get back to work and stop talking about politics

20:50.240 --> 20:52.920
So here I am Travis

20:54.520 --> 20:56.520
You're in the small room

20:58.560 --> 21:05.200
But Dennis is serving your cake Steve over at table 66. That's great. Yeah, everyone enjoyed that cake. What's your name?

21:05.200 --> 21:11.240
Sorry, Luana Luana. I'm sorry. Okay. Well, you just took what's your name? You just took her cake. I

21:11.240 --> 21:18.560
Know you gave it to her because well you guys everyone's look. I don't want to I'm not gonna say that Oklahoma's passive-aggressive

21:21.760 --> 21:24.680
You're Arkansas, okay, fine. Jesus Christ. It's like

21:25.280 --> 21:30.280
It's like most easily in this place is like like like but but but all anyone has in common

21:30.280 --> 21:32.600
You know Luana has a death sentence in 12 systems

21:32.600 --> 21:42.040
We heard about some people there's there's people like they're like he's walking around with a plate a tray of plates and forks

21:42.040 --> 21:44.040
Oh, yeah, I forgot the cake

21:45.320 --> 21:50.520
Do you think cake Luana? It's like Randy Quaid is serving cake over here over at the corner

21:52.040 --> 21:53.880
Jesus this guy

21:53.880 --> 21:56.840
All right, let's say the table 23. How are you guys doing?

21:56.840 --> 22:02.640
Just give me some cake. Oh man. Fuck and there's a seat here. I didn't think about this

22:02.640 --> 22:06.960
But these tables would be great with guys in the bathroom or like roll. This is the most work

22:06.960 --> 22:11.480
I've seen him do outside of writing. Yes. Yeah, this is the most exercises ever had in his life

22:12.440 --> 22:16.080
Well, I mean, that's not true. They've been watching him on the elliptical

22:16.920 --> 22:21.800
He takes a shot of him doing the elliptical and then he does it. It's just a vine

22:21.800 --> 22:28.760
He spends the next 10 minutes posting that photo. Well, that's why he plays the music so they know that it's not just a loop

22:29.960 --> 22:32.360
Trying to do a podcast over here at table 23

22:33.320 --> 22:37.240
Dan, what do you introduce us to the good folks over table 23? How are you guys?

22:37.240 --> 22:41.960

And aren't you guys like 23? Why do you know about Voltron?

23:01.680 --> 23:03.680
Don't tell me Brookheimer's making some shitty movie

23:06.720 --> 23:11.640
All right, where'd you see where you guys from? St. Louis

23:11.640 --> 23:19.240
They're from St. Louis. Where are you from? Arkansas. Okay, you're from Tulsa. Okay

23:21.800 --> 23:24.280
You notice nobody whooped for st. Louis. That was weird

23:24.840 --> 23:29.680
It's the only time no one's whooped for a city. Well, they don't they don't believe you're from there until you prove it

23:30.480 --> 23:34.120
It's a little it's called. It's called the proof me state. Yeah

23:49.560 --> 23:51.560
All right. Well, what do you guys?

23:52.120 --> 23:55.160
You guys what would you like to hear me?

23:55.760 --> 24:00.600
perform my patented musical act about like like what's most in your mind right now you're a

24:00.600 --> 24:06.320
A sort of a cross-section of white America?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.800
If if if all of America has penises and

24:13.280 --> 24:18.480
Yeah, you're the heart of the loaf of a nice fluffy white bread

24:19.640 --> 24:24.600
What what is what is that? What is that that that part of America most?

24:25.960 --> 24:27.960
Think about right now

24:27.960 --> 24:31.600
Mama fucking really I think I can all right

24:32.200 --> 24:34.200
Well, you heard him

24:34.200 --> 24:40.400
Wait, did he say that or did you know he don't here repeat it? I said mama fucking because it's gonna happen, right?

24:42.560 --> 24:44.560
According to the ancient Greeks it always does

24:45.560 --> 24:47.560
Yeah, yeah

24:48.080 --> 24:50.080
Yeah, yeah

24:50.080 --> 24:57.520
Yo, yo, but can you give cake while you rap? Yeah, I fucked your mama so hard. I did it in Oklahoma

24:57.520 --> 25:01.320
I fucked her till she got home. Oh, no

25:02.840 --> 25:07.520
All right, sorry about that. Yo, oh, okay. Yeah, that was probably a good

25:08.840 --> 25:10.840
Those are mercy

25:12.760 --> 25:14.760
You gave a woman cancer

25:15.280 --> 25:17.280
That was a good that was a good request

25:17.280 --> 25:22.080
You're serving out cake and giving people's mama's cancer. I

25:23.280 --> 25:28.800
Didn't get I fucked her till she got it that means I gave her a long life like like she got it

25:29.200 --> 25:34.400
Actuarially she got it statistically. She succumbed to it after a lifetime of being cherished as a partner

25:35.040 --> 25:35.880
and

25:35.880 --> 25:37.880
She died holding my hand

25:40.040 --> 25:44.480
But she didn't have lymphoma until you fucked her she might have lived longer

25:44.480 --> 25:47.840
That's a really cynical way of looking at it

25:49.240 --> 25:55.760
Table 11. How are you? What's your name? I'm Chandra. Chandra. You did it with a hard show like it's not Chandra

25:55.760 --> 25:57.760
It's Chandra

25:59.680 --> 26:04.280
Every every well except because you're you're is that you're given name your mom was like your name's Chandra

26:04.280 --> 26:15.680
And she said people are gonna try to say Chandra. Fuck them. Yeah

26:18.960 --> 26:21.840
You said mama and fuck them so I see

26:22.480 --> 26:28.680
H-A-N-D-R-A how do you read that? Here's what I say. It's Chandra. Not Chandra

26:28.680 --> 26:36.280
It's Chandra. Not Chandra. You're gonna pronounce it the way that my mama told me. I fucked your mama so hard

26:36.280 --> 26:38.280
She got emboldened

26:39.000 --> 26:41.280
Stop giving people's mothers diseases

26:44.160 --> 26:50.480
I don't think emboldening women is a disease. I don't care how far south we go

26:52.560 --> 26:54.560
I thought you said mold

26:54.560 --> 26:59.560
He said that and then he just served that cake like it was a mic drop. It was amazing

27:03.720 --> 27:07.000
Look, but look everybody at the surrounding tables might have

27:08.240 --> 27:13.280
You don't have to apologize like I don't look I'm giving amnesty to everybody that voted for Trump

27:13.280 --> 27:15.800
I don't care if everybody in the room did or everyone didn't like

27:16.600 --> 27:23.680
Amnesty let them let them slowly come around to the like like that's our only chance right now

27:23.680 --> 27:26.920
Let them give them the space that they need to be like oops

27:29.040 --> 27:36.040
Right we live in a world where no one wants to be wrong from a drunk person like the part of their brain that gives you keys

27:36.040 --> 27:38.040
Isn't in control

27:38.160 --> 27:43.360
Just let them like I'm as guilty as you are I get mad and then I'm like, but it's like what's the solution here?

27:43.360 --> 27:48.720
It's understanding we got to prove and what are we what are we at war for where we want we want understanding

27:48.720 --> 27:50.720
I didn't clear the room did I did people leave?

27:50.720 --> 27:54.560
It's about love my mother's

27:55.640 --> 27:59.040
All right, whatever. I don't know what I'm lecturing you about. Thank you table 11

28:02.200 --> 28:05.680

29:02.340 --> 29:06.420

46:42.860 --> 46:47.360
Oh, yeah, I met him as a guy too. Yeah. Yeah

46:48.860 --> 46:50.860
The so the

46:51.500 --> 46:53.860
Met her as a guy. What the fuck is my problem? Yeah?

46:56.540 --> 47:03.180
You guys don't care you're like give me a break. All right, don't tell us we don't care now. No, we're offended. I'm sorry

47:04.940 --> 47:07.500
Sorry, I offended you. I'm not okay. All right, so

47:07.500 --> 47:11.780
Oh, yeah, how do you fall 100 feet under your face? Okay, so let me set the scene

47:12.780 --> 47:19.660
I was in Minneapolis is pitch-black dark. We're like, you know, we're kind of bored. It's a Friday. There's no shows

47:19.660 --> 47:23.700
We didn't have any gigs. So we're like, let's gonna go. Let's go climb some tall buildings

47:23.700 --> 47:28.340
That's you know, we do that on regular Thursdays and stuff. So why not a Friday?

47:29.220 --> 47:32.820
Whatever it's like 2 a.m. Really really dark like I mentioned

47:32.820 --> 47:37.420
So we're climbing this ladder that doesn't stop and then we get to the top

47:37.420 --> 47:40.140
The ladder didn't stop. It didn't feel like it was

47:40.740 --> 47:43.820
Anyway, I have a little bit of OCD is like 92 steps

47:44.820 --> 47:49.820
Like climbing and then we got to the top when we were walking and I didn't wait for the flashlight

47:49.820 --> 47:53.060
That was my first mistake. The flashlights were behind me two of our dudes

47:53.580 --> 48:00.340
Marshall and Adam and there's like this like like a ceiling tile size hole in the top of this building

48:00.340 --> 48:06.700
And so I'm just walking enjoyed in the cityscape. I got it. Okay. I was mixing a drink. I thought I could multi-task

48:08.380 --> 48:10.380
Are you in a cave?

48:13.060 --> 48:18.060
Climb in buildings. There's this lie. It's you're on the outside of a building. Yeah, like it's like a fire escape ladder

48:18.060 --> 48:25.420
Yep, okay. It's an old abandoned green bin mill thing. Okay, and there's a hatch above you

48:25.420 --> 48:32.380
Right. No hatch. We were on the outside of the building. That's a little opening climbing. Yeah, and it's like several openings and

48:33.100 --> 48:38.100
Afterwards I found out like eight other people had also fallen and only one survived. Oh

48:38.900 --> 48:40.900
You meant that no

48:42.580 --> 48:47.140
Later on I found out I was actually the most fortunate person in this incident. Yeah

48:47.140 --> 48:49.140
Well, one of the most

48:49.700 --> 48:53.380
Fortunate people I should say and that you had said let's all do this and that everyone else

48:53.380 --> 48:58.780
Yeah, now it's a thing. Everyone's still doing it. It was dark. There was a hole in this in the ceiling

48:58.780 --> 49:04.140
Yep, and you fell through it straight through a hundred feet. I tried to put my arms out like everything

49:06.540 --> 49:12.060
How long did it take so it felt like it took forever by the same time it was happening so fast

49:12.060 --> 49:16.060
It's really like time. Yeah, it's like a thing when you're yeah when you're following it's crazy

49:16.060 --> 49:23.420
You know you like miss the last step. You're like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's no grounded man. It's just oh my god

49:23.540 --> 49:27.700
So I just want to be clear about this you crawled up a ladder on the outside of a building

49:27.700 --> 49:32.100
And the reason you fell is because as you thought you got to the top of the building what should have been

49:33.380 --> 49:36.980
Please walking on the roof and then there's a hole. Yeah, there's a hole

49:37.700 --> 49:42.020
Straight down it. Yeah, I just want to be clear about that. Yeah, so you're falling down through

49:42.020 --> 49:47.660
Just nothing. Yeah, the only thing I could think of was like a spike was just waiting for me

49:47.660 --> 49:50.620
And I was gonna get like games of throwing type of crap through my back

49:50.620 --> 49:56.060
That's like, I mean, there's such a good chance that there's there's not a pillow at the bottom. Oh, yeah for sure

49:56.060 --> 49:58.060
I was praying for water

50:04.780 --> 50:09.300
So you're facing were you facing up as you're falling no I was like

50:09.300 --> 50:14.540
You know arms in the air, uh-huh, maybe don't care what did but anyway, I was like

50:15.460 --> 50:18.460
Turn down for what? Yeah, well everything at that point

50:18.980 --> 50:22.700
But so I'm shaking like a Polaroid picture. Yeah. Yeah, these are all things that go through your head

50:24.300 --> 50:30.060
No, so I hit my feet and I like normally I roll out cuz I skateboard and I like you know jump off

50:30.060 --> 50:33.660
You know roasts and stuff and roll out you like compress your fall. You see yeah, yeah

50:33.660 --> 50:39.300
You're been ninjas do that kind of combat. I mean, I don't know. So you're saying you learn from skateboarding that you should like curl

50:40.060 --> 50:42.060
When you fall

50:42.100 --> 50:44.100
It's the PLF

50:44.500 --> 50:48.660
Together and you turn to the side. He knows I'm talking about so that's what I did

50:49.220 --> 50:54.660
No, but you forgot that other safety instructions don't climb up a hundred feet of ladder without like a rope

50:56.420 --> 51:00.780
You're falling now through a hundred feet of space to a well known dark

51:00.780 --> 51:05.580
It's anywhere from like 60 to 100 feet was never actually like measured out, you know, we didn't really

51:06.620 --> 51:11.140
So all right, so but really you hit your face first. No, not my face

51:11.140 --> 51:14.260
I um, but I did it. That's what the report said, you know, how you know

51:16.260 --> 51:20.060
No one really if you would horribly fell on your little tuchus and you were like, oh

51:21.060 --> 51:24.380
Broke in the process. I like try to roll out and it's like

51:24.380 --> 51:32.460
Concave concrete said the bottom of it. So it's like a funnel up the ends and some rolling into like a wall of concrete

51:32.460 --> 51:36.020
That's like, you know slanted the kind of escape ramp, but not as much fun

51:37.460 --> 51:39.460
I thought you landed on your face

51:39.460 --> 51:44.740
I smashed my knee which which broke my you roll into it and come up and pull a front side faking

51:44.740 --> 51:51.020
No, I wish I try I was trying to rock and roll and just get out of it. You know, did anything change about your life after that?

51:51.020 --> 51:56.100
Oh, yeah, starting with injuries. I mean, I mean not a PTSD and stuff. Did you get fucked up?

51:56.100 --> 52:01.180
Did you break? Oh, yeah, I like my femur is like broke like this. I don't know how you

52:01.420 --> 52:08.860
He's making a gesture that's like mr. Burns if he missed his fingers while trying to tend to them. Yeah. Yeah, I think they call it interlacing

52:09.740 --> 52:15.540
Not excellent. Yeah, it's not excellent. So if mr. Burns trying to say something was excellent, and then it wasn't it just went

52:15.540 --> 52:22.440
No, uh gears messing together your yeah, so just just your your basic. Yeah talking about like a bone

52:22.440 --> 52:24.940
It's like so much force is like

52:25.740 --> 52:31.540
Like lightning patterns couldn't go can break any more than it was breaking so it decided to break my pelvis

52:32.620 --> 52:34.620
Let's not blame the bone

52:37.300 --> 52:39.300
Some of these, you know some of these

52:39.300 --> 52:45.180
Sometimes it's the reverse our president said sometimes it's

52:48.300 --> 52:51.180
Since your pebbles got sheared or shattered or what happened there

52:51.180 --> 52:56.700
Yeah, so then my pelvis broke, and I didn't even realize that this bottom part broke because I was like

52:57.700 --> 53:00.020
I was all focused on when my face hit, you know

53:02.020 --> 53:05.660
Your face is your fortune. Yeah, like I mean not really anymore. I grow up beards

53:05.660 --> 53:11.580
You don't see all the weird stuff. Oh, you have like scarring under your beard. Yeah, I didn't think I'm glad for you

53:11.580 --> 53:16.060
There's a camera. I should look at it. It's like this. You see that. I I could see yeah

53:16.060 --> 53:18.060
I can see a scar you're pointing at it. Yeah

53:18.420 --> 53:23.340
So were you a mess of blood and guts at the bottom? Oh, man. It was blood guts mud

53:23.460 --> 53:29.940
There's bones sticking out here both hinges my jaw. I like all these teeth are these are fake

53:29.940 --> 53:36.660
Check check out my old dentures. I can take out the ones I got on now, too. I can verify he has a bag of teeth

53:38.980 --> 53:46.340
They're not the ones those those yeah, it's a Harmontown first table table 52 for 200 bucks these teeth can be yours

53:47.540 --> 53:49.540
One roll of the dice

53:50.340 --> 53:56.300
Over a thousand a piece is ridiculous. Yeah, and I had to get to you're walking around and talking like you're losing a Christmas

53:56.300 --> 54:01.580
This is crazy. You're very lucky. I mean just looking at you. Oh, yeah, whatever whatever's going on internally

54:01.580 --> 54:05.620
You must be in a lot of pain probably at one point. They said I was paralyzed in the hospital

54:05.620 --> 54:10.380
And I like I wouldn't take that as a yes answer. I was like, no, I'm not like you can't move your legs

54:10.380 --> 54:15.180
I was like, yeah, I can't yeah, you can't I was like, so if you're paralyzed and you're listening fucking suck it up

54:15.180 --> 54:21.100
Buttercup not really though. Not really. I know I know you didn't mean that but I always I always I always think that way

54:21.100 --> 54:26.060
Yeah, see when they when they show things where it's like the kid fights cancer and then over comes it I'm like, well

54:26.060 --> 54:31.020
What if your kid doesn't like what are you supposed to be like? Well, so go I should go fuck myself like I didn't work hard

54:32.380 --> 54:38.380
Oh, yeah, yeah, I didn't think positively enough. I don't like I deserve cancer. Okay, sorry

54:39.100 --> 54:44.940
But no, you're very lucky and because you I expected I fully expected and was I was you know

54:44.940 --> 54:47.580
Like he said you fell a hundred feet under your face and I thought oh, yeah

54:47.580 --> 54:51.900
This is this is good because I want to punish like like anybody who thinks the like

54:52.980 --> 54:56.860
Performing should have to do with looking like Jeff, you know, like I want to I want to show

54:58.220 --> 55:01.900
Like I want to I want to I want to I want the new standard of beauty to be reality

55:01.900 --> 55:04.700
But then you came up and you're all good-looking and you just fell on your face

55:06.540 --> 55:09.020
Okay, well show is deformity. Yes, why we're here

55:11.580 --> 55:14.540
He looks like he could have been like in the almond brothers or the eagles like

55:14.540 --> 55:16.540
Like he looks like

55:19.420 --> 55:23.100
The headband what's the what's the deformity you're gonna show us

55:24.300 --> 55:28.460
Mic up close you can hear it and everything. Oh, this is this is the tea thing. Okay. Well, okay

55:28.460 --> 55:31.740
You're gonna pull out your bridge. It's like a fake. It's a little more than a bridge. Okay

55:32.940 --> 55:35.820
Oh, no, it's more than oh, okay. All right. Well, okay

55:35.820 --> 55:45.500
Okay, oh, oh, show me show me Luke. What on earth is happening?

55:46.300 --> 55:51.100
You have a there's like a bottom. They're a separate one. His mouth is like a sarlacc pit

55:53.740 --> 55:57.500
Like like yeah, you're you're you're you're didn't you kill both of us are just all gone

55:57.740 --> 56:00.940
Just gone. So I have to take these out when I eat. We're still growing bone density

56:00.940 --> 56:07.020
These have a way more gums on them. Like they're building the gums back up. So yeah, we had to do another surgery here

56:07.100 --> 56:10.220
They'd like popped out my leg and scraped out some bone marrow

56:10.940 --> 56:12.940
shoved it in there with some animal

56:14.540 --> 56:15.580
I mean, I've knocked on wood

56:15.580 --> 56:19.500
I mean eventually something's gonna happen to me and it'll be the worst thing of all because I don't have the balls

56:19.500 --> 56:22.460
To climb a ladder so I won't have the cool thing falling on my face

56:23.020 --> 56:26.860
But but all of us eventually learn the human body is like

56:26.860 --> 56:32.780
It's just like a 57 Chevy. They start telling you like we're gonna take a muscle from your ass and put it on your head

56:32.780 --> 56:36.300
Just mark everything clicks and cracks now when I wake up in the morning and like stretch now

56:38.380 --> 56:43.500
So so Levi had also tweeted he said he said you have you know, you have feelings you want to share

56:43.580 --> 56:47.340
I don't want to put you in the spot like it's more than just you there's always more details

56:47.420 --> 56:51.100
Usually it's not so enlightening like this. I started getting on terry eyed and like yo

56:51.100 --> 56:58.140
I was in a coma for five days another five days. I couldn't walk or speak to remember my dad's name. Uh, it just gets depressing

56:58.540 --> 57:01.820
Well, we know we know that that's rough to go through. Oh, for sure. We'll get the coma thing

57:02.140 --> 57:03.740
Yeah, the coma is no fun

57:03.740 --> 57:07.260
But I like the worst part is remembering it all they're always like, oh, you're gonna forget

57:07.580 --> 57:11.820
like you you you're playing your brain blocks pain after so much time, but like

57:12.620 --> 57:17.500
I don't know man. I still wake up the night dares. I didn't know what Kanye West was talking about when he first came out

57:17.580 --> 57:19.340
That song but now I think I get it

57:19.340 --> 57:21.340
What did he fall through?

57:21.580 --> 57:23.580
Sometimes you have to fall 100 feet

57:24.540 --> 57:28.700
Sometimes you have to fall 100 feet and land on your face to find out what Kanye is talking about

57:31.900 --> 57:37.900
He'd be happy to know that a guy just fell on his face and was in a coma. He woke up and he's like what?

57:38.060 --> 57:43.020
Oh, yeah, okay. Anyways, the um, but uh, shit. Shit. Shit. Wait. What was I gonna say?

57:43.020 --> 57:50.140
It was on the tip of my tongue fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Bad show bad show. It's a good show

57:50.700 --> 57:52.700
Thank you. Thank you

57:52.700 --> 57:55.820
Oh, I know what I was gonna ask on forensic files. There was this lady

57:57.580 --> 58:03.260
There was a lady on forensic files and she uh faked getting knocked out by an intruder

58:04.460 --> 58:07.420
Who then took her baby and killed it because she wanted to kill the baby

58:07.420 --> 58:13.100
Uh, and she had this so part of her story was he came in and he karate chopped me and uh,

58:13.180 --> 58:15.260
And I don't remember anything after that and all this stuff

58:15.420 --> 58:21.020
And so they went into this whole thing about like when you have a trauma that rattles your brain enough to knock you out

58:21.500 --> 58:23.500
It's scientifically

58:23.580 --> 58:30.300
Like it's a fact that the moments before that trauma are it was there a while when you had no idea what was happening

58:30.460 --> 58:33.500
What like what has happened for sure there's more details too like

58:33.500 --> 58:38.380
When they had to come and uh get me it took them two hours to find where I was

58:38.540 --> 58:40.620
So I'm like at the bottom of this hole

58:40.620 --> 58:45.500
My I got a tooth that went so far up my gum it is coming out my bottom my nose right here

58:45.500 --> 58:50.540
Like you could feel the wall. I have to check in with somebody. Hey, uh, luanna. Look. Okay. What was your name again?

58:50.540 --> 58:51.500
I'm sorry

58:51.500 --> 58:53.500
Luana we're seats in the house, right?

58:53.660 --> 58:55.660
Yeah, okay. All right. See bye

58:55.660 --> 59:04.460
I just realized I was like I can't see you so I think okay. You're like 50 you're tweeting like $15. Fuck you

59:06.140 --> 59:08.140
There was there was

59:08.300 --> 59:12.460
Let's bring luana. Well, she's got it's her whole table. Yeah, but she'll be a representative

59:13.900 --> 59:15.500
They could switch

59:15.500 --> 59:20.220
Also luana, you know, you don't have to come up in case you fell and you're like I paid $15

59:20.220 --> 59:26.220
I went to the show. I couldn't see it. Then they brought me up and humiliated me

59:29.500 --> 59:33.900
All right, so all right, uh fell on your face, uh, okay good

59:34.060 --> 59:37.180
Oh, and he said he said you had a he said you had a rap

59:37.420 --> 59:40.700
I do I have a little like an emotional rap that I made about it

59:40.940 --> 59:45.740
It also is like some of it's calling you out jam, but not personally. Oh, shit

59:45.740 --> 59:50.940
I uh, I love to be called out when it's not personal. It's not personal because I know how it's just about my work

59:51.580 --> 59:53.580
It's just business. Yeah

59:54.220 --> 59:56.220
That's that's my least sensitive area

59:57.180 --> 01:00:01.900
That's why I do what I do. I just I listened to the podcast all the way through so often at work

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.460
I became a little paranoid and I thought you were talking about me

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:09.500
I thought you remembered me from a show way long ago. I'm glad you don't because I made a fool of myself

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:15.020
Oh, no, wait, so you really what tell me about that experience. Yeah, uh, you met me after a show and I

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:21.020
You were I mean you might not remember because you're kind of angry and you know something. I don't want to say anything bad

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.900
I'm going to in the rap. So okay. Well, what yeah, wait, wait, wait

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:30.620
I wrote it down. No, where did you meet Dan the first time? What was this? Uh, I was in Chicago. Yeah, okay

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.140
So we were on tour during the uh, was this on stage or offstage?

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:40.300
Offstage so what what you're saying like what I met you. I was in a bad mood. Yeah, you're like, uh,

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:46.300
I don't remember a word for word, but you weren't happy. You're like, you told me I was blacklisted. I was nervous and welcome back again

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.740
To the to the venue in Chicago that could have been it

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500
I don't know that this happened

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.660
Now I don't know if I won that craps game like what's going on

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:05.100
What do you mean blacklisted when I use that phrase casually Dan told you you were back

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.340
Yeah, like 69

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.300
What you were 69. Oh, oh, I'm sorry 86

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.060
You may you may have misinterpreted an experimental phase of my

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:26.540
Numbers, you know, I go on tour and I think let's try some stuff. You thought I was blacklisting you

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.420
Sometimes dan likes to 69

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:35.980
I got a sexual uh, okay, so you felt 86 not 69 right dan because he was in a bad mood

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.980
From my twitter feed from I don't remember

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.700
But you wrote a rap about it. This is why I don't think it happened. No offense. All right

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:49.660
Well, wait also did it happen before or after you felt it happened after I felt okay great

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:55.260
Good to know. All right. Well, I was also like this and I was like really mean and you couldn't see through my

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.740
teeth

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.740
Like what is he saying? Oh, okay

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.500
So I why all right. I didn't have a smile like I do today

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:10.300
All right. I bullied a differently abled person in Chicago. No, you didn't told them that they were blacklisted from life

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.660
Any care

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.060
Mutually filleting each other

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:23.500
Uh, but it's and you wrote this rap to do you want to beat you always want to do your I don't know it's more like uh

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.620
I could give you a beat

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:31.980
On thursday like my parents my parents like don't go you like you're scared of them. I was like, how are you?

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.620
So now hi luana. Welcome to hell. Yeah, thank you

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.060
Yeah

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:47.100
Luana do you want a shorter rap and then like a longer rap? Okay. He's pulled out a tiny notebook pages

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.620
Wait, well, let's hear the short one and maybe we'll want to hear the long one

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.980
Yeah, would you like to and the crowd went mild

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.220
I'll do the I'll do the flipping

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.780
Okay, this is

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:03.580
Can I hold that I'd feel much more comfortable if I could hold that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.220
Luana's blog entries is just getting better by the minute

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:15.020
Uh, I started from the beginning. I guess the short one. I think where the pencil mark stops and the pen begins

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.980
This is just a short one. Okay. We'll start here and we'll just go you can just stop whenever

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.620
All right, this one's not about the fog is a little shorter. It's just about like, you know

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:30.220
Shit, this is about you hitting Dan Harmon or just no, this one's just random not this one. We'll save that one for

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.220
I want to I want to hear

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.860
We only signed up for one rap

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.260
No, we want to hear we want to hear we want to hear we want to hear how you Dan Harmon hurt you

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:44.060
Okay, I was really angry and I was there's this new strain of paranoia that came out in a

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.620
Tocable form. All right

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:50.220
Let's see here. All right, you guys ready? Yeah

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.540
Just because it's now plugged in under your name after you already achieved mainstream

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.340
Doesn't mean you can claim fame and truly belongs to me

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:02.220
You're a part of a bigger hypocrisy as far as you can see. This is a need to be time to be free

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:09.180
Page turn because morality is immortality. I will rise above this and what you should trust is the words coming out

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:15.500
My mouth is it's not served with sauerkraut. That shit is about foreskin with your next to kin. That was disgusting

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.860
I know you know what I mean talking sausage about all these postings now dissecting what has already been

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.540
posted

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:28.700
Spoken there we go spoken out now here. I so loud took everything I had and I hope you're happy now

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.820
You changed to be all right someday flight you behind you

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:37.340
Um on the true night not forever been signed to nothing to no one's center once in the coma

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:43.820
Never had it. Well never had money to keep a honey or a honeypot. I'm seriously turning me down

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:50.700
Nope, not now far as I said a pc child as shit goes wild once you hear the sincere queer step to this mic

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.100
Not for telling my might

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:59.180
But the most horrible horrors one that make me my own orders all the clouds I resonate through as I

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:03.820
Incriminate you because I ain't got nothing to lose talk about falling down on your nose

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:10.620
It's just as red as the clown of my neighborhood. You know what sounds good. So I can't you write your own shit instead of being a

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.620
We

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:18.780
Behaving worse than a clip one of which I had no part of because I'm starting up my own rapper's world one

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:22.060
Which you won't be a part of they already know your own ones won't

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:28.060
Drive your own car because you're more addicted to those screens that you're most likely will never escape

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.260
E no, I'm not talking about nor the time I would tell you the story not once but twice assure me

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.460
You did everything. All right. Well got ready to prepare the ice

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.420
Right here three because you got the need after the fight. No, I'm not gonna be nice everyone

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.820
I talked to had the chance to provisions are low

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.420
Especially when I was held up in bed never even read nothing

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.420
But this shit through a tube said it's really good for you, but hold up

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.300
Let's rewind fell a little more than two stores, bitch

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:59.820
Please post it up my left leg you see the blast struck straight through my knee through the fema so far, you know

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.900
I go so hard

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:08.540
After my fema was flux splintered on through next was we're approaching the summer and Elvis ever spit rapping making shit

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.660
Fall fame what you gotta say better when you spit your own

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:16.460
Our guides have died. Not your hair doesn't mean in there trying to ninja roll out and I let out a shout

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:22.060
Couldn't make it through I tried to tuck and roll. Let's just say I never made it to the show

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.020
Yeah, I bet you already know judge me by my teeth

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:31.260
I had something more frightening than lightning for fucked up face worse than any mace head backs bounce back

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:35.260
So high fell out my left eye broke up my over luck

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:39.660
Upper and lower chompers couldn't see for weeks stole my shit while I was weak

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:44.300
So I said wouldn't it be nice if this person and that person would join in but now I know the truth

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.740
And that's the truth is ain't what within you imagine if I took something from you

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:52.220
You jump up through the roof more than you spoof go poof gets a little better as it goes on

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.540
I laid it all out

01:06:54.540 --> 01:07:01.260
Halfway done you guys now it's dressing and others who want to bling repeating the words as I move towards words country

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:06.300
All the things you see through the tv or the internet where most of our time is spent once said I couldn't rhyme like that

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:10.060
But that was in reference to my presence and now I know you see the truth

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:14.540
And you should be free trouble too for one day you will slip and I will be on top of it

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:20.940
No, it's not just a zip. There is no reason to even know you already know what I'm talking about say fuck you on this fine day

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:25.820
I hate it when you talk about my friends phone where I memorized the ring tone

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:30.380
Y'all know the bones so I'm trying to phone and I told you I told you twice and that's all right

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:35.260
You see isn't saying the drunken hall of fame. What a shame. You know, you know what it's about me

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.100
It's like one time about you there's no reason for you to recover the old track

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:42.940
You never want to go back afraid of the new hashtag with your name on it

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:48.860
Maybe you should try a bonnet suck your thumb again because I know you a pelican crew one hit wonder boy

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:55.020
I wonder who else and wrap out seven minutes about somebody else's business. Just just be your true self. Maybe I do

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:57.980
Hold on. Maybe I do

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.860
Even we're even we're even uncle uncle

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.540
Uncle even better where I think we're less than halfway through

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.860
Thank you. We're not we're not we're not

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:20.140
I it's darker a little harder. We're gonna close the show by him reading male wolf. Should we do it another day?

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:25.420
Thank you very much. That's a lot to put out there and like yeah, I mean

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:32.220
I didn't get to the mud in the blood part, but right. Yeah, I got hungry when you said sausage sausage and sauerkraut

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:36.780
Yeah, that's the first page Jeff. Yes. That's when I checked

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:44.780
It's like I'm 44, but all I can get is the irony that it's like well, it's a scathing indictment of someone who's abusing the

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.620
Time that they are getting on stage

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.900
Oh, my bad. I don't know. Well, it's just it's just sort of like that's all I can get it's all I'm getting is that

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:59.260
It's like I really scared to say why you're up on stage and you're not mindful of the individual's listening

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:04.540
And there's somebody there's people out there. They're human beings and human beings and feelings and human beings are entitled to

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.540
Be entertained

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.620
I get to that

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:14.780
Right, you get to that but you got to that you I mean you now know what it's like to have stage time

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:20.860
Like you had an unequivocal fucking like a microphone like focused on you, but he would have been there for three hours

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.100
He would have no there's no and wait

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.780
What if somebody came up to you after that show after you did that for two hours?

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:30.380
What if somebody came up to you and like I don't know what I don't know what happened

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.460
I've never said the word blacklist

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.620
Outside of it. Yeah, I've never heard you say like like but but what if so what if you had a

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:42.300
Disatisfying encounter with somebody after a show and then what if that person then was at your next show?

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:47.340
What if they were like, I want to tell you about your show or the show and then you're like, well, it's hard to do a show

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.140
Because oh, yeah, that's this dude is rapping his bells

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.940
Uh, let's let's let's check in with luana. Ron. What did you think about that rap?

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.940
Ha ha ha

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.620
And I'm sorry it was long and I wish you had about a bigger book to write it

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:07.980
Thanks, that's page terms

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:10.380
Understandable

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.820
Luana, what's your deal? What are you up to these days?

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:15.900

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.900
I'm just here

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.340
Dan Harmon

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:28.940
Where are you from? Arkansas. We're part of Fayetteville Fayetteville. Uh, did you go to school there?

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:31.740

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.580
Mark cuz my cars broke down right now

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.420
Your car broke down. Yeah having transmission problems

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:49.340
And I said, hey, I bought my ticket. Also. Will you please let me drive with you. Yeah

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:54.940
No, that's awesome. All right. What's it like to be on stage next to luke? It's a luke, right? luke

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.740
That's good

Thank you luke for your awesome rhymes and uh sharing

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:25.740
I gotta say it takes a lot of courage to come up on stage and admit that you were told never to come around him ever again

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:32.700
Like you could have just been pulled so quick and yet that was one of the first things like you said it pretty early

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.100
But where's my medal for going? Oh

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.820

I thought we were getting to know luwana

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.380
We're

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:57.580
You don't have a show. My whole show is shitting on you. That's all I have

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.300
We have a woman on stage that we haven't even spoken to and you want to start bringing up other people

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.900
I

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.780
luwana doesn't want this kind of attention anymore than the luwana. Okay. I mean it was like

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.540
Yeah, what else would you ask? What else would you ask me?

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:34.540
I mean she said that like she she knows that that's the actual answer scientific fact

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.100
Do you have a favorite color purple? Is it dark?

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.260
Why is dark purple your favorite color? Like why is that love?

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.580
It just feels it feels like love to you. My grandma used to wear dark purple

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:53.020
You loved her. Yeah, she's gone. She said you said did she's when did she go away?

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.020
Uh

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:59.740
I'm not good with dates. This sounds really bad. You have a symptom of the ad

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:02.220
Dan has a wrap up about your grandma. Yeah

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.020
How hard did you fuck her?

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:14.960
I'm gonna lock eyes with her. So I luwana's grandma was named linia. He fucked her so hard. She got chlamydia

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.960
Oh

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.720
Right seems like kind of an obvious place to go but yeah

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.880
I would have been much more giving I think Dan you would have been much more nuanced about that. Yeah, exactly

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.880
Uh, no what I was gonna do is I was hoping like I was I wanted to bring somebody else up that was like, okay

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:45.440
What's the opposite of a guy that fell a hundred feet? I do his face and that has a wrap about how I done him wrong

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.480
Which would be somebody who maybe has anyone been launched into the air a hundred feet

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.560
And or is very happy that they met me or something just to

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.520
It's just for me. It's just like I'd like to balance it. We got people pointing at other people

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.480
It's very curious to me. Like you're like this guy loves you so much

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.440
And he can fly

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.680
Uh, is it true would your friend wise your friends pointing at you?

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.680
He thinks that you admire me and think that I'm an inspiring figure in your life

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.240
Yeah, do you would you tell would you tell me about it in front of people?

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.920
You don't have to but if you would it would make me feel better

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:35.920
You can take the birthday seat

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.680
Hello, what's your name? Tim and you're from arkansas. I'm guessing markin son

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.680
Hmm

01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.200
I'm getting good at this. All right. Well, I'll tell me tell me how you how you love me

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:10.080
I don't I don't know if it's that astounding but I I'm just kind of a failed writer and

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.520
And I'm impressed with

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.600
with your

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.480
Your writing it's like you're the opposite of a skateboarder

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.080
What what didn't you write?

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:32.000
I've not written a lot of scripts. Okay scripts and screenplays and stuff. Okay. Yeah, a lot of poetry. Cool

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.160
Luanna, what's your when you say failed writer Tim? You mean you failed how?

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.880
Oh, I just I don't know what I mean. I'm just you know, I'm an introvert my friends made me come up here

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.240
You wrote you write and you're not Dan Harmon is what you mean, right?

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.640
You're not like a nobody wants to call himself a writer ever. We were just talking about you

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.520
At the table with my friends that I just met who are who are awesome

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.560
They gave me

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560
this bumper sticker

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.480
Anyway, oh nice Harmontown next tangent

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.160
So what were we talking about? Okay

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.480
We're talking about you table the table was like, uh

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.480
You know

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:23.040
Sorry, don't worry, but I it's me too. I do the same thing. Believe me. It's every show

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.160
I was that's why I was I was shifting over to Luana for a second when you got adjusted to the because this gets boring really fast

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.240
Believe the trust them, uh

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:36.000
But I was gonna say Luana. What's your uh, what's your like not your current job?

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:42.320
But like the one that you feel failed at like either it's because you didn't take piano lessons or what's the thing that you would have done

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:48.800
That you should have done that you are you you still think about like fuck. I didn't do that thing

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.840
I failed it all of my job

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.280
It's like I just need money so I

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.320
Right

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.280
It's not it's just not like a dichotomy where it's like my dream life and then my regular life

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.440
Something just kind of okay. Yeah, I guess come to think of it

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.360
We sort of create that dichotomy in Hollywood because we're like, what if poorer people didn't kill rich people?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.880
I guess it would be because we showed the movies about how working in a factory was just as good as their dreams

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.520
And the way we do that is by fading in on someone who has a dream and a factory job

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.840
And then we factory out these like myths to people what factory do you work at?

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:39.360
I work it's called Walmart. Mm-hmm. What's your what's your post there?

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.240
Um, I work at the home office. I answer calls about registers

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.440
Answer calls about registries answer registers if the register breaks

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:55.360
Oh, wait. Are you like a technician that fixes the register? I know I just take the call about it

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.000
To the person who will just tell somebody there's a thing broken

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I'll send it to the next level. Do you live in constant fear of people realizing that your job could be?

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.520
There's a phone on the left side of your desk and a phone on the right side

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.880
And then someone's gonna notice that you could connect the cords

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800
I'm laughing because uh

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:25.520
I'm a cruel person. I guess I know I'm laughing because I've been there. I guess I don't know. I like that's okay. Well

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.600
What oh, yeah, okay. All right lights are out. Okay. That's the they found out we were playing craps on stage

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.680
Okay, so back to you see I forgot your name Tim Tim easy name to forget

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:44.320
Now you're a little more relaxed like, uh, uh pitch us your app

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.520
No, I don't know

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.160
I just want to I just brought you up. Is it like I was like somebody hug me

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:57.520
What if you uh, what kind of writer are you would it be? Uh screenplays or novels or short stories or

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.800
Poetry really poetry really poetry. Yeah

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:06.960
Yeah, the thing is like you can be a failed poet and die and then people find out later on that you were a great poet

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.960
That's what I'm counting on

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.080
But that's what makes it the hardest job of all because you're like, well, how do I know when I've started or finished?

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.240
I'm like, I'm gonna write some poetry today

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.320
Well, maybe maybe this blank page is my poem

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:26.320
Or maybe it makes me identical to a non-poet and then you're like, I'll put a I'll put an a

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.680
Like that might that might be the best poem ever. I will never know. Yeah

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.680
we uh

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.680
so what I was trying to say before

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.440
is you

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.400
Put yourself out there, uh, you you you stand up here and show people your failure

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.040
Your your true self

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.080
But also your your your accomplishments, right?

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.200
And it's impressive. That's that's what we love about. Yeah, I take it for the team

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:59.360
I'm like, look if I can do this, you know, come on. What are we afraid of? What's your worst nightmare ending up?

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.080
like up here going like

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.240
That's my show

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.120
And then you're like, here's $10 $15 and you're like, there he is going. Uh, I go

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.040
I can do it like when like I think it's a service. I like it

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:22.640
I like connecting with people. You're talking to him or me. Okay him. You want to pull him from Tim?

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.000
Yeah

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.960
Do you have poems that you you would never you seem like a guy that would never want to share one of your poems?

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.280
That's a challenge

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.640
I'm sorry guys. I I don't have a memorized. I'm not a

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.480
I'm not a spoken word poet. Yeah, sorry. But the thing is like

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:47.360
Poetry is an important thing. Like I I'm only recently getting into like poetry like and like really reading poetry because

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.920
Poetry for me always seems like something it's a little

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:55.520
Distant and like you have to be smart or like like it's like listening to jazz

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:00.960
Like like that that horn solo by cold train is like it's above my

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.200
My musical brain and you read poetry and it kind of escapes you a bit

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:10.800
But if you really sit down and listen to poetry and let it wash over you it actually is really important

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.640
And also like and I'm not being reductive or diminishing at all like luke

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.520
Like what you what you read for us like that was poetry and that was like it's cool for people to write things down

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.920
Just for the sake of writing them down and saying them out loud or putting them on paper

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:31.680
So like to be a poet is uh important. I think especially now when our president can't can't finish a fucking sense

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.200
Absolutely. Also. He's the only is the only president and hey, I voted for him too

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.840
He's just not the most literate president we've ever had

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.840
We can all admit that I voted for not kidding. I'm gonna hear that voted for trump

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:48.560
And let's not make this political he didn't have

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:53.440
He didn't have a poet laureate at his inauguration because he's not poetic

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.160
And I think we need poetry in the world right now more than ever so to have people

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.160
all that

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.920
I am suspicious of everybody who always everybody who has a problem with words and I've always had that problem

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:13.920
And believe me I acknowledge the fact that uh the left side of the political spectrum has had a problem with words more than anybody

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.160
Whose phone was that what okay good just make a sure sorry

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.360
I mean I've been I've been as much like I you know people have told me you used the wrong pronoun

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:31.840
You did it again. I did it to Levi. I did it like and I like I I have the biggest foot in your mouth kind of like

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.640
Old fat white guy kind of like face of the of the enemy of progression

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.800
Uh kind of syndrome going on and for the longest time it was very easy for me to be like Jesus christ

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.880
He's fucking politically correct nazis and all this stuff, but and there is a part of us

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.080
The the best part of us that's like, oh

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:57.440
Let's all let's all just start being really really nice to each other and let's have a rule that you have to be really really nice to each other

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.320
and then and like now actual

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.200
Like actual bad ugly like hatred has come out of the woodwork and the weird really weird thing is that

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:14.880
A lot of the people who have been the most adamant to adapt to a world where we have rules about what we say are the people that are now

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:21.520
Forced to acknowledge that fuck the only enemy of this thing is like verbal nudity

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160
Is like making mistakes

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:30.960
Babbling like saying what you actually mean if the more people do that and also it has to be coupled with if you're wrong

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.520
Then someone says that offended me. They don't mean you shouldn't have been born

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.400
They don't mean that you shouldn't have any money that you have they don't mean that you should lose your job

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.800
They mean that offended me and you can actually just be like like, okay fine, then you're easily offended whatever

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.600
But what is my fucking point?

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.160
I just like like I'm we're all awash in this this this weird zone right now

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:03.360
And like I I have no idea like you you're awash in this weird zone like Harmon like we have work tomorrow

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.800
I I don't have a point. This is usually the part of the show where I spiral into like a really

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:17.840
Accidentally eloquent rant. Um, it's it's intentional and not an eloquent this time. And it's just your tough luck. You're out 15 bucks

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.880
You'd have lost a lot more out there this last two hours

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.520
It's it's there's those those machines are designed to rob you I don't care

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.920
And then I just I just throw everybody into the bus and

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.480
get on a plane

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.240
I don't know what I'm saying. I'm scared and fat and white and sad and

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:44.800
Straight and I I guess I offered to 69 a guy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your applause. Thank you. That's very brave. I

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:52.080
Don't know what we're having a small meeting. We're having a small meet and greet after Dan's gonna 69 10 people after the show

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.600
I will 69 everybody that hasn't been 69 now Tim a friend of yours

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:02.560
I think handed you a phone. Is that somebody handing you one of your poems for us to read or to hear?

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560
Yes, oh really?

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.760
What if I mean you know that you know that we're gonna even if it sucks we're gonna pretend

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.520
It's awesome because like you're

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.120
Because we that's how humanity works. Can I do a small interlude real quick like

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.800
Whatever your politics are whether you are pro-trump anti-trump whatever whatever your stance is right now

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.400
Um, he didn't have a poet at his inauguration, which is normally the case. Oh, that's what I was saying. Yes

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.160
and

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.920
I want to read one quote that is is what John F. Kennedy said at his inauguration

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.400
Or maybe not as an auguration, but he said at some point when power leads a man to arrogance

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.120
When power leads a man toward arrogance poetry reminds him of his limitations

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.320
When power narrows the area of man's concern

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:54.160
Poetry reminds him of the rich richness and diversity of existence when power corrupts poetry cleanses

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:58.800
So I would include Luke in that and everybody and also Dan and your ramblings

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.480
Like like the idea of the idea of saying what's on your mind and being able to say it

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.600
Semi intelligently hopefully very intelligently like the idea of like of

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.840
Expressing thought in a world where right now like it's just dying on the fucking vine like we have

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.880
Uh, we've got Tim on stage who is a poet and and is worried that you're a failed writer

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.080
You're not a failed writer. It's fucking gorgeous that you are a poet in a world without poetry

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.480
I know what you're thinking. How do I follow that? I know what you're thinking

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.960
That's

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.320
Wow, but the answer is with sincerity and like look

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.800
Yeah, you've got nothing but runway here. Okay. You saw what we put up with

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.800
This

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.880
You know Dan played fake craps with a bunch of guys that didn't know who we are

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.600
You know how bad this show is

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.680
You're you're you're good Tim. Tim lay one on us, please

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.560
Uh, okay. I'm just gonna read it. This is called challenger deep

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.840
I'll just read it

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:14.480
In truth once more, uh, I stood shivering clinging to starboard gear unnatural fear

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.600
Braided lines strained out of roiling water

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.240
snagging sea monsters

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.320
trawlers coaxing nightmares to light

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.800
When ancient head near breaking pacific lines snapped

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.720
The behemoth sank back to the deeps caverns unfathomed

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.680
Four times over the morning course we drug the bastard skyward

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.360
Four stolen hooks left us ragged shrouds of algae

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.280
Midday and the captain ordered a final angle

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600
I think he caught my ashen face

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:53.680
Ordering me to take lead either fear-abandoned ship or the cowered dog's body

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.640
I lurched forward

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.880
clutching leaded nets shouts fell away above a submarine missile shadow

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.280
scuttling aft

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:09.360
Thod under dying wake tiger propping herself on deck resting on pectoral fins

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.560
As a child might lean elbows on a soda counter

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:18.400
Powerless I caught myself searching sunken stocking eye incredulous mates tails

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.120
Some hideous king swallowing whole to become man to walk on land

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.640
To seduce to spawn and amphibious

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.400
To devour mothers to drag fathers through the void

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.960
Anvil skull

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.960
Smiling rows of arrowheads

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.440
Thanks Nick

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.880
You bet

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.880
I like the size of the page

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.680
Scrollable page

01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:05.920
Also, we can say for sure you're not a failed writer. That's magnificent, man. That's really cool. You've been given a horrible task. You have to keep writing

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.600
You have to keep writing for no audience. You have to keep doing it whether you like the only person that can evoke

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:17.760
They can say those words. It doesn't matter. It's just like that is that I guess that's what I was trying to get at is like

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.320
we this this thing about

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:27.920
Fashion and like when we're saying the right thing and the wrong thing and how that reflects upon whether or not we want humanity to progress

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.880
Uh, it's like well, we've actually fallen back to a position where okay

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:40.560
There's a war between the people that think you need to say what you feel and a war and the people who think that that should be actually put over here

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:48.480
Well, you do things that affect people and that you lie that that's what politics should be and all that stuff and like it's

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:56.480
It's no matter what you voted for and no matter what your politics are and no matter who how your family leans and what you think people forgotten

01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.960
What sickens you and how you're sick of this and all that like I like to think that everybody that

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.240
Like that I would want to hang out with as somebody that agrees that it's better to just barf out

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:11.840
Shit like and some of it will be silk and some of it will be dessert from last night

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:19.200
And some of it will be ugly and some will be beautiful and like we gotta sort it out like like it's just our job

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.960
Why am I why am I explaining that to you? You're a poet

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:29.280
But that's what I love about this podcast is that you guys throw it all out there and I worry too much as a poet

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.480
I worry too much about that's the enemy making it perfect. Did you hear the open my giggle episode where he was like?

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:38.160
Yeah, the enemy is stopping. It's like oh, it's that it's that idea

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.280
I've said that a thousand times to young writers because but I never follow this advice ever ever

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:49.360
I've never followed it once is that the idea that your your job is to write something good is why you're not writing

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.480
Because who the fuck is going to write something good? It's great advice

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.200
Your own it's your own definition of good writing is going to be automatically better than anything you've ever written

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.000
And if you're worth your salt so that you know, that's not what you're going to write

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.160
You have to write something underneath you have to write shit that you think is bad

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:09.120
You have to get get to that level and you just like like like like get it out there

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.640
I never do it. I never do it

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.320
I sit there and go like fuck it and then someone calls and says you're fired tomorrow

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.600
And then I go fuck you then and they're like this is fine. I'm like, yeah, it was fine

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.520
Because I'm a genius

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.520
And then I say on Twitter, I'm a genius and then you guys say I'm a genius and then I come to Oklahoma and do a show and

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:34.640
People get cake, but overall I don't know

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.200
Uh, all right. Well, thank you Tim for that poem. I really appreciate it. Thank you Tim

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.360
Tim real quick

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:47.120
Before you go. Is there a uh, is there a way for people to find your poetry online that we can go look at?

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.920
Or is there a last name or a thing that we want to find?

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:56.800
My last name is miran m u r e n you might find a couple of things out there if you really want to search for them

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.600
Yeah, well, I do. Yeah, that's cool. Thanks. Thanks Tim

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.080
He had that pause for a second. He was like

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.840
My last name is and I was like, oh here we go. He's like

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.960
My last name is hitler, but

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.320
Here's the thing

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:26.800
Like I'm I'm obsessed with nautical imagery and I learned it while my grandpa told me about hitlers conquests at sea. I

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
But I'm not one of those hitlers

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:36.080
I'm a self-loathing hitler. Loana. Are you an artist anyway? Do you have any artistic leanings? Not at all

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.520
None

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.360
You don't you don't sing you don't dance. You don't write. I can't cut a straight line

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:48.640
With a scissors you mean like she says she's all crafty. My whole family is I can't cut a straight line

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.600
I can't draw. Are you young enough for me to ask how old you are?

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.280
That's a good age

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.560
I think that's how old steve is now

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:08.240
I kind of have this it's a it's a it's a horrible human urge. I want to see you panicked

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.440
Like I want to wait. Whoa. Jesus christ

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.640
Well because she's so evolved and relaxed. I'm like what makes her panic. I said it was a horrible urge

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.840
This is the dynamics great

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.200
So you're thinking like like you you're admittedly not an artist any

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.840
any way

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.880
None

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.520
But you're you seem just cool as shit like you're a mellow

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.520
Maybe that's a secret. I think artists are all crazy people like but they have to have to have to say something

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.480
We like get off their chest so they can relax, but you just seem

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.640
Naturally relaxed my art is not worry

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.240
No, this is a real thing. You're buddha

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.880
Your art is yeah, it's big

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.880
I I this is a real thing. I've been thinking about because I'm writing this this book that's

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.000
You know I was gonna also rob people other money, but but uh

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:04.880
The where I'm like, I'm thinking about like human evolution and how we're like we're all like coming from chimpanzees

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.200
I'm sorry if you didn't vote for that. Uh, I know you're all liberal. It's fine. And I didn't mean that if you're not

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.480
I'll do it. I'll suck your dick for a dollar

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Don't beat me up

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.280
No, no, let's not check it with them. We checked it with them enough

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.080
But no, I love to think that they hung out and then they're they're like, what who's Duncan Trussell? And then they're like

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.760
Think all that too, uh, but but but I

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:46.960
Like I was just thinking about like chimpanzees and like the fact that like we as a species like the species that we evolved from

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.960
Like our shtick became

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:55.040
Alarm like like if you want like like we peaked at like we're like so satisfied

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.800
We have no enemies

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.920
We were like

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.360
The only thing we had to worry about was like leopards coming at us and then we just became this

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:07.760
Like this species that was like we'll sit here. We'll eat. We'll fuck. We'll hang out and then if anything fucks with us

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.960
We'll go

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.960
And then everyone will go like run away

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.320
And now today we just like walk around with these devices in our phones

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.520
And it's just like everything that alarms us is the thing that sells

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.400
It it's it's bigger than just like the news. It's like our stories are about like you're gonna die

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.560
How are you gonna deal with that? How are like like we're addicted to

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.760
We're beyond addicted to it. Like we're built on it

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.920
Like we're we are just people that like we don't think that anything could possibly be fine

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.480
And as a result

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.840
Nothing is ever fine. Like there's always shit to worry about which continues to feed itself

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.280
It's like it's like a junkie saying well, I only do heroin when my life's going really shitty

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:57.600
Like yeah, and it's you're you're guess what that's gonna be Wednesday. It's gonna keep happening like like because

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.840
Like you're putting yourself in that zone like we've been doing that

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.560
But there's unlike with heroin or booze or anything

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:09.520
There's absolutely not a single human being or even carbon-based life form. That's not a

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:16.400
Not on this thing. So no one's ever gonna call us on it. But that's what we're doing. We're like sitting around like

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.680
figuring out how to freak out and

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:27.280
And we like we're never gonna stop unless we actively decide that we have a problem and have like a 12 step meeting where we're like

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:33.760
We we love freaking out. We don't want to do it anymore. We're always gonna want to do it

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.400
Let's go to the moon and like not freak out anymore

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.120
I don't know why i'm laying all this on you like

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.120
I'm fine. You're you're working at walmart and you're like fine. I'm projecting onto you and i'm like here's the thing luanna

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:54.080
You're so laid back like do you have you're so laid back you do you have anxiety at all like

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.880
I don't want to say you're laid back

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.040
But when you lay around the house

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600
The house goes back

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:08.400
Do you ever have anxiety that you you get you get hung up on shit

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.640
Or are you are you bullshitting us? Are you are you just that that mellow even keeled all the time?

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.640
Or is it something that you you have to like sublimate and eat up that anxiety

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.840
Like can you bury it down? You're a raging inferno inside?

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.560
Yeah, you're about to go off

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:29.120
I'm like fine with being a raging inferno. I like this

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.960
You're you're fine. You're fine with us accusing you of being a raging inferno inside. She's fucking with us

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:41.840
She's fine with everything. I mean, I'm asking are you is it is it possible to be just completely laid back?

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:48.800
Or are you are you keeping some shit buried? Like I freak out, but it's not for long. I don't stay mad long

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:53.760
I don't do anything for long. You don't hold grudges. No, that's good. That's great. Yeah

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.480
Is there anything and I know the answer is no

01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.840
Is there anything that you repeat to yourself when you start to get upset that makes you relax?

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:07.520
I know the answer is no because you don't because you're like you're just like, oh, I'm relaxed like I'm trying to learn things like

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.600
Oh, whatever

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.160
I'm sorry. I know

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:20.960
He's asking he's asking you to tell him that you have a mantra that keeps you cool, but you're probably just cool

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.240
built in

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.520
I want that to be true, but that's not true

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.440
Yeah, you want to help me because that would be great, but you're fine with you're fucking fine

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:38.000
I just watch tv all the time and like I would spend weekends just listening to your commentary on community

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.520
And it doesn't and nothing I say

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.160
You know, listen, I'm trying to tell you in those commentary. I'm like, well this episode could have been better

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.120
Luanna get upset

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.680
And you're like

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.840
What do you want what's what do you watch like do you watch true crime?

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.720
Law and order special victory

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:01.760
So, okay

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.720
So you're gobbling up a little it's fictional crime. Yeah

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.160
Like yeah, I don't if I watch like 48 hours or something like that

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.560
It freaks me out because I live alone and then it's like oh someone's gonna kill me now. Yeah

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:16.880
40 hours is always about a woman who got fucking murdered by some asshole

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.200
And it's just some random person on the street. It's not like a husband or anything

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:25.520
It's like they didn't know him and they saw him and then now she's dead

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.960
It's funny because it's true

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.640
Uh the uh, I snort when I laugh sometimes, sorry

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.480
The uh, he doesn't want to he only snorts when he's around somebody beautiful as you if

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.280
If in your in your laid-backness

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.480
You could you osmotically understand that I'm an uptight person that

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:56.720
Is driven by his ability to make people happy which means people have to be unhappy

01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:01.680
I have to make them happy. Is there anything I can do to make you happy even if you have to lie?

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:09.120
Like you just say like oh if you pulled down your pants I would make my day and then I pulled out my pants

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.520
That's not a don't say that I chose that suggestion to take it off the table

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.320
I know you know you shouldn't

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.080
I'm saying like I'm saying like like like like help me

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.360
Like you're privileged. You're relaxed. You're asking her Dan. You're saying that you you want

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:32.080
Flawed people to be fixed by your creativity and you're asking her to be flawed so that you can make her happy

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:36.400
Yes, but she clearly is a happy person. I know and I don't like that. But yeah, but

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
She likes you

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.480
Otherwise like she already likes you whether or not she's flawed. I'd like her to be different

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.600
And if she's so cool she can do that for me

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.000
You're trying to fix somebody who doesn't need fix it. I'm trying to break her

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.360
No design she came prefixed it's nothing to do with her but break her

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.080
This is exactly why she doesn't watch 48 hours

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.800
Yeah, all right. All right. Fine. Fine. Well, stay up here. Let's I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:18.080
Unless you don't want to I'm gonna go out to the audience again

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.520
Yeah, you guys like it you like this part welcome to heaven. All right table nine. What's going on?

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.160
I tried to send you a drink

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.960
They wouldn't send you a drink. I got plenty. I got plenty

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:39.760
Well, right on you got kettle one right on for sure

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.200
Table nine table

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.080
Table nine needs bread

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.800
Table nine table nine clearly doesn't need more alcohol

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:58.320
Oh, you have a community book. What is that a sense of community essays on the television series and its fandom edited by

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.560
Ann Guy Lee, what is this?

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:04.640
A friend of mine is a college professor and actually has a book about your show. Wow

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.160
Take that Chuck Laurie

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:17.200
Don't see a lot of books about that. Well, thank you for bringing that and having that out in the open

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:20.720
It was just to give me a boost, right?

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.960
Oh, that's it back to this guy see

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:32.480
We love you for people that don't know our show that anyone that happened in here tonight like the gamblers in the back table

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.880
Uh, this is a show about Dan asking the world. Do they love him and the answer?

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.400
Yes, the answer is yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We love you

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.360
All right, okay

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:52.000
All right. Well, I think that easy. I still want to get more data, but he's angry at loana for not needing to be fixed

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.200
I just look. I don't know what I'm doing

01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:05.040
I just I have an internal gauge where I'm like if I spent $15 I'd walk away going. Oh, that's awesome. I robbed him

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.640
Take out $200 and say one more game of craps

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.340

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.280
Where the dirt's red

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.880
Where are my grandpappies from? Yes. Yeah

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:47.280
Uh, when's the last time there was a tornado here? Uh,

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.280
a couple days ago

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:53.200
Like all the time and a bunch of people died and it's in bad taste for me to bring it up, right?

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:57.120
Uh, I guess yeah, if you're not from here. Okay. Good

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.240
Well, thanks for dressing like my show. Uh

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.280
You just meant uh shy rick. Yeah

This tiny rick. There's the shy rick. All right table 46. How are you doing pretty good? What's your name? Conor? Conor

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.840
Conor

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.240
What are you? What's uh, what's what's your fit? What what what are you?

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.840
You're

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.320
Oh, come on. Don't I mean you can both be conor. Let's

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.880
It's that that's actually that

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:32.240
All right, never mind sir. I was going to break up a terminator thing and say everyone can be conor guys, especially

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.520
He says that he's you from the future. Yeah, I am and that you

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.520
You

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.400
No, but he says that he's here because you don't exist anymore

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:52.160
And uh that you're dying on an atomic level

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.080
That's what he said

01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.560
Sorry to put words in your mouth

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.440
And then you had you had some insight about that

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.920
I don't know if I should just keep giving the mic to everyone that just has a theory about the multiple conners

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:11.040
But I was just I was just saying like if it's a if it's sort of a pantheist kind of spiritualist thing

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.160
It could just be both interpretations of the same basic connor

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.560
And where are you from sir, uh, louisiana louisiana. Oh, yeah

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.800
I guarantee

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.960
You fucking yeah, exactly. That's a lateral point of view. Did you did you drive here from louisiana?

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.320
Okay

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:31.760
It's uh

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.880
It was it was a bit of a drive, but I kind of broke it off through dallas

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:38.640
I drove up to dallas and then drove from dallas to here and

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.240
Isn't that out of the way?

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:45.280
It's it's a bit out of the way, but there's a place to sleep

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.240
You drove from louisiana past oklahoma to texas and then came back here

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.360
No, am I am I bad at jay? All right. I've lost I've lost control of the show

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:05.280
That's not your fault. It's it's me. I'm a bad entertainer. All right. I don't what do we do?

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:10.400
How long have we been doing a show how much show have we done? We probably have like eight minutes left

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.040
Oh, yeah, we do or 14

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.640
But probably probably nine

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:20.800
Let's go let's go with 14 at least I say dan

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.040
Are there two handhelds that you could take in the crowd? What do you mean? Like uh, are there two wireless?

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:31.040
Oh, yeah, because the people I'm talking to they don't have a mic and then it's just me walking around going

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:35.120
Who are you and then they and then you hear a mumble and then I'm like, oh, that sounds crazy

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:38.080
No, I mean there's not there's only one wireless

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:43.200
So maybe like maybe you do a roving rap through the crowd like you I'll just be better at a transience

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.000
Itinerance errant night. Wait. Sorry. What's your suggestion? He wants you to rap

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.720
Oh a roving rap. Yes, maybe maybe you do like a groovy rap through the crowd or something

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.880
Right, right, but not quite yet. Like make some friends

01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:00.240
Rapping about mamas is a crutch says this guy

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:04.160
But wait is rapping a crutch or just about the mamas?

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.040
Mike Eagle

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:11.760
Mentioned a crutch for freestyling. You can't fall back on your mamas. You're right. No, you're right

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:15.520
But I mean I'm traveling. I thought I could go back on the crutches if I'm going out of town

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.240
Thank you for reminding me. Do you should watch a show called max headroom that was produced in the 80s

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.240
You look like the kid that created max headroom

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.600
His name is brice lynch the character's name is brice lynch. He looks exactly like him

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:36.240
Rap about you about crutches. Okay. Are you setting me up because like your mom uses crutches and you you want to punch me and say, okay

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.080
Well, yeah, what if I rapped about crutches then I wouldn't need to use

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:46.880
The mama crutch. Okay, Dan. Do you think we've traveled all the way here to uh, the oklahoma arkansas border

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.320
That you could do a rap that was mama free like completely

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:55.200
Like that you could get out of your safety zone and not fuck any mamas

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.760
Just let me try

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.640

He's sitting close to amber and I should have observed that

You don't just go around the table

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.920
there's a

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:45.280

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.080
from high school and uh

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.720

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.840
I yeah, I'm sorry for that language

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:14.400
But okay. All right. Sorry. All right. Well, hey, maybe you don't want me to take my shirt off if I'm so

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:24.240
I mean Dan sounded like you didn't like my rap. I don't know why you'd want to see my naked body

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.560
Right, I mean

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:33.760
Let's give you the freedom to fuck as many mamas as you want, but you don't have to don't don't make the mama thing a crutch

Let's continue the

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:49.440
All right, I don't think

Okay, yeah, yo, yo, okay. Yeah. Also, you're allowed to leave right now before this happens

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.960
When you go downtown and you eat some soup

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:06.240
You're gonna eat it and tell you poop. It's gonna be liquid because it wasn't solid

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.120
I fucked your mama because my name is dj collet

The Midwest is the place to be you go down to the panhandle and you take a pee

01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:39.840
I'm down to Texas and it funnels down to Mexico. That's where you don't want to go

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.760
You gotta build a wall. I voted for it. I fucked your mama so hard. I exploded her tip. I'm sorry

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.760
I said I fucked your mom, but I also had a pretty good rhyme there

01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:55.680
Because I rhymed exploded and voted which was unintentional

01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:00.480
Ah, man, just just don't

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:13.760

Hey dittle dittle your mom is in the middle. I rap so good

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:31.760
I played the fiddle. I don't want to fuck your mom so hard to go home. Fuck your mom is where the buffalo roam

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.360

All right, all right, just like it's $15. What do you get?

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:53.280
They get $69 after the show. I gotta combine

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.160
Taking up how much I got enough time to be naked and go out into the audience, right?

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.200
Oh, yeah, you

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:10.960

Oh, thank you. Is it Lacey? Is that illegal? Okay, that's fine. It's fine. If you give me, okay

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.360

Yo, he's got five shows up here. Yo, he wants to destroy himself

01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.920
Yo

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:39.200
Yo rap is an art and art is rap. I fucked your mom until she couldn't crap

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:41.760
I stopped her up with my dick

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:48.320
Yo, I made your mama sick by having sex with her. It's a crutch. I'm sorry

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:53.200
I can't not rap about fucking your mama

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.760
It's hard. I I'm really self-conscious because I think I might have a skid mark in my underwear

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:06.880
It's a really good chance of that now. You're subconscious thought about that dancing in a room for those strangers

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.880
Yeah, yeah, that was the last thing I thought
