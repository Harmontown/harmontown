02:01.320\nmiddle, I mean even if we, I mean this isn't like we're doing a show in Oklahoma City which\n\n02:01.320 --> 02:07.320\nwouldn't be a bad thing to do either, but we are, we're in a part of, yeah Oklahoma City\n\n02:07.320 --> 02:14.920\nwouldn't be a bad thing to do, at least neutral, woo, but I'm saying more people there would\n\n02:14.920 --> 02:19.040\nbe from, you know, you'd be like, oh hey, Oklahomans, and they'd be like, yay, and it'd\n\n02:19.040 --> 02:22.280\nbe like, there'd be a couple people from out of state, but we are like really, we're in\n\n02:22.280 --> 02:30.360\nthe Deadwood area, we're in the, we're an unincorporated like treaty turf, like, and it's a beautiful\n\n02:30.360 --> 02:36.640\nthing though, it's like a crossroads, it's like a, Jesus Christ, what are you, it's already\n\n02:36.640 --> 02:45.040\n9-11, we started the show at 9-05 or 9-06, it's already 9-11, again sometimes you have\n\n02:45.040 --> 02:52.240\nto travel to the Oklahoma-Arkansas border for a room full of people to cheer, it's 9-11,\n\n02:52.240 --> 02:56.760\nmy mind is going to be thinking all night about the 8 to 12 people that bought tickets\n\n02:56.760 --> 03:02.880\njust going, let's see some comedy tonight, and I promise you people, like, what do you\n\n03:02.880 --> 03:09.800\nmean you people, I mean you, I'm gonna, I will come around to you, I think, you know,\n\n03:09.800 --> 03:15.040\nto catch you up, I made a show, I wrote Monster House, I don't know what to tell you, I don't\n\n03:15.040 --> 03:18.520\nknow what to tell you why I'm here, why I deserve to be up here, it's like, how come\n\n03:18.520 --> 03:22.720\nI, just think of it like this, like you had that wedding with your drunk brother-in-law,\n\n03:22.720 --> 03:28.280\nhe had this many people paying attention to him, why not me, you'll figure it out eventually,\n\n03:28.280 --> 03:31.520\nbut to everybody else, thank you so much, but I was thinking like, we're right in the\n\n03:31.520 --> 03:35.080\nmiddle, I looked at a map of America and I'm like, you know, we all know Oklahoma is right\n\n03:35.080 --> 03:38.240\nabove Texas, we could point to it on a map, it's shaped like a frying pan, you think of\n\n03:38.240 --> 03:39.240\nlike business-\n\n03:39.240 --> 03:40.880\nIt's not right above it, it's right next to it.\n\n03:40.880 --> 03:41.880\nIt's both.\n\n03:41.880 --> 03:47.600\nWhat a weird thing to call me out on, that stuff, it's fucking above Texas, like, come\n\n03:47.600 --> 03:53.920\non, don't make me nervous, like, it's right in the spot, like, if you were gonna punch\n\n03:53.920 --> 04:01.400\nAmerica, like, it's right in the bladder, it's like, you look at Texas and you're like,\n\n04:01.400 --> 04:06.800\nyeah, that funnels down to like, you know, we piss on Mexico and like, it's like Oklahoma\n\n04:06.800 --> 04:13.840\nis like right where the processing happens, like, we funnel all of the intoxicants and\n\n04:13.840 --> 04:18.540\nthings to here and I was like, my dad was born in Oki and he was telling me about the\n\n04:18.540 --> 04:24.400\nTrail of Tears and about all these things and like, it was occurring to me that unfortunate\n\n04:24.400 --> 04:30.960\nlegacy that there was like an actual relocation of people and to here because this is the\n\n04:30.960 --> 04:34.240\nplace without reservations, this is the place of treaties and there's like, it's just a\n\n04:34.240 --> 04:40.120\nspot, if you wikipedia Oklahoma and look at Oklahoma just colored in red, like, right\n\n04:40.120 --> 04:47.200\nwhere America is, it's not directly in the center, it's like right above where you pee\n\n04:47.200 --> 04:52.080\nand I don't know what that means but I think it's important to you and it's important to\n\n04:52.080 --> 04:55.680\nme while I'm here and then I'm gonna get on a plane and complain about first class and\n\n04:55.680 --> 05:00.640\ngo back to LA and I didn't even like pay attention to where we were going on this\n\n05:00.640 --> 05:01.640\ntrip.\n\n05:01.640 --> 05:06.440\nWhile we were connecting in Dallas, it's like you were being peed, you were being filled\n\n05:06.440 --> 05:09.640\ndown into, my metaphor is apt.\n\n05:09.640 --> 05:15.520\nYour metaphor, yeah, it's watertight.\n\n05:15.520 --> 05:18.200\nI didn't know where we were going, I thought we were going to Oklahoma City until I found\n\n05:18.200 --> 05:25.320\nout, no, we were going to Tulsa and then, but then we're not gonna, then we're driving\n\n05:25.320 --> 05:26.880\nall the way to Arkansas.\n\n05:26.880 --> 05:32.960\nThat's where I'm basically in Arkansas, like, I got up this morning, left the Cherokee casino\n\n05:32.960 --> 05:35.560\nand walked to Arkansas, that's fucking amazing.\n\n05:35.560 --> 05:40.360\nYeah, no, you literally did, like I woke up to a bunch of texts, because there was a time\n\n05:40.360 --> 05:45.400\nzone difference and my watch didn't reset so I played Minecraft all 4 AM and I thought\n\n05:45.400 --> 05:49.760\nit was, I thought I was playing Minecraft all 2 AM and so I slept in and I woke up\n\n05:49.760 --> 05:55.080\nto 20 texts from Jeff just going, I walked to Arkansas, it's amazing and I thought you\n\n05:55.080 --> 05:58.360\nwere kidding, I thought you were trying to make a point, I don't know, like you were\n\n05:58.360 --> 05:59.360\nmad.\n\n05:59.360 --> 06:06.760\nI made friends, Jesse, Austin and Hannah from In at the Springs over there, hell yeah.\n\n06:06.760 --> 06:10.080\nIt's a great bar, they had Frenette Branca, it was a fucking paradise.\n\n06:10.080 --> 06:14.280\nYeah, and everyone here has been very nice, if it seems random that we're here, I mean\n\n06:14.280 --> 06:19.400\nthat's credit that goes to, because it's not random, somebody has to put effort into it,\n\n06:19.400 --> 06:21.760\nthis casino booked us, they were adamant about it.\n\n06:21.760 --> 06:23.400\nThe head of marketing here, Lacey.\n\n06:23.400 --> 06:29.320\nLacey, are you here?\n\n06:29.320 --> 06:36.360\nWe were all, we were all a bit excitedly confused about why are we going to this casino because\n\n06:36.360 --> 06:43.080\nthe head of marketing at this casino is a Harmontown fan and she made sure, she's such\n\n06:43.080 --> 06:50.240\na big Harmontown fan that it would have made sense if this room was empty, like when we\n\n06:50.240 --> 06:55.520\nlike, she's like hardcore, like, but still professional, it wasn't like she booked us\n\n06:55.520 --> 07:00.680\nto hang out with us, she has shit to do and has been doing it, she's a taskmaster and\n\n07:00.680 --> 07:05.160\na multi-tasker and also a lover of the show and booked us and she was right and it sold\n\n07:05.160 --> 07:06.160\nout the room.\n\n07:06.160 --> 07:09.400\nOkay, so those 12 people that I was talking about before, they were like, when is he going\n\n07:09.400 --> 07:10.400\nto start?\n\n07:10.400 --> 07:11.400\nOkay.\n\n07:11.400 --> 07:18.480\nAll right, so a guy walks into a bar and he says, I want to be with a hooker and the\n\n07:18.480 --> 07:26.760\nmadam is like, the hooker's cost $8 on Sunday and then the guy says, I'll take two because\n\n07:26.760 --> 07:30.320\nmy brother's Irish and he says, what does that mean?\n\n07:30.320 --> 07:38.440\nHe says, well, I quit drinking and my brother's Irish, so I have a hooker for him every Sunday\n\n07:38.440 --> 07:41.840\nand so he takes the hooker up and he goes and sleeps with her and he comes, he has a\n\n07:41.840 --> 07:44.640\ngood time and he comes down and he goes like, thank you, I did that for my brother and he\n\n07:44.640 --> 07:48.360\nleaves, I did half for my brother and he leaves and he comes back and he says, can I have another\n\n07:48.360 --> 07:51.080\nhooker and he does it twice because you have to do it twice and then he do the third thing\n\n07:51.080 --> 07:56.240\nand he comes back the third time and he says, can I have the hooker again and the hooker\n\n07:56.240 --> 08:00.960\nlady says, not the hooker lady, that's a hooker, the hooker that runs the hookers, the madam\n\n08:00.960 --> 08:07.240\nsays, she says, okay, well, why do you just want one this time, why not two?\n\n08:07.240 --> 08:17.360\nAnd he said, because I quit having a hooker sex and I still have it for my brother.\n\n08:17.360 --> 08:27.480\nAnd that joke was for the people that don't know why the fuck they're here.\n\n08:27.480 --> 08:30.800\nI think you sorted that out, I think now they know that they're in good comedic hands.\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:39.040\nYou came to a comedy show and you heard of a joke told very well by me, alright, so that's\n\n08:39.040 --> 08:44.560\nabout all I had to talk about, I mean, I tried as hard as I could because it wasn't because\n\n08:44.560 --> 08:48.680\nI made any assumptions about you folks based on where you live because we have too much\n\n08:48.680 --> 08:52.280\nof that happening right now and I've done it too much, it's the people that we can't\n\n08:52.280 --> 08:57.360\nsee and touch that we're afraid of, that we judge and we go like, oh, well, all those\n\n08:57.360 --> 09:01.640\npeople over there, they think this way, you know, all this stuff, but for all that reason\n\n09:01.640 --> 09:06.680\nI was like, well, probably the polite thing to do is to like not, don't make your show\n\n09:06.680 --> 09:10.720\nboring, don't talk about politics, it's like everyone's fucking weary, we're exhausted,\n\n09:10.720 --> 09:15.160\ngo out and do what you naturally do, it would just be so charming and just talk.\n\n09:15.160 --> 09:18.800\nSo I tried to like, I was like, yeah, I'm just gonna use the excuse to stay off of Twitter\n\n09:18.800 --> 09:23.920\nfor two days and like not look at the news, but then I looked last night, holy fuck.\n\n09:23.920 --> 09:24.920\nWhat the fuck is happening?\n\n09:24.920 --> 09:29.800\nIt's like a fucking sci-fi novel, we're, but I was like, are we going on stage with\n\n09:29.800 --> 09:33.240\nthe president, we're gonna come off stage with the president on the lamb, like, like,\n\n09:33.240 --> 09:38.040\nit's crazy, like, it doesn't matter where you lean politically, these are like crazy\n\n09:38.040 --> 09:39.200\nhistorical times.\n\n09:39.200 --> 09:44.960\nThe president himself is, is erroneously comparing it to Watergate, I'm like, no, it's, it's\n\n09:44.960 --> 09:51.440\ndifferent, like, it's, I wasn't around back then either, but like, it's different, sir,\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:57.560\nyou're, you're off the mark, this is weirder, you are under investigation for espionage,\n\n09:57.560 --> 09:59.520\nyou are, this is huge.\n\n09:59.520 --> 10:07.000\nUm, anyways, um, back here, you're in a red state, a red state, super duper red.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:11.680\nLook, if you voted for him, you still think it's amazing, he's the first president, he\n\n10:11.680 --> 10:18.160\nwould become my hero if, like, he went on the lamb, like, like, what if the president\n\n10:18.160 --> 10:23.880\nwas in South America tweeting and going like, fuck you haters, I'd be like, I know I know\n\n10:23.880 --> 10:29.000\nwhy you voted for him, like, it's this moxie that I get, I just didn't want it in a president,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:34.480\nbut I get it, I get it, he's got hutzpah, as the Cherokee say.\n\n10:34.480 --> 10:39.180\nYou've really assimilated to the culture here.\n\n10:39.180 --> 10:40.180\nYes I have.\n\n10:40.180 --> 10:41.680\nI've assimilated.\n\n10:41.680 --> 10:42.680\nCeo.\n\n10:42.680 --> 10:51.040\nAll right, I'll take that groan, because I don't know what I'm doing, I'll accept it,\n\n10:51.040 --> 10:55.040\nI'm not gonna yell at you guys for groaning, I'll call that a good groan, that was a good\n\n10:55.040 --> 10:56.040\ngroan.\n\n10:56.040 --> 10:57.560\nOkay, so Spencer, how are you?\n\n10:57.560 --> 10:58.800\nHey guys, I'm good.\n\n10:58.800 --> 11:02.120\nThank you, thank you.\n\n11:02.120 --> 11:08.840\nWe got off the airport off the plane in Tulsa at the airport and I lost Spencer for a moment\n\n11:09.080 --> 11:11.080\nPeople were just taking pictures with him\n\n11:13.280 --> 11:17.520\nLook, I don't want to keep harping on it, but again he got more applause than me I think yeah, it's weird\n\n11:17.520 --> 11:22.800\nI don't get it. I'm fine with it. I'm processing it. Well, it's fine. It makes sense to me. I'm okay with it\n\n11:22.800 --> 11:24.640\nI don't get it\n\n11:24.640 --> 11:29.800\nBut I said hey Spencer, how you doing you were like hey guys you're playing to them. No, that's just it's a bit\n\n11:29.800 --> 11:33.960\nIt's just that's what I do, but also. No, I say hey guys to you guys\n\n11:35.760 --> 11:42.200\nDance being insecure right now. Yeah, let's complain about first class. You have more Midwest appeal than he does\n\n11:42.200 --> 11:46.600\nI don't know. I don't get it. Sometimes the applause is so weird. I try to wear my Spencer's shirt\n\n11:48.680 --> 11:52.280\nI was like what's the what's my where's my buffet shirt like where's my\n\n11:53.720 --> 11:55.720\nWhere's my lumberjack and shirt?\n\n11:55.720 --> 12:01.320\nI want to I want these I want these folks to know I'm on their side when I go out drunk and talk about the president\n\n12:01.400 --> 12:03.080\nAll right, but no\n\n12:03.080 --> 12:11.120\nI'm tired Spencer on your floor of this very wonderful very five-star very worth your money hotel and casino\n\n12:11.360 --> 12:17.520\nThere was a guy walking around with a shirt and no pants. I was wearing pants and no underpants\n\n12:17.680 --> 12:19.280\nNo, I was wearing underpants\n\n12:19.280 --> 12:24.760\nYou were the you encountered a guy that was nude from the waist down. No\n\n12:24.760 --> 12:26.360\nNo\n\n12:26.360 --> 12:33.520\nIt was on your floor. I might have heard a naked man. Okay, they sound pretty similar though\n\n12:33.520 --> 12:38.880\nI thought you were part of that encounter. Lacey said there was a guy. I shouldn't divulge this. Yeah, that's I'm not sure\n\n12:39.280 --> 12:43.920\nThere was a guy walking around with no pants or no underwear and cookies. He had a box of cookies\n\n12:45.400 --> 12:47.400\nThat was the that was the apology\n\n12:48.520 --> 12:51.320\nI'm sorry. I'm you take the good with the bad. Oh\n\n12:51.320 --> 12:54.480\nHey, oh, I saw your dick. I didn't want to oh\n\n12:56.160 --> 12:58.760\nBut he was I mean he was removed is the moral of the story\n\n12:58.760 --> 13:01.680\nYou shouldn't do that here and that guy won't be here when you come\n\n13:03.160 --> 13:05.440\nAlso the looser slots in, Oklahoma\n\n13:07.320 --> 13:11.200\nI love that idea that there's a yeah, there's looser slots. I like that\n\n13:11.920 --> 13:16.920\nWe had a we had a friend that worked in Vegas your friend and she had explained\n\n13:16.920 --> 13:21.880\nShe was the manager at the luxe for a while and she was explaining that like there's a whole\n\n13:22.760 --> 13:28.440\nMentality to like where they put which slots and stuff and that they the most interesting thing of all was that she was talking about\n\n13:28.440 --> 13:33.880\nHow yeah, we don't people think that we're like hoping that a gambling addict would like walk in the door\n\n13:33.880 --> 13:40.280\nNo, we try to they you they try to spot those people that are having trouble and try to because it's bad marketing\n\n13:40.280 --> 13:47.960\nLike you don't want somebody like walking around outside the casino going I lost my house.

Okay, so let me set the scene\n\n47:12.780 --> 47:19.660\nI was in Minneapolis is pitch-black dark. We're like, you know, we're kind of bored. It's a Friday. There's no shows\n\n47:19.660 --> 47:23.700\nWe didn't have any gigs. So we're like, let's gonna go. Let's go climb some tall buildings\n\n47:23.700 --> 47:28.340\nThat's you know, we do that on regular Thursdays and stuff. So why not a Friday?\n\n47:29.220 --> 47:32.820\nWhatever it's like 2 a.m. Really really dark like I mentioned\n\n47:32.820 --> 47:37.420\nSo we're climbing this ladder that doesn't stop and then we get to the top\n\n47:37.420 --> 47:40.140\nThe ladder didn't stop. It didn't feel like it was\n\n47:40.740 --> 47:43.820\nAnyway, I have a little bit of OCD is like 92 steps\n\n47:44.820 --> 47:49.820\nLike climbing and then we got to the top when we were walking and I didn't wait for the flashlight\n\n47:49.820 --> 47:53.060\nThat was my first mistake. The flashlights were behind me two of our dudes\n\n47:53.580 --> 48:00.340\nMarshall and Adam and there's like this like like a ceiling tile size hole in the top of this building\n\n48:00.340 --> 48:06.700\nAnd so I'm just walking enjoyed in the cityscape. I got it. Okay. I was mixing a drink. I thought I could multi-task\n\n48:08.380 --> 48:10.380\nAre you in a cave?\n\n48:13.060 --> 48:18.060\nClimb in buildings. There's this lie. It's you're on the outside of a building. Yeah, like it's like a fire escape ladder\n\n48:18.060 --> 48:25.420\nYep, okay. It's an old abandoned green bin mill thing. Okay, and there's a hatch above you\n\n48:25.420 --> 48:32.380\nRight. No hatch. We were on the outside of the building. That's a little opening climbing. Yeah, and it's like several openings and\n\n48:33.100 --> 48:38.100\nAfterwards I found out like eight other people had also fallen and only one survived. Oh\n\n48:38.900 --> 48:40.900\nYou meant that no\n\n48:42.580 --> 48:47.140\nLater on I found out I was actually the most fortunate person in this incident. Yeah\n\n48:47.140 --> 48:49.140\nWell, one of the most\n\n48:49.700 --> 48:53.380\nFortunate people I should say and that you had said let's all do this and that everyone else\n\n48:53.380 --> 48:58.780\nYeah, now it's a thing. Everyone's still doing it. It was dark. There was a hole in this in the ceiling\n\n48:58.780 --> 49:04.140\nYep, and you fell through it straight through a hundred feet. I tried to put my arms out like everything\n\n49:06.540 --> 49:12.060\nHow long did it take so it felt like it took forever by the same time it was happening so fast\n\n49:12.060 --> 49:16.060\nIt's really like time. Yeah, it's like a thing when you're yeah when you're following it's crazy\n\n49:16.060 --> 49:23.420\nYou know you like miss the last step. You're like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's no grounded man. It's just oh my god\n\n49:23.540 --> 49:27.700\nSo I just want to be clear about this you crawled up a ladder on the outside of a building\n\n49:27.700 --> 49:32.100\nAnd the reason you fell is because as you thought you got to the top of the building what should have been\n\n49:33.380 --> 49:36.980\nPlease walking on the roof and then there's a hole. Yeah, there's a hole\n\n49:37.700 --> 49:42.020\nStraight down it. Yeah, I just want to be clear about that. Yeah, so you're falling down through\n\n49:42.020 --> 49:47.660\nJust nothing. Yeah, the only thing I could think of was like a spike was just waiting for me\n\n49:47.660 --> 49:50.620\nAnd I was gonna get like games of throwing type of crap through my back\n\n49:50.620 --> 49:56.060\nThat's like, I mean, there's such a good chance that there's there's not a pillow at the bottom. Oh, yeah for sure\n\n49:56.060 --> 49:58.060\nI was praying for water\n\n50:04.780 --> 50:09.300\nSo you're facing were you facing up as you're falling no I was like\n\n50:09.300 --> 50:14.540\nYou know arms in the air, uh-huh, maybe don't care what did but anyway, I was like\n\n50:15.460 --> 50:18.460\nTurn down for what? Yeah, well everything at that point\n\n50:18.980 --> 50:22.700\nBut so I'm shaking like a Polaroid picture. Yeah. Yeah, these are all things that go through your head\n\n50:24.300 --> 50:30.060\nNo, so I hit my feet and I like normally I roll out cuz I skateboard and I like you know jump off\n\n50:30.060 --> 50:33.660\nYou know roasts and stuff and roll out you like compress your fall. You see yeah, yeah\n\n50:33.660 --> 50:39.300\nYou're been ninjas do that kind of combat. I mean, I don't know. So you're saying you learn from skateboarding that you should like curl\n\n50:40.060 --> 50:42.060\nWhen you fall\n\n50:42.100 --> 50:44.100\nIt's the PLF\n\n50:44.500 --> 50:48.660\nTogether and you turn to the side. He knows I'm talking about so that's what I did\n\n50:49.220 --> 50:54.660\nNo, but you forgot that other safety instructions don't climb up a hundred feet of ladder without like a rope\n\n50:56.420 --> 51:00.780\nYou're falling now through a hundred feet of space to a well known dark\n\n51:00.780 --> 51:05.580\nIt's anywhere from like 60 to 100 feet was never actually like measured out, you know, we didn't really\n\n51:06.620 --> 51:11.140\nSo all right, so but really you hit your face first. No, not my face\n\n51:11.140 --> 51:14.260\nI um, but I did it. That's what the report said, you know, how you know\n\n51:16.260 --> 51:20.060\nNo one really if you would horribly fell on your little tuchus and you were like, oh\n\n51:21.060 --> 51:24.380\nBroke in the process. I like try to roll out and it's like\n\n51:24.380 --> 51:32.460\nConcave concrete said the bottom of it. So it's like a funnel up the ends and some rolling into like a wall of concrete\n\n51:32.460 --> 51:36.020\nThat's like, you know slanted the kind of escape ramp, but not as much fun\n\n51:37.460 --> 51:39.460\nI thought you landed on your face\n\n51:39.460 --> 51:44.740\nI smashed my knee which which broke my you roll into it and come up and pull a front side faking\n\n51:44.740 --> 51:51.020\nNo, I wish I try I was trying to rock and roll and just get out of it. You know, did anything change about your life after that?\n\n51:51.020 --> 51:56.100\nOh, yeah, starting with injuries. I mean, I mean not a PTSD and stuff. Did you get fucked up?\n\n51:56.100 --> 52:01.180\nDid you break? Oh, yeah, I like my femur is like broke like this. I don't know how you\n\n52:01.420 --> 52:08.860\nHe's making a gesture that's like mr. Burns if he missed his fingers while trying to tend to them. Yeah. Yeah, I think they call it interlacing\n\n52:09.740 --> 52:15.540\nNot excellent. Yeah, it's not excellent. So if mr. Burns trying to say something was excellent, and then it wasn't it just went\n\n52:15.540 --> 52:22.440\nNo, uh gears messing together your yeah, so just just your your basic. Yeah talking about like a bone\n\n52:22.440 --> 52:24.940\nIt's like so much force is like\n\n52:25.740 --> 52:31.540\nLike lightning patterns couldn't go can break any more than it was breaking so it decided to break my pelvis\n\n52:32.620 --> 52:34.620\nLet's not blame the bone\n\n52:37.300 --> 52:39.300\nSome of these, you know some of these\n\n52:39.300 --> 52:45.180\nSometimes it's the reverse our president said sometimes it's\n\n52:48.300 --> 52:51.180\nSince your pebbles got sheared or shattered or what happened there\n\n52:51.180 --> 52:56.700\nYeah, so then my pelvis broke, and I didn't even realize that this bottom part broke because I was like\n\n52:57.700 --> 53:00.020\nI was all focused on when my face hit, you know\n\n53:02.020 --> 53:05.660\nYour face is your fortune. Yeah, like I mean not really anymore. I grow up beards\n\n53:05.660 --> 53:11.580\nYou don't see all the weird stuff. Oh, you have like scarring under your beard.

So yeah, we had to do another surgery here\n\n56:07.100 --> 56:10.220\nThey'd like popped out my leg and scraped out some bone marrow\n\n56:10.940 --> 56:12.940\nshoved it in there with some animal\n\n56:14.540 --> 56:15.580\nI mean, I've knocked on wood\n\n56:15.580 --> 56:19.500\nI mean eventually something's gonna happen to me and it'll be the worst thing of all because I don't have the balls\n\n56:19.500 --> 56:22.460\nTo climb a ladder so I won't have the cool thing falling on my face\n\n56:23.020 --> 56:26.860\nBut but all of us eventually learn the human body is like\n\n56:26.860 --> 56:32.780\nIt's just like a 57 Chevy. They start telling you like we're gonna take a muscle from your ass and put it on your head\n\n56:32.780 --> 56:36.300\nJust mark everything clicks and cracks now when I wake up in the morning and like stretch now\n\n56:38.380 --> 56:43.500\nSo so Levi had also tweeted he said he said you have you know, you have feelings you want to share\n\n56:43.580 --> 56:47.340\nI don't want to put you in the spot like it's more than just you there's always more details\n\n56:47.420 --> 56:51.100\nUsually it's not so enlightening like this. I started getting on terry eyed and like yo\n\n56:51.100 --> 56:58.140\nI was in a coma for five days another five days. I couldn't walk or speak to remember my dad's name.

He woke up and he's like what?\n\n57:38.060 --> 57:43.020\nOh, yeah, okay. Anyways, the um, but uh, shit. Shit. Shit. Wait.

Yeah, but she'll be a representative\n\n59:13.900 --> 59:15.500\nThey could switch\n\n59:15.500 --> 59:20.220\nAlso luana, you know, you don't have to come up in case you fell and you're like I paid $15\n\n59:20.220 --> 59:26.220\nI went to the show. I couldn't see it. Then they brought me up and humiliated me\n\n59:29.500 --> 59:33.900\nAll right, so all right, uh fell on your face, uh, okay good\n\n59:34.060 --> 59:37.180\nOh, and he said he said you had a he said you had a rap\n\n59:37.420 --> 59:40.700\nI do I have a little like an emotional rap that I made about it\n\n59:40.940 --> 59:45.740\nIt also is like some of it's calling you out jam, but not personally. Oh, shit\n\n59:45.740 --> 59:50.940\nI uh, I love to be called out when it's not personal. It's not personal because I know how it's just about my work\n\n59:51.580 --> 59:53.580\nIt's just business. Yeah\n\n59:54.220 --> 59:56.220\nThat's that's my least sensitive area\n\n59:57.180 --> 01:00:01.900\nThat's why I do what I do. I just I listened to the podcast all the way through so often at work\n\n01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.460\nI became a little paranoid and I thought you were talking about me\n\n01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:09.500\nI thought you remembered me from a show way long ago. I'm glad you don't because I made a fool of myself\n\n01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:15.020\nOh, no, wait, so you really what tell me about that experience. Yeah, uh, you met me after a show and I\n\n01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:21.020\nYou were I mean you might not remember because you're kind of angry and you know something.

I was nervous and welcome back again\n\n01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.740\nTo the to the venue in Chicago that could have been it\n\n01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500\nI don't know that this happened\n\n01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.660\nNow I don't know if I won that craps game like what's going on\n\n01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:05.100\nWhat do you mean blacklisted when I use that phrase casually Dan told you you were back\n\n01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.340\nYeah, like 69\n\n01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.300\nWhat you were 69.

You thought I was blacklisting you\n\n01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.420\nSometimes dan likes to 69\n\n01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:35.980\nI got a sexual uh, okay, so you felt 86 not 69 right dan because he was in a bad mood\n\n01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.980\nFrom my twitter feed from I don't remember\n\n01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.700\nBut you wrote a rap about it. This is why I don't think it happened. No offense. All right\n\n01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:49.660\nWell, wait also did it happen before or after you felt it happened after I felt okay great\n\n01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:55.260\nGood to know. All right. Well, I was also like this and I was like really mean and you couldn't see through my\n\n01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.740\nteeth\n\n01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.740\nLike what is he saying? Oh, okay\n\n01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.500\nSo I why all right. I didn't have a smile like I do today\n\n01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:10.300\nAll right. I bullied a differently abled person in Chicago. No, you didn't told them that they were blacklisted from life\n\n01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.660\nAny care\n\n01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.060\nMutually filleting each other\n\n01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:23.500\nUh, but it's and you wrote this rap to do you want to beat you always want to do your I don't know it's more like uh\n\n01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.620\nI could give you a beat\n\n01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:31.980\nOn thursday like my parents my parents like don't go you like you're scared of them.

He's pulled out a tiny notebook pages\n\n01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.620\nWait, well, let's hear the short one and maybe we'll want to hear the long one\n\n01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.980\nYeah, would you like to and the crowd went mild\n\n01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.220\nI'll do the I'll do the flipping\n\n01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.780\nOkay, this is\n\n01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:03.580\nCan I hold that I'd feel much more comfortable if I could hold that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah\n\n01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.220\nLuana's blog entries is just getting better by the minute\n\n01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:15.020\nUh, I started from the beginning. I guess the short one. I think where the pencil mark stops and the pen begins\n\n01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.980\nThis is just a short one. Okay. We'll start here and we'll just go you can just stop whenever\n\n01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.620\nAll right, this one's not about the fog is a little shorter. It's just about like, you know\n\n01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:30.220\nShit, this is about you hitting Dan Harmon or just no, this one's just random not this one. We'll save that one for\n\n01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.220\nI want to I want to hear\n\n01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.860\nWe only signed up for one rap\n\n01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.260\nNo, we want to hear we want to hear we want to hear we want to hear how you Dan Harmon hurt you\n\n01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:44.060\nOkay, I was really angry and I was there's this new strain of paranoia that came out in a\n\n01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.620\nTocable form.

Yeah\n\n01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.540\nJust because it's now plugged in under your name after you already achieved mainstream\n\n01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.340\nDoesn't mean you can claim fame and truly belongs to me\n\n01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:02.220\nYou're a part of a bigger hypocrisy as far as you can see. This is a need to be time to be free\n\n01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:09.180\nPage turn because morality is immortality. I will rise above this and what you should trust is the words coming out\n\n01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:15.500\nMy mouth is it's not served with sauerkraut. That shit is about foreskin with your next to kin. That was disgusting\n\n01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.860\nI know you know what I mean talking sausage about all these postings now dissecting what has already been\n\n01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.540\nposted\n\n01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:28.700\nSpoken there we go spoken out now here.

That's when I checked\n\n01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:44.780\nIt's like I'm 44, but all I can get is the irony that it's like well, it's a scathing indictment of someone who's abusing the\n\n01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.620\nTime that they are getting on stage\n\n01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.900\nOh, my bad.

Well, it's just it's just sort of like that's all I can get it's all I'm getting is that\n\n01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:59.260\nIt's like I really scared to say why you're up on stage and you're not mindful of the individual's listening\n\n01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:04.540\nAnd there's somebody there's people out there. They're human beings and human beings and feelings and human beings are entitled to\n\n01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.540\nBe entertained\n\n01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.620\nI get to that\n\n01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:14.780\nRight, you get to that but you got to that you I mean you now know what it's like to have stage time\n\n01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:20.860\nLike you had an unequivocal fucking like a microphone like focused on you, but he would have been there for three hours\n\n01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.100\nHe would have no there's no and wait\n\n01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.780\nWhat if somebody came up to you after that show after you did that for two hours?\n\n01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:30.380\nWhat if somebody came up to you and like I don't know what I don't know what happened\n\n01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.460\nI've never said the word blacklist\n\n01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.620\nOutside of it.

My whole show is shitting on you. That's all I have\n\n01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.300\nWe have a woman on stage that we haven't even spoken to and you want to start bringing up other people\n\n01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.900\nI\n\n01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.780\nluwana doesn't want this kind of attention anymore than the luwana. Okay. I mean it was like\n\n01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.540\nYeah, what else would you ask? What else would you ask me?\n\n01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:22.860\nShe's already up here.

Oh nice\n\n01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:34.540\nI mean she said that like she she knows that that's the actual answer scientific fact\n\n01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.100\nDo you have a favorite color purple? Is it dark?\n\n01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.260\nWhy is dark purple your favorite color? Like why is that love?\n\n01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.580\nIt just feels it feels like love to you. My grandma used to wear dark purple\n\n01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:53.020\nYou loved her. Yeah, she's gone. She said you said did she's when did she go away?\n\n01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.020\nUh\n\n01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:59.740\nI'm not good with dates. This sounds really bad. You have a symptom of the ad\n\n01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:02.220\nDan has a wrap up about your grandma. Yeah\n\n01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.020\nHow hard did you fuck her?\n\n01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:14.960\nI'm gonna lock eyes with her. So I luwana's grandma was named linia. He fucked her so hard.

Yeah, exactly\n\n01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.880\nUh, no what I was gonna do is I was hoping like I was I wanted to bring somebody else up that was like, okay\n\n01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:45.440\nWhat's the opposite of a guy that fell a hundred feet? I do his face and that has a wrap about how I done him wrong\n\n01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.480\nWhich would be somebody who maybe has anyone been launched into the air a hundred feet\n\n01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.560\nAnd or is very happy that they met me or something just to\n\n01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.520\nIt's just for me. It's just like I'd like to balance it. We got people pointing at other people\n\n01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.480\nIt's very curious to me. Like you're like this guy loves you so much\n\n01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.440\nAnd he can fly\n\n01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.680\nUh, is it true would your friend wise your friends pointing at you?\n\n01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.680\nHe thinks that you admire me and think that I'm an inspiring figure in your life\n\n01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.240\nYeah, do you would you tell would you tell me about it in front of people?\n\n01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.920\nYou don't have to but if you would it would make me feel better\n\n01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:35.920\nYou can take the birthday seat\n\n01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.680\nHello, what's your name? Tim and you're from arkansas. I'm guessing markin son\n\n01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.680\nHmm\n\n01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.200\nI'm getting good at this. All right. Well, I'll tell me tell me how you how you love me\n\n01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:10.080\nI don't I don't know if it's that astounding but I I'm just kind of a failed writer and\n\n01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.520\nAnd I'm impressed with\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.600\nwith your\n\n01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.480\nYour writing it's like you're the opposite of a skateboarder\n\n01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.080\nWhat what didn't you write?\n\n01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:32.000\nI've not written a lot of scripts. Okay scripts and screenplays and stuff. Okay. Yeah, a lot of poetry. Cool\n\n01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.160\nLuanna, what's your when you say failed writer Tim? You mean you failed how?\n\n01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.880\nOh, I just I don't know what I mean. I'm just you know, I'm an introvert my friends made me come up here\n\n01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.240\nYou wrote you write and you're not Dan Harmon is what you mean, right?\n\n01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.640\nYou're not like a nobody wants to call himself a writer ever. We were just talking about you\n\n01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.520\nAt the table with my friends that I just met who are who are awesome\n\n01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.560\nThey gave me\n\n01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560\nthis bumper sticker\n\n01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.480\nAnyway, oh nice Harmontown next tangent\n\n01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.160\nSo what were we talking about? Okay\n\n01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.480\nWe're talking about you table the table was like, uh\n\n01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.480\nYou know\n\n01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:23.040\nSorry, don't worry, but I it's me too. I do the same thing. Believe me. It's every show\n\n01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.160\nI was that's why I was I was shifting over to Luana for a second when you got adjusted to the because this gets boring really fast\n\n01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.240\nBelieve the trust them, uh\n\n01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:36.000\nBut I was gonna say Luana. What's your uh, what's your like not your current job?\n\n01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:42.320\nBut like the one that you feel failed at like either it's because you didn't take piano lessons or what's the thing that you would have done\n\n01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:48.800\nThat you should have done that you are you you still think about like fuck. I didn't do that thing\n\n01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.840\nI failed it all of my job\n\n01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.280\nIt's like I just need money so I\n\n01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.320\nRight\n\n01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.280\nIt's not it's just not like a dichotomy where it's like my dream life and then my regular life\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.440\nSomething just kind of okay. Yeah, I guess come to think of it\n\n01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.360\nWe sort of create that dichotomy in Hollywood because we're like, what if poorer people didn't kill rich people?\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.880\nI guess it would be because we showed the movies about how working in a factory was just as good as their dreams\n\n01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.520\nAnd the way we do that is by fading in on someone who has a dream and a factory job\n\n01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.840\nAnd then we factory out these like myths to people what factory do you work at?\n\n01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:39.360\nI work it's called Walmart. Mm-hmm. What's your what's your post there?\n\n01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.240\nUm, I work at the home office. I answer calls about registers\n\n01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.440\nAnswer calls about registries answer registers if the register breaks\n\n01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:55.360\nOh, wait. Are you like a technician that fixes the register? I know I just take the call about it\n\n01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.000\nTo the person who will just tell somebody there's a thing broken\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nI'll send it to the next level. Do you live in constant fear of people realizing that your job could be?\n\n01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.520\nThere's a phone on the left side of your desk and a phone on the right side\n\n01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.880\nAnd then someone's gonna notice that you could connect the cords\n\n01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800\nI'm laughing because uh\n\n01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:25.520\nI'm a cruel person. I guess I know I'm laughing because I've been there. I guess I don't know. I like that's okay. Well\n\n01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.600\nWhat oh, yeah, okay. All right lights are out. Okay.

Yeah\n\n01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:06.960\nYeah, the thing is like you can be a failed poet and die and then people find out later on that you were a great poet\n\n01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.960\nThat's what I'm counting on\n\n01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.080\nBut that's what makes it the hardest job of all because you're like, well, how do I know when I've started or finished?\n\n01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.240\nI'm like, I'm gonna write some poetry today\n\n01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.320\nWell, maybe maybe this blank page is my poem\n\n01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:26.320\nOr maybe it makes me identical to a non-poet and then you're like, I'll put a I'll put an a\n\n01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.680\nLike that might that might be the best poem ever.

Like I I'm only recently getting into like poetry like and like really reading poetry because\n\n01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.920\nPoetry for me always seems like something it's a little\n\n01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:55.520\nDistant and like you have to be smart or like like it's like listening to jazz\n\n01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:00.960\nLike like that that horn solo by cold train is like it's above my\n\n01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.200\nMy musical brain and you read poetry and it kind of escapes you a bit\n\n01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:10.800\nBut if you really sit down and listen to poetry and let it wash over you it actually is really important\n\n01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.640\nAnd also like and I'm not being reductive or diminishing at all like luke\n\n01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.520\nLike what you what you read for us like that was poetry and that was like it's cool for people to write things down\n\n01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.920\nJust for the sake of writing them down and saying them out loud or putting them on paper\n\n01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:31.680\nSo like to be a poet is uh important. I think especially now when our president can't can't finish a fucking sense\n\n01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.200\nAbsolutely. Also. He's the only is the only president and hey, I voted for him too\n\n01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.840\nHe's just not the most literate president we've ever had\n\n01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.840\nWe can all admit that I voted for not kidding. I'm gonna hear that voted for trump\n\n01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:48.560\nAnd let's not make this political he didn't have\n\n01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:53.440\nHe didn't have a poet laureate at his inauguration because he's not poetic\n\n01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.160\nAnd I think we need poetry in the world right now more than ever so to have people\n\n01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.160\nall that\n\n01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.920\nI am suspicious of everybody who always everybody who has a problem with words and I've always had that problem\n\n01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:13.920\nAnd believe me I acknowledge the fact that uh the left side of the political spectrum has had a problem with words more than anybody\n\n01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.160\nWhose phone was that what okay good just make a sure sorry\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.360\nI mean I've been I've been as much like I you know people have told me you used the wrong pronoun\n\n01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:31.840\nYou did it again. I did it to Levi. I did it like and I like I I have the biggest foot in your mouth kind of like\n\n01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.640\nOld fat white guy kind of like face of the of the enemy of progression\n\n01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.800\nUh kind of syndrome going on and for the longest time it was very easy for me to be like Jesus christ\n\n01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.880\nHe's fucking politically correct nazis and all this stuff, but and there is a part of us\n\n01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.080\nThe the best part of us that's like, oh\n\n01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:57.440\nLet's all let's all just start being really really nice to each other and let's have a rule that you have to be really really nice to each other\n\n01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.320\nand then and like now actual\n\n01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.200\nLike actual bad ugly like hatred has come out of the woodwork and the weird really weird thing is that\n\n01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:14.880\nA lot of the people who have been the most adamant to adapt to a world where we have rules about what we say are the people that are now\n\n01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:21.520\nForced to acknowledge that fuck the only enemy of this thing is like verbal nudity\n\n01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160\nIs like making mistakes\n\n01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:30.960\nBabbling like saying what you actually mean if the more people do that and also it has to be coupled with if you're wrong\n\n01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.520\nThen someone says that offended me. They don't mean you shouldn't have been born\n\n01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.400\nThey don't mean that you shouldn't have any money that you have they don't mean that you should lose your job\n\n01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.800\nThey mean that offended me and you can actually just be like like, okay fine, then you're easily offended whatever\n\n01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.600\nBut what is my fucking point?\n\n01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.160\nI just like like I'm we're all awash in this this this weird zone right now\n\n01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:03.360\nAnd like I I have no idea like you you're awash in this weird zone like Harmon like we have work tomorrow\n\n01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.800\nI I don't have a point. This is usually the part of the show where I spiral into like a really\n\n01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:17.840\nAccidentally eloquent rant. Um, it's it's intentional and not an eloquent this time. And it's just your tough luck. You're out 15 bucks\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.880\nYou'd have lost a lot more out there this last two hours\n\n01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.520\nIt's it's there's those those machines are designed to rob you I don't care\n\n01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.920\nAnd then I just I just throw everybody into the bus and\n\n01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.480\nget on a plane\n\n01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.240\nI don't know what I'm saying. I'm scared and fat and white and sad and\n\n01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:44.800\nStraight and I I guess I offered to 69 a guy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your applause. Thank you. That's very brave. I\n\n01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:52.080\nDon't know what we're having a small meeting. We're having a small meet and greet after Dan's gonna 69 10 people after the show\n\n01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.600\nI will 69 everybody that hasn't been 69 now Tim a friend of yours\n\n01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:02.560\nI think handed you a phone. Is that somebody handing you one of your poems for us to read or to hear?\n\n01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560\nYes, oh really?\n\n01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.760\nWhat if I mean you know that you know that we're gonna even if it sucks we're gonna pretend\n\n01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.520\nIt's awesome because like you're\n\n01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.120\nBecause we that's how humanity works. Can I do a small interlude real quick like\n\n01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.800\nWhatever your politics are whether you are pro-trump anti-trump whatever whatever your stance is right now\n\n01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.400\nUm, he didn't have a poet at his inauguration, which is normally the case. Oh, that's what I was saying. Yes\n\n01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.160\nand\n\n01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.920\nI want to read one quote that is is what John F. Kennedy said at his inauguration\n\n01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.400\nOr maybe not as an auguration, but he said at some point when power leads a man to arrogance\n\n01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.120\nWhen power leads a man toward arrogance poetry reminds him of his limitations\n\n01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.320\nWhen power narrows the area of man's concern\n\n01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:54.160\nPoetry reminds him of the rich richness and diversity of existence when power corrupts poetry cleanses\n\n01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:58.800\nSo I would include Luke in that and everybody and also Dan and your ramblings\n\n01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.480\nLike like the idea of the idea of saying what's on your mind and being able to say it\n\n01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.600\nSemi intelligently hopefully very intelligently like the idea of like of\n\n01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.840\nExpressing thought in a world where right now like it's just dying on the fucking vine like we have\n\n01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.880\nUh, we've got Tim on stage who is a poet and and is worried that you're a failed writer\n\n01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.080\nYou're not a failed writer. It's fucking gorgeous that you are a poet in a world without poetry\n\n01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.480\nI know what you're thinking. How do I follow that? I know what you're thinking\n\n01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.960\nThat's\n\n01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.320\nWow, but the answer is with sincerity and like look\n\n01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.800\nYeah, you've got nothing but runway here. Okay. You saw what we put up with\n\n01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.800\nThis\n\n01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.880\nYou know Dan played fake craps with a bunch of guys that didn't know who we are\n\n01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.600\nYou know how bad this show is\n\n01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.680\nYou're you're you're good Tim.

That's magnificent, man. That's really cool. You've been given a horrible task. You have to keep writing\n\n01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.600\nYou have to keep writing for no audience.

It's like oh, it's that it's that idea\n\n01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.280\nI've said that a thousand times to young writers because but I never follow this advice ever ever\n\n01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:49.360\nI've never followed it once is that the idea that your your job is to write something good is why you're not writing\n\n01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.480\nBecause who the fuck is going to write something good? It's great advice\n\n01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.200\nYour own it's your own definition of good writing is going to be automatically better than anything you've ever written\n\n01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.000\nAnd if you're worth your salt so that you know, that's not what you're going to write\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.160\nYou have to write something underneath you have to write shit that you think is bad\n\n01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:09.120\nYou have to get get to that level and you just like like like like get it out there\n\n01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.640\nI never do it.

I'm like, yeah, it was fine\n\n01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.520\nBecause I'm a genius\n\n01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.520\nAnd then I say on Twitter, I'm a genius and then you guys say I'm a genius and then I come to Oklahoma and do a show and\n\n01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:34.640\nPeople get cake, but overall I don't know\n\n01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.200\nUh, all right.

He's like\n\n01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.960\nMy last name is hitler, but\n\n01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.320\nHere's the thing\n\n01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:26.800\nLike I'm I'm obsessed with nautical imagery and I learned it while my grandpa told me about hitlers conquests at sea. I\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nBut I'm not one of those hitlers\n\n01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:36.080\nI'm a self-loathing hitler. Loana. Are you an artist anyway? Do you have any artistic leanings? Not at all\n\n01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.520\nNone\n\n01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.360\nYou don't you don't sing you don't dance. You don't write. I can't cut a straight line\n\n01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:48.640\nWith a scissors you mean like she says she's all crafty. My whole family is I can't cut a straight line\n\n01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.600\nI can't draw. Are you young enough for me to ask how old you are?\n\n01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.280\nThat's a good age\n\n01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.560\nI think that's how old steve is now\n\n01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:08.240\nI kind of have this it's a it's a it's a horrible human urge. I want to see you panicked\n\n01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.440\nLike I want to wait. Whoa. Jesus christ\n\n01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.640\nWell because she's so evolved and relaxed. I'm like what makes her panic. I said it was a horrible urge\n\n01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.840\nThis is the dynamics great\n\n01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.200\nSo you're thinking like like you you're admittedly not an artist any\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.840\nany way\n\n01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.880\nNone\n\n01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.520\nBut you're you seem just cool as shit like you're a mellow\n\n01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.520\nMaybe that's a secret. I think artists are all crazy people like but they have to have to have to say something\n\n01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.480\nWe like get off their chest so they can relax, but you just seem\n\n01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.640\nNaturally relaxed my art is not worry\n\n01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.240\nNo, this is a real thing. You're buddha\n\n01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.880\nYour art is yeah, it's big\n\n01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.880\nI I this is a real thing. I've been thinking about because I'm writing this this book that's\n\n01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.000\nYou know I was gonna also rob people other money, but but uh\n\n01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:04.880\nThe where I'm like, I'm thinking about like human evolution and how we're like we're all like coming from chimpanzees\n\n01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.200\nI'm sorry if you didn't vote for that. Uh, I know you're all liberal. It's fine. And I didn't mean that if you're not\n\n01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.480\nI'll do it. I'll suck your dick for a dollar\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nDon't beat me up\n\n01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.280\nNo, no, let's not check it with them. We checked it with them enough\n\n01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.080\nBut no, I love to think that they hung out and then they're they're like, what who's Duncan Trussell? And then they're like\n\n01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.760\nThink all that too, uh, but but but I\n\n01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:46.960\nLike I was just thinking about like chimpanzees and like the fact that like we as a species like the species that we evolved from\n\n01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.960\nLike our shtick became\n\n01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:55.040\nAlarm like like if you want like like we peaked at like we're like so satisfied\n\n01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.800\nWe have no enemies\n\n01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.920\nWe were like\n\n01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.360\nThe only thing we had to worry about was like leopards coming at us and then we just became this\n\n01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:07.760\nLike this species that was like we'll sit here. We'll eat. We'll fuck. We'll hang out and then if anything fucks with us\n\n01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.960\nWe'll go\n\n01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.960\nAnd then everyone will go like run away\n\n01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.320\nAnd now today we just like walk around with these devices in our phones\n\n01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.520\nAnd it's just like everything that alarms us is the thing that sells\n\n01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.400\nIt it's it's bigger than just like the news. It's like our stories are about like you're gonna die\n\n01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.560\nHow are you gonna deal with that? How are like like we're addicted to\n\n01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.760\nWe're beyond addicted to it. Like we're built on it\n\n01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.920\nLike we're we are just people that like we don't think that anything could possibly be fine\n\n01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.480\nAnd as a result\n\n01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.840\nNothing is ever fine. Like there's always shit to worry about which continues to feed itself\n\n01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.280\nIt's like it's like a junkie saying well, I only do heroin when my life's going really shitty\n\n01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:57.600\nLike yeah, and it's you're you're guess what that's gonna be Wednesday. It's gonna keep happening like like because\n\n01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.840\nLike you're putting yourself in that zone like we've been doing that\n\n01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.560\nBut there's unlike with heroin or booze or anything\n\n01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:09.520\nThere's absolutely not a single human being or even carbon-based life form. That's not a\n\n01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:16.400\nNot on this thing. So no one's ever gonna call us on it. But that's what we're doing. We're like sitting around like\n\n01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.680\nfiguring out how to freak out and\n\n01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:27.280\nAnd we like we're never gonna stop unless we actively decide that we have a problem and have like a 12 step meeting where we're like\n\n01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:33.760\nWe we love freaking out. We don't want to do it anymore. We're always gonna want to do it\n\n01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.400\nLet's go to the moon and like not freak out anymore\n\n01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.120\nI don't know why i'm laying all this on you like\n\n01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.120\nI'm fine. You're you're working at walmart and you're like fine.

Are you are you just that that mellow even keeled all the time?\n\n01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.640\nOr is it something that you you have to like sublimate and eat up that anxiety\n\n01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.840\nLike can you bury it down? You're a raging inferno inside?\n\n01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.560\nYeah, you're about to go off\n\n01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:29.120\nI'm like fine with being a raging inferno.
