00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
McDonalds

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
McDonalds

00:12.000 --> 00:30.520
Come on, win it all, from Hollywood, California, Melt the On Promise, the NerdMelt Theater,

00:30.520 --> 00:43.520
Harmontown is now in second place. The Vodka's on stage, the Comptroller is at his desk.

00:43.520 --> 00:59.520
Let's welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon. Wow! What a crowd!

00:59.520 --> 01:06.520
I hope some of you got some of Erin McGathy's cupcakes on the way in.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.520
Loaded with peyote. Sorry about that.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.520
The time D&D starts is going to get wild.

01:15.520 --> 01:22.520
I had convinced Erin on the ride over here tonight, the topic of kiss came up, the band Kiss,

01:22.520 --> 01:29.520
because we drove past a billboard for some new reality show, and I had her convinced for a few blocks

01:29.520 --> 01:40.520
that there was a fifth member of Kiss named Kissy Face, but there was Cat Face and Demon Face

01:40.520 --> 01:48.520
and Star Face, but there was a guy, the original member was Kissy Face, and he was the drummer

01:48.520 --> 01:54.520
and he had a big hat shaped like lips and they kicked him out of the band and shortened the name to Kiss.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.520
And you had sold her on that?

01:56.520 --> 02:05.520
She was googling like crazy. She was looking for pictures. I was like, keep looking, they covered it up.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.520
The story of Kiss doesn't want you to know.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.520
Are you talking about the same billboard I saw?

02:11.520 --> 02:15.520
Yeah, it says from Arena Rock to Arena Football.

02:15.520 --> 02:21.520
The reality show, there is an indoor football team called the Los Angeles Kiss,

02:21.520 --> 02:26.520
that's an actual indoor football team that's called the Kiss, and that Kiss owns.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.520
That's not a TV show.

02:28.520 --> 02:33.520
Well, it is now, motherfucker, coming soon to AMC, we just did their work for them.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.520
For real?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.520
Yeah, that's what it said, new series coming.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.520
I saw that billboard, thought it was an ad like buy tickets now to go see the Kiss.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.520
Now check it out, of all the shows we could promote with this show.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.520
Go flock to AMC and watch Kissy Football.

02:48.520 --> 02:53.520
It's called Fourth and Rock?

02:53.520 --> 02:54.520
Fourth and Loud.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.520
Fourth and Loud doesn't rhyme or scan.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.520
How about Third and Dumb?

03:01.520 --> 03:07.520
You may notice, Jeff, that I have a new phone case here. It looks like a book.

03:07.520 --> 03:13.520
It also is a wallet. It's got my driver's license and credit cards in it.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.520
A little bit of money.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.520
Not a lot.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.520
If somebody in the audience guesses how much money, do they get to keep the whole thing?

03:20.520 --> 03:24.520
No.

03:24.520 --> 03:29.520
I don't have a wallet in my back pocket. I am wallet free for the last three days.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.520
I'm doing an experiment. Can I just have my phone case?

03:33.520 --> 03:35.520
I have no wallet in my back pocket.

03:35.520 --> 03:41.520
My anxiety about that, I'm projecting my own anxiety onto that.

03:41.520 --> 03:47.520
You have your phone and all of your essential identification, credit cards, money, all in one basket.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.520
If you lose your phone, you've lost the whole shop.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.520
I don't lose my phone, especially now that it's my wallet.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.520
I definitely won't because I'm constantly...

03:58.520 --> 04:03.520
The uncomfortable thing about it is that I've trained myself because I used to lose my wallet constantly

04:03.520 --> 04:05.520
when I was in my 20s.

04:05.520 --> 04:10.520
The third time you lose your wallet and you have to get a new driver's license and all that shit,

04:10.520 --> 04:12.520
you get really conditioned to...

04:12.520 --> 04:16.520
I'm constantly patting my ass whenever I'm anywhere.

04:16.520 --> 04:20.520
Whenever I stand up, whenever I'm leaving a building, I just give my ass a good pat.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.520
Then if there's nothing there, I panic.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.520
Then if it's in my front pocket, I go, oh god.

04:25.520 --> 04:31.520
Now, I'm also tired of every time I sit down, I have to pull out a phone, I have to pull out a wallet,

04:31.520 --> 04:36.520
I have to pack them up on the table with some weird distracting beginning to every sit down with me.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.520
What's this guy stacking all this shit on the table for?

04:39.520 --> 04:41.520
What's his deal? What's he going to put up there next?

04:41.520 --> 04:45.520
Like a wrench or a shoe? Who is he? What kind of status play is this?

04:45.520 --> 04:48.520
Now I just put down this little book.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.520
I like that it's a little leather-bound edition.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.520
It looks like a little Bible.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.520
You look like kind of an old-timey preacher.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.520
Yeah.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.520
It's pretty nice.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.520
I'll go back to the iHarmon pretty soon because I just realized something.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.520
You're not going to stick with the iHarmon, man.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.520
I think I am now because I have to remember things and I think that whatever,

05:10.520 --> 05:14.520
the thing that stops me from writing them down, I just realize this now.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.520
It has nothing to do with the technology or how hard it is,

05:16.520 --> 05:21.520
and everything to do with the fact that it always feels weird to pull out your phone and start it up

05:21.520 --> 05:24.520
because that looks identical to not giving a shit about what someone's saying.

05:24.520 --> 05:29.520
When, in fact, writing it down with a pencil and a piece of paper, they'll be like,

05:29.520 --> 05:32.520
Holy fuck, this guy's really listening to me.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.520
Morally Safer is here.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.520
Yeah, and it's like the opposite if you get your phone out.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.520
It looks like you're texting people while they're talking.

05:40.520 --> 05:46.520
All right, so that concludes Boring Corner.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.520
Shark Week, it's Shark Week, Jeff.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.520
Oh, God, they started today.

05:50.520 --> 05:55.520
I have, look, I didn't watch the last couple of Shark Weeks because I didn't like where Shark Week was going.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
I just read an article about this.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.520
Oh, yeah?

05:58.520 --> 05:59.520
Yeah.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.520
So I went, yesterday, I went through the Direct TV, like DVR, like, you know, the guide, the kind of thing.

06:04.520 --> 06:12.520
I said, let's see what 2014 new Shark material is, and they got some doozies coming up.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.520
Well, some of them are lies, Jeff lies.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.520
There's an article about it.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.520
Shark lies?

06:17.520 --> 06:22.520
Yeah, it's a little boy.com. I didn't write down my sources, but I was reading an article on the way here.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.520
It's someone who has outraged at how Shark Weeks become about lies.

06:25.520 --> 06:30.520
Lies, like fake sensationalized, like fake documentaries masquerading as real ones.

06:30.520 --> 06:36.520
Well, there's one that's called, like, there's something that sounds like a movie about a shark.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.520
Like Megalodon.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.520
Megaloshark or something.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.520
It's not Megalodon.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.520
It's like a prehistoric shark.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.520
Well, yeah, but there got one this Shark Week about Megalodon, and it's fake.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.520
But that's whole baloney, yeah.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
Exactly.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.520
I read an article by an outraged journalist.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.520
It's abalone.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.520
Shark Week is abalone.

06:53.520 --> 06:58.520
And dot funny.

06:58.520 --> 07:07.520
And Discovery Canada aired a very controversial commercial featuring fake iPhone footage of a shark in Lake Ontario.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.520
What?

07:08.520 --> 07:18.520
And they say, watch Shark Week here in Canada, Discovery Canada, and they aired this little iPhone video that they staged with a fake shark in Lake Ontario.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.520
And there's just a bunch of guys going, hey, hey, man, can we catch a fish?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.520
Yeah, man, let's catch a fish.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.520
Whoa, look, a shark!

07:25.520 --> 07:27.520
And it's like this shark comes up and...

07:27.520 --> 07:31.520
Why are they all from California then?

07:31.520 --> 07:37.520
Yeah, I just think anyone that doesn't even think physical sounds like this.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.520
Have you seen the Rob Lowe commercial for it?

07:40.520 --> 07:43.520
He goes, so sharky.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.520
What?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.520
Rob Lowe is like jet skiing?

07:46.520 --> 07:47.520
What's he doing?

07:47.520 --> 07:48.520
He's standing on sharks.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.520
He's standing on sharks like water skis kind of.

07:51.520 --> 07:55.520
And there's some bikini gals, and he goes, so sharky.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.520
No, I wouldn't say that.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.520
I don't understand this person's outrage.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.520
I guess this brings up an interesting topic.

08:02.520 --> 08:07.520
Is the media supposed to have integrity, or are people supposed to...

08:07.520 --> 08:09.520
Isn't that ship sailed?

08:09.520 --> 08:11.520
Isn't the ball in people's court now?

08:11.520 --> 08:13.520
Aren't we supposed to have integrity now?

08:13.520 --> 08:16.520
We have to realize that the media is full of shit and start acting accordingly.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.520
There's no thing like on John Oliver's show last week tonight or whatever,

08:19.520 --> 08:25.520
and he talked about where they're making advertisement mimic news articles.

08:25.520 --> 08:29.520
They look like news, and so it's the idea that we're making things look real,

08:29.520 --> 08:31.520
but it's all just ads.

08:31.520 --> 08:36.520
And the LA Times years and years ago started running things that looked like news

08:36.520 --> 08:40.520
at the bottom third of the front page, and it was all advertisement.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.520
And that caused a big shit storm.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.520
But you should be able to...

08:44.520 --> 08:48.520
I mean, we've entered an age now where it should just be up to people

08:48.520 --> 08:51.520
to know that everything they see in here is fucking garbage bullshit.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.520
I mean, we live on the inside of a goddamn honeycomb that we built

08:56.520 --> 08:59.520
of people before us that were raised on media that was full of horse shit, too.

08:59.520 --> 09:04.520
Like, we're three layers deep in a fucking beehive of garbage.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.520
There's nothing, nothing. New York Times, fuck off.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.520
There's nothing in there that's true.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.520
Everything's the opposite of truth.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.520
Anything that's not telling you that you live in a giant empire

09:15.520 --> 09:20.520
that's running on the blood of the impoverished around the earth is a lie.

09:20.520 --> 09:25.520
There's no sharks in Lake Ontario, and nothing else is true either.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.520
No myths have been busted.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.520
And by the way, I'm not complaining.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.520
I love poor people's blood. It powers my new car.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.520
I'm fucking, I love it.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.520
I just think we should wear togas and commit to it.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.520
Like Rome, they didn't have media in Rome that was lying.

09:41.520 --> 09:45.520
And people were like, that ad for a cherry, it looks like a newspaper article.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.520
Go, go, go, go.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.520
No, lies, lies.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.520
How what am I to do?

09:52.520 --> 09:55.520
No, people get out there and give speeches, and they would...

09:55.520 --> 09:57.520
Yeah, they would lie that way, and everyone knew they were lying,

09:57.520 --> 10:00.520
and then every five years they'd kill them.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.520
Here comes the big liar, hey, liar.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.520
It's too powerful to call out lying too loud, because then he'll have us killed,

10:07.520 --> 10:10.520
but pretty soon, let's rise up and kill him.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.520
Everybody knew that everyone was lying.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.520
The religion was a lie. Everyone knew it.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.520
They were like, what do you worship?

10:14.520 --> 10:16.520
Cat god.

10:16.520 --> 10:21.520
He meows and makes the moon to turn into the sun.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.520
Do you worship him or worship him?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.520
I just love the parties.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.520
I love dressing like a cat on Saturday.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.520
You know, it's just like this idea that anything that you hear from anyone else

10:33.520 --> 10:38.520
is anything other than entertainment, edification, like sharing emotion, you know.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.520
Like, we're a bunch of thumb-sucking babies,

10:41.520 --> 10:47.520
worrying about whether Shark Week has lost its integrity.

10:47.520 --> 10:52.520
What is Discovery Channel supposed to be the last bastion of fucking...

10:52.520 --> 10:54.520
That's so sad.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.520
We all like Breaking Bad.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.520
That's a network that used to be American movie classics.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.520
Everybody headed for the hills at a certain point.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.520
They're like, oh shit, Internet, run!

11:03.520 --> 11:05.520
Everyone change the name of your network.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.520
And just call it KY Jelly.

11:09.520 --> 11:14.520
Don't forget that it used to be Kentucky Yoke...

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
Finish it, Jelly.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.520
Okay.

11:18.520 --> 11:23.520
Every network has like these letters and then you go like, oh yeah, that was the Nashville Network.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.520
Yeah, I guess.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.520
Now it's just fucking whatever, man, every man for itself.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.520
The learning channel and the history channel have become hilarious.

11:31.520 --> 11:36.520
And then some of them try to cling to some vestige of their old identity and going like,

11:36.520 --> 11:38.520
the learning channel.

11:38.520 --> 11:42.520
Because everything's learning.

11:42.520 --> 11:47.520
They have these new slogans like, we're watching the Discovery Channel.

11:47.520 --> 11:53.520
Sometimes television is Discovery.

11:53.520 --> 11:58.520
Right now you're learning that there's a monster's rerun on it.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.520
The history channel.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.520
You know what tomorrow's history is?

12:02.520 --> 12:04.520
Whatever happened today?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.520
You know what's happened today?

12:06.520 --> 12:09.520
Ben Johnson's eating the sandwich.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.520
So, airing tonight, tomorrow's history.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.520
Yeah.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.520
Alright, so anyways, I mean, what's not, please, it's a television.

12:15.520 --> 12:20.520
If you ask a toaster, what's the most important thing in the world?

12:20.520 --> 12:22.520
It's gonna tell you bread.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.520
And if you ask a toaster, it's opinion of bread.

12:24.520 --> 12:28.520
It's going to say, I don't think it's toasted enough.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.520
So let's look at the television as an appliance.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.520
What do you think it's doing?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.520
It's making you watch it.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.520
Is your neighbor racist?

12:36.520 --> 12:38.520
Is it dangerous to go outside?

12:38.520 --> 12:39.520
Fuck yeah!

12:39.520 --> 12:42.520
Says the television.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.520
Does your racist neighbor have bread?

12:45.520 --> 12:46.520
Says the toaster.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.520
Bring it in here.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.520
If you can't finish it, put it in me.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.520
Says the refrigerator.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.520
But the fucking television is the worst of all.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.520
It's telling you just whatever you do, stay in your living rooms.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.520
And it will tell you anything to make that happen.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.520
Don't go to church.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.520
Don't go skiing.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.520
Does the toaster tell, when you're in bed at night,

13:07.520 --> 13:11.520
does the toaster tell the TV, when they get up, tell him to buy more bread?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.520
I don't know.

13:13.520 --> 13:18.520
There's nothing about bread commercials on every channel.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.520
The balance has been unbalanced.

13:21.520 --> 13:26.520
I don't know, maybe there's fun musical numbers like Beauty and the Beast.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.520
I met Werner Herzog.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.520
I saw the photo of that, it's amazing.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.520
That was after a 15 minute chat about movies.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.520
He came in and did a voice for Rick and Morty.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.520
I have Werner Herzog questions.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.520
Did he disappoint or did he satisfy?

13:42.520 --> 13:47.520
I've never met a famous person that was just exactly what you'd expect.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.520
But it's not to say that he's predictable at all,

13:50.520 --> 13:55.520
because what you expect at Werner Herzog is that he's going to come in and be Werner Herzog.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.520
So he came in and I said, thank you for coming.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
Oh, thank you.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.520
I found a parking outside.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.520
He wanted to know.

14:03.520 --> 14:10.520
He wanted to know the voice of a cartoon alien.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.520
The character's name is Old Reptile.

14:12.520 --> 14:23.520
So he's like, is he a crocodile?

14:23.520 --> 14:24.520
Snake?

14:24.520 --> 14:27.520
He's an Old Reptile, he's an alien.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.520
Do you have some form of...

14:30.520 --> 14:33.520
I can't make him sound like Peter Lorre.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.520
You're a little Michael Madsen there too.

14:36.520 --> 14:43.520
Do you have a fucking ear I could cut off?

14:43.520 --> 14:45.520
He wanted to see something.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.520
The character hasn't been drawn yet.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.520
So there's no concept art?

14:48.520 --> 14:50.520
So we showed him a little bit of Rick and Morty.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.520
I showed him a scene from the pilot when they're in the intergalactic customs.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.520
So he watches it for a second and he goes, ah, yes, I see.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.520
Yes, they are creatures but they speak normally.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.520
Wait, okay.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.520
Second Werner Herzog question.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.520
Is Werner Herzog now going...

15:09.520 --> 15:13.520
Is he going to be on like Bob's Burgers and stuff too?

15:13.520 --> 15:14.520
I hope not.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
Is he out doing cartoon voices?

15:16.520 --> 15:18.520
How did you pull this?

15:18.520 --> 15:22.520
We just sent to the casting department while he'd do it.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.520
He's in LA and they were like, yeah, he'll do it.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.520
Well, I don't want to...

15:28.520 --> 15:30.520
He just did it for scale.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.520
So you got Werner Herzog in the booth.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.520
And he's got the headphones on.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.520
And who's directing him?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.520
I'm directing him.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.520
And Justin's there probably?

15:38.520 --> 15:39.520
Well, he had a lot of questions about it.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.520
He was like, so do you want me to do exaggerated...

15:44.520 --> 15:45.520
Why do I...

15:45.520 --> 15:46.520
I can't do...

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
I was doing this impression for a while.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
Just go part German.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
Be more straight.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.520
I can't...

15:50.520 --> 15:56.520
I think that we have ways of making you talk.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.520
That's just a phrase I use to get into my German character.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.520
I'm sorry to our German listeners.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.520
It's a little Don Corleone right now.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.520
That is the day of my furor's wedding.

16:07.520 --> 16:12.520
You come to me.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.520
All right, so anyways, maybe...

16:14.520 --> 16:15.520
He's in the booth.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.520
I mean, tell me if you're ready for this one.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.520
First he had to understand...

16:20.520 --> 16:24.520
He was like, do you want me to do an exaggerated version of myself?

16:24.520 --> 16:25.520
I said, no, no, no.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.520
Don't do...

16:26.520 --> 16:27.520
Just be yourself.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.520
And he's like...

16:29.520 --> 16:32.520
You know, myself is...

16:32.520 --> 16:33.520
Here we go.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.520
You know, that's...

16:34.520 --> 16:36.520
This is an automobile construct.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.520
And I said, well, the guy that you are...

16:39.520 --> 16:42.520
You know, the guy that you are having grown up watching your movies.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.520
Like that guy.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.520
And he's like, oh, well, see, that guy, you know, that is...

16:47.520 --> 16:52.520
I am being an exaggerated version of myself.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.520
I said, okay, yeah, exactly.

16:54.520 --> 16:55.520
He's saying...

16:55.520 --> 16:56.520
Presentational.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.520
In his movies, he's performing for us?

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
He just means...

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
He just means like anybody is.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.520
Like when you're talking into a microphone,

17:03.520 --> 17:05.520
you fucking step on the gas a little bit.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.520
So then he got in the booth and already watched the cartoon.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
He said, yeah, the creatures speak normal.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.520
And then he got in and he does this monologue.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.520
And it's about penises.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.520
And it's just this big, long monologue.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.520
He'd already read the material before he got there.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.520
Yeah.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
And he said, I read the screenplay.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.520
And I synced it.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.520
I synced it.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.520
It is very funny.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.520
Yeah.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.520
And I was like, yeah, you bet.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.520
You bet your...

17:35.520 --> 17:38.520
He went in there and then he fucking nailed it.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.520
Like first take, he just did it.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.520
And because he's playing an old reptile who,

17:42.520 --> 17:44.520
without spoiling the story,

17:44.520 --> 17:46.520
he's just a cameo.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.520
He's just an old reptile alien who's explaining to the other aliens

17:49.520 --> 17:52.520
that he's spent a lot of time on Earth,

17:52.520 --> 17:53.520
among the Earthlings,

17:53.520 --> 17:56.520
and noticed their relationship with their penises.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.520
So...

17:57.520 --> 18:03.520
And it's just a big, long monologue about this cosmic observer

18:03.520 --> 18:07.520
talking about how humans feel about their penises.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.520
It's funny when they're small.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.520
It's funny when they're big.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.520
It's...

18:12.520 --> 18:15.520
I've been to parties where men will take an object,

18:15.520 --> 18:17.520
hold it in front and say,

18:17.520 --> 18:21.520
hey, I missed her so-and-so dick.

18:21.520 --> 18:26.520
Was it Pringles by any chance, Ben?

18:26.520 --> 18:29.520
So, he nails it.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.520
And then we just did something.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.520
I was like, well, can you do it more intense?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.520
Can you do it more tragic?

18:34.520 --> 18:35.520
Can you do it more things?

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
And then he...

18:36.520 --> 18:37.520
It was fun.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.520
It was a lot of fun.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.520
Then he plopped down and talked about...

18:39.520 --> 18:41.520
I wanted to talk to you about the act of killing

18:41.520 --> 18:43.520
because he executed, produced that,

18:43.520 --> 18:46.520
and he explained how he discovered that movie

18:46.520 --> 18:49.520
or how it was brought to him by Joshua Oppenheimer.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.520
And we talked about how amazing that movie was for a while.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.520
And it turns out he, for those of you who have seen it,

18:55.520 --> 18:57.520
like, I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't,

18:57.520 --> 19:00.520
go find the act of killing and watch it.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.520
I've talked about it on this podcast.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.520
It's one of the most incredible documentaries I've ever seen.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.520
The ending of it will be particularly impacting to you.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.520
And he told this story about how he was actually very key

19:13.520 --> 19:17.520
in the way that that ending was edited or rather not edited.

19:17.520 --> 19:22.520
He was the voice of trying to convince the filmmaker.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
You can't.

19:23.520 --> 19:27.520
You have to show all three minutes of this unedited at all.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.520
And I said to him, if you do this,

19:30.520 --> 19:35.520
if you shoot this movie for seven years

19:35.520 --> 19:41.520
and then edit the final three minutes in any way,

19:41.520 --> 19:45.520
you have spent your life in vain.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.520
And I said, is that also how you order breakfast?

19:54.520 --> 19:58.520
If I do not get feta cheese and a scramble,

19:58.520 --> 20:01.520
if there aren't also bits of bacon.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.520
And I was amazed by his story.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.520
I was like, wow, this guy's a real fucking, like, he's a genius.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.520
That story proves it.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.520
But then he said another story that kind of undercut it

20:12.520 --> 20:14.520
because I meant, he said, who else has done the show?

20:14.520 --> 20:15.520
And I said, Stephen Colbert.

20:15.520 --> 20:21.520
And he said, I had an influence on Stephen Colbert.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.520
I say that with humility, but he, I was doing his show

20:26.520 --> 20:29.520
and he came up to me in the hallway before

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
and I had not seen it.

20:30.520 --> 20:36.520
I asked him, is it Colbert or Colbert?

20:36.520 --> 20:39.520
And he said, oh, it's the French.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
It's Colbert.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.520
And I said, that being the case,

20:43.520 --> 20:48.520
you should think about changing the pronunciation of reports

20:48.520 --> 20:51.520
and do the French of that, which is rapport.

20:51.520 --> 20:55.520
And soon after that, he started using that pronunciation

20:55.520 --> 20:57.520
of the show.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.520
And I was like, adorable.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.520
And I said, did you meet him on the Daily Show?

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
Or did you meet him?

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
And he's like, no, no, his show.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.520
I'm like, oh, that's when he started pronouncing it differently.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.520
OK.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.520
And then I just moved on.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.520
You can just picture what it was like doing that

21:11.520 --> 21:13.520
and Stephen Colbert going, you know what?

21:13.520 --> 21:14.520
I'm going to do that.

21:14.520 --> 21:19.520
You know exactly how that story unfolded.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.520
That's so cute.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.520
But an amazing guy had really just kind of, yeah,

21:23.520 --> 21:25.520
when he enters the room, it's kind of, I don't know,

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
you feel it.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
What archetype is that?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.520
He's like, he fills a niche for people.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.520
I think sometimes in his documentary,

21:31.520 --> 21:34.520
Grizzly Man is sometimes, he injects himself a little more

21:34.520 --> 21:36.520
than I think he might want to do.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.520
He makes himself more of a protagonist in his documentary

21:39.520 --> 21:42.520
sometime where he's like, what's up with Grizzly Man?

21:42.520 --> 21:46.520
He's like, he's hearing the cell phone of the guy

21:46.520 --> 21:47.520
getting killed by the bear.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.520
And he's in front of the wife.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.520
He's like, oh, this is the worst.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.520
You should never listen to this.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
Yes, never listen to this.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.520
Don't ever.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
This is really bad stuff.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
Don't, don't listen to this.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.520
Yeah, he does a lot of weird stuff.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.520
That's why you're watching his movies.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.520
You feel this like, you feel like you're in the hands

22:04.520 --> 22:06.520
of some strange master, you know.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.520
You know, it's great.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.520
His movies might take some weird left turn.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.520
Have you seen My Best Fiend?

22:10.520 --> 22:11.520
About him and Charles Kinski?

22:11.520 --> 22:12.520
That's a doozy.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.520
Yeah, that's how I was introduced to him actually.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.520
That was one of Dino's favorite movies.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.520
Yeah.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.520
He showed that to me.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.520
But yeah, what a gem.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.520
I'd like him to, I'd like him to be New Pierce

22:20.520 --> 22:21.520
on Community.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.520
I think that would be great.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.520
Oh, yeah.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.520
That's so amazing.

22:26.520 --> 22:27.520
Yes.

22:27.520 --> 22:31.520
This, this, this things you are talking about

22:31.520 --> 22:34.520
at the study room table is,

22:34.520 --> 22:36.520
I understand the concepts,

22:36.520 --> 22:47.520
but the real question is at what price?

22:47.520 --> 22:53.520
And if you change the letters in price, you get Pierce.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.520
I'm getting a, I'm getting a new car.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.520
I want, I want, I want to, yeah, I know.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.520
It's a few cheers first.

23:00.520 --> 23:01.520
I know.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.520
I said it that way.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.520
You reacted that way.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.520
It's just the one that runs on human blood.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.520
Yeah.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.520
It's just, yes.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.520
It has a straw that goes from it to the third world.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.520
It's a new like super stretchy straw.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.520
Where are you driving in LA?

23:17.520 --> 23:21.520
The straw reaches over to the Gaza Strip

23:21.520 --> 23:32.520
and it just, it just sucks up too late.

23:32.520 --> 23:36.520
You didn't care 40 years ago.

23:36.520 --> 23:41.520
Their parents were in a live 40 years ago.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.520
I don't know why I'm trying to high road you.

23:43.520 --> 23:47.520
I pay my taxes like everyone else.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.520
The, but anyways, yeah, I'm getting a,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.520
I need to get a new car.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.520
So I came home last night.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.520
You're getting that Tesla?

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
We were hanging out.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
I decided against the Tesla.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.520
It's too, it's out of my, it's, it's not for me.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.520
It's for guys that are like, you know, like super like,

24:01.520 --> 24:05.520
like, you know, like Rockefeller, like, you know,

24:05.520 --> 24:07.520
I'm not ready yet for the Tesla.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.520
Wayne Brady has a Tesla.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.520
He's not Rockefeller.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.520
Wayne Brady is more Rockefeller than I am.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.520
Wayne Brady can have a Tesla.

24:12.520 --> 24:16.520
You shouldn't have a Tesla until you have more than one car.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.520
That's what it is.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.520
You should have one of those special garages

24:19.520 --> 24:21.520
like in Ferris Bueller's day off.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.520
Like, like, like a car, like a car garage.

24:23.520 --> 24:28.520
Like a, like a, like, like where, like a garage.

24:28.520 --> 24:32.520
No, as, as opposed to the black widow toilet storage

24:32.520 --> 24:36.520
that I have, I have like six toilets

24:36.520 --> 24:38.520
and a bunch of McDonald's cups.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.520
Why do you have six toilets?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.520
I'll tell you, I'm glad you asked.

24:41.520 --> 24:45.520
Because there was some, and I,

24:45.520 --> 24:48.520
maybe I'm getting myself in trouble, I'd say.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.520
Is that an exaggeration first off?

24:49.520 --> 24:50.520
Are there really six toilets?

24:50.520 --> 24:51.520
I think it's like five toilets or something.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.520
It doesn't make sense.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.520
Just five toilets looming about in your, in your car garage.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.520
There's three bathrooms in my house.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.520
So why would there be more than three toilets?

24:58.520 --> 25:00.520
Maybe it's three in a, it just, it looks like five.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.520
Oh, you know what it is?

25:02.520 --> 25:04.520
I bet it's like the tank comes in one box or something.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.520
I don't know.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
It's a bunch of boxes.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.520
They're in boxes.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.520
There's not just loose toilets.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.520
No, they're, they're brand new.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.520
It doesn't look like a public restroom in there.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.520
When I bought my home, the realtor explained to me,

25:16.520 --> 25:19.520
I don't know, I don't know if we're all going to end up in jail

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
for me saying this.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.520
The realtor told me there's a, in the 70s,

25:24.520 --> 25:27.520
there was this law passed that said like anyone that bought a new,

25:27.520 --> 25:32.520
bought a home new had to change the toilets out to these low flush toilets

25:32.520 --> 25:34.520
because there was this big drought in the 70s

25:34.520 --> 25:35.520
and there was this rule passed.

25:35.520 --> 25:39.520
And it's, you know, you're only required to buy the toilets.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.520
That's all they're going to check on.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.520
So I'll just have them put them in the garage.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
What?

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
Why not install them?

25:46.520 --> 25:48.520
Because they're low flush, Jeff.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.520
I have giant turds.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.520
I'm a 41 year old behemoth.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.520
I'm a, I'm a human bear.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.520
But low flush toilets still flush the big turds too.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.520
They're just, they're just, they're more modern.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.520
They're, they're, they're designed.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.520
So what's the low part that they're like groovy?

26:02.520 --> 26:05.520
I think, I think toilets early on were,

26:05.520 --> 26:08.520
were designed without water conservation in mind.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.520
And so there was just needless water usage.

26:10.520 --> 26:11.520
All right.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.520
Well, I'll have a task rabbit come over.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.520
You guys use task rabbit?

26:14.520 --> 26:19.520
It's like the Uber of having people like do shit around your house.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.520
You can just, you can just, Aaron uses it.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.520
You can just call it task rabbit.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.520
You've got, you've got boxes of toilets there just as a graft thing.

26:25.520 --> 26:26.520
Like where you just try to.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.520
It's like, yeah, it's kind of like, yeah,

26:28.520 --> 26:30.520
when Paulie took over the bar and good fellas.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.520
Yeah. It's like the toilets came in.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
They went out.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.520
They're just toilets.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.520
They're just sitting there.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.520
They're brand new toilets.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.520
If you want, if you want a toilet.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.520
Now I feel guilty.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.520
I'll have them installed.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.520
Jesus Christ.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.520
I thought when I heard low flush, I thought,

26:46.520 --> 26:48.520
oh, that's so less turds go down.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.520
That doesn't seem very convenient.

26:51.520 --> 26:56.520
So anyways, I don't want to get off a lot of tangents.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.520
I, I, I'm getting a new car.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.520
I'm driving, I need to get a new car.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
And I want to be very careful about it.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.520
I've never really bought a grown up car before.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.520
And what are you getting?

27:07.520 --> 27:11.520
I don't know, but I came home last night after we were at little Tom's for a while.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.520
And Aaron didn't come out because she said she was working on something.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.520
It turns out she was working on,

27:15.520 --> 27:20.520
she made a PowerPoint presentation for me to help me price cars and look at them.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.520
And a little, it was a little presentation.

27:22.520 --> 27:27.520
It said, it said, it was called Honk for Harmon.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.520
And then, and then it listed the criteria that I've been talking about.

27:31.520 --> 27:35.520
Turns out the thing that I'm interested in is called infotainment.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.520
I didn't know there was a word for it.

27:38.520 --> 27:44.520
I've heard of edutainment and I like that just as little as infotainment.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.520
Jesus Christ, I thought they fixed the air conditioning in here.

27:47.520 --> 27:48.520
All right.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.520
Uh, yeah, it's, it's info.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.520
I don't know, it's all the shit that you want to know about a car,

27:52.520 --> 27:56.520
but then I'm like, what about the screen and the thing and the doodads?

27:56.520 --> 27:57.520
So you want the, the interactivity.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.520
I was like, get a chastle.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.520
They got that giant.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.520
Like there's like five iPods in there.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.520
iPads is 60 to a hundred something thousand dollars.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.520
Like it's like, it's like two, you can't lease one.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.520
You got that Yahoo money now.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.520
I'm spending that on the wedding.

28:14.520 --> 28:18.520
And also I'm like, we're going to do crazy shit with Harmontown.com.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.520
And like, I've already, I'm already spending too much money,

28:22.520 --> 28:23.520
but I'm going to get a night.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.520
I'm going to get a really nice like grown up car.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.520
What's the front runners right now for you in the PowerPoint presentation?

28:29.520 --> 28:31.520
Well, I thought I'd share this on the podcast in case anybody,

28:31.520 --> 28:34.520
any of you car companies out there wanted to,

28:34.520 --> 28:39.520
I was thinking maybe a BMW, an infinity, a Mercedes.

28:39.520 --> 28:44.520
If you're listening out there, you know, I'm still looking around.

28:44.520 --> 28:48.520
Uh, give me a call.

28:48.520 --> 28:52.520
I mean, I'll only be, you know, doing this podcast for all these.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.520
Why don't we advertise in the show?

28:54.520 --> 28:55.520
Do we decide not to?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.520
We, we're waiting for the big fucking hall.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.520
We're not going for that short chump change, short con fucking.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.520
Because, because I was talking to Wade Randolph today,

29:02.520 --> 29:05.520
and he, you know, and Willie Roberts have a show.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.520
What's it called? A real life sci-fi or something like that?

29:07.520 --> 29:08.520
And they're already advertising.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.520
They already have revenue.

29:10.520 --> 29:11.520
They're already pulling it in.

29:11.520 --> 29:12.520
Yeah, but how much?

29:12.520 --> 29:13.520
I don't know.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.520
I don't know.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.520
I mean, it's like.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.520
Yeah, but we went, we've been courting Nike for 30 years now.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.520
It's beer money.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.520
If you're, if you're down there, you know, smaller audience or whatever,

29:24.520 --> 29:28.520
like if you're not like some kind of big giant thing that people are flocking to,

29:28.520 --> 29:32.520
to hear all their news or something, you can't really, it's kind of like,

29:32.520 --> 29:33.520
it'll sustain.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.520
I would like that.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.520
Like, it's like, when our podcast start and I goes,

29:36.520 --> 29:39.520
Feral audio and then my music plays right before that.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.520
Tonight's Harmontown brought to you by BMW.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
The ultimate driving machine.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.520
Yeah.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.520
But don't just get me like, like, I'll just be saying, Holy shit, Jeff,

29:49.520 --> 29:53.520
I got the BMW SX 75 99 series.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.520
It's so great.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.520
I feel I'm such a happier person because of it.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.520
You know, I'll be saying stuff like that when I get my new car.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
That goes against everything.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.520
I'll be doing it.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.520
I'll be doing it.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.520
I'll be saying it for real.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.520
Like the way I say, I love Minecraft.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.520
Why aren't they paying you?

30:10.520 --> 30:13.520
They don't need the money and they don't need to advertise.

30:13.520 --> 30:17.520
It's like the best thing in the world.

30:17.520 --> 30:23.520
I made a, I made a, I made a, like a refinery in Minecraft.

30:23.520 --> 30:29.520
I had this pipe coming up because I play this like tech world to mod it out thing.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.520
Spencer set up a server for it.

30:31.520 --> 30:36.520
And so I made a glass dome and I have these little robots mine for me.

30:36.520 --> 30:40.520
Because who the fuck wants to mine in Minecraft?

30:40.520 --> 30:42.520
And then they put everything in a chest and then pumps,

30:42.520 --> 30:47.520
deliver the ore and everything through these pipes, goes under my glass dome,

30:47.520 --> 30:50.520
up through the ground in the center of the dome,

30:50.520 --> 30:54.520
and into a series of pumps that go out four ways.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.520
Separates the cobblestone, the dirt, the sand and the gravel.

30:57.520 --> 31:01.520
I put some into assembly lines that compress them for easier storage.

31:01.520 --> 31:06.520
And I was so proud of myself and I had a jet pack that I made.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.520
And I soared up above the dome to look at my...

31:08.520 --> 31:11.520
We're making podcast history, right?

31:11.520 --> 31:15.520
I soared up above my dome to look at my new refinery.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.520
You can soar above like an omnipotent force?

31:17.520 --> 31:19.520
Yeah, with a jet pack.

31:19.520 --> 31:27.520
And I soared up above it and it looked exactly like a swastika.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.520
Because it's like stemming out and then it goes to right angles.

31:30.520 --> 31:36.520
And I was like, oh shit, do I change it?

31:36.520 --> 31:40.520
And I showed it to Erin and she's like, yeah, that really looks like a swastika.

31:40.520 --> 31:45.520
And I said, yeah, and it looks like a swastika for the worst reason.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.520
Efficiency.

31:47.520 --> 31:52.520
It would be one thing if I was just some punk kid,

31:52.520 --> 31:59.520
but it was like, yeah, I made this thing that sorts things and processes them.

31:59.520 --> 32:09.520
It was an accidental byproduct that looked down and there's Hitler giving me the thumbs up.

32:09.520 --> 32:16.520
You're doing great. Good job, Mr. Cobblestone Dominator.

32:16.520 --> 32:24.520
I just started playing Clash of Clans and every hundredth base you go see looks like a swastika.

32:24.520 --> 32:33.520
I think it's accidental. Some are just geometric shapes that look like they have a little swirly right angles.

32:33.520 --> 32:37.520
And they are either backwards or proper swastikas.

32:37.520 --> 32:44.520
And some are like, okay, that guy, his name also has like, you know, like umlauts in it and shit.

32:44.520 --> 32:51.520
So that's how they're trying to, that's how they're going to make a comeback? The Clash of Clans?

32:51.520 --> 32:57.520
When I was a kid, this might be bullshit, but I remember being a little kid on Main Street in Disneyland

32:57.520 --> 33:01.520
and when you walked on Main Street there's curtains and supposedly,

33:01.520 --> 33:08.520
and maybe it was imprinted on my mind, but there were curtains that had little swastikas on them on Main Street.

33:08.520 --> 33:12.520
But that's also like an old-timey, you know, like an old, you know...

33:12.520 --> 33:16.520
An old, no, an old-timey Nazi...

33:16.520 --> 33:18.520
That symbol predates Nazism by...

33:18.520 --> 33:22.520
Yeah, but I don't think that there were like, Incan Indians or whoever used it,

33:22.520 --> 33:27.520
but like, that symbol predates Nazism in the sense that it's an American Native American.

33:27.520 --> 33:32.520
Yeah, it's for, yeah, it's like my friend...

33:32.520 --> 33:38.520
Yeah, but he's saying it, but Walt Disney wasn't really into India.

33:38.520 --> 33:42.520
Anyways, Jesus Christ, are you dying?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.520
I'm cool to trot over here.

33:44.520 --> 33:47.520
Really? Maybe it's just fat.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
Cheat day.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.520
Cheat day, I'm probably sweating like cupcakes.

33:50.520 --> 33:54.520
You're sweating like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter right now.

33:54.520 --> 33:58.520
It's a Chris Rock joke.

33:58.520 --> 34:02.520
I thought that was a Dallas reference.

34:02.520 --> 34:06.520
You're so old.

34:06.520 --> 34:10.520
I don't even know what we're talking about.

34:10.520 --> 34:15.520
Patrick Ewing wasn't even an oil tycoon in the primetime soap opera.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.520
Why are you sweating so much?

34:18.520 --> 34:26.520
I see people fanning. Yeah, I'm like a freshly served Big Mac here.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.520
I should have said McRib, that would have been funnier.

34:29.520 --> 34:37.520
Stay tuned after the show for Harmontown After Hours, where I do a little punch-up on my...

34:37.520 --> 34:39.520
on all the things I say.

34:39.520 --> 34:44.520
Why don't we bring out Erin McGathy?

34:44.520 --> 35:01.520
Yeah, you look very pretty and you're very jolly and you're dancing,

35:01.520 --> 35:05.520
but in five minutes you're going to look like this.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.520
You have a lot of layers on right now.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.520
I feel like a fucking rosemary potato.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.520
You're dressed for like a brisk spring day.

35:12.520 --> 35:18.520
Yeah, I gained some weight recently and it's an illusion.

35:18.520 --> 35:22.520
I'm a body magician.

35:22.520 --> 35:30.520
The layers make you think, oh, she's so thin that she has to heat up.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.520
It's called the Mary Kate diet is what I'm doing.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.520
She's chilled to the bone.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.520
I feel very comfortable though.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.520
I did too when I first came up here.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.520
It's heat, you know, it takes a while.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.520
It takes a second.

35:43.520 --> 35:48.520
I will tell you during this pause that after the show tonight,

35:48.520 --> 35:55.520
our producer Dustin Marshall's lovely girlfriend Elizabeth Messick is doing a little gig,

35:55.520 --> 36:00.520
a little half-hour spot with her band over at Harvard and Stone.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
Golden afternoon.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.520
Harvard and Stone, really?

36:02.520 --> 36:04.520
Yeah, it's only a couple of minutes from here, so...

36:04.520 --> 36:05.520
So rock and roll thingy.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.520
I don't know if I will be going to the drawing room tonight after the show as we usually do

36:09.520 --> 36:16.520
because I will be dead on the floor like a recently recaptured Scientologist

36:16.520 --> 36:21.520
thrown into their detox chamber.

36:21.520 --> 36:26.520
I'm sweating my life force out right now, so I probably won't be able to...

36:26.520 --> 36:28.520
Do you have a bottle of water here?

36:28.520 --> 36:32.520
I have God's water.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.520
You're a big rim podcasting.

36:35.520 --> 36:40.520
Yeah, right, yeah, well, if we're going to call my bluff, I'll stop complaining.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.520
I'm not going to hydrate.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.520
I need water.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.520
I need chicken water.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.520
How's it going, sweetie?

36:47.520 --> 36:50.520
What's it like to be engaged to me?

36:50.520 --> 36:52.520
Do you like it?

36:52.520 --> 36:53.520
Yeah, are you...

36:53.520 --> 36:57.520
While you hesitate, don't go.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.520
You mean like the period before getting married?

37:00.520 --> 37:02.520
Like an engagement?

37:02.520 --> 37:06.520
Yeah, it's great.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.520
Resounding hooray.

37:09.520 --> 37:16.520
I mean, I feel spiritually like we got engaged much...

37:16.520 --> 37:22.520
Someone's very friend has visited.

37:22.520 --> 37:23.520
I don't know.

37:23.520 --> 37:24.520
Yeah, it's great.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.520
I love it.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.520
Yeah.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.520
I don't have anything tonight.

37:28.520 --> 37:31.520
Today was a really fun day.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.520
It was kind of a perfect day.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.520
What happened?

37:34.520 --> 37:36.520
Take us through your day, Aaron.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.520
Well, we were up.

37:39.520 --> 37:43.520
I forced you to play catchphrase last night, Jeff Davis.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.520
Yeah, I was home at like 10.30 p.m.

37:46.520 --> 37:51.520
and then went to your guy's place at midnight, I think, and left there at 3.30.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.520
We played catchphrase and we watched Who's Line.

37:54.520 --> 38:01.520
And also, we cried looking at YouTubes about people loving animals.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.520
It was just another night at Dan and Aaron's.

38:05.520 --> 38:11.520
I remember we were watching Dogs Decoded, a Nova episode about dogs.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.520
I thought Russian ladies trying to make foxes angry and shit.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.520
It was really ugly.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.520
Yeah, I was excited.

38:16.520 --> 38:23.520
They were showing this Russian lady who was trying to figure out if tameness in canines is genetic.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.520
Or if it's nurture.

38:26.520 --> 38:34.520
So she had all these foxes and cages and they were breeding one half of them for tameness.

38:34.520 --> 38:38.520
Taking the tamest one from each litter and breeding them and so on and so forth.

38:38.520 --> 38:41.520
The others, they were taking the aggressive ones and doing the same thing.

38:41.520 --> 38:47.520
So they had two collections of foxes and they were learning an incredibly important thing about genetics.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.520
They weren't really trying to impress the dogs or anything.

38:50.520 --> 38:55.520
But Aaron just kept going like, why, get those dogs out of the cage.

38:55.520 --> 38:58.520
You don't have to put dogs in cages.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.520
They're foxes.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.520
It's in Russia.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.520
It's 1993.

39:02.520 --> 39:06.520
I was about to say, I don't really remember the documentary.

39:06.520 --> 39:09.520
Get that dog out of the cage.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.520
Get it out.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.520
It's a rape culture.

39:13.520 --> 39:17.520
It's just a male gaze.

39:17.520 --> 39:21.520
There's another Negroni.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.520
Negroni is what I just said.

39:23.520 --> 39:35.520
Yeah, so we were up, which is a cocktail made with vermouth, gin, and compare.

39:35.520 --> 39:36.520
So it turns out.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.520
We played three person catchphrase.

39:38.520 --> 39:41.520
What I'm leading to is that we woke up very hungover.

39:41.520 --> 39:49.520
When you left last night, Jeff, somehow you closed the gate so the gate came inside and was locked.

39:49.520 --> 39:56.520
And our friends, Kimber and Dave, who were staying in our guest room, Dave had to teach a class this morning

39:56.520 --> 39:59.520
and he couldn't get out and he had to jump the fence.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.520
I just closed it behind me.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.520
Yeah, it's not your fault.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
It's the shitty gate.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
It's not your fault.

40:03.520 --> 40:08.520
I found the word secret button to get out and I closed it behind me.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.520
It's not your fault at all because it's happened once before.

40:11.520 --> 40:14.520
If it hadn't, then whew.

40:14.520 --> 40:18.520
With a gate, it closed so hard that our friend couldn't get out of the gate.

40:18.520 --> 40:24.520
What we had to do is we had to take a credit card, actually used Dan's pot card.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.520
So it was like, well, this could be fucked up, right?

40:27.520 --> 40:32.520
They're not going to be like, sir, your pot card's not pristine.

40:32.520 --> 40:36.520
I don't think you're ready to handle this marijuana.

40:36.520 --> 40:42.520
It's a prescription card for medicine I use for my anxiety.

40:42.520 --> 40:46.520
So I think it being fucked up is more of a reason for you to get the medicine.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.520
You're like, look what I did.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.520
I was so anxious.

40:48.520 --> 40:53.520
I tried to eat it.

40:53.520 --> 41:00.520
I got up at 11.30 because my friends couldn't leave the house and got them out.

41:00.520 --> 41:05.520
And then I started, I've been on a little baking cake.

41:05.520 --> 41:16.520
Someone pointed out earlier how dangerous it is to put runts on cupcakes.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.520
Is everybody okay?

41:18.520 --> 41:19.520
Runts?

41:19.520 --> 41:20.520
Yeah, runts.

41:20.520 --> 41:26.520
There's a banana and other colored balls.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.520
The world's biggest, hardest sprinkles.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.520
Yeah, they're dangerous because they're not meant to be like sprinkles.

41:32.520 --> 41:39.520
Maybe you could choke or break your teeth, but it sounds like everybody's okay.

41:39.520 --> 41:43.520
Dead men tell no tales.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.520
We were hungover.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.520
It was a late morning.

41:45.520 --> 41:52.520
It was just very fun because I was baking and I was watching a family movie like I like to do.

41:52.520 --> 41:55.520
I watched Monsters vs. Aliens.

41:55.520 --> 41:59.520
Very great, very body positive.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.520
Made me feel really good.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.520
Someone just said, what?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.520
Watch it.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.520
It's body positive.

42:04.520 --> 42:08.520
You just have to understand that if you're a giant, you're a monster.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.520
But then you're like, no, I want to be a monster.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.520
Right, I want to be a monster.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.520
Seth Rogen laughs too many times.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.520
Just see it.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.520
Is that Amy Poehler in the lead role?

42:20.520 --> 42:22.520
No, I think it's Reese.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.520
Oh, okay.

42:23.520 --> 42:26.520
Witherspoon.

42:26.520 --> 42:29.520
That's a crazy name.

42:29.520 --> 42:32.520
She should own a media conglomerate.

42:32.520 --> 42:35.520
Yeah, yeah, like Sumner Redstone or...

42:35.520 --> 42:40.520
Reese Witherspoon acquired Warner Cable today.

42:40.520 --> 42:47.520
Yeah, we've joked about how media conglomerate presidents always have like warlock names.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.520
Sumner Redstone?

42:50.520 --> 42:52.520
Jesus Christ, don't hurt me.

42:52.520 --> 42:55.520
Don't hurt my village.

42:55.520 --> 42:58.520
Blood River Nighttown?

42:58.520 --> 43:02.520
Even Rupert Murdoch's getting a little sail in me.

43:02.520 --> 43:05.520
He's at the top of a coal tower, for sure.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.520
Who's the other one?

43:06.520 --> 43:09.520
You don't write a script and the good guy's name is Rupert Murdoch.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.520
Who's the other one?

43:10.520 --> 43:12.520
There's another one like Sumner Redstone.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.520
That one's the sexiest.

43:14.520 --> 43:15.520
Yeah, there's another one.

43:15.520 --> 43:20.520
There's a third one that's also like Windwit Willowman.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.520
Well, that's a good system.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.520
Wicker Spellcraft.

43:24.520 --> 43:26.520
Wicker Spellcraft.

43:26.520 --> 43:29.520
Smooth, smooth moon.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.520
Oh, hey everybody.

43:31.520 --> 43:35.520
Why don't you let that be Spencer's theme and we'll bring him out.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.520
Spencer's theme!

43:37.520 --> 43:41.520
Good job, Spencer.

43:48.520 --> 43:51.520
Spencer bounced to the stage like a gazelle.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.520
It's a real obstacle course, but yeah, I'm quirky.

43:54.520 --> 43:58.520
What are you doing?

43:58.520 --> 44:03.520
The president?

44:03.520 --> 44:08.520
Spencer, take us through either a highlight or low light of your day today.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.520
Of my day?

44:09.520 --> 44:10.520
Yeah.

44:10.520 --> 44:11.520
I don't know.

44:11.520 --> 44:15.520
I hung out with Abed this morning, real Abed for you guys.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.520
Highlight or low light?

44:16.520 --> 44:17.520
That was the highlight.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.520
He's a cool guy.

44:19.520 --> 44:22.520
Sometimes he wakes up in the morning, so I text him.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.520
Let's go to Porto's bakery.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.520
And we do.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.520
Oh god, does he die other days?

44:28.520 --> 44:31.520
Some days he doesn't wake up so early.

44:31.520 --> 44:32.520
Oh, Aaron.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.520
I was woken up by Aaron, who clearly thought I might have been dead.

44:36.520 --> 44:37.520
She woke me up.

44:37.520 --> 44:38.520
She was like, Dan!

44:38.520 --> 44:39.520
And I was like, what?

44:39.520 --> 44:40.520
What?

44:40.520 --> 44:43.520
And she was like, oh.

44:43.520 --> 44:46.520
He was very still.

44:46.520 --> 44:49.520
I'm just 41, that's all.

44:49.520 --> 44:53.520
You're watching Duck It By, YouTube bits, and Dan and Aaron's place.

44:53.520 --> 44:58.520
And there's the thing where the guy reunites with the gorilla, and there's this guy that

44:58.520 --> 45:01.520
gets the whale free, and the whale starts breaching and putting on a display.

45:01.520 --> 45:02.520
So we're all kind of tearing up.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.520
Dan falls asleep, because I'm leaving.

45:03.520 --> 45:04.520
I'm going to bed.

45:04.520 --> 45:05.520
And then we start playing catchphrase.

45:05.520 --> 45:10.520
And at some point, Aaron says, I gotta go to the bathroom.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.520
They're all right?

45:11.520 --> 45:12.520
And then she just crawls.

45:12.520 --> 45:15.520
And it's not like the bathroom's right there.

45:15.520 --> 45:19.520
She has to leave a room, leave another room, and then go to a hallway.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.520
She just crawled like a giant baby.

45:21.520 --> 45:24.520
I didn't bother to walk.

45:24.520 --> 45:27.520
I was very drunk at last week's Hammer Town, and spent a lot of this.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.520
Hammer Town.

45:28.520 --> 45:33.520
It's a podcast I do after this one.

45:33.520 --> 45:38.520
That was a Freightian summer soft goddamnit.

45:38.520 --> 45:40.520
Did I really say Hammer Town?

45:40.520 --> 45:41.520
Did I say Hammer Town?

45:41.520 --> 45:42.520
I said Hammer Town.

45:42.520 --> 45:43.520
All right.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.520
Stop.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.520
Hammer Town.

45:47.520 --> 45:52.520
I feel very ashamed of how wasted I was at last week's Hammer Town, because we had been

45:52.520 --> 45:53.520
drinking all day.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.520
And then I do not remember crawling to the bathroom.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.520
I was having a blast.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.520
There was a lot of hollering in the last Hammer Town.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.520
There was lots of yelling.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.520
I got a little sloppy, yeah.

46:02.520 --> 46:06.520
I think I was a little nervous, Dana Carvey, and I maybe drank all too much.

46:06.520 --> 46:09.520
I was crying, really.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.520
Yeah, it was a real mess.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.520
Did you have lunch?

46:14.520 --> 46:15.520
No.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.520
If I don't have lunch, I will literally cry.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.520
It's really embarrassing.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.520
If you don't eat lunch, you'll just start crying?

46:22.520 --> 46:23.520
Yeah.

46:23.520 --> 46:28.520
I mean, obviously, I've never had this kind of burden, but I'd imagine it's a tiny bit

46:28.520 --> 46:32.520
what it's like to get PMS.

46:32.520 --> 46:38.520
Just in terms of like, I'll realize I'm crying, and I'll be like, why am I crying?

46:38.520 --> 46:43.520
Oh, because it's three o'clock and I haven't had any Chinese food.

46:43.520 --> 46:49.520
I mean, it is a similar thing where like, when you have PMS, I mean, people experience

46:49.520 --> 46:54.520
PMS in different ways, but sometimes one will find themselves crying and be like, why am

46:54.520 --> 46:56.520
I such a, oh, it's this.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.520
Yeah, it's just something physiologically.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.520
The surge is coming.

46:59.520 --> 47:03.520
Spencer, next time you and I go for early morning Porto's Bakery, can I come along?

47:03.520 --> 47:04.520
Sure, yeah.

47:04.520 --> 47:05.520
Are you up in the morning?

47:05.520 --> 47:06.520
Yeah.

47:06.520 --> 47:07.520
Yeah.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.520
Woo!

47:08.520 --> 47:11.520
I got some tweets.

47:11.520 --> 47:17.520
I know we have some pilgrims that have come from far and away to see Harvey Chan tonight.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.520
I think there's someone from Belgium here, isn't there?

47:19.520 --> 47:20.520
No, is there really?

47:20.520 --> 47:21.520
Right over there.

47:21.520 --> 47:22.520
I see it.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
Wow!

47:23.520 --> 47:26.520
Why did someone else clap over there?

47:26.520 --> 47:28.520
Maybe they just love Belgium.

47:28.520 --> 47:31.520
Belgium has the best Christmas rituals.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520
What's your name?

47:33.520 --> 47:36.520
If you don't mind just asking, oh, where's the Belgian guy?

47:36.520 --> 47:37.520
Yvonne.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.520
Yvonne?

47:38.520 --> 47:39.520
Yvonne.

47:39.520 --> 47:40.520
Oh, shit.

47:40.520 --> 47:41.520
Yvonne.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.520
Oh, man, that's foreign.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.520
Yvonne, are you shy?

47:47.520 --> 47:51.520
Do you want to come talk to us about Belgium at all?

47:51.520 --> 47:52.520
Okay.

47:52.520 --> 47:53.520
Yvonne!

47:53.520 --> 47:54.520
Yvonne!

47:54.520 --> 47:55.520
Yvonne!

47:55.520 --> 48:05.520
So it's a tiny country, nestled in the highlands of the Belgium area.

48:05.520 --> 48:12.520
Dan, before Levi can fill you in, what do you honestly know about Belgium as a country?

48:12.520 --> 48:13.520
Small?

48:13.520 --> 48:14.520
Landlocked?

48:14.520 --> 48:15.520
No.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.520
All right, that's it.

48:18.520 --> 48:25.520
Tell us anything, Levi.

48:25.520 --> 48:28.520
What are you doing out here?

48:28.520 --> 48:29.520
Business trip?

48:29.520 --> 48:30.520
Pleasure trip?

48:30.520 --> 48:31.520
Roof trip.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.520
Just a road trip?

48:32.520 --> 48:33.520
Yeah.

48:33.520 --> 48:38.520
Levi, you could have flown.

48:38.520 --> 48:42.520
You just came out to the North America to just drive around?

48:42.520 --> 48:43.520
Yeah.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.520
Where else are you going?

48:45.520 --> 48:48.520
You know, after I'm going to Joshua Street Park.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.520
Oh, cool.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
Oh, yeah.

48:50.520 --> 48:52.520
Are you going to do some of those drugs?

48:52.520 --> 48:54.520
No, no, no.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.520
I don't do drugs.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.520
Ah.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.520
Well, it won't be as fun as you can get over here.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.520
It's a desert.

49:02.520 --> 49:07.520
And it's kind of shitty.

49:07.520 --> 49:10.520
People go because no one wants to be there.

49:10.520 --> 49:11.520
It's gorgeous out there.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.520
No, it is.

49:12.520 --> 49:13.520
I actually live there.

49:13.520 --> 49:14.520
I'm sorry.

49:14.520 --> 49:15.520
It's great.

49:15.520 --> 49:16.520
You'll love it.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.520
But you really should do drugs.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.520
And I'll make it better.

49:20.520 --> 49:22.520
He's going to do drugs.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.520
His mom's listening now.

49:24.520 --> 49:25.520
Okay.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.520
What was it?

49:26.520 --> 49:27.520
Is this your first stop?

49:27.520 --> 49:28.520
California?

49:28.520 --> 49:30.520
I went to San Francisco first.

49:30.520 --> 49:31.520
Oh, nice.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.520
We love San Francisco.

49:32.520 --> 49:33.520
We do.

49:33.520 --> 49:34.520
Yeah, me too.

49:34.520 --> 49:35.520
Yeah.

49:35.520 --> 49:40.520
What was your favorite part of San Francisco?

49:40.520 --> 49:45.520
Well, not the hilly parts.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.520
I walked in.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.520
Oh, you walked around.

49:49.520 --> 49:52.520
Oh, is there a hill myth in Belgium?

49:52.520 --> 49:54.520
It's pretty flat.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.520
Oh, okay.

49:55.520 --> 49:58.520
Not used to it.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.520
What do you do in Belgium?

50:00.520 --> 50:01.520
Are you a student?

50:01.520 --> 50:02.520
You look kind of young.

50:02.520 --> 50:03.520
I'm a baker.

50:03.520 --> 50:04.520
A baker.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.520
Oh!

50:05.520 --> 50:06.520
Yes!

50:06.520 --> 50:07.520
Yes!

50:07.520 --> 50:08.520
Yes!

50:08.520 --> 50:09.520
Yes!

50:09.520 --> 50:10.520
Yes!

50:10.520 --> 50:11.520
What do you make?

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
Really?

50:12.520 --> 50:13.520
I mean, what do you...

50:13.520 --> 50:18.520
I mean, for your life?

50:18.520 --> 50:19.520
Yeah.

50:19.520 --> 50:20.520
Yeah.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.520
Do you wear a hat?

50:21.520 --> 50:23.520
My hair just grew a little.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.520
A hat.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.520
Oh, just a hair net?

50:25.520 --> 50:26.520
Yeah.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.520
Just wear one of those hats.

50:27.520 --> 50:31.520
But on school, we had some of those hats.

50:31.520 --> 50:35.520
One of my favorite bakeries that I've ever been to is in Chicago, and it's Belgian.

50:35.520 --> 50:36.520
And they're amazing.

50:36.520 --> 50:39.520
It's like the best pastry is the best coffee.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.520
It's really, really wonderful.

50:40.520 --> 50:41.520
What's...

50:41.520 --> 50:42.520
Oh, sorry.

50:42.520 --> 50:43.520
You go.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.520
No, I think we're going to ask the same question.

50:44.520 --> 50:47.520
Well, what's your favorite pastry?

50:47.520 --> 50:48.520
That you make.

50:48.520 --> 50:49.520
Like, what's...

50:49.520 --> 50:50.520
Yeah.

50:50.520 --> 50:54.520
Raspberry bavarois?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.520
What is bavarois?

50:56.520 --> 51:00.520
It's a sort of mousse with...

51:00.520 --> 51:04.520
And a Lewis Carroll poem.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.520
Who wear the bavarois, my friend?

51:07.520 --> 51:10.520
You'll gain 20 pounds.

51:10.520 --> 51:13.520
Boy, a baker from Belgium.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.520
We're going to waste this opportunity.

51:15.520 --> 51:16.520
I know it.

51:16.520 --> 51:20.520
What do you think of American cuisine?

51:20.520 --> 51:23.520
I like it.

51:23.520 --> 51:27.520
I like burgers, hot dogs, pizza.

51:27.520 --> 51:31.520
Pizza.

51:31.520 --> 51:39.520
What the podcast listeners don't know is that this guy is actually Werner Herzog.

51:39.520 --> 51:45.520
Werner Herzog is on stage pretending to be a Belgian baker.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.520
So you listen to the podcast in Belgium?

51:47.520 --> 51:48.520
Yeah.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.520
Why?

51:49.520 --> 51:51.520
I mean, what...

51:51.520 --> 51:55.520
It's very flattering that someone from a foreign country would be tuning in.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.520
I like communities.

51:57.520 --> 52:00.520
I start listening to some podcasts with you.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.520
Yeah, community is really important.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.520
Just coming together as a group.

52:05.520 --> 52:07.520
Understanding each other.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.520
We have a great community here.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.520
It doesn't even mean that other thing anymore.

52:13.520 --> 52:18.520
It's like how cheers stop meaning anything.

52:18.520 --> 52:22.520
I'm always astounded.

52:22.520 --> 52:26.520
I always thought, and everybody always thought when we were making the show early on,

52:26.520 --> 52:32.520
well, this is definitely not going to be internationally accessible.

52:32.520 --> 52:34.520
But I don't know.

52:34.520 --> 52:35.520
I guess it is.

52:35.520 --> 52:36.520
I don't have a question for you.

52:36.520 --> 52:42.520
I'm just so curious about a person born and raised in a foreign country like seeing community

52:42.520 --> 52:45.520
and going like, ah, that's great.

52:45.520 --> 52:48.520
I'm so astounded that that's possible.

52:48.520 --> 52:55.520
I heard they love it in China for a much admittedly Chinese person.

52:55.520 --> 53:00.520
There's called communism.

53:00.520 --> 53:02.520
That's what I really chalked it up to.

53:02.520 --> 53:03.520
They said it's very...

53:03.520 --> 53:04.520
People really like it in China.

53:04.520 --> 53:07.520
It's subtitled and it's on this website that's like Chinese Hulu.

53:07.520 --> 53:08.520
That's nice.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.520
I think we talked about this already.

53:09.520 --> 53:13.520
Because I assumed when she said that I was like, oh, I bet it's because it's such a...

53:13.520 --> 53:15.520
Yeah, it's about...

53:15.520 --> 53:16.520
It's a collective.

53:16.520 --> 53:17.520
Yeah.

53:17.520 --> 53:24.520
Levi, what would you want Americans or whomever who's listening to this to know about Belgian people?

53:24.520 --> 53:26.520
And are you a...

53:26.520 --> 53:27.520
This could sound like a making a joke.

53:27.520 --> 53:29.520
Are you a bell?

53:29.520 --> 53:30.520
You're bell...

53:30.520 --> 53:31.520
Like what?

53:31.520 --> 53:32.520
I'm a...

53:32.520 --> 53:33.520
Someone said, oh man.

53:33.520 --> 53:35.520
But you just say Belgian.

53:35.520 --> 53:37.520
You don't say like Turk or...

53:37.520 --> 53:40.520
It's just Belgian in English.

53:40.520 --> 53:43.520
Okay, what are the Flemish?

53:43.520 --> 53:46.520
Tell me about the Flemish.

53:46.520 --> 53:49.520
Something on the Flemish.

53:49.520 --> 53:51.520
We are very...

53:51.520 --> 53:53.520
As a folk.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.520
Not outgoing.

53:55.520 --> 53:57.520
Are you Flemish?

53:57.520 --> 53:58.520
Yeah, Flemish.

53:58.520 --> 53:59.520
What is Flemish?

53:59.520 --> 54:01.520
Is that part of being a Belgian or not?

54:01.520 --> 54:06.520
Yeah, we have three parts of a Belgian technically.

54:06.520 --> 54:09.520
Flauners where we speak Flemish.

54:09.520 --> 54:14.520
We're...

54:14.520 --> 54:18.520
We'll be right back.

54:18.520 --> 54:20.520
And we're back.

54:20.520 --> 54:24.520
The new Infinity Essex series.

54:24.520 --> 54:27.520
Gold-bond powder.

54:27.520 --> 54:29.520
Oh, so in Flanders they speak Flemish.

54:29.520 --> 54:38.520
Yeah, Daniel, the French part but I don't really know what the English term for that is.

54:38.520 --> 54:39.520
Whoa.

54:39.520 --> 54:42.520
Your dad's here.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.520
Can you say that again, sir?

54:44.520 --> 54:47.520
Wankers.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.520
Wankers.

54:49.520 --> 54:54.520
We have a guy from Suffolk back there.

54:54.520 --> 54:57.520
A guy from a Guy Ritchie movie.

54:57.520 --> 54:59.520
You fucking Belgian toilet.

54:59.520 --> 55:01.520
I'll tell you what you call him.

55:01.520 --> 55:04.520
You know you're a fucking cunt.

55:04.520 --> 55:09.520
We're back, make your raspberry hubo cookies.

55:09.520 --> 55:18.520
And wait till the Germans fucking evade you again, you twat.

55:18.520 --> 55:23.520
You fucking twat.

55:23.520 --> 55:28.520
They don't call them wankers.

55:28.520 --> 55:31.520
Where are you from back there, fucking Southampton?

55:31.520 --> 55:32.520
What is it?

55:32.520 --> 55:33.520
London.

55:33.520 --> 55:37.520
You're just a shadow monster from our vantage point.

55:37.520 --> 55:41.520
Don't stab me later.

55:41.520 --> 55:46.520
Wait, do people in London really feel competitive against people in Belgium?

55:46.520 --> 55:48.520
No, I think it was reacting to the French, right?

55:48.520 --> 55:50.520
The French part, what do they call them, right?

55:50.520 --> 55:55.520
Is that just like your innate hatred of the French or a French adjacent?

55:55.520 --> 55:57.520
No, I'm just very jealous.

55:57.520 --> 55:58.520
Oh, yeah?

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
That's nice.

55:59.520 --> 56:03.520
They call them Belgians.

56:03.520 --> 56:07.520
Wait, get up here, get up here weirdo, get up here.

56:07.520 --> 56:09.520
Shadow monster to the stage.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.520
London calling.

56:11.520 --> 56:13.520
London shadow monster, get up here.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.520
I'm playing you at the Scottish Tune if you don't mind.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.520
If you want to, of course.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.520
You're fucking coming up here, mate.

56:20.520 --> 56:23.520
You're fucking coming up.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.520
International Harmontown.

56:25.520 --> 56:27.520
All right.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.520
No, I'm not sure, sit down.

56:28.520 --> 56:30.520
No, what's your name, asshole?

56:30.520 --> 56:32.520
Pietro.

56:32.520 --> 56:36.520
Pietro, why don't you...

56:36.520 --> 56:37.520
Have a seat sir, what's your name?

56:37.520 --> 56:39.520
It's a term of entertainment.

56:39.520 --> 56:40.520
Pietro.

56:40.520 --> 56:42.520
Pietro.

56:42.520 --> 56:43.520
Pietro.

56:43.520 --> 56:44.520
Pietro.

56:44.520 --> 56:45.520
Pietro.

56:45.520 --> 56:46.520
Are you of Italian descent?

56:46.520 --> 56:49.520
My parents are both Italian, but I was born in Canada,

56:49.520 --> 56:52.520
then I lived in the UK for 10, 15 years.

56:52.520 --> 56:53.520
This guy's fucking good looking.

56:53.520 --> 56:54.520
Look at this guy.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.520
You're like a modeled, are you like an international soccer star?

56:57.520 --> 56:59.160
Well, I heard you did some modeling, though.

56:59.160 --> 57:00.000
Huh? As a kid?

57:00.000 --> 57:03.040
Yeah, well, I mean, better than me.

57:03.040 --> 57:04.520
I've done, I've done shit all.

57:04.520 --> 57:06.120
My mother tells me I'm quite ugly.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.960
Like, constantly.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.000
Is it right?

57:09.000 --> 57:09.840
Yeah, no.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.120
She says, yeah.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.400
I look like a buddhura in Italian.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.240
Buddhura?

57:14.240 --> 57:15.080
Yeah.

57:15.080 --> 57:18.560
I'm just like, yeah, just, you know, rough rogue.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.400
Really?

57:19.400 --> 57:20.240
Yeah.

57:20.240 --> 57:21.060
Wow.

57:21.060 --> 57:21.880
Is she here?

57:21.880 --> 57:22.720
No.

57:22.720 --> 57:25.240
No, no, I ran away to America for a bit.

57:25.240 --> 57:28.520
Ah, well, this is cool.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
Yeah.

57:29.520 --> 57:32.240
It's nice to meet you.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.960
Levi's like, can I please sit down now?

57:35.960 --> 57:39.640
Do you have more questions about Belgium?

57:39.640 --> 57:42.040
Why did you scream out wankers?

57:42.040 --> 57:43.440
Which means masturbators.

57:43.440 --> 57:45.800
Why did you scream out?

57:45.800 --> 57:47.520
A wanker is somebody who masturbates

57:47.520 --> 57:49.000
and doesn't know they're doing it, right?

57:49.000 --> 57:52.320
I thought it just meant penis or what?

57:52.320 --> 57:53.320
Or they know they're doing it.

57:53.320 --> 57:55.160
I just mean like a wanker is somebody who's just

57:55.160 --> 57:56.720
an animal that's like dirt stuff all the time.

57:56.720 --> 58:00.040
No, no, in the UK, it's just like dick, I guess, here.

58:00.040 --> 58:01.320
No, I know what it means.

58:01.320 --> 58:02.000
Yeah.

58:02.000 --> 58:02.640
But I just mean.

58:02.640 --> 58:06.040
I mean, I do masturbate, but I do know that one.

58:06.040 --> 58:07.240
How frequently?

58:07.240 --> 58:08.360
Oh, it really depends.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.400
I'm actually traveling with two guys over there,

58:10.400 --> 58:11.320
so it's a bit awkward.

58:11.320 --> 58:14.160
I was like, how frequently do you masturbate?

58:14.160 --> 58:18.040
I tried today.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.320
I need to pull back.

58:19.320 --> 58:20.600
No, I know.

58:20.600 --> 58:23.560
Like, you know, if I'm doing coursework, then yeah, a lot.

58:23.560 --> 58:26.880
I do a lot of programming when I graduated, so.

58:26.880 --> 58:29.120
So wait, does that mean a lot of masturbation?

58:29.120 --> 58:29.720
Are you kidding?

58:29.720 --> 58:32.320
If you're programming for 15 hours straight, you know.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.160
No, I understand.

58:33.160 --> 58:33.640
I'm sorry.

58:33.640 --> 58:34.840
You watch a few episodes of Community,

58:34.840 --> 58:36.440
you see Alison Brie, and you think, well.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.920
Oh, OK.

58:38.920 --> 58:40.720
Let's bring out our next guest, Alison Brie.

58:40.720 --> 58:46.320
Everybody get your dicks out, Alison Brie.

58:50.240 --> 58:53.000
Levi, who's your favorite community character?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.720
Is that a dumb question?

58:55.720 --> 58:56.440
Abbot.

58:56.440 --> 58:58.320
Abbot, yeah.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.800
It's sort of relatable.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.960
Yeah, relatable.

59:01.960 --> 59:05.440
You think you might be on the spectrum a little bit?

59:05.440 --> 59:11.640
I mean, that's why, I mean, you're not half Arabic.

59:11.640 --> 59:14.880
Who's actually played by a half Indian.

59:14.880 --> 59:16.840
But yeah, you think maybe you're a little.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.600
Yeah, a bit, I think.

59:18.600 --> 59:19.880
Yeah.

59:19.880 --> 59:22.800
Like on the playground, did anybody ever come up

59:22.800 --> 59:25.920
to you and go, what are you doing?

59:25.920 --> 59:29.920
And then you look down and like your pants are down.

59:29.920 --> 59:31.920
Or you just have like a booger on your shirt,

59:31.920 --> 59:34.040
or like, or you just, I don't know,

59:34.040 --> 59:35.080
you're just doing something wrong,

59:35.080 --> 59:37.520
and you didn't know it was wrong until like everyone

59:37.520 --> 59:41.320
in a circle around you going, what are you doing?

59:41.320 --> 59:45.440
You have a lot of memories like that.

59:45.440 --> 59:47.760
Hypothetically, this is.

59:47.760 --> 59:48.600
Don't stop, Dan.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.840
Just go through.

59:51.840 --> 59:56.600
They're going to Sarah walk up and.

59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.320
So yeah, you put that into your pastry, like.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.000
It's your, it's your.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.240
That's all the croissants, it's layers of pain.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.240
Is cooking a way of, do you put emotions into your cooking?

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.680
Is there, are you connecting with people when you're cooking?

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.800
Do you think of it as a, or is it like a trade?

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.680
Did your dad hand it down to you?

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.160
No, I actually started doing it because I didn't sleep well,

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.600
so I decided to come and bake it.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.680
So you started in your own kitchen and then you.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.560
Not really, I started going to school for it.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.960
So you couldn't, you couldn't sleep so you got up

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.760
and you enrolled in a school.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.120
You probably baked a couple of things at home first.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.400
You probably have to bring those in when you apply, right?

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.160
There's a muffin I made, it's a crepe,

01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:00.400
got kind of cold on the way over.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.520
When you go to a school, when you're 12,

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.560
and then you have a trimester, you can try for baker,

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.600
for, with meat, I don't know, but sure, yeah.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.040
And for a chef.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.600
So in your school system, it's more trade-oriented, right?

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.880
Like it's not so much like funneling people into.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.880
You have three courses.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.560
Flanders.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.680
Wankers.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.000
And wankers.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.640
Indian chief.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.440
Candlestick makers.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:46.080
You have the more traditional languages and stuff

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.960
like that, and then the more practical, like jobs,

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.400
like bakers, clothes makers, and stuff like that,

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.640
and art school.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.880
How's the unemployment there?

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.480
Is everybody going to have a job?

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.480
Most people, yeah.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.720
Not many homeless people.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.880
That's nice.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.480
Pietro.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.840
Pietro, you were talking about programming,

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.440
so you're a computer?

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.120
No, I did mechanical engineering.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.960
I just graduated in July.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960
Congratulations.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.240
Did you live here in LA, Pietro?

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240
No.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.760
Actually, I'm technically homeless.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.520
We got kicked out of a hostel because we

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.480
booked the wrong nights.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.680
So we were actually going to sleep on our own.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.760
You're visiting from London?

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.840
Yeah, we drove.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.200
So we basically went to San Francisco first,

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.720
and then we went to sleep.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.880
Like him, yeah.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.200
I'm amazed we didn't meet.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.480
When did you think of the hills?

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:41.880
The hills.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.200
I went to, I started in Bristol, so I was used to hills.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.040
It's very heavy.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.760
Fuckin' Bristol.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.360
Jesus Christ.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.280
Fuckin' Bristol.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.080
You know what they say about Bristol?

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.720
Full of cuts.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.040
If you don't like walkin' on a level surface,

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040
wait five minutes.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.600
It'll change.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.440
It's the hilliest fucking burrow of the whole Queen's realm.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.040
Isn't Bristol cockney ramming flame for titties?

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.600
Bristol's city titties, right?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:18.920
It is.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:22.240
It's cockney ramming flame for boobs.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.760
I'm going to teach you something about London, my friends.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.560
You see it, you're like, oh, look, I know it's Bristol's.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.480
You never heard that before?

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.280
No, I haven't.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:30.920
Are you starting again?

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.640
I think we're more reserved, though, than in the US.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.960
No, I learned this from a friend who's from London.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.440
Really?

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.200
Yeah, it's cockney ramming flame.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:38.600
I didn't.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.080
I know.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.120
I'm a privately educated guy.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.680
Oh, well, Lonnie.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.720
World's fanciest homeless guy.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.280
In your private education, did they teach you

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.320
to scream wanker from the back?

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.560
Was that a day where you came to class with your little

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.200
messenger bag?

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.160
I'm sorry.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.880
My monocle has a chip on it, so.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.960
No, I got it.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.400
That sounds like bullying.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.840
He wasn't bragging.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.640
He was saying, no, I've never heard that phrase.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.520
He was saying he was private.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.440
He's a fancy person.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.560
He was explaining why.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.200
He wasn't like, he wasn't.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.040
He yelled wanker from the back of the room.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.120
He's a hooligan.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.080
He's a London hooligan.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.800
You guys said, aren't titties called Bristol's?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.640
And he said, I don't think so.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.920
And you're like, I think they're called titties, Bristol's.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.440
And he's like, I'd never heard that.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.680
And he's like, but in London.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.240
And he's like, well, I'm fucking posh.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.360
But he's homeless.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.760
But you have enough money to fly abroad and cruise about.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.480
And you've graduated from a nice degree, probably.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.240
Yeah, no.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.160
What university did you go to?

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160
Oxford.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:51.680
I wish.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.440
No, my friend did.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.200
I went to Bristol.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.040
I went to my internship.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.720
There's another one.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.880
Did you get double first to work at the college?

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.120
No, no, I didn't.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.920
I parted way too much.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.480
What did you read?

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.960
Well, I'm a mechanical engineering.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.440
Really?

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.960
I did my main research which was in ultrasonic fluid

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.200
levitation.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.800
So I levitated in.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.880
Fluid levitation?

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.760
That sounds like code for a wanking.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.240
In a swimming pool.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.640
Jericho's in a swimming pool.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.120
Who levitated some fluid in the hot tub?

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:25.800
That's just fancy.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.560
I'm studying.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.120
I'm studying.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.680
I'm studying.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.120
Don't tell me what tits are called.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.920
What is fluid levitation?

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.520
You just use levitate particles of fluid.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520
You just keep going.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.040
In the air.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.200
So you create, set up a three-dimensional static.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.440
So magnetics are for what?

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.480
Magnetic fields or what?

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:45.960
No, no, no.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.640
This is done entirely using air and vibrations.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.240
You just vibrate air.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.680
Spencer, do you know about this?

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.040
Well, it sounds like, I mean, if you apply,

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.680
is it like a certain frequency?

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.560
It's like a wether state.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.320
Yeah, so you set up a, you call them like acoustic horns

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.600
or an ungevian horn.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.000
You put some piezoelectric elements behind it.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.760
You apply an AC current to add it.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.600
And then those vibrate because obviously piezoelectric

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.320
governments change size of kind.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.080
He knows, he knows.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.760
And then that sets up a standing wave,

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.440
which then you have nodes where you can put droplets in.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.960
Well, speaking of which, do you like n-dubs?

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.320
Oh, I've heard of him.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.640
No, no, not really.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.040
I'm more of a dead mouse fan.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.000
Yeah, dead mouse fan.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.840
How do you feel about the chabs?

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.040
The chabs.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.120
What the hell are the chabs?

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120
What's going on?

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.120
The chabs.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.720
There's a feedback loop happening right now.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.720
I don't have an accent.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.160
I'm about to levitate some fluids over here.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.120
When Spencer said n-dubs, I genuinely

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:46.640
thought he was doing slang for the N-W-O-A-C-P.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.720
I mean, they've really been slipping.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.800
Yeah.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.120
I saw a picture on the internet.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.480
I'm sure this is not related at all.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.560
I thought it was somewhere in Denmark or something

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.200
where some scientist had created a cloud in the middle

01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.920
of a room.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.360
It looked like a regular cloud.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.920
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.560
So was that you?

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.520
I was just wondering if that had to do with fluid limitation.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.040
Yeah, it was my spare time.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:14.800
That's interesting.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.160
I mean, what do you now that you have this very specific

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.280
knowledge, what kind of job are you looking to?

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.680
I actually already got a job with Toshiba in the UK.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.320
So I'll be doing research into futuristic city design, which

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.640
sounds a bit weird.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.760
Why is Toshiba going to be designing cities?

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:39.680
Toshiba has the wherewithal to design a city.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.680
What do you know?

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.280
Yeah.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.680
Old Detroit has a cancer.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.760
Cancer is called crime.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.280
Toshiba City will be enforced by a new kind of law

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.440
enforcement.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.560
Ladies and gentlemen, the fluid levitator 209.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.920
Put your gloves down, wankers.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.000
You have 10 seconds before I come on you.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Dumb.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.480
That's dumb.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.920
That's stupid.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.440
Well, like, five.

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.520
I think that we have a really good lineup for D&D tonight.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.320
I feel like this is like.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.440
I don't know, but well, don't spring that out, Spencer.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.080
How many characters do you have?

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.480
Camille's not here.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.360
Yeah, so I guess one, right?

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.680
Camille.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.840
So you say we have to choose between.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.000
I'm not saying that.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.960
I guess Jeff's saying that.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.120
Right, that's a thing.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.440
Leave I have a question, because you brought up the Danish.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.280
Why is a Danish called the Danish?

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.320
Do you call it that?

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.880
What do you call a Danish?

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.720
They call it the here.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.000
A Belgian.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.880
The homeland.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.800
We call it Puerto Kuchen, which basically is

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.720
a bit better, Puerto Kuchen.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.440
Buter Kuchen.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.480
Buter Kuchen.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.120
Like a butter Kuchen.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.080
Butter Kuchen.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.240
Kuchen with butter.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.680
Right, it's a bit better because of all the layers of butter.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.600
Yeah, but a croissant is also layers of butter, right?

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.520
A lot of pastries have layers of sort of butter Kuchen.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.040
That's all from the same dough.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.120
Yeah, what kind of alternating current would you

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.600
need to apply to layers of butter to make it?

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.720
There's got to be a reason why this is happening.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.440
Can we make the world's best croissant here tonight?

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.920
And it's like floating in the air.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.600
It's just like croissant vapor that you walk into.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.400
And you get a little bit of an electric shock,

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.000
but you're like, whoa, butter Kuchen.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.360
First, Pietro would have to overcome

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.360
his abiding hatred of the Belgians.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.640
I thought it was directed at the French, no?

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.040
I thought that was the joke.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.440
I think we just have to go.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.040
Yeah, sorry.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:48.680
Yeah, thank you.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.640
We never have any French people come to Harmontown.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.400
It's good.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.920
They're afraid to speak up.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.200
What other countries are here?

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.000
Moi?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Oi!

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Well, we know where he's from.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
For us, we.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.640
You can't.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.160
I thought I heard people wooing for Canada.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.480
Are you guys visiting from Canada?

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.560
We live here now.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.040
OK.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.200
Oh, you guys are.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:14.880
Sorry.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.720
You guys are so nice.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.560
It's a melting pot.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.440
You can't get out.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.600
You don't get to retain any.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.120
Levi, are you planning on going back home and spending

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.840
your life in Belgium?

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.640
Or would you rather, would you like to live here, maybe?

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.360
Jeff's looking for a roommate.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.240
No, I'm going back home.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.240
Sorry, Jeff.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.320
What if he moved in with Jeff?

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.840
Or Jeff said that he moved in with him,

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.760
but he was a prisoner because of his life.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.760
And Jeff just wanted his cooking.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.160
And we'd just come over and Levi'd be like, hi, everybody.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.200
And I had this like, like, scared look on his face.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.880
And Jeff was like, no, he likes it here.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.760
Can't you imagine a world where Jeff's like, yeah,

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.600
Levi's moving in.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.720
And you know, in Belgium, they do that.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.040
Like, Jeff starts wearing different ties

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.640
and is teaching us how to do, like, Belgian cooking.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.880
And he just can't stop talking about Belgium.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.520
And also, you go to Belgium, and then they

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.760
thank you for your innovations on there.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.520
It's a nice world.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.240
It's a compliment.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:14.720
It's fine.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.400
Pietro, you're going to go back to London?

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.840
You want to live in England most of your life?

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.920
Yeah, I think so.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.320
Sorry.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:28.200
Well, when Toshiba makes Toshiba City,

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.600
where is that city going to be?

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.600
What is it called currently?

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.880
Yeah, it's a twin sea, really.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.400
So yeah.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.560
Is it an idea?

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.680
Or is it a will?

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.920
They're really into, I mean, I guess this is California,

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.240
isn't it?

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.960
So they're really into, like, energy, smart energy systems.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.960
So let's say it's really sunny in Los Angeles,

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.080
but it's pouring with rain in San Francisco.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.400
And the soil of Hanzabra, could you divert energy efficiently

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.200
to San Francisco?

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.000
Yeah, I think about that.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.720
Toshiba's going to build a city that's going to steal weather?

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.720
That's what I heard.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.200
It's raining in San Francisco.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.120
It should be over here.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.360
The sun's out.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.440
Our rain was stolen by a Japanese skyscraper.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440
Toshiba.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.280
Toshiba's like the villain from Rainbow Brights.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.760
It's like Mr. Burns on The Simpsons.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.680
Get it.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.800
Pietro, are you hard at work?

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.480
And the rain thief?

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.480
2,000?

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.840
I was trying to do it, Mr. Burns.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.280
It didn't work out.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.520
It sounded like you've heard of Herzog.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.080
I thought to myself, as I watched the recent harm

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:47.920
in town that things were decrepit, almost painful.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.400
I don't know.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.120
So what do we do?

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.360
We got an extra person up here to leave.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.440
I play a unicorn.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.440
No, I should just go.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.720
I feel like I really interrupted.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.080
Something rather beautiful here.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.200
But the crowd's falling in love with you, Pietro.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.280
Yeah, you're just doing that.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.040
The hearts and minds.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.600
He's just doing that Downton Abbey,

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.160
like upper class, like humility thing.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.200
I've been given so much.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.960
Pietro, Lady Mary would love you to stay.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.560
I know you need it, Mary, when I do.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.360
I was a privately schooled.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.760
I don't want to overstay my welcome.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.600
This is your show.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.600
No, you haven't.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.600
No, you're both great.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.440
You're both lovely.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.880
It's an international Harmontown.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.440
We're going to find something for Levi to do

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.480
in the middle of the game.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.600
It's going to be an amazing non-player character

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.880
that Spencer comes up with.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.560
Maybe he could be your kind of laconic, like Avengers

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.560
and kind of a like a.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.480
Oh, he could be a Avenger.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.400
Yeah, OK.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.000
I like that.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.520
Nailed it.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.520
All right.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.760
Are you familiar with Avengers?

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.240
Yeah.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.560
All right, well, really, all right.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.280
Well, he gets out the character sheets.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.520
So you're watching community, which surprises me.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.560
When people in non-English speaking countries

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.520
are watching community and going, like, I get it.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.400
That's the funny joke about Pokemon.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.360
But the, because that's American.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.560
And so's Toshiba.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.600
But then you're listening to Harmontown.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.200
I mean, what, I guess I'm putting you on the spot.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.880
I'm like some dumb person at a party going, like,

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.000
why do you like me?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.080
I'm just wondering, like, when you're listening to,

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.080
are you, oh, I know it's because you're baking.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.440
So you're like, you know, you want to listen to just,

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.680
like, white noise.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.320
No, it just, it interests me.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:43.640
Like, I also listened to the Nerdist writer's panel.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.280
Like, all that stuff behind TV, and I like that.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.760
You like pop culture and stuff.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.720
Yeah, stuff like that.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.880
What do you think about that acre?

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.560
That acre, Ben Acre.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.440
Do you like better acre or blacker?

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.760
This guy doesn't even listen to the podcast.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.920
Blacker, I guess.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.920
OK.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.000
Blacker, because he's blacker.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.200
Blacker's better.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.080
Thank you guys for being here.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.600
All right, can we just, can we hand out the character sheets?

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.560
Like, you can do whatever you want, man.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.520
Pass them down.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.760
So I guess, Pietro, you're going to play Chris de Burgh.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.240
Are you familiar with this?

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.840
I heard one or two podcasts.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.840
So you're a thief, you're a rogue.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.040
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.520
You're a dashing British Italian fluid

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.520
levitating rogue.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.200
That depends on Pietro, I think.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.560
And what, wait, this must be Jeff's.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.640
Get that all the way down to Jeff.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.240
And then Levi, you're just playing my hawk of hunger.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.240
He doesn't have a sheet.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.920
Spencer, you good to go?

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.080
Wait.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.320
Oh, this is Aaron.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.640
There we go.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.440
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:14.080
Last time on Harmontown, our gang was under attack.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.040
After escaping a black dragon and narrowly

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.120
dodging a crashing airship, our heroes headed out

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.440
of the purple canyons and found themselves on the road

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.880
to Rosebook with a robot baby named Lodgy.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.600
Rosebook was a quaint little town at the outskirts

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.640
of the purple mountains, less than a mile away.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.280
But as the gang drew closer, they saw a horse-drawn carriage

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.960
under attack by orcish marauders.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.920
The gang leapt into action, all except Sharpie,

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.440
who was so busy masturbating that he didn't even

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.960
realize the deadly melee taking place all around him.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.440
Sorry.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.560
Our heroes struck, felling a third of the orcs

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.640
in a single moment as Sharpie waded into the fray,

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.320
yelling and confused.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.680
Mulraine, perhaps possessed by the spirit of Duncan Trussell,

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.040
took her own life, stabbing herself in the eyes

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.200
and turning her brain matter into mush,

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.000
killing her instantly.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.640
Cut the music.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.360
Cut it off.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.080
Kill it.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.440
Kill the music.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.600
Like Mulraine.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.000
All right.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.640
So yeah, that's what just happened.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.680
You hear the beginning of a scream quickly cut short.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.440
You turn to see Mulraine fall to the dirt, blood and brain

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.560
spilling from her eye socket.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.800
A nearby orc sees this happen and attempts

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.560
to make it look like he did it.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.920
He points it at his head with both thumbs

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.200
and goes, this orc.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.480
No.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.200
I react.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.240
Is that the whole reaction?

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.120
Mulraine.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.080
Is that his cum face?

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.000
I thought you said it was a plot twist.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.840
Zero was masturbating.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.280
All I dance faces are his cum face.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.760
Think, think.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.760
I'm just usually listening to the podcast when I'm coming.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.240
Is that orcish?

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.640
Are we still battling those orcs?

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.320
Oh yeah, you're in the middle of a fight.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.240
This happened in the middle of a combat.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.760
So Mulraine is laying dead with a smushed brain.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.960
And a sword in her face.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.240
And a sword in her face.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.360
Yep.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.280
It's tragic.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.440
I take her sword out to avenge her suicide.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:39.400
I charge at the orc in a barbarian rage.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.280
You charge at the orc?

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.840
Oh, you miss him, though.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.640
You charge at the orc, but maybe it's

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.920
the sword that you've never used before.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.680
It just is too heavy or something.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.280
I run back and put it back in her face.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:59.600
Avenger, attack the nearest orc with your bird claws.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.600
After giving your mighty Belgian scream.

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.760
That's just how they sound over there.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.840
Yeah, no, it's like different countries

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.880
have different words for, you know, like cockadoodle-doo.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.400
Yeah, in Spanish, chickens go, kikari, gukudu, gukudu-doo.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:30.880
Avenger, the hawk with his battle cry,

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.440
scratches at the orc that Jeff or Quark

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.200
missed with his blade, and clawing his eyes

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.720
and dealing four damage.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.160
The orc is running around screaming.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.040
I'm going to do shocking grasp on him

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.080
if I can get to him.

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.160
On the same orc?

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:47.660
Yep.

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.560
All right.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.320
You try to do that.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.840
You miss also.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.120
You lunge towards him with a shocking grasp,

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.280
but he nimbly dodges out of the way.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.960
Voila being the hawked.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.120
Yeah.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:03.880
Which turn is it?

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.680
Well, it's that orc's turn.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.320
He's trying to.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.680
He tries to dislodge the hawk from his face,

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.680
but instead he just falls, and he impales himself

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:19.160
on Moran's face sword.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.400
I guess it's not an impalement.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.680
It's more of just a slice.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.560
But you know, he's dead.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.480
He's dead.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.920
He tried to get the hawk off, and he killed himself.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.360
Half the orcs are dead.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.920
Nobody touched that sword.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.960
The other orc, one of the other orcs

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.520
runs away just because he realizes he's outnumbered.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.120
And then is that two left?

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.120
That's two left, I think.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:42.960
Yeah, two left.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.200
Two orcs left.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.480
The other one just, he looks at the damage,

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.040
and he's kind of freaked out.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.760
Is it Chris de Burghstern, then, maybe?

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.760
It would be, yeah, Chris de Burghstern.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.320
Yeah, so can I throw my poison dagger at the last orc?

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.160
There's one more?

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.520
I think I said two more, right?

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.440
Two more.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.360
But yeah, you do that, and you strike him right in the neck,

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:13.920
dealing four damage to his neck.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.200
That's like a hawk knife.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:15.920
Every little health.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.720
Standard hawk damage, he bleeds quite heavily

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.880
and clutches at his throat, putting in a quark's turn.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.360
I take my mighty greatsword out, and I aim right at his knee

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.960
caps and try to cleave his knees just like this way.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.160
I don't want him to die fast.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.640
I want him to bleed out.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.080
You cleave at his knees, and you slice them open.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.440
Wait, what's your damage again?

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.320
I can't remember.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:47.320
I'm the mighty greatsword, his is 2DA plus 7.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.600
He explodes for the knees.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.520
Jesus Christ.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.760
His discs rupture.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.520
Jesus.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.400
Plus a million against orcs.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.840
The last orc, the leader orc.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.960
He's wearing a helmet and holding a gold axe.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.680
He grumbles.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.360
He's like, I'm not going to die today, you bastards.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.720
He pulls out a necklace.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.640
Oh, I have it written down.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.800
He pulls out a necklace from a pouch.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.600
It's covered in three dangling glass bobbles, each of which

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.960
contains a blazing, fiery nexus of light.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.320
He takes three or four measured steps back

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.200
and then hurls the necklace directly

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.760
into the middle of all of you guys.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.960
Oh, thank you.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.840
It strikes like a bullet directly

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.560
towards the horse-drawn carriage.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.320
And for a split second, all you can hear

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.920
is the delicate shattering of glass.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.480
But then a massive explosion rips forth decimating the carriage

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.280
and creating a large mushroom cloud in its wake.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.080
You can see that gnome that was earlier atop the carriage

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.520
blasting off like a rocket.

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.880
He goes at least 20 feet upwards before plummeting back

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.560
into the earth, landing on packed ground

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.880
with a sickening snap.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.040
He's still.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.800
But the massive shockwave rips forth in all directions,

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.560
consuming all sorts of things in its blazing trail.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.640
Make a reflex saves.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.480
What are your reflex saves?

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.480
My reflex save is five.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.080
I'm sad.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.000
So infinite.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.720
My dexterity is 14.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.160
All right, well, I rolled really high.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.040
So everybody saves.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.640
I got five, so I got five, yeah.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.440
All right, you all save.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:36.720
Everybody but Jeff takes 13 damage.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.400
So his blazing fire consumes your bodies

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.720
and lights things on fire.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720
Not your whole bodies, though.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.800
Just 13 damage worth of your bodies.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.400
But I rolled high.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.920
I'm good?

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:51.440
Yeah, you're good because you got the dodgy.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.000
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.200
Yeah, the whole carriage is consumed in a fiery blaze.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.200
And then the orc, he clicks his heels together

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.960
and little feathers pop out of his boots.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.320
And he flies away.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.600
That hell kind of orc?

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:07.520
This isn't the last you've seen of Vathros the Mighty.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.800
Aphros?

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.280
Vathros.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.720
He disappears, leaving nothing but burning carnage.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.720
Is that necklace still there?

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.800
Or is that what that consumed?

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.320
Bloated.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.840
Vathros the Mighty.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.720
I think we're going to see that guy again.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.400
I hope we do.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.640
I got to score to something.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:30.040
And make a note that's how much three glass bulbs

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.160
do on a necklace.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160
You know, if anyone ever throws down one of those things

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.920
and it's got one on it, it'll be like, all right.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.920
No biggie.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.080
It's like an M80.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.520
I go up to the gnome that snapped on the packed earth

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.360
and I examine his body.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.960
He's pretty still, but his eyelids flicker open.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.080
And he's like, oh, help me.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.800
I can't move.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.560
Sharpie, heal this man.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.320
I'm a wizard.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.440
You have no heal spells?

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:04.920
No.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.760
No, that's not really a direction I went.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.160
It shows the specialized in shrinking people.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.600
Mulraine, do you have a heal spell on you?

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.440
Dead.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.440
Dead.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.960
OK, I loot Mulraine.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.960
Oh, I guess she got blown up.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.480
Yeah, yeah, all the possessions anywhere in the fireball

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.360
explosion are completely worthless.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.280
So she's gone?

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.640
She's just vaporized?

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.880
Yes.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.560
Really?

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.880
She was in the fireball.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.360
Yeah, I think that's how it works.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.320
Well, OK.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.360
Don't you have some good berries or something for the?

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:45.880
I don't.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.920
That's a different game.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.880
Oh, OK.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.720
Sorry.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.200
Well, OK, I guess the dust is kind of settling right now.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.640
I guess we could take stock of the fact

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.400
that Mulraine, who we've grown to know and love,

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.960
is just she's been completely vaporized.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.880
I go to the dying guy and I go, why were they attacking you?

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.280
I'm a brewer.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.680
They were trying to steal from my distillery.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.240
It blew up.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.840
What, do you make potions or beer?

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.560
I make spirits.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.800
Like beer spirits or?

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.560
A guy that can blow things up and fly with his boots

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.440
wanted to steal beer?

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.880
If I had to guess, I don't think he knew my wares.

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.680
He probably thought you had like potions or something.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.480
Maybe.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.280
I do my experiments out here to stay safe.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.320
Beer experiments?

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.360
Yeah.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.400
It's pretty volatile.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.320
It's a moving still.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.160
But now it's blown up.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:53.960
It's gone, right?

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.120
It sure was.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.000
Are you OK?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:56.920
How do you feel right now?

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.440
I can't move at all.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.960
I attempt to just, I massage him and try to heal him.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:11.000
You massage him, making sure to stimulate his fascial layers.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.560
He doesn't seem to react because his neck looks broken.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:18.440
I do have a brew potion feet.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.160
I don't know if I can look around.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.000
I also have knowledge of, no I don't.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.120
Well, everything's all blown up.

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:27.680
It's all.

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:30.880
I thought maybe I could see like a piece of milk thistle.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.480
It was a crazy magic fireball.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.200
Yeah.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:35.600
All right.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.680
Well, I think what's happened, sir,

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.800
is that your back and or neck may be broken.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.760
You're going to have to hold still for a while

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.560
and you don't have a choice.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320
How far away from the nearest city?

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.880
We're very close to my town Rosebook.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:54.920
I should take me there.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:57.080
I pick him up and throw him over my shoulder.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.640
You're not supposed to move.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.560
I heard somewhere you're not supposed to.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.640
That guy was cast.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.600
What about my mage hand spell?

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.200
Can I use that to lift a dude?

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.160
No, he weighs more than five pounds.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.480
And levitate?

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.760
Oh, you could levitate him, yeah.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.080
Like all the way to town?

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:17.960
Sure.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.400
I'm going to levitate you.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.360
I put him back down.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:29.960
It's going to hurt a little, but not as much as that did.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.080
I can't do anything.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.520
Right.

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.400
We'll levitate you.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.440
You lead the way to Rosebook.

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.360
You can see it from here.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.600
OK.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.600
Hocus pocus, body float us.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.560
And as the body lifts into the air,

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.120
you begin to hear the loud rumbling of thunder

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.160
as the sky darkens above you.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:54.920
Cracow, cracow, lightning, cracow, more lightning.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.640
From the east, you can see a blazing white light

01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.240
flying through the sky.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.080
It's quite far away, but you can see even from here

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.480
that it's aloft on great wings of flame,

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.600
wings that shed flame onto the ground with each beat,

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.640
lighting fires and blazes all across the earth below.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.720
Wait, wait, I can calm winds, it says here.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.920
It doesn't look like it's winds.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.400
Not even so down a little bit, no?

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.280
It's too far off, anyway.

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.120
It looks like it's maybe about six miles off.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.920
It'll be some time before it gets here,

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.040
but it's definitely apocalyptic looking.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.400
Like a storm's up, Rowan.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.800
We've got to get out of here.

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.640
OK, let's run.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.040
Everybody run to Rosebook.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.000
I trot while levitating.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.360
Hocus pocus, body float us.

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.800
Hocus pocus, body float us.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.120
You arrive at Rosebook.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.600
You could see a ring of white monolithic pillars,

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.920
each draped in bright red roses.

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.640
It kind of forms a fence around the city,

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.520
giving a very secured and beautiful appearance.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.000
You can see the front gate of the city

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.600
as several farmers with various livestock

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:05.640
are kind of ushered in by a few city guards,

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.000
the lead of which is a female paladin in bright shining armor,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.960
kind of giving directions to the city guardsmen

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.160
ushering people inside for safety.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:21.480
This way, move on by, looking good.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.480
All right.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.760
Mm-hmm.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.280
You guys are close now.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.200
You're right up there at the front gate.

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.080
Aaron, did you write a new character for us?

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.800
Mm-hmm.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.640
You, female paladin, what is your name?

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.560
Yes, hello, hi.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:44.160
And maybe give us a lengthy back story.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.080
I pull up a rock and sit down for what

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.320
I intend to be a long period of a back story character.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.760
I send Avenger, my Belgian hawk, to Avenger,

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.200
give your battle cry and go check out that storm.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.040
So you don't risk anything, but see if you can get a vantage

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.640
point and report back.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:11.600
Woo-hoo!

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.080
Avenger takes flight, so it's going to be some time

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.400
before he's returned, like at least five or 10 minutes.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:22.600
Well, yeah, so who is this tough guy here?

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.720
Hey, everybody.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.560
My name is Dignity Sarsgard.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.400
I fight for truth.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.520
I look for heroes.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:35.080
I support heroes.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.680
I myself am a hero.

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.080
That's a brave stance.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.680
You know what, my friends?

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:43.480
Sometimes it is.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.800
Sometimes it is brave, and I like to think of myself

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.320
as constantly brave.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.640
Well, we just want to get in, so we'll just

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.200
nice to meet you where it's going to go past.

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.560
I saw you pull up a rock.

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.760
I'm from the town of Citrus.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.320
You may have heard of a town covered in oranges.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:08.800
Everyone wore orange, it was an orange-focused town.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:13.800
But then one day, a rain thief, or a sun thief,

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.680
had I wish it was a rain thief, came by and just...

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.040
I pull up another rock.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.840
You know what, enough about me.

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.160
You guys, uh...

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:26.240
No, we're just passing through.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.560
We're just going to get through the gate,

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.960
and thanks to that, how do you do it?

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.760
Nice to meet you.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:37.760
Yeah, but, uh, hey, when you get off...

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:42.480
I just got off.

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.320
Me, too.

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.880
So, um, so, stupid.

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.400
I didn't realize that you were on the job.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:54.120
I take a 10-hour shift every day of looking for truth

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:57.440
and honor in everything that I see and feel.

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.840
It's my own job that I put upon myself,

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.200
but I would, uh, I was looking for a gang to travel with.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.880
Yeah, I know, we're good, we're still...

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:06.800
I will join you!

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.680
We're still grieving over a lost friend.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:09.760
I will join you.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.840
Too soon.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:11.400
You need...

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.520
Too much has happened, uh, Sarsgar.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.640
You need protect...

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:14.360
Sarsgar, too much has happened.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:14.920
I will...

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:15.680
Let's go!

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:18.600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:19.760
Sarsgar, we keep...

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.920
Like I always say, let's jazz for light.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.480
What?

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.160
I just, what?

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.200
What?

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.200
Jazz for light?

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:34.200
Guys, I pull a meeting with Sharpie and Chris de Burgh.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.200
What?

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.200
I pull a sidebar.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.200
Jazz for light?

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:41.200
Yeah, I pull Sharpie and Chris de Burgh aside of her.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.520
Guys, I got a really bad vibe off of Jigna.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.800
Off in the corner.

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.400
Zippin' out B, now, bye!

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.880
Well, she's, yeah, she's clearly...

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.160
No one paid her to be out the hero, and she's...

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.280
Look, we have enough on our plate.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:59.800
We have enough on our plate right now.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.480
Jazz for light?

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.200
She just strikes me as a kind of person that would probably hang out with us for a while,

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:12.080
get bored of who she is, and kill herself, and change her character.

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.800
It just seems like another one of these weird identity crisis ladies would keep meeting.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.800
All right, yeah, well, I...

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800
Hey, everybody.

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:18.800
Thank you, Andy.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.800
I thought, I thought maybe...

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.800
I'm sorry, I know you guys are talking about...

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:22.800
Hi!

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.800
Hi!

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.320
Uh, I just wanted to explain what jazzing for light means.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.160
No, no, no, we got it.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.160
We got it.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.160
No, no, I just want...

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:35.520
I want you guys to take a note of jazz, like, like, improvisation, improvisation, improvisational

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.520
jazz.

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.520
We're love-actating a man who's dying.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.840
It just means, like, you do whatever you want.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.840
We have to get this guy in jail.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.840
Right.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:41.840
Okay, okay, I'll join you.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.840
Okay!

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.840
Jesus.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.840
Okay.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.840
We're gonna ask you.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840
Let's zoom for truth.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.840
She's just...

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840
She's just...

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:49.840
I'm changing her...

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:50.840
She's...

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:51.840
She's...

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:52.840
I pull another sidebar.

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:53.840
She just keeps making up catchphrases.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.840
I gotta...

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.840
I gotta...

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840
I gotta...

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:57.840
Trying way too hard.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.840
I only have, like...

01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.840
Trying way too hard.

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.840
I have...

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.840
My man...

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.840
My manna is at, like, uh, 13 percent, uh, I gotta levitate.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840
This guy's gonna fall.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:08.840
Yeah, I mean, we can...

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.840
Hey, Dignity, uh, we'll catch you on the flip-flop, we gotta get this guy inside.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.840
It was nice to meet you, really.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:13.840
Nice to meet you.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:14.840
Uh...

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:15.840
I think our adventure days are over.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:16.840
Yeah, we're...

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.840
We're kind of retiring.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.560
I will absolutely join you.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:27.560
One of my attributes is that I hear what God wants to hear.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.560
I pull a third sidebar.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.560
I go...

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.560
I go to the side and I realize he's not talking to me and I walk away.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.560
Okay.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560
I pull a third sidebar.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.560
I...

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.560
Sharpie, I'm gonna stab Dignity.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:38.560
Sorry.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.560
Now, come on.

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.560
We don't even have to...

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:42.560
Is there another guard there?

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.560
Can I ask?

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:44.560
I know a direction.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.560
This man is wounded.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.560
He needs...

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:47.560
He needs medical attention.

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.560
Oh.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.560
What?

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560
Who do you talk to?

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560
I can heal.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560
Jesus Christ.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.560
You can heal?

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.560
Dignity?

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.560
We've had a long day.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.560
This man's back is broken, I think.

01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.560
Well...

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.560
And you guys all burnt up.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.560
Let me approach him.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.560
Sorry.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.560
And I got all burnt up.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.560
I...

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.560
I approach the broken back levitated man.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.560
You do that.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.560
I use...

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.560
Heal.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.560
I never thought I'd miss Mulraine Sedona.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.560
And I...

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.560
Yes, I use that.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.560
Wow.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.560
My hero.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.560
Well, heal skill is like just...

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.560
Okay, okay.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:36.560
Well, under special...

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.560
Do you have a spell or a...

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560
I do.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.560
Under special abilities, I have a 3D6 damage heal.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.560
What is it?

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.560
What's it called?

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.560
Heals.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.560
Is it called?

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.560
Yeah.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.560
Sure.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:55.560
You touch the man and heal him for 14 points of damage.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560
His various vertebrae crack back into place.

01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.560
He still can't quite move, but he's...

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.560
He can wiggle his toes a bit.

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.560
It's taken a lot of convincing, but I will join you on your quest.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.560
We're not on a quest.

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:08.560
We're kind of...

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.560
We're finishing a quest.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.560
Well, I just wish I knew what was going on with Avenger right now.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.560
Yeah, Avenger comes back.

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.560
Oh, he's back.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.560
He's five to 10 minutes.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.560
And when he does, you realize...

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:30.560
I realize that in Belgium, they only have owls.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:36.560
It's a small country and there's only so many birds of prey.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:44.560
So, he could see it looks like a blazing figure of light kind of flying towards you.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.560
It looks dangerous.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.560
It's big.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.560
So, it's 30 feet big.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:52.560
Stand behind me.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.560
Do we trust...

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.560
Well, I think we should get into the town, right?

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.560
I mean, these guys live in a place where there's...

01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.560
I'm already in the town.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.560
I walked away a long time ago.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.560
I'm at a bar right now.

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:10.560
Is there an apothecary or a metastologist or a healer?

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:13.560
Yes, there is a metastologist in the center of town.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560
The sky's back.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560
It's still fucked up.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.560
You did your best.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.560
Thank you.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:21.560
I don't like to list this big glowing light thing that's coming our way, guys.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:25.560
I gotta drop this guy off so I can wash my hands of him.

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.560
Here, come into the town.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.560
I'll show you around.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.560
I have a...

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560
Spencer, what is it called?

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.560
Constabulary.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560
Constabulary.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560
Come to my...

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560
Constabulary.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560
I'm sorry.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.560
What?

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.560
Okay.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.560
Is there a hospital?

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.560
Yes.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.560
In the Constabulary, there is a very sophisticated first aid kit.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.560
And let's jam towards health.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.560
All right.

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.560
So you killed your character off to become this completely different character.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.560
You're the same confused person.

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.560
I don't know who you're talking to.

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560
You're liberated.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.560
I don't want to sit on stage with Reddit right now, I would like to just do the show.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.560
Maybe some people said some things on Reddit and I thought I should kill myself.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.560
It's a different vibe.

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560
I'm trying to move.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.560
I'm trying to sing towards light and truth.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.560
You're playing the game based on Reddit?

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.560
I never go on there and defend myself.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:36.560
I would like to just play the show and, you know, just go be positive and not worry about

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.560
what, you know...

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.560
Douche Coup, 69.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.560
Douche Coup.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.560
Bartman.

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.560
SpongeBob.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.560
I mean, the reason why I killed my character is because I was talking about it for so long

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:56.560
and then last week I felt like it was the right thing to do.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.560
And we can talk about that if you want.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.560
But I felt like it was the right thing to do and I realized this is also what I did in

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.560
our private game.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.560
You're responding to web negativity and that's why you're changing the character.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.560
Not because you wanted to try other things.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.560
I don't think that's what you're saying.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.560
I mean, you've been so positive towards my character that I don't know why I wouldn't want to live

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560
on forever.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560
I mean, you've been such a...

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:18.560
I've been the biggest supporter of your gameplay.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.560
I find you delightful.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560
Sure.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:28.560
This is starting to feel mean.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.560
This guy needs a hospital.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:35.560
I don't understand.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.560
Let's go.

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.560
Let's go.

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.560
I whistle.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.560
Oh, I whistle and it sounds very similar to...

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.560
Hootie-hootie.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.560
What did you say?

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.560
Woo-hoo.

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:46.560
Woo-hoo.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.560
I whistle and a beautiful brown horse rides up.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:54.560
I found this horse wandering around.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.560
It's Coco.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.560
You recognize...

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560
You guys recognize that it's Coco.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560
I lift everyone.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.560
I put them on.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560
Can we just call you Mulrainee?

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.560
Because you remind us so much of our friend that just died?

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.560
I resent this right now, Jeff.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.560
Who's Jeff?

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560
Exactly.

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560
Who is Jeff?

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.560
Nothing.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.560
I heard about Mulrainee.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.560
I take the guy over my shoulder and I take him inside the fort.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560
That hurts really bad.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.560
You're healed now, aren't you?

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560
No, I'm a little healed.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.560
I can't put him back down.

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.560
My arm's not broken anymore.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:37.560
My neck.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.560
He needs to be levitated to a goddamn healer.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.560
I'm going to start walking with Coco towards the medicine cabinet

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.560
inside the cop house, the constabulary, thank you.

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.560
Two guards come out of the constabularians.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.560
They look at you and they run over with a stretcher and grab the guy.

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.560
Stretching them along.

01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:01.560
These guys are super fun.

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.560
They're really nice guys.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.560
Thanks, dignity.

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.560
You're welcome, Joe.

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:15.560
She remembered.

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.560
What was that?

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:23.560
Avenger, when you saw this thing coming, how soon did you reckon it would get here,

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:29.560
based on its speed and your hawk knowledge?

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.560
Ten minutes.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.560
Is that right, ten minutes?

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.560
I mean, you know, hawk time is like four times fast or something.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.560
Forty minutes?

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.560
Here's the thing about me.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.560
All of my spells are depleted and have been for like nine gaming sessions.

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.560
I was thinking that too, but there was a good three weeks that you guys were regenerating spells

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.560
and traveling to the Purple Man Mountains.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560
Oh, okay.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560
So I think you're good.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.560
All right.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.560
Good.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.560
I mean, rest is always nice.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.560
Yeah, can I make you guys some tea?

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.560
Yeah, you guys are in the constabulary.

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.560
There's men with guard outfits.

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.560
They're red and white uniforms.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.560
They're kind of walking in and out.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.560
There's a sitting room where you're kind of near with tables and benches and a few off-duty guards

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.560
sitting and drinking and talking.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:24.560
No, these guys.

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:32.560
I give, I pull up a table and I put down tea for everybody.

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.560
It's a dry city.

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.560
Sorry?

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.560
It's a dry city.

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560
Like, no, no.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560
For alcohol.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.560
That's white tea.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.560
Sorry?

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.560
Oh, right.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.560
Everyone's drinking tea.

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.560
Even those guys drinking earlier were drinking tea.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:51.560
I wouldn't mind going and finding out these crystal crabs and shit that we've gotten.

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.560
The Purple Cave are worth.

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.560
Remember those things?

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.560
Oh, yeah.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.560
Yeah, like crab things.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.560
Is there someone in town that can appraise those items for us?

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.560
Who are you talking to?

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.560
One of the guards.

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.560
I don't know.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.560
I'm off duty.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.560
Is anybody on duty?

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.560
No one on duty is in the realm.

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.560
She's off duty, right?

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:17.560
You're off duty?

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:20.560
Yeah, I'm off duty spiritually.

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:23.560
I bet she doesn't even work here.

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:26.560
Who knows, man?

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.560
You know these guys.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.560
Spencer, do I know of a guy?

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.560
A what?

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.560
What was it we were just looking for?

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.560
I don't know.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560
I saw the guards.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.560
In 40 minutes or so, there's a giant storm brewing that's coming our way.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560
We need to defend the city.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.560
Do you guys have defenses in an army that can protect us?

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.560
Yes.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.560
You sense of urgency worries me.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.560
That was me the Dungeon Master because you weren't asking anybody.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560
That's from the guard.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.560
They're off duty.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.560
Look.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.560
Do I know?

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.560
Spencer, I appealed to their desire to be alive later on.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.560
Whether they're working or not.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:13.560
As dignity, do I have knowledge of who's in charge of defense for the city?

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.560
Yeah.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:19.560
The guy who's in charge of everything, including the defense of the city, is the main patriarch,

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.560
whose name is Father Tender.

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.560
Hey.

01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:23.560
Hi.

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.560
Don't have to ask me twice.

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.560
Hey, little guy.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.560
No, look up.

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.560
Hey.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.560
Hi.

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560
My name is Quark.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.560
Quark.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.560
Yes.

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.560
Dignity.

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.560
Hello.

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.560
Hi.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.560
Thank you for the warm reception.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560
You got it.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.560
I heard you talking.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560
I would like to introduce you to the...

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.560
I know.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.560
You keep coming up into our sidebars.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.560
Yeah.

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.560
Twice a week.

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.560
I wash my hair twice a week.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:57.560
So I would like to introduce you to a very special person.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.560
He's right around the corner.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.560
Can I lead you there?

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.560
I know you're talking about defense.

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.560
Yes.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.820
As a new member of your gang that will forever be with you and never leave, I would like

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.560
to show you...

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.560
No matter even if someone says on Reddit to change your character.

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.560
This one's here to stay.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.560
Look, I'm not looking for more compliments.

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.560
All right.

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:20.560
So we...

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.560
So I lead them.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.560
I gesture to them and walk out and show them Father Tender's.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.560
Yeah.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:32.560
But before you could even open the door, the doors swing wide and you can see Father Tender

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.560
himself was striding through.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:39.560
He's a very handsome older man in white robes embroidered with red roses.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.560
He marches inside with guardsmen to his left and to his right.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.560
He says, greetings, guardsmen.

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.560
Father Tender here.

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.560
Thank you for your service.

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.560
You're all doing a fine job.

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.560
Then he looks at Quark and his face hardens.

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.560
He glances over at Dignity.

01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.560
Dignity, who are all these new faces?

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:06.560
These are my best friends.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.560
These are my best friends.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560
These are my potential lovers.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.560
These are my future adventure haver together withers.

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.560
These are the most important people on the face of the planet.

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.560
This is Quark.

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.560
He's great.

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.560
And this is Sharpie.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.560
I overheard your name.

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.560
He's very strong.

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:28.560
This is Avenger.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.560
This is Christopher, who's been quietly listening.

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.560
Pleased to meet you.

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:43.560
He's very fancy.

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:51.560
My new friends are concerned with the safety of the city and I would like to help them

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.560
protect the city.

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.560
There's a big white ball coming.

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.560
Oh, I know.

01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.560
Your adventure is, huh?

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.560
It's dangerous work, isn't it?

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.560
It brings danger all around, doesn't it?

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560
There's a big white ball coming.

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.560
We don't really like danger so much here in Roseville.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.560
Are you animatronic?

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.560
No, no.

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:16.560
We follow our beliefs strictly and the Rosa Crucian Codex clearly states that

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:19.560
danger is evil.

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.560
And right now, we've got a whole lot of it.

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.560
I don't know if you know out there, but there's a demon coming right for us,

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.560
blasting hellfire and screaming bloody murder.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560
And I think you're behind it, Gnome.

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560
Gnomes are always trouble.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560
I'm not behind it.

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560
It just came in here.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560
We just brought a gnome in.

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.560
Yeah, he points at the broken gnome.

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.560
Ever since this gnome has been coming through town, making immoral drinks and

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.560
poisoning our citizens, we've lost our God's favor.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.560
If you could excuse me, I need to pray.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.560
My clerics are already at the Soul Rods, reinforcing our wards.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.560
He looks over at dignity with a lecherous gaze and says,

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.560
you know, my Soul Rods already rigidly reinforced.

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.560
So, as he walks out, he says,

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:08.560
feel free to stop by my juicery if anyone wants me to give him my special juice.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.560
What?

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.560
New friends, you don't want the special juice.

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:19.560
It's not that special. Everyone in this town can generate it, and his is warm.

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.560
Hey, Sharpie, Chris, let's get the hell out of this town.

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.560
I don't like the looks of Father Tender.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.560
I don't like anything about this town.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560
We dropped the guy off. We did our duty. Let's just keep moving.

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.560
Yeah.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:34.560
Can I run out after Father Tender and use diplomacy?

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.560
Sure.

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.560
Okay. Chase after Father Tender.

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.560
What are you saying?

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:46.560
This gnome is not responsible for this demon.

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.560
This gnome is necessary to the safety of this town,

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.560
and you should treat this gnome like the special guest that he is.

01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:59.560
Ah, you're right. I'll do that.

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.560
But I got my eye on him.

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:12.560
If you guys bring any more trouble, you're all fucked.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.560
It's what he says when he leaves every room.

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.560
It's his thing.

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.560
And he traipses out.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.560
All right. Well, I don't know. I feel bad for this town. There's a thing coming.

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.560
I guess I don't feel bad about this town at all.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:31.560
We've got a shitty reception from the get-go.

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:33.560
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.560
We've done worse things to people who have done less to us.

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.560
Wait, do we still have a robot baby with us?

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560
Oh, yeah.

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560
Just checking.

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.560
I'm a power unit. I'm 300 gold.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.560
He could have been the robot baby. Fuck.

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.560
Oh, yeah.

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.560
That's on me, man. You're doing a great hawk, though.

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.560
The hawk is the highlight of my life.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.560
It's my new ring.

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.560
How far is it?

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:06.560
I go up to the walls, the rosy walls of Rosebook and look over and check out the light storm coming towards.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.560
You can see the light storm drying nearer.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.560
It's coming way faster than you'd ever expected.

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:15.560
And as it nears, you can hear a voice calling out from the void.

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.560
It sounds like...

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.560
Oh, shit.

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.560
Heading straight towards the town.

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:27.560
And with an instance, it's upon you, but crashing towards the town,

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:30.560
it smashes directly into solid air above the town.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.560
You see white wards sizzling and popping in midair,

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:37.560
burning the angel's flesh and compelling it outside of the city.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.560
It circles around a few times, crashing into the barrier for longer.

01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560
It stands firm.

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.560
Yoshi, the angel, right?

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.560
Yep. Yomiji?

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.560
Yomiji.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:52.560
You can't seem to get into the barrier.

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.560
Wow, the soul rods kept him out.

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:56.560
I told you!

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.560
Aside from that guy's lack of sexual harassment training,

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.560
I guess he's an effective leader.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.560
He's got this place buckled down.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.560
One of the guards pokes at her and speaks up.

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.560
He's like, you know, that guy wasn't always a perv.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.560
Uh, hi.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:19.560
That's all. See ya.

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:23.560
This is a weird city's town, that's weird.

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.560
So we're safe, we're good.

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.560
It's over.

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:30.560
Where do we go next?

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:37.560
I walk out of the constabulary and walk into town to see if there's anyone...

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:41.560
Are we going to try to cash in our little crystal crab thingies?

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:45.560
Everyone seems kind of occupied, looking at a giant flaming angel demon.

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.560
Is it still, it's just hovering out there?

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.560
Yeah, it's attacking this barrier immensely.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.560
It's still trying to get in.

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:55.560
Yeah, it's like a velociraptor, texting the weaknesses in an electrical fence.

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:59.560
I don't think we're leaving this place until we take care of this guy.

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:02.560
Is there a wise man in town, a dignity?

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.560
No.

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.560
Do we know that there's a wise man?

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.560
Or a wise woman?

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:17.560
I mean, Mr. Father Tender is basically our wise man, and you saw how wise he is.

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:28.560
I mean, it could be the first on a list of many harrowing great adventures for you to join me in defending this city.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:33.560
And we can all jam towards the light.

01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:41.560
And if there was ever someone I wanted to jam towards light with, I mean, I think it would be you.

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:48.560
You're very particular.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:51.560
And I like that.

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.560
I like how particular you are.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.560
I realize you just lost your friend.

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:57.560
I don't think you care at all.

01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.560
Really?

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.560
No.

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560
I know, of course I do.

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.560
You never met her.

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.560
You don't know how much we cared about her.

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.560
I have her horse.

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.560
I fucked that horse.

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:13.560
Well, then you love her.

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:19.560
I'm saying, maybe we got off on the wrong foot, we've had a very long day.

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.560
The last thing you want is more adventures.

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.560
We've had it up to here with adventures.

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:34.560
Well, then come to the flat where I'm staying and I made a blanket fort.

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.560
You're not concerned about this angel attacking?

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:39.560
No, I am, but you're telling me that you're tired.

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.560
I'm saying this when we first met, you wanted to go on more adventures.

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.560
I'm saying, look, it was like we're tired.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.560
Friends just got killed.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.560
Well, she killed us all.

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:53.560
Jeff, say we don't want to go on any more adventures again.

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:58.560
But say my name is my actual name, Quirk.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.560
We don't want to go on any more adventures.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.560
Well, Quirk.

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.560
And I look up at the angel.

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:10.560
I don't think the adventure cares.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:11.560
Wait, wait, wait.

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:15.560
And then, I'll say my line again.

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.560
I'll say my line again.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:22.560
Then you say your line again and I want to hear adventure just like you.

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.560
Just kind of chime in after you.

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.560
All right.

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:26.560
You know what?

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.560
But make it a special adventure cry that this has a little bit of fear in it.

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.560
Or like kind of like a cliffhanger.

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:34.560
