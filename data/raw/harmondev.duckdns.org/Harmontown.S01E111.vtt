think it's toasted enough.\n\n12:28.520 --> 12:31.520\nSo let's look at the television as an appliance.\n\n12:31.520 --> 12:33.520\nWhat do you think it's doing?\n\n12:33.520 --> 12:35.520\nIt's making you watch it.\n\n12:35.520 --> 12:36.520\nIs your neighbor racist?\n\n12:36.520 --> 12:38.520\nIs it dangerous to go outside?\n\n12:38.520 --> 12:39.520\nFuck yeah!\n\n12:39.520 --> 12:42.520\nSays the television.\n\n12:42.520 --> 12:45.520\nDoes your racist neighbor have bread?\n\n12:45.520 --> 12:46.520\nSays the toaster.\n\n12:46.520 --> 12:48.520\nBring it in here.\n\n12:48.520 --> 12:50.520\nIf you can't finish it, put it in me.\n\n12:50.520 --> 12:52.520\nSays the refrigerator.\n\n12:52.520 --> 12:55.520\nBut the fucking television is the worst of all.\n\n12:55.520 --> 12:58.520\nIt's telling you just whatever you do, stay in your living rooms.\n\n12:58.520 --> 13:01.520\nAnd it will tell you anything to make that happen.\n\n13:01.520 --> 13:02.520\nDon't go to church.\n\n13:02.520 --> 13:04.520\nDon't go skiing.\n\n13:04.520 --> 13:07.520\nDoes the toaster tell, when you're in bed at night,\n\n13:07.520 --> 13:11.520\ndoes the toaster tell the TV, when they get up, tell him to buy more bread?\n\n13:11.520 --> 13:13.520\nI don't know.\n\n13:13.520 --> 13:18.520\nThere's nothing about bread commercials on every channel.\n\n13:18.520 --> 13:21.520\nThe balance has been unbalanced.\n\n13:21.520 --> 13:26.520\nI don't know, maybe there's fun musical numbers like Beauty and the Beast.\n\n13:26.520 --> 13:28.520\nI met Werner Herzog.\n\n13:28.520 --> 13:30.520\nI saw the photo of that, it's amazing.\n\n13:30.520 --> 13:33.520\nThat was after a 15 minute chat about movies.\n\n13:33.520 --> 13:36.520\nHe came in and did a voice for Rick and Morty.\n\n13:36.520 --> 13:39.520\nI have Werner Herzog questions.\n\n13:39.520 --> 13:42.520\nDid he disappoint or did he satisfy?\n\n13:42.520 --> 13:47.520\nI've never met a famous person that was just exactly what you'd expect.\n\n13:47.520 --> 13:50.520\nBut it's not to say that he's predictable at all,\n\n13:50.520 --> 13:55.520\nbecause what you expect at Werner Herzog is that he's going to come in and be Werner Herzog.\n\n13:55.520 --> 13:58.520\nSo he came in and I said, thank you for coming.\n\n13:58.520 --> 13:59.520\nOh, thank you.\n\n13:59.520 --> 14:01.520\nI found a parking outside.\n\n14:01.520 --> 14:03.520\nHe wanted to know.\n\n14:03.520 --> 14:10.520\nHe wanted to know the voice of a cartoon alien.\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:12.520\nThe character's name is Old Reptile.\n\n14:12.520 --> 14:23.520\nSo he's like, is he a crocodile?\n\n14:23.520 --> 14:24.520\nSnake?\n\n14:24.520 --> 14:27.520\nHe's an Old Reptile, he's an alien.\n\n14:27.520 --> 14:30.520\nDo you have some form of...\n\n14:30.520 --> 14:33.520\nI can't make him sound like Peter Lorre.\n\n14:33.520 --> 14:36.520\nYou're a little Michael Madsen there too.\n\n14:36.520 --> 14:43.520\nDo you have a fucking ear I could cut off?\n\n14:43.520 --> 14:45.520\nHe wanted to see something.\n\n14:45.520 --> 14:47.520\nThe character hasn't been drawn yet.\n\n14:47.520 --> 14:48.520\nSo there's no concept art?\n\n14:48.520 --> 14:50.520\nSo we showed him a little bit of Rick and Morty.\n\n14:50.520 --> 14:54.520\nI showed him a scene from the pilot when they're in the intergalactic customs.\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:58.520\nSo he watches it for a second and he goes, ah, yes, I see.\n\n14:58.520 --> 15:02.520\nYes, they are creatures but they speak normally.\n\n15:02.520 --> 15:05.520\nWait, okay.\n\n15:05.520 --> 15:07.520\nSecond Werner Herzog question.\n\n15:07.520 --> 15:09.520\nIs Werner Herzog now going...\n\n15:09.520 --> 15:13.520\nIs he going to be on like Bob's Burgers and stuff too?\n\n15:13.520 --> 15:14.520\nI hope not.\n\n15:14.520 --> 15:16.520\nIs he out doing cartoon voices?\n\n15:16.520 --> 15:18.520\nHow did you pull this?\n\n15:18.520 --> 15:22.520\nWe just sent to the casting department while he'd do it.\n\n15:22.520 --> 15:24.520\nHe's in LA and they were like, yeah, he'll do it.\n\n15:24.520 --> 15:28.520\nWell, I don't want to...\n\n15:28.520 --> 15:30.520\nHe just did it for scale.\n\n15:30.520 --> 15:32.520\nSo you got Werner Herzog in the booth.\n\n15:32.520 --> 15:34.520\nAnd he's got the headphones on.\n\n15:34.520 --> 15:36.520\nAnd who's directing him?\n\n15:36.520 --> 15:37.520\nI'm directing him.\n\n15:37.520 --> 15:38.520\nAnd Justin's there probably?\n\n15:38.520 --> 15:39.520\nWell, he had a lot of questions about it.\n\n15:39.520 --> 15:44.520\nHe was like, so do you want me to do exaggerated...\n\n15:44.520 --> 15:45.520\nWhy do I...\n\n15:45.520 --> 15:46.520\nI can't do...\n\n15:46.520 --> 15:47.520\nI was doing this impression for a while.\n\n15:47.520 --> 15:48.520\nJust go part German.\n\n15:48.520 --> 15:49.520\nBe more straight.\n\n15:49.520 --> 15:50.520\nI can't...\n\n15:50.520 --> 15:56.520\nI think that we have ways of making you talk.\n\n15:56.520 --> 15:58.520\nThat's just a phrase I use to get into my German character.\n\n15:58.520 --> 16:01.520\nI'm sorry to our German listeners.\n\n16:01.520 --> 16:05.520\nIt's a little Don Corleone right now.\n\n16:05.520 --> 16:07.520\nThat is the day of my furor's wedding.\n\n16:07.520 --> 16:12.520\nYou come to me.\n\n16:12.520 --> 16:14.520\nAll right, so anyways, maybe...\n\n16:14.520 --> 16:15.520\nHe's in the booth.\n\n16:15.520 --> 16:17.520\nI mean, tell me if you're ready for this one.\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:20.520\nFirst he had to understand...\n\n16:20.520 --> 16:24.520\nHe was like, do you want me to do an exaggerated version of myself?\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:25.520\nI said, no, no, no.\n\n16:25.520 --> 16:26.520\nDon't do...\n\n16:26.520 --> 16:27.520\nJust be yourself.\n\n16:27.520 --> 16:29.520\nAnd he's like...\n\n16:29.520 --> 16:32.520\nYou know, myself is...\n\n16:32.520 --> 16:33.520\nHere we go.\n\n16:33.520 --> 16:34.520\nYou know, that's...\n\n16:34.520 --> 16:36.520\nThis is an automobile construct.\n\n16:36.520 --> 16:39.520\nAnd I said, well, the guy that you are...\n\n16:39.520 --> 16:42.520\nYou know, the guy that you are having grown up watching your movies.\n\n16:42.520 --> 16:43.520\nLike that guy.\n\n16:43.520 --> 16:47.520\nAnd he's like, oh, well, see, that guy, you know, that is...\n\n16:47.520 --> 16:52.520\nI am being an exaggerated version of myself.\n\n16:52.520 --> 16:54.520\nI said, okay, yeah, exactly.\n\n16:54.520 --> 16:55.520\nHe's saying...\n\n16:55.520 --> 16:56.520\nPresentational.\n\n16:56.520 --> 16:58.520\nIn his movies, he's performing for us?\n\n16:58.520 --> 16:59.520\nHe just means...\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:01.520\nHe just means like anybody is.\n\n17:01.520 --> 17:03.520\nLike when you're talking into a microphone,\n\n17:03.520 --> 17:05.520\nyou fucking step on the gas a little bit.\n\n17:05.520 --> 17:08.520\nSo then he got in the booth and already watched the cartoon.\n\n17:08.520 --> 17:10.520\nHe said, yeah, the creatures speak normal.\n\n17:10.520 --> 17:12.520\nAnd then he got in and he does this monologue.\n\n17:12.520 --> 17:14.520\nAnd it's about penises.\n\n17:14.520 --> 17:18.520\nAnd it's just this big, long monologue.\n\n17:18.520 --> 17:21.520\nHe'd already read the material before he got there.\n\n17:21.520 --> 17:22.520\nYeah.\n\n17:22.520 --> 17:24.520\nAnd he said, I read the screenplay.\n\n17:24.520 --> 17:26.520\nAnd I synced it.\n\n17:26.520 --> 17:28.520\nI synced it.\n\n17:28.520 --> 17:30.520\nIt is very funny.\n\n17:30.520 --> 17:31.520\nYeah.\n\n17:31.520 --> 17:34.520\nAnd I was like, yeah, you bet.\n\n17:34.520 --> 17:35.520\nYou bet your...\n\n17:35.520 --> 17:38.520\nHe went in there and then he fucking nailed it.\n\n17:38.520 --> 17:39.520\nLike first take, he just did it.\n\n17:39.520 --> 17:42.520\nAnd because he's playing an old reptile who,\n\n17:42.520 --> 17:44.520\nwithout spoiling the story,\n\n17:44.520 --> 17:46.520\nhe's just a cameo.\n\n17:46.520 --> 17:49.520\nHe's just an old reptile alien who's explaining to the other aliens\n\n17:49.520 --> 17:52.520\nthat he's spent a lot of time on Earth,\n\n17:52.520 --> 17:53.520\namong the Earthlings,\n\n17:53.520 --> 17:56.520\nand noticed their relationship with their penises.\n\n17:56.520 --> 17:57.520\nSo...\n\n17:57.520 --> 18:03.520\nAnd it's just a big, long monologue about this cosmic observer\n\n18:03.520 --> 18:07.520\ntalking about how humans feel about their penises.\n\n18:07.520 --> 18:09.520\nIt's funny when they're small.\n\n18:09.520 --> 18:11.520\nIt's funny when they're big.\n\n18:11.520 --> 18:12.520\nIt's...\n\n18:12.520 --> 18:15.520\nI've been to parties where men will take an object,\n\n18:15.520 --> 18:17.520\nhold it in front and say,\n\n18:17.520 --> 18:21.520\nhey, I missed her so-and-so dick.\n\n18:21.520 --> 18:26.520\nWas it Pringles by any chance, Ben?\n\n18:26.520 --> 18:29.520\nSo, he nails it.\n\n18:29.520 --> 18:30.520\nAnd then we just did something.\n\n18:30.520 --> 18:32.520\nI was like, well, can you do it more intense?\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:34.520\nCan you do it more tragic?\n\n18:34.520 --> 18:35.520\nCan you do it more things?\n\n18:35.520 --> 18:36.520\nAnd then he...\n\n18:36.520 --> 18:37.520\nIt was fun.\n\n18:37.520 --> 18:38.520\nIt was a lot of fun.\n\n18:38.520 --> 18:39.520\nThen he plopped down and talked about...\n\n18:39.520 --> 18:41.520\nI wanted to talk to you about the act of killing\n\n18:41.520 --> 18:43.520\nbecause he executed, produced that,\n\n18:43.520 --> 18:46.520\nand he explained how he discovered that movie\n\n18:46.520 --> 18:49.520\nor how it was brought to him by Joshua Oppenheimer.\n\n18:49.520 --> 18:52.520\nAnd we talked about how amazing that movie was for a while.\n\n18:52.520 --> 18:55.520\nAnd it turns out he, for those of you who have seen it,\n\n18:55.520 --> 18:57.520\nlike, I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't,\n\n18:57.520 --> 19:00.520\ngo find the act of killing and watch it.\n\n19:00.520 --> 19:02.520\nI've talked about it on this podcast.\n\n19:02.520 --> 19:05.520\nIt's one of the most incredible documentaries I've ever seen.\n\n19:05.520 --> 19:09.520\nThe ending of it will be particularly impacting to you.\n\n19:09.520 --> 19:13.520\nAnd he told this story about how he was actually very key\n\n19:13.520 --> 19:17.520\nin the way that that ending was edited or rather not edited.\n\n19:17.520 --> 19:22.520\nHe was the voice of trying to convince the filmmaker.\n\n19:22.520 --> 19:23.520\nYou can't.\n\n19:23.520 --> 19:27.520\nYou have to show all three minutes of this unedited at all.\n\n19:27.520 --> 19:30.520\nAnd I said to him, if you do this,\n\n19:30.520 --> 19:35.520\nif you shoot this movie for seven years\n\n19:35.520 --> 19:41.520\nand then edit the final three minutes in any way,\n\n19:41.520 --> 19:45.520\nyou have spent your life in vain.\n\n19:48.520 --> 19:52.520\nAnd I said, is that also how you order breakfast?\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:58.520\nIf I do not get feta cheese and a scramble,\n\n19:58.520 --> 20:01.520\nif there aren't also bits of bacon.\n\n20:04.520 --> 20:06.520\nAnd I was amazed by his story.\n\n20:06.520 --> 20:09.520\nI was like, wow, this guy's a real fucking, like, he's a genius.\n\n20:09.520 --> 20:10.520\nThat story proves it.\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:12.520\nBut then he said another story that kind of undercut it\n\n20:12.520 --> 20:14.520\nbecause I meant, he said, who else has done the show?\n\n20:14.520 --> 20:15.520\nAnd I said, Stephen Colbert.\n\n20:15.520 --> 20:21.520\nAnd he said, I had an influence on Stephen Colbert.\n\n20:21.520 --> 20:26.520\nI say that with humility, but he, I was doing his show\n\n20:26.520 --> 20:29.520\nand he came up to me in the hallway before\n\n20:29.520 --> 20:30.520\nand I had not seen it.\n\n20:30.520 --> 20:36.520\nI asked him, is it Colbert or Colbert?\n\n20:36.520 --> 20:39.520\nAnd he said, oh, it's the French.\n\n20:39.520 --> 20:40.520\nIt's Colbert.\n\n20:40.520 --> 20:43.520\nAnd I said, that being the case,\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:48.520\nyou should think about changing the pronunciation of reports\n\n20:48.520 --> 20:51.520\nand do the French of that, which is rapport.\n\n20:51.520 --> 20:55.520\nAnd soon after that, he started using that pronunciation\n\n20:55.520 --> 20:57.520\nof the show.\n\n20:57.520 --> 20:59.520\nAnd I was like, adorable.\n\n20:59.520 --> 21:02.520\nAnd I said, did you meet him on the Daily Show?\n\n21:02.520 --> 21:03.520\nOr did you meet him?\n\n21:03.520 --> 21:04.520\nAnd he's like, no, no, his show.\n\n21:04.520 --> 21:06.520\nI'm like, oh, that's when he started pronouncing it differently.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:07.520\nOK.\n\n21:07.520 --> 21:09.520\nAnd then I just moved on.\n\n21:09.520 --> 21:11.520\nYou can just picture what it was like doing that\n\n21:11.520 --> 21:13.520\nand Stephen Colbert going, you know what?\n\n21:13.520 --> 21:14.520\nI'm going to do that.\n\n21:14.520 --> 21:19.520\nYou know exactly how that story unfolded.\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:20.520\nThat's so cute.\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:23.520\nBut an amazing guy had really just kind of, yeah,\n\n21:23.520 --> 21:25.520\nwhen he enters the room, it's kind of, I don't know,\n\n21:25.520 --> 21:26.520\nyou feel it.\n\n21:26.520 --> 21:27.520\nWhat archetype is that?\n\n21:27.520 --> 21:29.520\nHe's like, he fills a niche for people.\n\n21:29.520 --> 21:31.520\nI think sometimes in his documentary,\n\n21:31.520 --> 21:34.520\nGrizzly Man is sometimes, he injects himself a little more\n\n21:34.520 --> 21:36.520\nthan I think he might want to do.\n\n21:36.520 --> 21:39.520\nHe makes himself more of a protagonist in his documentary\n\n21:39.520 --> 21:42.520\nsometime where he's like, what's up with Grizzly Man?\n\n21:42.520 --> 21:46.520\nHe's like, he's hearing the cell phone of the guy\n\n21:46.520 --> 21:47.520\ngetting killed by the bear.\n\n21:47.520 --> 21:49.520\nAnd he's in front of the wife.\n\n21:49.520 --> 21:51.520\nHe's like, oh, this is the worst.\n\n21:51.520 --> 21:53.520\nYou should never listen to this.\n\n21:53.520 --> 21:54.520\nYes, never listen to this.\n\n21:54.520 --> 21:56.520\nDon't ever.\n\n21:56.520 --> 21:57.520\nThis is really bad stuff.\n\n21:57.520 --> 21:58.520\nDon't, don't listen to this.\n\n21:58.520 --> 21:59.520\nYeah, he does a lot of weird stuff.\n\n21:59.520 --> 22:01.520\nThat's why you're watching his movies.\n\n22:01.520 --> 22:04.520\nYou feel this like, you feel like you're in the hands\n\n22:04.520 --> 22:06.520\nof some strange master, you know.\n\n22:06.520 --> 22:07.520\nYou know, it's great.\n\n22:07.520 --> 22:09.520\nHis movies might take some weird left turn.\n\n22:09.520 --> 22:10.520\nHave you seen My Best Fiend?\n\n22:10.520 --> 22:11.520\nAbout him and Charles Kinski?\n\n22:11.520 --> 22:12.520\nThat's a doozy.\n\n22:12.520 --> 22:14.520\nYeah, that's how I was introduced to him actually.\n\n22:14.520 --> 22:15.520\nThat was one of Dino's favorite movies.\n\n22:15.520 --> 22:16.520\nYeah.\n\n22:16.520 --> 22:17.520\nHe showed that to me.\n\n22:17.520 --> 22:18.520\nBut yeah, what a gem.\n\n22:18.520 --> 22:20.520\nI'd like him to, I'd like him to be New Pierce\n\n22:20.520 --> 22:21.520\non Community.\n\n22:21.520 --> 22:23.520\nI think that would be great.\n\n22:23.520 --> 22:24.520\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:24.520 --> 22:26.520\nThat's so amazing.\n\n22:26.520 --> 22:27.520\nYes.\n\n22:27.520 --> 22:31.520\nThis, this, this things you are talking about\n\n22:31.520 --> 22:34.520\nat the study room table is,\n\n22:34.520 --> 22:36.520\nI understand the concepts,\n\n22:36.520 --> 22:47.520\nbut the real question is at what price?\n\n22:47.520 --> 22:53.520\nAnd if you change the letters in price, you get Pierce.\n\n22:53.520 --> 22:56.520\nI'm getting a, I'm getting a new car.\n\n22:56.520 --> 22:58.520\nI want, I want, I want to, yeah, I know.\n\n22:58.520 --> 23:00.520\nIt's a few cheers first.\n\n23:00.520 --> 23:01.520\nI know.\n\n23:01.520 --> 23:02.520\nI said it that way.\n\n23:02.520 --> 23:03.520\nYou reacted that way.\n\n23:03.520 --> 23:05.520\nIt's just the one that runs on human blood.\n\n23:05.520 --> 23:06.520\nYeah.\n\n23:06.520 --> 23:08.520\nIt's just, yes.\n\n23:08.520 --> 23:13.520\nIt has a straw that goes from it to the third world.\n\n23:13.520 --> 23:16.520\nIt's a new like super stretchy straw.\n\n23:16.520 --> 23:17.520\nWhere are you driving in LA?\n\n23:17.520 --> 23:21.520\nThe straw reaches over to the Gaza Strip\n\n23:21.520 --> 23:32.520\nand it just, it just sucks up too late.\n\n23:32.520 --> 23:36.520\nYou didn't care 40 years ago.\n\n23:36.520 --> 23:41.520\nTheir parents were in a live 40 years ago.\n\n23:41.520 --> 23:43.520\nI don't know why I'm trying to high road you.\n\n23:43.520 --> 23:47.520\nI pay my taxes like everyone else.\n\n23:47.520 --> 23:49.520\nThe, but anyways, yeah, I'm getting a,\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:51.520\nI need to get a new car.\n\n23:51.520 --> 23:52.520\nSo I came home last night.\n\n23:52.520 --> 23:53.520\nYou're getting that Tesla?\n\n23:53.520 --> 23:54.520\nWe were hanging out.\n\n23:54.520 --> 23:55.520\nI decided against the Tesla.\n\n23:55.520 --> 23:58.520\nIt's too, it's out of my, it's, it's not for me.\n\n23:58.520 --> 24:01.520\nIt's for guys that are like, you know, like super like,\n\n24:01.520 --> 24:05.520\nlike, you know, like Rockefeller, like, you know,\n\n24:05.520 --> 24:07.520\nI'm not ready yet for the Tesla.\n\n24:07.520 --> 24:08.520\nWayne Brady has a Tesla.\n\n24:08.520 --> 24:09.520\nHe's not Rockefeller.\n\n24:09.520 --> 24:11.520\nWayne Brady is more Rockefeller than I am.\n\n24:11.520 --> 24:12.520\nWayne Brady can have a Tesla.\n\n24:12.520 --> 24:16.520\nYou shouldn't have a Tesla until you have more than one car.\n\n24:16.520 --> 24:17.520\nThat's what it is.\n\n24:17.520 --> 24:19.520\nYou should have one of those special garages\n\n24:19.520 --> 24:21.520\nlike in Ferris Bueller's day off.\n\n24:21.520 --> 24:23.520\nLike, like, like a car, like a car garage.\n\n24:23.520 --> 24:28.520\nLike a, like a, like, like where, like a garage.\n\n24:28.520 --> 24:32.520\nNo, as, as opposed to the black widow toilet storage\n\n24:32.520 --> 24:36.520\nthat I have, I have like six toilets\n\n24:36.520 --> 24:38.520\nand a bunch of McDonald's cups.\n\n24:38.520 --> 24:39.520\nWhy do you have six toilets?\n\n24:39.520 --> 24:41.520\nI'll tell you, I'm glad you asked.\n\n24:41.520 --> 24:45.520\nBecause there was some, and I,\n\n24:45.520 --> 24:48.520\nmaybe I'm getting myself in trouble, I'd say.\n\n24:48.520 --> 24:49.520\nIs that an exaggeration first off?\n\n24:49.520 --> 24:50.520\nAre there really six toilets?\n\n24:50.520 --> 24:51.520\nI think it's like five toilets or something.\n\n24:51.520 --> 24:52.520\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n24:52.520 --> 24:55.520\nJust five toilets looming about in your, in your car garage.\n\n24:55.520 --> 24:56.520\nThere's three bathrooms in my house.\n\n24:56.520 --> 24:58.520\nSo why would there be more than three toilets?\n\n24:58.520 --> 25:00.520\nMaybe it's three in a, it just, it looks like five.\n\n25:00.520 --> 25:02.520\nOh, you know what it is?\n\n25:02.520 --> 25:04.520\nI bet it's like the tank comes in one box or something.\n\n25:04.520 --> 25:05.520\nI don't know.\n\n25:05.520 --> 25:06.520\nIt's a bunch of boxes.\n\n25:06.520 --> 25:07.520\nThey're in boxes.\n\n25:07.520 --> 25:09.520\nThere's not just loose toilets.\n\n25:09.520 --> 25:11.520\nNo, they're, they're brand new.\n\n25:11.520 --> 25:13.520\nIt doesn't look like a public restroom in there.\n\n25:13.520 --> 25:16.520\nWhen I bought my home, the realtor explained to me,\n\n25:16.520 --> 25:19.520\nI don't know, I don't know if we're all going to end up in jail\n\n25:19.520 --> 25:20.520\nfor me saying this.\n\n25:20.520 --> 25:24.520\nThe realtor told me there's a, in the 70s,\n\n25:24.520 --> 25:27.520\nthere was this law passed that said like anyone that bought a new,\n\n25:27.520 --> 25:32.520\nbought a home new had to change the toilets out to these low flush toilets\n\n25:32.520 --> 25:34.520\nbecause there was this big drought in the 70s\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:35.520\nand there was this rule passed.\n\n25:35.520 --> 25:39.520\nAnd it's, you know, you're only required to buy the toilets.\n\n25:39.520 --> 25:40.520\nThat's all they're going to check on.\n\n25:40.520 --> 25:42.520\nSo I'll just have them put them in the garage.\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:43.520\nWhat?\n\n25:45.520 --> 25:46.520\nWhy not install them?\n\n25:46.520 --> 25:48.520\nBecause they're low flush, Jeff.\n\n25:48.520 --> 25:50.520\nI have giant turds.\n\n25:50.520 --> 25:53.520\nI'm a 41 year old behemoth.\n\n25:53.520 --> 25:55.520\nI'm a, I'm a human bear.\n\n25:55.520 --> 25:57.520\nBut low flush toilets still flush the big turds too.\n\n25:57.520 --> 25:59.520\nThey're just, they're just, they're more modern.\n\n25:59.520 --> 26:00.520\nThey're, they're, they're designed.\n\n26:00.520 --> 26:02.520\nSo what's the low part that they're like groovy?\n\n26:02.520 --> 26:05.520\nI think, I think toilets early on were,\n\n26:05.520 --> 26:08.520\nwere designed without water conservation in mind.\n\n26:08.520 --> 26:10.520\nAnd so there was just needless water usage.\n\n26:10.520 --> 26:11.520\nAll right.\n\n26:11.520 --> 26:12.520\nWell, I'll have a task rabbit come over.\n\n26:12.520 --> 26:14.520\nYou guys use task rabbit?\n\n26:14.520 --> 26:19.520\nIt's like the Uber of having people like do shit around your house.\n\n26:19.520 --> 26:21.520\nYou can just, you can just, Aaron uses it.\n\n26:21.520 --> 26:22.520\nYou can just call it task rabbit.\n\n26:22.520 --> 26:25.520\nYou've got, you've got boxes of toilets there just as a graft thing.\n\n26:25.520 --> 26:26.520\nLike where you just try to.\n\n26:26.520 --> 26:28.520\nIt's like, yeah, it's kind of like,

Good job, Mr. Cobblestone Dominator.\n\n32:16.520 --> 32:24.520\nI just started playing Clash of Clans and every hundredth base you go see looks like a swastika.\n\n32:24.520 --> 32:33.520\nI think it's accidental. Some are just geometric shapes that look like they have a little swirly right angles.\n\n32:33.520 --> 32:37.520\nAnd they are either backwards or proper swastikas.\n\n32:37.520 --> 32:44.520\nAnd some are like, okay, that guy, his name also has like, you know, like umlauts in it and shit.\n\n32:44.520 --> 32:51.520\nSo that's how they're trying to, that's how they're going to make a comeback? The Clash of Clans?\n\n32:51.520 --> 32:57.520\nWhen I was a kid, this might be bullshit, but I remember being a little kid on Main Street in Disneyland\n\n32:57.520 --> 33:01.520\nand when you walked on Main Street there's curtains and supposedly,\n\n33:01.520 --> 33:08.520\nand maybe it was imprinted on my mind, but there were curtains that had little swastikas on them on Main Street.\n\n33:08.520 --> 33:12.520\nBut that's also like an old-timey, you know, like an old, you know...\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:16.520\nAn old, no, an old-timey Nazi...\n\n33:16.520 --> 33:18.520\nThat symbol predates Nazism by...\n\n33:18.520 --> 33:22.520\nYeah, but I don't think that there were like, Incan Indians or whoever used it,\n\n33:22.520 --> 33:27.520\nbut like, that symbol predates Nazism in the sense that it's an American Native American.\n\n33:27.520 --> 33:32.520\nYeah, it's for, yeah, it's like my friend...\n\n33:32.520 --> 33:38.520\nYeah, but he's saying it, but Walt Disney wasn't really into India.\n\n33:38.520 --> 33:42.520\nAnyways, Jesus Christ, are you dying?\n\n33:42.520 --> 33:44.520\nI'm cool to trot over here.\n\n33:44.520 --> 33:47.520\nReally? Maybe it's just fat.\n\n33:47.520 --> 33:48.520\nCheat day.\n\n33:48.520 --> 33:50.520\nCheat day, I'm probably sweating like cupcakes.\n\n33:50.520 --> 33:54.520\nYou're sweating like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter right now.\n\n33:54.520 --> 33:58.520\nIt's a Chris Rock joke.\n\n33:58.520 --> 34:02.520\nI thought that was a Dallas reference.\n\n34:02.520 --> 34:06.520\nYou're so old.\n\n34:06.520 --> 34:10.520\nI don't even know what we're talking about.\n\n34:10.520 --> 34:15.520\nPatrick Ewing wasn't even an oil tycoon in the primetime soap opera.\n\n34:15.520 --> 34:18.520\nWhy are you sweating so much?\n\n34:18.520 --> 34:26.520\nI see people fanning. Yeah, I'm like a freshly served Big Mac here.\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:29.520\nI should have said McRib, that would have been funnier.\n\n34:29.520 --> 34:37.520\nStay tuned after the show for Harmontown After Hours, where I do a little punch-up on my...\n\n34:37.520 --> 34:39.520\non all the things I say.\n\n34:39.520 --> 34:44.520\nWhy don't we bring out Erin McGathy?\n\n34:44.520 --> 35:01.520\nYeah, you look very pretty and you're very jolly and you're dancing,\n\n35:01.520 --> 35:05.520\nbut in five minutes you're going to look like this.\n\n35:05.520 --> 35:07.520\nYou have a lot of layers on right now.\n\n35:07.520 --> 35:09.520\nI feel like a fucking rosemary potato.\n\n35:09.520 --> 35:12.520\nYou're dressed for like a brisk spring day.\n\n35:12.520 --> 35:18.520\nYeah, I gained some weight recently and it's an illusion.\n\n35:18.520 --> 35:22.520\nI'm a body magician.\n\n35:22.520 --> 35:30.520\nThe layers make you think, oh, she's so thin that she has to heat up.\n\n35:30.520 --> 35:33.520\nIt's called the Mary Kate diet is what I'm doing.\n\n35:33.520 --> 35:35.520\nShe's chilled to the bone.\n\n35:35.520 --> 35:37.520\nI feel very comfortable though.\n\n35:37.520 --> 35:39.520\nI did too when I first came up here.\n\n35:39.520 --> 35:41.520\nIt's heat, you know, it takes a while.\n\n35:41.520 --> 35:43.520\nIt takes a second.\n\n35:43.520

going to the drawing room tonight after the show as we usually do\n\n36:09.520 --> 36:16.520\nbecause I will be dead on the floor like a recently recaptured Scientologist\n\n36:16.520 --> 36:21.520\nthrown into their detox chamber.\n\n36:21.520 --> 36:26.520\nI'm sweating my life force out right now, so I probably won't be able to...\n\n36:26.520 --> 36:28.520\nDo you have a bottle of

--> 37:22.520\nSomeone's very friend has visited.\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:23.520\nI don't know.\n\n37:23.520 --> 37:24.520\nYeah, it's great.\n\n37:24.520 --> 37:25.520\nI love it.\n\n37:25.520 --> 37:26.520\nYeah.\n\n37:26.520 --> 37:28.520\nI don't have anything tonight.\n\n37:28.520 --> 37:31.520\nToday was a really fun day.\n\n37:31.520 --> 37:33.520\nIt was kind of a perfect day.\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:34.520\nWhat happened?\n\n37:34.520 --> 37:36.520\nTake us through your day, Aaron.\n\n37:36.520 --> 37:39.520\nWell, we were up.\n\n37:39.520 --> 37:43.520\nI forced you to play catchphrase last night, Jeff Davis.\n\n37:43.520 --> 37:46.520\nYeah, I was home at like 10.30 p.m.\n\n37:46.520 --> 37:51.520\nand then went to your guy's place at midnight, I think, and left there at 3.30.\n\n37:51.520 --> 37:54.520\nWe played catchphrase and we watched Who's Line.\n\n37:54.520 --> 38:01.520\nAnd also, we cried looking at YouTubes about people loving animals.\n\n38:01.520 --> 38:05.520\nIt was just another night at Dan and Aaron's.\n\n38:05.520 --> 38:11.520\nI remember we were watching Dogs Decoded, a Nova episode about dogs.\n\n38:11.520 --> 38:14.520\nI thought Russian ladies trying to make foxes angry and shit.\n\n38:14.520 --> 38:15.520\nIt was really ugly.\n\n38:15.520 --> 38:16.520\nYeah, I was excited.\n\n38:16.520 --> 38:23.520\nThey were showing this Russian lady who was trying to figure out if tameness in canines is genetic.\n\n38:23.520 --> 38:26.520\nOr if it's nurture.\n\n38:26.520 --> 38:34.520\nSo she had all these foxes and cages and they were breeding one half of them for tameness.\n\n38:34.520 --> 38:38.520\nTaking the tamest one from each litter and breeding them and so on and so forth.\n\n38:38.520 --> 38:41.520\nThe others, they were taking the aggressive ones and doing the same thing.\n\n38:41.520 --> 38:47.520\nSo they had two collections of foxes and they were learning an incredibly important thing about genetics.\n\n38:47.520 --> 38:50.520\nThey weren't really trying to impress the dogs or anything.\n\n38:50.520 --> 38:55.520\nBut Aaron just kept going like, why, get those dogs out of the cage.\n\n38:55.520 --> 38:58.520\nYou don't have to put dogs in cages.\n\n38:58.520 --> 38:59.520\nThey're foxes.\n\n38:59.520 --> 39:00.520\nIt's in Russia.\n\n39:00.520 --> 39:02.520\nIt's 1993.\n\n39:02.520 --> 39:06.520\nI was about to say, I don't really remember the documentary.\n\n39:06.520 --> 39:09.520\nGet that dog out of the cage.\n\n39:09.520 --> 39:11.520\nGet it out.\n\n39:11.520 --> 39:13.520\nIt's a rape culture.\n\n39:13.520 --> 39:17.520\nIt's just a male gaze.\n\n39:17.520 --> 39:21.520\nThere's another Negroni.\n\n39:21.520 --> 39:23.520\nNegroni is what I just said.\n\n39:23.520 --> 39:35.520\nYeah, so we were up, which is a cocktail made with vermouth, gin, and compare.\n\n39:35.520 --> 39:36.520\nSo it turns out.\n\n39:36.520 --> 39:38.520\nWe played three person catchphrase.\n\n39:38.520 --> 39:41.520\nWhat I'm leading to is that we woke up very hungover.\n\n39:41.520 --> 39:49.520\nWhen you left last night, Jeff, somehow you closed the gate so the gate came inside and was locked.\n\n39:49.520 --> 39:56.520\nAnd our friends, Kimber and Dave, who were staying in our guest room, Dave had to teach a class this morning\n\n39:56.520 --> 39:59.520\nand he couldn't get out and he had to jump the fence.\n\n39:59.520 --> 40:00.520\nI just closed it behind me.\n\n40:00.520 --> 40:01.520\nYeah, it's not your fault.\n\n40:01.520 --> 40:02.520\nIt's the shitty gate.\n\n40:02.520 --> 40:03.520\nIt's not your fault.\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:08.520\nI found the word secret button to get out and I closed it behind me.\n\n40:08.520 --> 40:11.520\nIt's not your fault at all because it's happened once before.\n\n40:11.520 --> 40:14.520\nIf it hadn't, then whew.\n\n40:14.520 --> 40:18.520\nWith a gate, it closed so hard that our friend couldn't get out of the gate.\n\n40:18.520 --> 40:24.520\nWhat we had to do is we had to take a credit card, actually used Dan's pot card.\n\n40:24.520 --> 40:27.520\nSo it was like, well, this could be fucked up, right?\n\n40:27.520 --> 40:32.520\nThey're not going to be like, sir, your pot card's not pristine.\n\n40:32.520 --> 40:36.520\nI don't think you're ready to handle this marijuana.\n\n40:36.520 --> 40:42.520\nIt's a prescription card for medicine I use for my anxiety.\n\n40:42.520 --> 40:46.520\nSo I think it being fucked up is more of a reason for you to get the medicine.\n\n40:46.520 --> 40:47.520\nYou're like, look what I did.\n\n40:47.520 --> 40:48.520\nI was so anxious.\n\n40:48.520 --> 40:53.520\nI tried to eat it.\n\n40:53.520 --> 41:00.520\nI got up at 11.30 because my friends couldn't leave the house and got them out.\n\n41:00.520 --> 41:05.520\nAnd then I started, I've been on a little baking cake.\n\n41:05.520 --> 41:16.520\nSomeone pointed out earlier how dangerous it is to put runts on cupcakes.\n\n41:16.520 --> 41:18.520\nIs everybody okay?\n\n41:18.520 --> 41:19.520\nRunts?\n\n41:19.520 --> 41:20.520\nYeah, runts.\n\n41:20.520 --> 41:26.520\nThere's a banana and other colored balls.\n\n41:26.520 --> 41:29.520\nThe world's biggest, hardest sprinkles.\n\n41:29.520 --> 41:32.520\nYeah, they're dangerous because they're not meant to be like sprinkles.\n\n41:32.520 --> 41:39.520\nMaybe you could choke or break your teeth, but it sounds like everybody's okay.\n\n41:39.520 --> 41:43.520\nDead men tell no tales.\n\n41:43.520 --> 41:44.520\nWe were hungover.\n\n41:44.520 --> 41:45.520\nIt was a late morning.\n\n41:45.520 --> 41:52.520\nIt was just very fun because I was baking and I was watching a family movie like I like to do.\n\n41:52.520 --> 41:55.520\nI watched Monsters vs. Aliens.\n\n41:55.520 --> 41:59.520\nVery great, very body positive.\n\n41:59.520 --> 42:00.520\nMade me feel really good.\n\n42:00.520 --> 42:02.520\nSomeone just said, what?\n\n42:02.520 --> 42:03.520\nWatch it.\n\n42:03.520 --> 42:04.520\nIt's body positive.\n\n42:04.520 --> 42:08.520\nYou just have to understand that if you're a giant, you're a monster.\n\n42:08.520 --> 42:11.520\nBut then you're like, no, I want to be a monster.\n\n42:11.520 --> 42:14.520\nRight, I want to be a monster.\n\n42:14.520 --> 42:16.520\nSeth Rogen laughs too many times.\n\n42:16.520 --> 42:18.520\nJust see it.\n\n42:18.520 --> 42:20.520\nIs that Amy Poehler in the lead role?\n\n42:20.520 --> 42:22.520\nNo, I think it's Reese.\n\n42:22.520 --> 42:23.520\nOh, okay.\n\n42:23.520 --> 42:26.520\nWitherspoon.\n\n42:26.520 --> 42:29.520\nThat's a crazy name.\n\n42:29.520 --> 42:32.520\nShe should own a media conglomerate.\n\n42:32.520 --> 42:35.520\nYeah, yeah, like Sumner Redstone or...\n\n42:35.520 --> 42:40.520\nReese Witherspoon acquired Warner Cable today.\n\n42:40.520 --> 42:47.520\nYeah, we've joked about how media conglomerate presidents always have like warlock names.\n\n42:47.520 --> 42:50.520\nSumner Redstone?\n\n42:50.520 --> 42:52.520\nJesus Christ, don't hurt me.\n\n42:52.520 --> 42:55.520\nDon't hurt my village.\n\n42:55.520 --> 42:58.520\nBlood River Nighttown?\n\n42:58.520 --> 43:02.520\nEven Rupert Murdoch's getting a little sail in me.\n\n43:02.520 --> 43:05.520\nHe's at the top of a coal tower, for sure.\n\n43:05.520 --> 43:06.520\nWho's the other one?\n\n43:06.520 --> 43:09.520\nYou don't write a script and the good guy's name is Rupert Murdoch.\n\n43:09.520 --> 43:10.520\nWho's the other one?\n\n43:10.520 --> 43:12.520\nThere's another one like Sumner Redstone.\n\n43:12.520 --> 43:14.520\nThat one's the sexiest.\n\n43:14.520 --> 43:15.520\nYeah, there's another one.\n\n43:15.520 --> 43:20.520\nThere's a third one that's also like Windwit Willowman.\n\n43:20.520 --> 43:22.520\nWell, that's a good system.\n\n43:22.520 --> 43:24.520\nWicker Spellcraft.\n\n43:24.520 --> 43:26.520\nWicker Spellcraft.\n\n43:26.520 --> 43:29.520\nSmooth, smooth moon.\n\n43:29.520 --> 43:31.520\nOh, hey everybody.\n\n43:31.520 --> 43:35.520\nWhy don't you let that be Spencer's theme and we'll bring him out.\n\n43:35.520 --> 43:37.520\nSpencer's theme!\n\n43:37.520 --> 43:41.520\nGood job, Spencer.\n\n43:48.520 --> 43:51.520\nSpencer bounced to the stage like a gazelle.\n\n43:51.520 --> 43:54.520\nIt's a real obstacle course, but yeah, I'm quirky.\n\n43:54.520 --> 43:58.520\nWhat are you doing?\n\n43:58.520 --> 44:03.520\nThe president?\n\n44:03.520 --> 44:08.520\nSpencer, take us through either a highlight or low light of your day today.\n\n44:08.520 --> 44:09.520\nOf my day?\n\n44:09.520 --> 44:10.520\nYeah.\n\n44:10.520 --> 44:11.520\nI don't know.\n\n44:11.520 --> 44:15.520\nI hung out with Abed this morning, real Abed for you guys.\n\n44:15.520 --> 44:16.520\nHighlight or low light?\n\n44:16.520 --> 44:17.520\nThat was the highlight.\n\n44:17.520 --> 44:19.520\nHe's a cool guy.\n\n44:19.520 --> 44:22.520\nSometimes he wakes up in the morning, so I text him.\n\n44:22.520 --> 44:24.520\nLet's go to Porto's bakery.\n\n44:24.520 --> 44:25.520\nAnd we do.\n\n44:25.520 --> 44:28.520\nOh god, does he die other days?\n\n44:28.520 --> 44:31.520\nSome days he doesn't wake up so early.\n\n44:31.520 --> 44:32.520\nOh, Aaron.\n\n44:32.520 --> 44:36.520\nI was woken up by Aaron, who clearly thought I might have been dead.\n\n44:36.520 --> 44:37.520\nShe woke me up.\n\n44:37.520 --> 44:38.520\nShe was like, Dan!\n\n44:38.520 --> 44:39.520\nAnd I was like, what?\n\n44:39.520 --> 44:40.520\nWhat?\n\n44:40.520 --> 44:43.520\nAnd she was like, oh.\n\n44:43.520 --> 44:46.520\nHe was very still.\n\n44:46.520 --> 44:49.520\nI'm just 41, that's all.\n\n44:49.520 --> 44:53.520\nYou're watching Duck It By, YouTube bits, and Dan and Aaron's place.\n\n44:53.520 --> 44:58.520\nAnd there's the thing where the guy reunites with the gorilla, and there's this guy that\n\n44:58.520 --> 45:01.520\ngets the whale free, and the whale starts breaching and putting on a display.\n\n45:01.520 --> 45:02.520\nSo we're all kind of tearing up.\n\n45:02.520 --> 45:03.520\nDan falls asleep, because I'm leaving.\n\n45:03.520 --> 45:04.520\nI'm going to bed.\n\n45:04.520 --> 45:05.520\nAnd then we start playing catchphrase.\n\n45:05.520 --> 45:10.520\nAnd at some point, Aaron says, I gotta go to the bathroom.\n\n45:10.520 --> 45:11.520\nThey're all right?\n\n45:11.520 --> 45:12.520\nAnd then she just crawls.\n\n45:12.520 --> 45:15.520\nAnd it's not like the bathroom's right there.\n\n45:15.520 --> 45:19.520\nShe has to leave a room, leave another room, and then go to a hallway.\n\n45:19.520 --> 45:21.520\nShe just crawled like a giant baby.\n\n45:21.520 --> 45:24.520\nI didn't bother to walk.\n\n45:24.520 --> 45:27.520\nI was very drunk at last week's Hammer Town, and spent a lot of this.\n\n45:27.520 --> 45:28.520\nHammer Town.\n\n45:28.520 --> 45:33.520\nIt's a podcast I do after this one.\n\n45:33.520 --> 45:38.520\nThat was a Freightian summer soft goddamnit.\n\n45:38.520 --> 45:40.520\nDid I really say Hammer Town?\n\n45:40.520 --> 45:41.520\nDid I say Hammer Town?\n\n45:41.520 --> 45:42.520\nI said Hammer Town.\n\n45:42.520 --> 45:43.520\nAll right.\n\n45:43.520 --> 45:45.520\nStop.\n\n45:45.520 --> 45:47.520\nHammer Town.\n\n45:47.520 --> 45:52.520\nI feel very ashamed of how wasted I was at last week's Hammer Town, because we had been\n\n45:52.520 --> 45:53.520\ndrinking all day.\n\n45:53.520 --> 45:56.520\nAnd then I do not remember crawling to the bathroom.\n\n45:56.520 --> 45:57.520\nI was having a blast.\n\n45:57.520 --> 45:59.520\nThere was a lot of hollering in the last Hammer Town.\n\n45:59.520 --> 46:00.520\nThere was lots of yelling.\n\n46:00.520 --> 46:02.520\nI got a little sloppy, yeah.\n\n46:02.520 --> 46:06.520\nI think I was a little nervous, Dana Carvey, and I maybe drank all too much.\n\n46:06.520 --> 46:09.520\nI was crying, really.\n\n46:09.520 --> 46:11.520\nYeah, it was a real mess.\n\n46:11.520 --> 46:14.520\nDid you have lunch?\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:15.520\nNo.\n\n46:15.520 --> 46:18.520\nIf I don't have lunch, I will literally cry.\n\n46:18.520 --> 46:20.520\nIt's really embarrassing.\n\n46:20.520 --> 46:22.520\nIf you don't eat lunch, you'll just start crying?\n\n46:22.520 --> 46:23.520\nYeah.\n\n46:23.520 --> 46:28.520\nI mean, obviously, I've never had this kind of burden, but I'd imagine it's a tiny bit\n\n46:28.520 --> 46:32.520\nwhat it's like to get PMS.\n\n46:32.520 --> 46:38.520\nJust in terms of like, I'll realize I'm crying, and I'll be like, why am I crying?\n\n46:38.520 --> 46:43.520\nOh, because it's three o'clock and I haven't had any Chinese food.\n\n46:43.520 --> 46:49.520\nI mean, it is a similar thing where like, when you have PMS, I mean, people experience\n\n46:49.520 --> 46:54.520\nPMS in different ways, but sometimes one will find themselves crying and be like, why am\n\n46:54.520 --> 46:56.520\nI such a, oh, it's this.\n\n46:56.520 --> 46:58.520\nYeah, it's just something physiologically.\n\n46:58.520 --> 46:59.520\nThe surge is coming.\n\n46:59.520 --> 47:03.520\nSpencer, next time you and I go for early morning Porto's Bakery, can I come along?\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:04.520\nSure, yeah.\n\n47:04.520 --> 47:05.520\nAre you up in the morning?\n\n47:05.520 --> 47:06.520\nYeah.\n\n47:06.520 --> 47:07.520\nYeah.\n\n47:07.520 --> 47:08.520\nWoo!\n\n47:08.520 --> 47:11.520\nI got some tweets.\n\n47:11.520 --> 47:17.520\nI know we have some pilgrims that have come from far and away to see Harvey Chan tonight.\n\n47:17.520 --> 47:19.520\nI think there's someone from Belgium here, isn't there?\n\n47:19.520 --> 47:20.520\nNo, is there really?\n\n47:20.520 --> 47:21.520\nRight over there.\n\n47:21.520 --> 47:22.520\nI see it.\n\n47:22.520 --> 47:23.520\nWow!\n\n47:23.520 --> 47:26.520\nWhy did someone else clap over there?\n\n47:26.520 --> 47:28.520\nMaybe they just love Belgium.\n\n47:28.520 --> 47:31.520\nBelgium has the best Christmas rituals.\n\n47:31.520 --> 47:33.520\nWhat's your name?\n\n47:33.520 --> 47:36.520\nIf you don't mind just asking, oh, where's the Belgian guy?\n\n47:36.520 --> 47:37.520\nYvonne.\n\n47:37.520 --> 47:38.520\nYvonne?\n\n47:38.520 --> 47:39.520\nYvonne.\n\n47:39.520 --> 47:40.520\nOh, shit.\n\n47:40.520 --> 47:41.520\nYvonne.\n\n47:41.520 --> 47:44.520\nOh, man, that's foreign.\n\n47:44.520 --> 47:47.520\nYvonne, are you shy?\n\n47:47.520 --> 47:51.520\nDo you want to come talk to us about Belgium at all?\n\n47:51.520 --> 47:52.520\nOkay.\n\n47:52.520 --> 47:53.520\nYvonne!\n\n47:53.520 --> 47:54.520\nYvonne!\n\n47:54.520 --> 47:55.520\nYvonne!\n\n47:55.520 --> 48:05.520\nSo it's a tiny country, nestled in the highlands of the Belgium area.\n\n48:05.520 --> 48:12.520\nDan, before Levi can fill you in, what do you honestly know about Belgium as a country?\n\n48:12.520 --> 48:13.520\nSmall?\n\n48:13.520 --> 48:14.520\nLandlocked?\n\n48:14.520 --> 48:15.520\nNo.\n\n48:15.520 --> 48:18.520\nAll right, that's it.\n\n48:18.520 --> 48:25.520\nTell us anything, Levi.\n\n48:25.520 --> 48:28.520\nWhat are you doing out here?\n\n48:28.520 --> 48:29.520\nBusiness trip?\n\n48:29.520 --> 48:30.520\nPleasure trip?\n\n48:30.520 --> 48:31.520\nRoof trip.\n\n48:31.520 --> 48:32.520\nJust a road trip?\n\n48:32.520 --> 48:33.520\nYeah.\n\n48:33.520 --> 48:38.520\nLevi, you could have flown.\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:42.520\nYou just came out to the North America to just drive around?\n\n48:42.520 --> 48:43.520\nYeah.\n\n48:43.520 --> 48:45.520\nWhere else are you going?\n\n48:45.520 --> 48:48.520\nYou know, after I'm going to Joshua Street Park.\n\n48:48.520 --> 48:49.520\nOh, cool.\n\n48:49.520 --> 48:50.520\nOh, yeah.\n\n48:50.520 --> 48:52.520\nAre you going to do some of those drugs?\n\n48:52.520 --> 48:54.520\nNo, no, no.\n\n48:54.520 --> 48:56.520\nI don't do drugs.\n\n48:56.520 --> 48:57.520\nAh.\n\n48:57.520 --> 49:00.520\nWell, it won't be as fun as you can get over here.\n\n49:00.520 --> 49:02.520\nIt's a desert.\n\n49:02.520 --> 49:07.520\nAnd it's kind of shitty.\n\n49:07.520 --> 49:10.520\nPeople go because no one wants to be there.\n\n49:10.520 --> 49:11.520\nIt's gorgeous out there.\n\n49:11.520 --> 49:12.520\nNo, it is.\n\n49:12.520 --> 49:13.520\nI actually live there.\n\n49:13.520 --> 49:14.520\nI'm sorry.\n\n49:14.520 --> 49:15.520\nIt's great.\n\n49:15.520 --> 49:16.520\nYou'll love it.\n\n49:16.520 --> 49:18.520\nBut you really should do drugs.\n\n49:18.520 --> 49:20.520\nAnd I'll make it better.\n\n49:20.520 --> 49:22.520\nHe's going to do drugs.\n\n49:22.520 --> 49:24.520\nHis mom's listening now.\n\n49:24.520 --> 49:25.520\nOkay.\n\n49:25.520 --> 49:26.520\nWhat was it?\n\n49:26.520 --> 49:27.520\nIs this your first stop?\n\n49:27.520 --> 49:28.520\nCalifornia?\n\n49:28.520 --> 49:30.520\nI went to San Francisco first.\n\n49:30.520 --> 49:31.520\nOh, nice.\n\n49:31.520 --> 49:32.520\nWe love San Francisco.\n\n49:32.520 --> 49:33.520\nWe do.\n\n49:33.520 --> 49:34.520\nYeah, me too.\n\n49:34.520 --> 49:35.520\nYeah.\n\n49:35.520 --> 49:40.520\nWhat was your favorite part of San Francisco?\n\n49:40.520 --> 49:45.520\nWell, not the hilly parts.\n\n49:45.520 --> 49:47.520\nI walked in.\n\n49:47.520 --> 49:49.520\nOh, you walked around.\n\n49:49.520 --> 49:52.520\nOh, is there a hill myth in Belgium?\n\n49:52.520 --> 49:54.520\nIt's pretty flat.\n\n49:54.520 --> 49:55.520\nOh, okay.\n\n49:55.520 --> 49:58.520\nNot used to it.\n\n49:58.520 --> 50:00.520\nWhat do you do in Belgium?\n\n50:00.520 --> 50:01.520\nAre you a student?\n\n50:01.520 --> 50:02.520\nYou look kind of young.\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:03.520\nI'm a baker.\n\n50:03.520 --> 50:04.520\nA baker.\n\n50:04.520 --> 50:05.520\nOh!\n\n50:05.520 --> 50:06.520\nYes!\n\n50:06.520 --> 50:07.520\nYes!\n\n50:07.520 --> 50:08.520\nYes!\n\n50:08.520 --> 50:09.520\nYes!\n\n50:09.520 --> 50:10.520\nYes!\n\n50:10.520 --> 50:11.520\nWhat do you make?\n\n50:11.520 --> 50:12.520\nReally?\n\n50:12.520 --> 50:13.520\nI mean, what do you...\n\n50:13.520 --> 50:18.520\nI mean, for your life?\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:19.520\nYeah.\n\n50:19.520 --> 50:20.520\nYeah.\n\n50:20.520 --> 50:21.520\nDo you wear a hat?\n\n50:21.520 --> 50:23.520\nMy hair just grew a little.\n\n50:23.520 --> 50:24.520\nA hat.\n\n50:24.520 --> 50:25.520\nOh, just a hair net?\n\n50:25.520 --> 50:26.520\nYeah.\n\n50:26.520 --> 50:27.520\nJust wear one of those hats.\n\n50:27.520 --> 50:31.520\nBut on school, we had some of those hats.\n\n50:31.520 --> 50:35.520\nOne of my favorite bakeries that I've ever been to is in Chicago, and it's Belgian.\n\n50:35.520 --> 50:36.520\nAnd they're amazing.\n\n50:36.520 --> 50:39.520\nIt's like the best pastry is the best coffee.\n\n50:39.520 --> 50:40.520\nIt's really, really wonderful.\n\n50:40.520 --> 50:41.520\nWhat's...\n\n50:41.520 --> 50:42.520\nOh, sorry.\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:43.520\nYou go.\n\n50:43.520 --> 50:44.520\nNo, I think we're going to ask the same question.\n\n50:44.520 --> 50:47.520\nWell, what's your favorite pastry?\n\n50:47.520 --> 50:48.520\nThat you make.\n\n50:48.520 --> 50:49.520\nLike, what's...\n\n50:49.520 --> 50:50.520\nYeah.\n\n50:50.520 --> 50:54.520\nRaspberry bavarois?\n\n50:54.520 --> 50:56.520\nWhat is bavarois?\n\n50:56.520 --> 51:00.520\nIt's a sort of mousse with...\n\n51:00.520 --> 51:04.520\nAnd a Lewis Carroll poem.\n\n51:04.520 --> 51:07.520\nWho wear the bavarois, my friend?\n\n51:07.520 --> 51:10.520\nYou'll gain 20 pounds.\n\n51:10.520 --> 51:13.520\nBoy, a baker from Belgium.\n\n51:13.520 --> 51:15.520\nWe're going to waste this opportunity.\n\n51:15.520 --> 51:16.520\nI know it.\n\n51:16.520 --> 51:20.520\nWhat do you think of American cuisine?\n\n51:20.520 --> 51:23.520\nI like it.\n\n51:23.520 --> 51:27.520\nI like burgers, hot dogs, pizza.\n\n51:27.520 --> 51:31.520\nPizza.\n\n51:31.520 --> 51:39.520\nWhat the podcast listeners don't know is that this guy is actually Werner Herzog.\n\n51:39.520 --> 51:45.520\nWerner Herzog is on stage pretending to be a Belgian baker.\n\n51:45.520 --> 51:47.520\nSo you listen to the podcast in Belgium?\n\n51:47.520 --> 51:48.520\nYeah.\n\n51:48.520 --> 51:49.520\nWhy?\n\n51:49.520 --> 51:51.520\nI mean, what...\n\n51:51.520 --> 51:55.520\nIt's very flattering that someone from a foreign country would be tuning in.\n\n51:55.520 --> 51:57.520\nI like communities.\n\n51:57.520 --> 52:00.520\nI start listening to some podcasts with you.\n\n52:00.520 --> 52:02.520\nYeah, community is really important.\n\n52:02.520 --> 52:05.520\nJust coming together as a group.\n\n52:05.520 --> 52:07.520\nUnderstanding each other.\n\n52:07.520 --> 52:09.520\nWe have a great community here.\n\n52:09.520 --> 52:13.520\nIt doesn't even mean that other thing anymore.\n\n52:13.520 --> 52:18.520\nIt's like how cheers stop meaning anything.\n\n52:18.520 --> 52:22.520\nI'm always astounded.\n\n52:22.520 --> 52:26.520\nI always thought, and everybody always thought when we were making the show early on,\n\n52:26.520 --> 52:32.520\nwell, this is definitely not going to be internationally accessible.\n\n52:32.520 --> 52:34.520\nBut I don't know.\n\n52:34.520 --> 52:35.520\nI guess it is.\n\n52:35.520 --> 52:36.520\nI don't have a question for you.\n\n52:36.520 --> 52:42.520\nI'm just so curious about a person born and raised in a foreign country like seeing community\n\n52:42.520 --> 52:45.520\nand going like, ah, that's great.\n\n52:45.520 --> 52:48.520\nI'm so astounded that that's possible.\n\n52:48.520 --> 52:55.520\nI heard they love it in China for a much admittedly Chinese person.\n\n52:55.520 --> 53:00.520\nThere's called communism.\n\n53:00.520 --> 53:02.520\nThat's what I really chalked it up to.\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:03.520\nThey said it's very...\n\n53:03.520 --> 53:04.520\nPeople really like it in China.\n\n53:04.520 --> 53:07.520\nIt's subtitled and it's on this website that's like Chinese Hulu.\n\n53:07.520 --> 53:08.520\nThat's nice.\n\n53:08.520 --> 53:09.520\nI think we talked about this already.\n\n53:09.520 --> 53:13.520\nBecause I assumed when she said that I was like, oh, I bet it's because it's such a...\n\n53:13.520 --> 53:15.520\nYeah, it's about...\n\n53:15.520 --> 53:16.520\nIt's a collective.\n\n53:16.520 --> 53:17.520\nYeah.\n\n53:17.520 --> 53:24.520\nLevi, what would you want Americans or whomever who's listening to this to know about Belgian people?\n\n53:24.520 --> 53:26.520\nAnd are you a...\n\n53:26.520 --> 53:27.520\nThis could sound like a making a joke.\n\n53:27.520 --> 53:29.520\nAre you a bell?\n\n53:29.520 --> 53:30.520\nYou're bell...\n\n53:30.520 --> 53:31.520\nLike what?\n\n53:31.520 --> 53:32.520\nI'm a...\n\n53:32.520 --> 53:33.520\nSomeone said, oh man.\n\n53:33.520 --> 53:35.520\nBut you just say Belgian.\n\n53:35.520 --> 53:37.520\nYou don't say like Turk or...\n\n53:37.520 --> 53:40.520\nIt's just Belgian in English.\n\n53:40.520 --> 53:43.520\nOkay, what are the Flemish?\n\n53:43.520 --> 53:46.520\nTell me about the Flemish.\n\n53:46.520 --> 53:49.520\nSomething on the Flemish.\n\n53:49.520 --> 53:51.520\nWe are very...\n\n53:51.520 --> 53:53.520\nAs a folk.\n\n53:53.520 --> 53:55.520\nNot outgoing.\n\n53:55.520 --> 53:57.520\nAre you Flemish?\n\n53:57.520 --> 53:58.520\nYeah, Flemish.\n\n53:58.520 --> 53:59.520\nWhat is Flemish?\n\n53:59.520 --> 54:01.520\nIs that part of being a Belgian or not?\n\n54:01.520 --> 54:06.520\nYeah, we have three parts of a Belgian technically.\n\n54:06.520 --> 54:09.520\nFlauners where we speak Flemish.\n\n54:09.520 --> 54:14.520\nWe're...\n\n54:14.520 --> 54:18.520\nWe'll be right back.\n\n54:18.520 --> 54:20.520\nAnd we're back.\n\n54:20.520 --> 54:24.520\nThe new Infinity Essex series.\n\n54:24.520 --> 54:27.520\nGold-bond powder.\n\n54:27.520 --> 54:29.520\nOh, so in Flanders they speak Flemish.\n\n54:29.520 --> 54:38.520\nYeah, Daniel, the French part but I don't really know what the English term for that is.\n\n54:38.520 --> 54:39.520\nWhoa.\n\n54:39.520 --> 54:42.520\nYour dad's here.\n\n54:42.520 --> 54:44.520\nCan you say that again, sir?\n\n54:44.520 --> 54:47.520\nWankers.\n\n54:47.520 --> 54:49.520\nWankers.\n\n54:49.520 --> 54:54.520\nWe have a guy from Suffolk back there.\n\n54:54.520 --> 54:57.520\nA guy from a Guy Ritchie movie.\n\n54:57.520 --> 54:59.520\nYou fucking Belgian toilet.\n\n54:59.520 --> 55:01.520\nI'll tell you what you call him.\n\n55:01.520 --> 55:04.520\nYou know you're a fucking cunt.\n\n55:04.520 --> 55:09.520\nWe're back, make your raspberry hubo cookies.\n\n55:09.520 --> 55:18.520\nAnd wait till the Germans fucking evade you again, you twat.\n\n55:18.520 --> 55:23.520\nYou fucking twat.\n\n55:23.520 --> 55:28.520\nThey don't call them wankers.\n\n55:28.520 --> 55:31.520\nWhere are you from back there, fucking Southampton?\n\n55:31.520 --> 55:32.520\nWhat is it?\n\n55:32.520 --> 55:33.520\nLondon.\n\n55:33.520 --> 55:37.520\nYou're just a shadow monster from our vantage point.\n\n55:37.520 --> 55:41.520\nDon't stab me later.\n\n55:41.520 --> 55:46.520\nWait, do people in London really feel competitive against people in Belgium?\n\n55:46.520 --> 55:48.520\nNo, I think it was reacting to the French, right?\n\n55:48.520 --> 55:50.520\nThe French part, what do they call them, right?\n\n55:50.520 --> 55:55.520\nIs that just like your innate hatred of the French or a French adjacent?\n\n55:55.520 --> 55:57.520\nNo, I'm just very jealous.\n\n55:57.520 --> 55:58.520\nOh, yeah?\n\n55:58.520 --> 55:59.520\nThat's nice.\n\n55:59.520 --> 56:03.520\nThey call them

of Italian descent?\n\n56:46.520 --> 56:49.520\nMy parents are both Italian, but I was born in Canada,\n\n56:49.520 --> 56:52.520\nthen I lived in the UK for 10, 15 years.\n\n56:52.520 --> 56:53.520\nThis guy's fucking good looking.\n\n56:53.520 --> 56:54.520\nLook at this guy.\n\n56:54.520 --> 56:57.520\nYou're like a modeled, are you like an international soccer star?\n\n56:57.520 -->

wankers?\n\n57:42.040 --> 57:43.440\nWhich means masturbators.\n\n57:43.440 --> 57:45.800\nWhy did you scream out?\n\n57:45.800 --> 57:47.520\nA wanker is somebody who masturbates\n\n57:47.520 --> 57:49.000\nand doesn't know they're doing it, right?\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:52.320\nI thought it just meant penis or what?\n\n57:52.320 --> 57:53.320\nOr they know they're doing it.\n\n57:53.320 --> 57:55.160\nI just mean like a wanker is somebody who's just\n\n57:55.160 --> 57:56.720\nan animal that's like dirt stuff all the time.\n\n57:56.720 --> 58:00.040\nNo, no, in the UK, it's just like dick, I guess, here.\n\n58:00.040 --> 58:01.320\nNo, I know what it means.\n\n58:01.320 --> 58:02.000\nYeah.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:02.640\nBut I just mean.\n\n58:02.640 --> 58:06.040\nI mean, I do masturbate, but I do know that one.\n\n58:06.040 --> 58:07.240\nHow frequently?\n\n58:07.240 --> 58:08.360\nOh, it really depends.\n\n58:08.360 --> 58:10.400\nI'm actually traveling with two guys over there,\n\n58:10.400 --> 58:11.320\nso it's a bit awkward.\n\n58:11.320 --> 58:14.160\nI was like, how frequently do you masturbate?\n\n58:14.160 --> 58:18.040\nI tried today.\n\n58:18.040 --> 58:19.320\nI need to pull back.\n\n58:19.320 --> 58:20.600\nNo, I know.\n\n58:20.600 --> 58:23.560\nLike, you know, if I'm doing coursework, then yeah, a lot.\n\n58:23.560 --> 58:26.880\nI do a lot of programming when I graduated, so.\n\n58:26.880 --> 58:29.120\nSo wait, does that mean a lot of masturbation?\n\n58:29.120 --> 58:29.720\nAre you kidding?\n\n58:29.720 --> 58:32.320\nIf you're programming for 15 hours straight, you know.\n\n58:32.320 --> 58:33.160\nNo, I understand.\n\n58:33.160 --> 58:33.640\nI'm sorry.\n\n58:33.640 --> 58:34.840\nYou watch a few episodes of Community,\n\n58:34.840 --> 58:36.440\nyou see Alison Brie, and you think, well.\n\n58:36.440 --> 58:38.920\nOh, OK.\n\n58:38.920 --> 58:40.720\nLet's bring out our next guest, Alison Brie.\n\n58:40.720 --> 58:46.320\nEverybody get your dicks out, Alison Brie.\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:53.000\nLevi, who's your favorite community character?\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.720\nIs that a dumb question?\n\n58:55.720 --> 58:56.440\nAbbot.\n\n58:56.440 --> 58:58.320\nAbbot, yeah.\n\n58:58.320 --> 58:59.800\nIt's sort of relatable.\n\n58:59.800 --> 59:01.960\nYeah, relatable.\n\n59:01.960 --> 59:05.440\nYou think you might be on the spectrum a little bit?\n\n59:05.440 --> 59:11.640\nI mean, that's why, I mean, you're not half Arabic.\n\n59:11.640 --> 59:14.880\nWho's actually played by a half Indian.\n\n59:14.880 --> 59:16.840\nBut yeah, you think maybe you're a little.\n\n59:16.840 --> 59:18.600\nYeah, a bit, I think.\n\n59:18.600 --> 59:19.880\nYeah.\n\n59:19.880 --> 59:22.800\nLike on the playground, did anybody ever come up\n\n59:22.800 --> 59:25.920\nto you and go, what are you doing?\n\n59:25.920 --> 59:29.920\nAnd then you look down and like your pants are down.\n\n59:29.920 --> 59:31.920\nOr you just have like a booger on your shirt,\n\n59:31.920 --> 59:34.040\nor like, or you just, I don't know,\n\n59:34.040 --> 59:35.080\nyou're just doing something wrong,\n\n59:35.080 --> 59:37.520\nand you didn't know it was wrong until like everyone\n\n59:37.520 --> 59:41.320\nin a circle around you going, what are you doing?\n\n59:41.320 --> 59:45.440\nYou have a lot of memories like that.\n\n59:45.440 --> 59:47.760\nHypothetically, this is.\n\n59:47.760 --> 59:48.600\nDon't stop, Dan.\n\n59:48.600 --> 59:51.840\nJust go through.\n\n59:51.840 --> 59:56.600\nThey're going to Sarah walk up and.\n\n59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.320\nSo yeah, you put that into your pastry, like.\n\n01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.000\nIt's your, it's your.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.240\nThat's all the croissants, it's layers of pain.\n\n01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.240\nIs cooking a way of, do you put emotions into your cooking?\n\n01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.680\nIs there, are you connecting with people when you're cooking?\n\n01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.800\nDo you think of it as a, or is it like a trade?\n\n01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.680\nDid your dad hand it down to you?\n\n01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.160\nNo, I actually started doing it because I didn't sleep well,\n\n01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.600\nso I decided to come and bake it.\n\n01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.680\nSo you started in your own kitchen and then you.\n\n01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.560\nNot really, I started going to school for it.\n\n01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.960\nSo you couldn't, you couldn't sleep so you got up\n\n01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.760\nand you enrolled in a school.\n\n01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.120\nYou probably baked a couple of things at home first.\n\n01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.400\nYou probably have to bring those in when you apply, right?\n\n01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.160\nThere's a muffin I made, it's a crepe,\n\n01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:00.400\ngot kind of cold on the way over.\n\n01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.520\nWhen you go to a school, when you're 12,\n\n01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.560\nand then you have a trimester, you can try for baker,\n\n01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.600\nfor, with meat, I don't know, but sure, yeah.\n\n01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.040\nAnd for a chef.\n\n01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.600\nSo in your school system, it's more trade-oriented, right?\n\n01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.880\nLike it's not so much like funneling people into.\n\n01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.880\nYou have three courses.\n\n01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.560\nFlanders.\n\n01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.680\nWankers.\n\n01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.000\nAnd wankers.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.640\nIndian chief.\n\n01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.440\nCandlestick makers.\n\n01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:46.080\nYou have the more traditional languages and stuff\n\n01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.960\nlike that, and then the more practical, like jobs,\n\n01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.400\nlike bakers, clothes makers, and stuff like that,\n\n01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.640\nand art school.\n\n01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.880\nHow's the unemployment there?\n\n01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.480\nIs everybody going to have a job?\n\n01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.480\nMost people, yeah.\n\n01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.720\nNot many homeless people.\n\n01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.880\nThat's nice.\n\n01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.480\nPietro.\n\n01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.840\nPietro, you were talking about programming,\n\n01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.440\nso you're a computer?\n\n01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.120\nNo, I did mechanical engineering.\n\n01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.960\nI just graduated in July.\n\n01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960\nCongratulations.\n\n01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.240\nDid you live here in LA, Pietro?\n\n01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240\nNo.\n\n01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.760\nActually, I'm technically homeless.\n\n01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.520\nWe got kicked out of a hostel because we\n\n01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.480\nbooked the wrong nights.\n\n01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.680\nSo we were actually going to sleep on our own.\n\n01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.760\nYou're visiting from London?\n\n01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.840\nYeah, we drove.\n\n01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.200\nSo we basically went to San Francisco first,\n\n01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.720\nand then we went to sleep.\n\n01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.880\nLike him, yeah.\n\n01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.200\nI'm amazed we didn't meet.\n\n01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.480\nWhen did you think of the hills?\n\n01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:41.880\nThe hills.\n\n01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.200\nI went to, I started in Bristol, so I was used to hills.\n\n01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.040\nIt's very heavy.\n\n01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.760\nFuckin' Bristol.\n\n01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.360\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.280\nFuckin' Bristol.\n\n01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.080\nYou know what they say about Bristol?\n\n01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.720\nFull of cuts.\n\n01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.040\nIf you don't like walkin' on a level surface,\n\n01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040\nwait five minutes.\n\n01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.600\nIt'll change.\n\n01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.440\nIt's the hilliest fucking burrow of the whole Queen's realm.\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.040\nIsn't Bristol cockney ramming flame for titties?\n\n01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.600\nBristol's city titties, right?\n\n01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:18.920\nIt is.\n\n01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:22.240\nIt's cockney ramming flame for boobs.\n\n01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.760\nI'm going to teach you something about London, my friends.\n\n01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.560\nYou see it, you're like, oh, look, I know it's Bristol's.\n\n01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.480\nYou never heard that before?\n\n01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.280\nNo, I haven't.\n\n01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:30.920\nAre you starting again?\n\n01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.640\nI think we're more reserved, though, than in the US.\n\n01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.960\nNo, I learned this from a friend who's from London.\n\n01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.440\nReally?\n\n01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.200\nYeah, it's cockney ramming flame.\n\n01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:38.600\nI didn't.\n\n01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.080\nI know.\n\n01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.120\nI'm a privately educated guy.\n\n01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.680\nOh, well, Lonnie.\n\n01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.720\nWorld's fanciest homeless guy.\n\n01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.280\nIn your private education, did they teach you\n\n01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.320\nto scream wanker from the back?\n\n01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.560\nWas that a day where you came to class with your little\n\n01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.200\nmessenger bag?\n\n01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.160\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.880\nMy monocle has a chip on it, so.\n\n01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.960\nNo, I got it.\n\n01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.400\nThat sounds like bullying.\n\n01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.840\nHe wasn't bragging.\n\n01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.640\nHe was saying, no, I've never heard that phrase.\n\n01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.520\nHe was saying he was private.\n\n01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.440\nHe's a fancy person.\n\n01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.560\nHe was explaining why.\n\n01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.200\nHe wasn't like, he wasn't.\n\n01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.040\nHe yelled wanker from the back of the room.\n\n01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.120\nHe's a hooligan.\n\n01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.080\nHe's a London hooligan.\n\n01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.800\nYou guys said, aren't titties called Bristol's?\n\n01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.640\nAnd he said, I don't think so.\n\n01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.920\nAnd you're like, I think they're called titties, Bristol's.\n\n01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.440\nAnd he's like, I'd never heard that.\n\n01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.680\nAnd he's like, but in London.\n\n01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.240\nAnd he's like, well, I'm fucking posh.\n\n01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.360\nBut he's homeless.\n\n01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.760\nBut you have enough money to fly abroad and cruise about.\n\n01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.480\nAnd you've graduated from a nice degree, probably.\n\n01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.240\nYeah, no.\n\n01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.160\nWhat university did you go to?\n\n01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160\nOxford.\n\n01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:51.680\nI wish.\n\n01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.440\nNo, my friend did.\n\n01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.200\nI went to Bristol.\n\n01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.040\nI went to my internship.\n\n01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.720\nThere's another one.\n\n01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.880\nDid you get double first to work at the college?\n\n01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.120\nNo, no, I didn't.\n\n01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.920\nI parted way too much.\n\n01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.480\nWhat did you read?\n\n01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.960\nWell, I'm a mechanical engineering.\n\n01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.440\nReally?\n\n01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.960\nI did my main research which was in ultrasonic fluid\n\n01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.200\nlevitation.\n\n01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.800\nSo I levitated in.\n\n01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.880\nFluid levitation?\n\n01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.760\nThat sounds like code for a wanking.\n\n01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.240\nIn a swimming pool.\n\n01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.640\nJericho's in a swimming pool.\n\n01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.120\nWho levitated some fluid in the hot tub?\n\n01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:25.800\nThat's just fancy.\n\n01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.560\nI'm studying.\n\n01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.120\nI'm studying.\n\n01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.680\nI'm studying.\n\n01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.120\nDon't tell me what tits are called.\n\n01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.920\nWhat is fluid levitation?\n\n01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.520\nYou just use levitate particles of fluid.\n\n01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520\nYou just keep going.\n\n01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.040\nIn the air.\n\n01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.200\nSo you create, set up a three-dimensional static.\n\n01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.440\nSo magnetics are for what?\n\n01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.480\nMagnetic fields or what?\n\n01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:45.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.640\nThis is done entirely using air and vibrations.\n\n01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.240\nYou just vibrate air.\n\n01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.680\nSpencer, do you know about this?\n\n01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.040\nWell, it sounds like, I mean, if you apply,\n\n01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.680\nis it like a certain frequency?\n\n01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.560\nIt's like a wether state.\n\n01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.320\nYeah, so you set up a, you call them like acoustic horns\n\n01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.600\nor an ungevian horn.\n\n01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.000\nYou put some piezoelectric elements behind it.\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.760\nYou apply an AC current to add it.\n\n01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.600\nAnd then those vibrate because obviously piezoelectric\n\n01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.320\ngovernments change size of kind.\n\n01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.080\nHe knows, he knows.\n\n01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.760\nAnd then that sets up a standing wave,\n\n01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.440\nwhich then you have nodes where you can put droplets in.\n\n01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.960\nWell, speaking of which, do you like n-dubs?\n\n01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.320\nOh, I've heard of him.\n\n01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.640\nNo, no, not really.\n\n01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.040\nI'm more of a dead mouse fan.\n\n01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.000\nYeah, dead mouse fan.\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.840\nHow do you feel about the chabs?\n\n01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.040\nThe chabs.\n\n01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.120\nWhat the hell are the chabs?\n\n01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.120\nThe chabs.\n\n01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.720\nThere's a feedback loop happening right now.\n\n01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.720\nI don't have an accent.\n\n01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.160\nI'm about to levitate some fluids over here.\n\n01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.120\nWhen Spencer said n-dubs, I genuinely\n\n01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:46.640\nthought he was doing slang for the N-W-O-A-C-P.\n\n01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.720\nI mean, they've really been slipping.\n\n01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.800\nYeah.\n\n01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.120\nI saw a picture on the internet.\n\n01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.480\nI'm sure this is not related at all.\n\n01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.560\nI thought it was somewhere in Denmark or something\n\n01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.200\nwhere some scientist had created a cloud in the middle\n\n01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.920\nof a room.\n\n01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.360\nIt looked like a regular cloud.\n\n01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.920\nYeah, yeah, I saw it.\n\n01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.560\nSo was that you?\n\n01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.520\nI was just wondering if that had to do with fluid limitation.\n\n01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.040\nYeah, it was my spare time.\n\n01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:14.800\nThat's interesting.\n\n01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.160\nI mean, what do you now that you have this very specific\n\n01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.280\nknowledge, what kind of job are you looking to?\n\n01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.680\nI actually already got a job with Toshiba in the UK.\n\n01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.320\nSo I'll be doing research into futuristic city design, which\n\n01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.640\nsounds a bit weird.\n\n01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.760\nWhy is Toshiba going to be designing cities?\n\n01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:39.680\nToshiba has the wherewithal to design a city.\n\n01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.680\nWhat do you know?\n\n01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.280\nYeah.\n\n01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.680\nOld Detroit has a cancer.\n\n01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.760\nCancer is called crime.\n\n01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.280\nToshiba City will be enforced by a new kind of law\n\n01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.440\nenforcement.\n\n01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.560\nLadies and gentlemen, the fluid levitator 209.\n\n01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.920\nPut your gloves down, wankers.\n\n01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.000\nYou have 10 seconds before I come on you.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nDumb.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.480\nThat's dumb.\n\n01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.920\nThat's stupid.\n\n01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.440\nWell, like, five.\n\n01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.520\nI think that we have a really good lineup for D&D tonight.\n\n01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.320\nI feel like this is like.\n\n01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.440\nI don't know, but well, don't spring that out, Spencer.\n\n01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.080\nHow many characters do you have?\n\n01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.480\nCamille's not here.\n\n01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.360\nYeah, so I guess one, right?\n\n01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.680\nCamille.\n\n01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.840\nSo you say we have to choose between.\n\n01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.000\nI'm not saying that.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.960\nI guess Jeff's saying that.\n\n01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.120\nRight, that's a thing.\n\n01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.440\nLeave I have a question, because you brought up the Danish.\n\n01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.280\nWhy is a Danish called the Danish?\n\n01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.320\nDo you call it that?\n\n01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.880\nWhat do you call a Danish?\n\n01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.720\nThey call it the here.\n\n01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.000\nA Belgian.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.880\nThe homeland.\n\n01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.800\nWe call it Puerto Kuchen, which basically is\n\n01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.720\na bit better, Puerto Kuchen.\n\n01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.440\nButer Kuchen.\n\n01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.480\nButer Kuchen.\n\n01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.120\nLike a butter Kuchen.\n\n01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.080\nButter Kuchen.\n\n01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.240\nKuchen with butter.\n\n01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.680\nRight, it's a bit better because of all the layers of butter.\n\n01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.600\nYeah, but a croissant is also layers of butter, right?\n\n01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.520\nA lot of pastries have layers of sort of butter Kuchen.\n\n01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.040\nThat's all from the same dough.\n\n01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.120\nYeah, what kind of alternating current would you\n\n01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.600\nneed to apply to layers of butter to make it?\n\n01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.720\nThere's got to be a reason why this is happening.\n\n01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.440\nCan we make the world's best croissant here tonight?\n\n01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.920\nAnd it's like floating in the air.\n\n01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.600\nIt's just like croissant vapor that you walk into.\n\n01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.400\nAnd you get a little bit of an electric shock,\n\n01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.000\nbut you're like, whoa, butter Kuchen.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.360\nFirst, Pietro would have to overcome\n\n01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.360\nhis abiding hatred of the Belgians.\n\n01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.640\nI thought it was directed at the French, no?\n\n01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.040\nI thought that was the joke.\n\n01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.440\nI think we just have to go.\n\n01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.040\nYeah, sorry.\n\n01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:48.680\nYeah, thank you.\n\n01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.640\nWe never have any French people come to Harmontown.\n\n01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.400\nIt's good.\n\n01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.920\nThey're afraid to speak up.\n\n01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.200\nWhat other countries are here?\n\n01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.000\nMoi?\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nOi!\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nWell, we know where he's from.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nFor us, we.\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.640\nYou can't.\n\n01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.160\nI thought I heard people wooing for Canada.\n\n01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.480\nAre you guys visiting from Canada?\n\n01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.560\nWe live here now.\n\n01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.040\nOK.\n\n01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.200\nOh, you guys are.\n\n01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:14.880\nSorry.\n\n01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.720\nYou guys are so nice.\n\n01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.560\nIt's a melting pot.\n\n01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.440\nYou can't get out.\n\n01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.600\nYou don't get to retain any.\n\n01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.120\nLevi, are you planning on going back home and spending\n\n01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.840\nyour life in Belgium?\n\n01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.640\nOr would you rather, would you like to live here, maybe?\n\n01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.360\nJeff's looking for a roommate.\n\n01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.240\nNo, I'm going back home.\n\n01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.240\nSorry, Jeff.\n\n01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.320\nWhat if he moved in with Jeff?\n\n01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.840\nOr Jeff said that he moved in with him,\n\n01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.760\nbut he was a prisoner because of his life.\n\n01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.760\nAnd Jeff just wanted his cooking.\n\n01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.160\nAnd we'd just come over and Levi'd be like, hi, everybody.\n\n01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.200\nAnd I had this like, like, scared look on his face.\n\n01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.880\nAnd Jeff was like, no, he likes it here.\n\n01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.760\nCan't you imagine a world where Jeff's like, yeah,\n\n01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.600\nLevi's moving in.\n\n01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.720\nAnd you know, in Belgium, they do that.\n\n01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.040\nLike, Jeff starts wearing different ties\n\n01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.640\nand is teaching us how to do, like, Belgian cooking.\n\n01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.880\nAnd he just can't stop talking about Belgium.\n\n01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.520\nAnd also, you go to Belgium, and then they\n\n01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.760\nthank you for your innovations on there.\n\n01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.520\nIt's a nice world.\n\n01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.240\nIt's a compliment.\n\n01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:14.720\nIt's fine.\n\n01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.400\nPietro, you're going to go back to London?\n\n01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.840\nYou want to live in England most of your life?\n\n01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.920\nYeah, I think so.\n\n01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.320\nSorry.\n\n01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:28.200\nWell, when Toshiba makes Toshiba City,\n\n01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.600\nwhere is that city going to be?\n\n01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.600\nWhat is it called currently?\n\n01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.880\nYeah, it's a twin sea, really.\n\n01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.400\nSo yeah.\n\n01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.560\nIs it an idea?\n\n01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.680\nOr is it a will?\n\n01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.920\nThey're really into, I mean, I guess this is California,\n\n01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.240\nisn't it?\n\n01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.960\nSo they're really into, like, energy, smart energy systems.\n\n01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.960\nSo let's say it's really sunny in Los Angeles,\n\n01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.080\nbut it's pouring with rain in San Francisco.\n\n01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.400\nAnd the soil of Hanzabra, could you divert energy efficiently\n\n01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.200\nto San Francisco?\n\n01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.000\nYeah, I think about that.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.720\nToshiba's going to build a city that's going to steal weather?\n\n01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.720\nThat's what I heard.\n\n01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.200\nIt's raining in San Francisco.\n\n01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.120\nIt should be over here.\n\n01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.360\nThe sun's out.\n\n01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.440\nOur rain was stolen by a Japanese skyscraper.\n\n01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440\nToshiba.\n\n01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.280\nToshiba's like the villain from Rainbow Brights.\n\n01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.760\nIt's like Mr. Burns on The Simpsons.\n\n01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.680\nGet it.\n\n01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.800\nPietro, are you hard at work?\n\n01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.480\nAnd the rain thief?\n\n01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.480\n2,000?\n\n01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.840\nI was trying to do it, Mr. Burns.\n\n01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.280\nIt didn't work out.\n\n01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.520\nIt sounded like you've heard of Herzog.\n\n01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.080\nI thought to myself, as I watched the recent harm\n\n01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:47.920\nin town that things were decrepit, almost painful.\n\n01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.400\nI don't know.\n\n01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.120\nSo what do we do?\n\n01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.360\nWe got an extra person up here to leave.\n\n01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.440\nI play a unicorn.\n\n01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.440\nNo, I should just go.\n\n01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.720\nI feel like I really interrupted.\n\n01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.080\nSomething rather beautiful here.\n\n01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.200\nBut the crowd's falling in love with you, Pietro.\n\n01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.280\nYeah, you're just doing that.\n\n01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.040\nThe hearts and minds.\n\n01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.600\nHe's just doing that Downton Abbey,\n\n01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.160\nlike upper class, like humility thing.\n\n01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.200\nI've been given so much.\n\n01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.960\nPietro, Lady Mary would love you to stay.\n\n01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.560\nI know you need it, Mary, when I do.\n\n01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.360\nI was a privately schooled.\n\n01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.760\nI don't want to overstay my welcome.\n\n01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.600\nThis is your show.\n\n01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.600\nNo, you haven't.\n\n01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.600\nNo, you're both great.\n\n01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.440\nYou're both lovely.\n\n01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.880\nIt's an international Harmontown.\n\n01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.440\nWe're going to find something for Levi to do\n\n01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.480\nin the middle of the game.\n\n01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.600\nIt's going to be an amazing non-player character\n\n01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.880\nthat Spencer comes up with.\n\n01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.560\nMaybe he could be your kind of laconic, like Avengers\n\n01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.560\nand kind of a like a.\n\n01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.480\nOh, he could be a Avenger.\n\n01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.400\nYeah, OK.\n\n01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.000\nI like that.\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.520\nNailed it.\n\n01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.520\nAll right.\n\n01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.760\nAre you familiar with Avengers?\n\n01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.240\nYeah.\n\n01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.560\nAll right, well, really, all right.\n\n01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.280\nWell, he gets out the character sheets.\n\n01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.520\nSo you're watching community, which surprises me.\n\n01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.560\nWhen people in non-English speaking countries\n\n01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.520\nare watching community and going, like, I get it.\n\n01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.400\nThat's the funny joke about Pokemon.\n\n01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.360\nBut the, because that's American.\n\n01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.560\nAnd so's Toshiba.\n\n01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.600\nBut then you're listening to Harmontown.\n\n01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.200\nI mean, what, I guess I'm putting you on the spot.\n\n01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.880\nI'm like some dumb person at a party going, like,\n\n01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.000\nwhy do you like me?\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.080\nI'm just wondering, like, when you're listening to,\n\n01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.080\nare you, oh, I know it's because you're baking.\n\n01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.440\nSo you're like, you know, you want to listen to just,\n\n01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.680\nlike, white noise.\n\n01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.320\nNo, it just, it interests me.\n\n01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:43.640\nLike, I also listened to the Nerdist writer's panel.\n\n01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.280\nLike, all that stuff behind TV, and I like that.\n\n01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.760\nYou like pop culture and stuff.\n\n01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.720\nYeah, stuff like that.\n\n01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.880\nWhat do you think about that acre?\n\n01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.560\nThat acre, Ben Acre.\n\n01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.440\nDo you like better acre or blacker?\n\n01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.760\nThis guy doesn't even listen to the podcast.\n\n01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.920\nBlacker, I guess.\n\n01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.920\nOK.\n\n01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.000\nBlacker, because he's blacker.\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.200\nBlacker's better.\n\n01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.080\nThank you guys for being here.\n\n01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.600\nAll right, can we just, can we hand out the character sheets?\n\n01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.560\nLike, you can do whatever you want, man.\n\n01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.520\nPass them down.\n\n01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.760\nSo I guess, Pietro, you're going to play Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.240\nAre you familiar with this?\n\n01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.840\nI heard one or two podcasts.\n\n01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.840\nSo you're a thief, you're a rogue.\n\n01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.040\nOh, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.520\nYou're a dashing British Italian fluid\n\n01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.520\nlevitating rogue.\n\n01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.200\nThat depends on Pietro, I think.\n\n01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.560\nAnd what, wait, this must be Jeff's.\n\n01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.640\nGet that all the way down to Jeff.\n\n01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.240\nAnd then Levi, you're just playing my hawk of hunger.\n\n01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.240\nHe doesn't have a sheet.\n\n01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.920\nSpencer, you good to go?\n\n01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.080\nWait.\n\n01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.320\nOh, this is Aaron.\n\n01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.640\nThere we go.\n\n01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.440\nOK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.\n\n01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:14.080\nLast time on Harmontown, our gang was under attack.\n\n01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.040\nAfter escaping a black dragon and narrowly\n\n01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.120\ndodging a crashing airship, our heroes headed out\n\n01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.440\nof the purple canyons and found themselves on the road\n\n01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.880\nto Rosebook with a robot baby named Lodgy.\n\n01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.600\nRosebook was a quaint little town at the outskirts\n\n01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.640\nof the purple mountains, less than a mile away.\n\n01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.280\nBut as the gang drew closer, they saw a horse-drawn carriage\n\n01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.960\nunder attack by orcish marauders.\n\n01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.920\nThe gang leapt into action, all except Sharpie,\n\n01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.440\nwho was so busy masturbating that he didn't even\n\n01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.960\nrealize the deadly melee taking place all around him.\n\n01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.440\nSorry.\n\n01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.560\nOur heroes struck, felling a third of the orcs\n\n01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.640\nin a single moment as Sharpie waded into the fray,\n\n01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.320\nyelling and confused.\n\n01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.680\nMulraine, perhaps possessed by the spirit of Duncan Trussell,\n\n01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.040\ntook her own life, stabbing herself in the eyes\n\n01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.200\nand turning her brain matter into mush,\n\n01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.000\nkilling her instantly.\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.640\nCut the music.\n\n01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.360\nCut it off.\n\n01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.080\nKill it.\n\n01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.440\nKill the music.\n\n01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.600\nLike Mulraine.\n\n01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.000\nAll right.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.640\nSo yeah, that's what just happened.\n\n01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.680\nYou hear the beginning of a scream quickly cut short.\n\n01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.440\nYou turn to see Mulraine fall to the dirt, blood and brain\n\n01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.560\nspilling from her eye socket.\n\n01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.800\nA nearby orc sees this happen and attempts\n\n01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.560\nto make it look like he did it.\n\n01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.920\nHe points it at his head with both thumbs\n\n01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.200\nand goes, this orc.\n\n01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.480\nNo.\n\n01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.200\nI react.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.240\nIs that the whole reaction?\n\n01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.120\nMulraine.\n\n01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.080\nIs that his cum face?\n\n01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.000\nI thought you said it was a plot twist.\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.840\nZero was masturbating.\n\n01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.280\nAll I dance faces are his cum face.\n\n01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.760\nThink, think.\n\n01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.760\nI'm just usually listening to the podcast when I'm coming.\n\n01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.240\nIs that orcish?\n\n01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.640\nAre we still battling those orcs?\n\n01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.320\nOh yeah, you're in the middle of a fight.\n\n01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.240\nThis happened in the middle of a combat.\n\n01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.760\nSo Mulraine is laying dead with a smushed brain.\n\n01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.960\nAnd a sword in her face.\n\n01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.240\nAnd a sword in her face.\n\n01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.360\nYep.\n\n01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.280\nIt's tragic.\n\n01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.440\nI take her sword out to avenge her suicide.\n\n01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:39.400\nI charge at the orc in a barbarian rage.\n\n01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.280\nYou charge at the orc?\n\n01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.840\nOh, you miss him, though.\n\n01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.640\nYou charge at the orc, but maybe it's\n\n01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.920\nthe sword that you've never used before.\n\n01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.680\nIt just is too heavy or something.\n\n01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.280\nI run back and put it back in her face.\n\n01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:59.600\nAvenger, attack the nearest orc with your bird claws.\n\n01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.600\nAfter giving your mighty Belgian scream.\n\n01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.760\nThat's just how they sound over there.\n\n01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.840\nYeah, no, it's like different countries\n\n01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.880\nhave different words for, you know, like cockadoodle-doo.\n\n01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.400\nYeah, in Spanish, chickens go, kikari, gukudu, gukudu-doo.\n\n01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:30.880\nAvenger, the hawk with his battle cry,\n\n01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.440\nscratches at the orc that Jeff or Quark\n\n01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.200\nmissed with his blade, and clawing his eyes\n\n01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.720\nand dealing four damage.\n\n01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.160\nThe orc is running around screaming.\n\n01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.040\nI'm going to do shocking grasp on him\n\n01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.080\nif I can get to him.\n\n01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.160\nOn the same orc?\n\n01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:47.660\nYep.\n\n01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.560\nAll right.\n\n01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.320\nYou try to do that.\n\n01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.840\nYou miss also.\n\n01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.120\nYou lunge towards him with a shocking grasp,\n\n01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.280\nbut he nimbly dodges out of the way.\n\n01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.960\nVoila being the hawked.\n\n01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.120\nYeah.\n\n01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:03.880\nWhich turn is it?\n\n01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.680\nWell, it's that orc's turn.\n\n01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.320\nHe's trying to.\n\n01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.680\nHe tries to dislodge the hawk from his face,\n\n01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.680\nbut instead he just falls, and he impales himself\n\n01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:19.160\non Moran's face sword.\n\n01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.400\nI guess it's not an impalement.\n\n01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.680\nIt's more of just a slice.\n\n01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.560\nBut you know, he's dead.\n\n01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.480\nHe's dead.\n\n01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.920\nHe tried to get the hawk off, and he killed himself.\n\n01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.360\nHalf the orcs are dead.\n\n01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.920\nNobody touched that sword.\n\n01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.960\nThe other orc, one of the other orcs\n\n01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.520\nruns away just because he realizes he's outnumbered.\n\n01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.120\nAnd then is that two left?\n\n01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.120\nThat's two left, I think.\n\n01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:42.960\nYeah, two left.\n\n01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.200\nTwo orcs left.\n\n01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.480\nThe other one just, he looks at the damage,\n\n01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.040\nand he's kind of freaked out.\n\n01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.760\nIs it Chris de Burghstern, then, maybe?\n\n01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.760\nIt would be, yeah, Chris de Burghstern.\n\n01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.320\nYeah, so can I throw my poison dagger at the last orc?\n\n01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.160\nThere's one more?\n\n01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.520\nI think I said two more, right?\n\n01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.440\nTwo more.\n\n01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.360\nBut yeah, you do that, and you strike him right in the neck,\n\n01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:13.920\ndealing four damage to his neck.\n\n01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.200\nThat's like a hawk knife.\n\n01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:15.920\nEvery little health.\n\n01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.720\nStandard hawk damage, he bleeds quite heavily\n\n01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.880\nand clutches at his throat, putting in a quark's turn.\n\n01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.360\nI take my mighty greatsword out, and I aim right at his knee\n\n01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.960\ncaps and try to cleave his knees just like this way.\n\n01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.160\nI don't want him to die fast.\n\n01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.640\nI want him to bleed out.\n\n01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.080\nYou cleave at his knees, and you slice them open.\n\n01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.440\nWait, what's your damage again?\n\n01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.320\nI can't remember.\n\n01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:47.320\nI'm the mighty greatsword, his is 2DA plus 7.\n\n01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.600\nHe explodes for the knees.\n\n01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.520\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.760\nHis discs rupture.\n\n01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.520\nJesus.\n\n01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.400\nPlus a million against orcs.\n\n01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.840\nThe last orc, the leader orc.\n\n01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.960\nHe's wearing a helmet and holding a gold axe.\n\n01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.680\nHe grumbles.\n\n01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.360\nHe's like, I'm not going to die today, you bastards.\n\n01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.720\nHe pulls out a necklace.\n\n01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.640\nOh, I have it written down.\n\n01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.800\nHe pulls out a necklace from a pouch.\n\n01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.600\nIt's covered in three dangling glass bobbles, each of which\n\n01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.960\ncontains a blazing, fiery nexus of light.\n\n01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.320\nHe takes three or four measured steps back\n\n01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.200\nand then hurls the necklace directly\n\n01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.760\ninto the middle of all of you guys.\n\n01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.960\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.840\nIt strikes like a bullet directly\n\n01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.560\ntowards the horse-drawn carriage.\n\n01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.320\nAnd for a split second, all you can hear\n\n01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.920\nis the delicate shattering of glass.\n\n01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.480\nBut then a massive explosion rips forth decimating the carriage\n\n01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.280\nand creating a large mushroom cloud in its wake.\n\n01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.080\nYou can see that gnome that was earlier atop the carriage\n\n01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.520\nblasting off like a rocket.\n\n01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.880\nHe goes at least 20 feet upwards before plummeting back\n\n01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.560\ninto the earth, landing on packed ground\n\n01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.880\nwith a sickening snap.\n\n01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.040\nHe's still.\n\n01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.800\nBut the massive shockwave rips forth in all directions,\n\n01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.560\nconsuming all sorts of things in its blazing trail.\n\n01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.640\nMake a reflex saves.\n\n01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.480\nWhat are your reflex saves?\n\n01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.480\nMy reflex save is five.\n\n01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.080\nI'm sad.\n\n01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.000\nSo infinite.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.720\nMy dexterity is 14.\n\n01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.160\nAll right, well, I rolled really high.\n\n01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.040\nSo everybody saves.\n\n01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.640\nI got five, so I got five, yeah.\n\n01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.440\nAll right, you all save.\n\n01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:36.720\nEverybody but Jeff takes 13 damage.\n\n01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.400\nSo his blazing fire consumes your bodies\n\n01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.720\nand lights things on fire.\n\n01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720\nNot your whole bodies, though.\n\n01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.800\nJust 13 damage worth of your bodies.\n\n01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.400\nBut I rolled high.\n\n01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.920\nI'm good?\n\n01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:51.440\nYeah, you're good because you got the dodgy.\n\n01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.000\nAll right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.200\nYeah, the whole carriage is consumed in a fiery blaze.\n\n01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.200\nAnd then the orc, he clicks his heels together\n\n01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.960\nand little feathers pop out of his boots.\n\n01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.320\nAnd he flies away.\n\n01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.600\nThat hell kind of orc?\n\n01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:07.520\nThis isn't the last you've seen of Vathros the Mighty.\n\n01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.800\nAphros?\n\n01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.280\nVathros.\n\n01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.720\nHe disappears, leaving nothing but burning carnage.\n\n01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.720\nIs that necklace still there?\n\n01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.800\nOr is that what that consumed?\n\n01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.320\nBloated.\n\n01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.840\nVathros the Mighty.\n\n01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.720\nI think we're going to see that guy again.\n\n01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.400\nI hope we do.\n\n01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.640\nI got to score to something.\n\n01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:30.040\nAnd make a note that's how much three glass bulbs\n\n01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.160\ndo on a necklace.\n\n01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160\nYou know, if anyone ever throws down one of those things\n\n01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.920\nand it's got one on it, it'll be like, all right.\n\n01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.920\nNo biggie.\n\n01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.080\nIt's like an M80.\n\n01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.520\nI go up to the gnome that snapped on the packed earth\n\n01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.360\nand I examine his body.\n\n01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.960\nHe's pretty still, but his eyelids flicker open.\n\n01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.080\nAnd he's like, oh, help me.\n\n01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.800\nI can't move.\n\n01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.560\nSharpie, heal this man.\n\n01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.320\nI'm a wizard.\n\n01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.440\nYou have no heal spells?\n\n01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:04.920\nNo.\n\n01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.760\nNo, that's not really a direction I went.\n\n01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.160\nIt shows the specialized in shrinking people.\n\n01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.600\nMulraine, do you have a heal spell on you?\n\n01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.440\nDead.\n\n01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.440\nDead.\n\n01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.960\nOK, I loot Mulraine.\n\n01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.960\nOh, I guess she got blown up.\n\n01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.480\nYeah, yeah, all the possessions anywhere in the fireball\n\n01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.360\nexplosion are completely worthless.\n\n01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.280\nSo she's gone?\n\n01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.640\nShe's just vaporized?\n\n01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.880\nYes.\n\n01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.560\nReally?\n\n01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.880\nShe was in the fireball.\n\n01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.360\nYeah, I think that's how it works.\n\n01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.320\nWell, OK.\n\n01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.360\nDon't you have some good berries or something for the?\n\n01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:45.880\nI don't.\n\n01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.920\nThat's a different game.\n\n01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.880\nOh, OK.\n\n01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.720\nSorry.\n\n01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.200\nWell, OK, I guess the dust is kind of settling right now.\n\n01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.640\nI guess we could take stock of the fact\n\n01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.400\nthat Mulraine, who we've grown to know and love,\n\n01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.960\nis just she's been completely vaporized.\n\n01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.880\nI go to the dying guy and I go, why were they attacking you?\n\n01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.280\nI'm a brewer.\n\n01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.680\nThey were trying to steal from my distillery.\n\n01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.240\nIt blew up.\n\n01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.840\nWhat, do you make potions or beer?\n\n01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.560\nI make spirits.\n\n01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.800\nLike beer spirits or?\n\n01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.560\nA guy that can blow things up and fly with his boots\n\n01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.440\nwanted to steal beer?\n\n01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.880\nIf I had to guess, I don't think he knew my wares.\n\n01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.680\nHe probably thought you had like potions or something.\n\n01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.480\nMaybe.\n\n01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.280\nI do my experiments out here to stay safe.\n\n01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.320\nBeer experiments?\n\n01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.360\nYeah.\n\n01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.400\nIt's pretty volatile.\n\n01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.320\nIt's a moving still.\n\n01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.160\nBut now it's blown up.\n\n01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:53.960\nIt's gone, right?\n\n01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.120\nIt sure was.\n\n01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.000\nAre you OK?\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:56.920\nHow do you feel right now?\n\n01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.440\nI can't move at all.\n\n01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.960\nI attempt to just, I massage him and try to heal him.\n\n01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:11.000\nYou massage him, making sure to stimulate his fascial layers.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.560\nHe doesn't seem to react because his neck looks broken.\n\n01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:18.440\nI do have a brew potion feet.\n\n01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.160\nI don't know if I can look around.\n\n01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.000\nI also have knowledge of, no I don't.\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.120\nWell, everything's all blown up.\n\n01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:27.680\nIt's all.\n\n01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:30.880\nI thought maybe I could see like a piece of milk thistle.\n\n01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.480\nIt was a crazy magic fireball.\n\n01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.200\nYeah.\n\n01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:35.600\nAll right.\n\n01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.680\nWell, I think what's happened, sir,\n\n01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.800\nis that your back and or neck may be broken.\n\n01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.760\nYou're going to have to hold still for a while\n\n01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.560\nand you don't have a choice.\n\n01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320\nHow far away from the nearest city?\n\n01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.880\nWe're very close to my town Rosebook.\n\n01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:54.920\nI should take me there.\n\n01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:57.080\nI pick him up and throw him over my shoulder.\n\n01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.640\nYou're not supposed to move.\n\n01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.560\nI heard somewhere you're not supposed to.\n\n01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.640\nThat guy was cast.\n\n01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.600\nWhat about my mage hand spell?\n\n01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.200\nCan I use that to lift a dude?\n\n01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.160\nNo, he weighs more than five pounds.\n\n01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.480\nAnd levitate?\n\n01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.760\nOh, you could levitate him, yeah.\n\n01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.080\nLike all the way to town?\n\n01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:17.960\nSure.\n\n01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.400\nI'm going to levitate you.\n\n01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.360\nI put him back down.\n\n01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:29.960\nIt's going to hurt a little, but not as much as that did.\n\n01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.080\nI can't do anything.\n\n01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.520\nRight.\n\n01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.400\nWe'll levitate you.\n\n01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.440\nYou lead the way to Rosebook.\n\n01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.360\nYou can see it from here.\n\n01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.600\nOK.\n\n01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.600\nHocus pocus, body float us.\n\n01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.560\nAnd as the body lifts into the air,\n\n01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.120\nyou begin to hear the loud rumbling of thunder\n\n01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.160\nas the sky darkens above you.\n\n01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:54.920\nCracow, cracow, lightning, cracow, more lightning.\n\n01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.640\nFrom the east, you can see a blazing white light\n\n01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.240\nflying through the sky.\n\n01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.080\nIt's quite far away, but you can see even from here\n\n01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.480\nthat it's aloft on great wings of flame,\n\n01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.600\nwings that shed flame onto the ground with each beat,\n\n01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.640\nlighting fires and blazes all across the earth below.\n\n01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.720\nWait, wait, I can calm winds, it says here.\n\n01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.920\nIt doesn't look like it's winds.\n\n01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.400\nNot even so down a little bit, no?\n\n01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.280\nIt's too far off, anyway.\n\n01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.120\nIt looks like it's maybe about six miles off.\n\n01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.920\nIt'll be some time before it gets here,\n\n01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.040\nbut it's definitely apocalyptic looking.\n\n01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.400\nLike a storm's up, Rowan.\n\n01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.800\nWe've got to get out of here.\n\n01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.640\nOK, let's run.\n\n01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.040\nEverybody run to Rosebook.\n\n01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.000\nI trot while levitating.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.360\nHocus pocus, body float us.\n\n01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.800\nHocus pocus, body float us.\n\n01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.120\nYou arrive at Rosebook.\n\n01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.600\nYou could see a ring of white monolithic pillars,\n\n01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.920\neach draped in bright red roses.\n\n01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.640\nIt kind of forms a fence around the city,\n\n01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.520\ngiving a very secured and beautiful appearance.\n\n01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.000\nYou can see the front gate of the city\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.600\nas several farmers with various livestock\n\n01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:05.640\nare kind of ushered in by a few city guards,\n\n01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.000\nthe lead of which is a female paladin in bright shining armor,\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.960\nkind of giving directions to the city guardsmen\n\n01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.160\nushering people inside for safety.\n\n01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:21.480\nThis way, move on by, looking good.\n\n01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.480\nAll right.\n\n01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.760\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:30:25.760 -->

01:32:57.440\nand honor in everything that I see and feel.\n\n01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.840\nIt's my own job that I put upon myself,\n\n01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.200\nbut I would, uh, I was looking

hang out with us for a while,\n\n01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:12.080\nget bored of who she is, and kill herself, and change her character.\n\n01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.800\nIt just seems like another one of these weird identity crisis ladies would keep meeting.\n\n01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.800\nAll right, yeah, well, I...\n\n01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800\nHey, everybody.\n\n01:34:17.800 -->

you realize...\n\n01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:30.560\nI realize that in Belgium, they only have owls.\n\n01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:36.560\nIt's a small country and there's only so many birds of prey.\n\n01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:44.560\nSo, he could see it looks like a blazing figure of light kind of flying towards you.\n\n01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.560\nIt looks dangerous.\n\n01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.560\nIt's big.\n\n01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.560\nSo, it's 30 feet big.\n\n01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:52.560\nStand behind me.\n\n01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.560\nDo we trust...\n\n01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.560\nWell, I think we should get into the town, right?\n\n01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.560\nI mean, these guys live in a place where there's...\n\n01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.560\nI'm already in the town.\n\n01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.560\nI walked away a long time ago.\n\n01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.560\nI'm at a bar right now.\n\n01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:10.560\nIs there an apothecary or a metastologist or a healer?\n\n01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:13.560\nYes, there is a metastologist in the center of town.\n\n01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560\nThe sky's back.\n\n01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560\nIt's still fucked up.\n\n01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.560\nYou did your best.\n\n01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.560\nThank you.\n\n01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:21.560\nI don't like to list this big glowing light thing that's coming our way, guys.\n\n01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:25.560\nI gotta drop this guy off so I can wash my hands of him.\n\n01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.560\nHere, come into the town.\n\n01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.560\nI'll show you around.\n\n01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.560\nI have a...\n\n01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560\nSpencer, what is it called?\n\n01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.560\nConstabulary.\n\n01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560\nConstabulary.\n\n01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560\nCome to my...\n\n01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560\nConstabulary.\n\n01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.560\nWhat?\n\n01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.560\nOkay.\n\n01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.560\nIs there a hospital?\n\n01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.560\nYes.\n\n01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.560\nIn the Constabulary, there is a very sophisticated first aid kit.\n\n01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.560\nAnd let's jam towards health.\n\n01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.560\nAll right.\n\n01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.560\nSo you killed your character off to become this completely different character.\n\n01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.560\nYou're the same confused person.\n\n01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.560\nI don't know who you're talking to.\n\n01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560\nYou're liberated.\n\n01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.560\nI don't want to sit on stage with Reddit right now, I would like to just do the show.\n\n01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.560\nMaybe some people said some things on Reddit and I thought I should kill myself.\n\n01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.560\nIt's a different vibe.\n\n01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560\nI'm trying to move.\n\n01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.560\nI'm trying to sing towards light and truth.\n\n01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.560\nYou're playing the game based on Reddit?\n\n01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.560\nI never go on there and defend myself.\n\n01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:36.560\nI would like to just play the show and, you know, just go be positive and not worry about\n\n01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.560\nwhat, you know...\n\n01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.560\nDouche Coup, 69.\n\n01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.560\nDouche Coup.\n\n01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.560\nBartman.\n\n01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.560\nSpongeBob.\n\n01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.560\nI mean, the reason why I killed my character is because I was talking about it for so long\n\n01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:56.560\nand then last week I felt like it was the right thing to do.\n\n01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.560\nAnd we can talk about that if you want.\n\n01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.560\nBut I felt like it was the right thing to do and I realized this is also what I did in\n\n01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.560\nour private game.\n\n01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.560\nYou're responding to web negativity and that's why you're changing the character.\n\n01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.560\nNot because you wanted to try other things.\n\n01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.560\nI don't think that's what you're saying.\n\n01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.560\nI mean, you've been so positive towards my character that I don't know why I wouldn't want to live\n\n01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560\non forever.\n\n01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560\nI mean, you've been such a...\n\n01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:18.560\nI've been the biggest supporter of your gameplay.\n\n01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.560\nI find you delightful.\n\n01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560\nSure.\n\n01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:28.560\nThis is starting to feel mean.\n\n01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.560\nThis guy needs a hospital.\n\n01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:35.560\nI don't understand.\n\n01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.560\nLet's go.\n\n01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.560\nLet's go.\n\n01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.560\nI whistle.\n\n01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.560\nOh, I whistle and it sounds very similar to...\n\n01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.560\nHootie-hootie.\n\n01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.560\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.560\nWoo-hoo.\n\n01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:46.560\nWoo-hoo.\n\n01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.560\nI whistle and a beautiful brown horse rides up.\n\n01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:54.560\nI found this horse wandering around.\n\n01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.560\nIt's Coco.\n\n01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.560\nYou recognize...\n\n01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560\nYou guys recognize that it's Coco.\n\n01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560\nI lift everyone.\n\n01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.560\nI put them on.\n\n01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560\nCan we just call you Mulrainee?\n\n01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.560\nBecause you remind us so much of our friend that just died?\n\n01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.560\nI resent this right now, Jeff.\n\n01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.560\nWho's Jeff?\n\n01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560\nExactly.\n\n01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560\nWho is Jeff?\n\n01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.560\nNothing.\n\n01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.560\nI heard about Mulrainee.\n\n01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.560\nI take the guy over my shoulder and I take him inside the fort.\n\n01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560\nThat hurts really bad.\n\n01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.560\nYou're healed now, aren't you?\n\n01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560\nNo, I'm a little healed.\n\n01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.560\nI can't put him back down.\n\n01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.560\nMy arm's not broken anymore.\n\n01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:37.560\nMy neck.\n\n01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.560\nHe needs to be levitated to a goddamn healer.\n\n01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.560\nI'm going to start walking with Coco towards the medicine cabinet\n\n01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.560\ninside the cop house, the constabulary, thank you.\n\n01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.560\nTwo guards come out of the constabularians.\n\n01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.560\nThey look at you and they run over with a stretcher and grab the guy.\n\n01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.560\nStretching them along.\n\n01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:01.560\nThese guys are super fun.\n\n01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.560\nThey're really nice guys.\n\n01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.560\nThanks, dignity.\n\n01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.560\nYou're welcome, Joe.\n\n01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:15.560\nShe remembered.\n\n01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.560\nWhat was that?\n\n01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:23.560\nAvenger, when you saw this thing coming, how soon did you reckon it would get here,\n\n01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:29.560\nbased on its speed and your hawk knowledge?\n\n01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.560\nTen minutes.\n\n01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.560\nIs that right, ten minutes?\n\n01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.560\nI mean, you know, hawk time is like four times fast or something.\n\n01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.560\nForty minutes?\n\n01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.560\nHere's the thing about me.\n\n01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.560\nAll of my spells are depleted and have been for like nine gaming sessions.\n\n01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.560\nI was thinking that too, but there was a good three weeks that you guys were regenerating spells\n\n01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.560\nand traveling to the Purple Man Mountains.\n\n01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560\nOh, okay.\n\n01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560\nSo I think you're good.\n\n01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.560\nAll right.\n\n01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.560\nGood.\n\n01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.560\nI mean, rest is always nice.\n\n01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.560\nYeah, can I make you guys some tea?\n\n01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.560\nYeah, you guys are in the constabulary.\n\n01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.560\nThere's men with guard outfits.\n\n01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.560\nThey're red and white uniforms.\n\n01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.560\nThey're kind of walking in and out.\n\n01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.560\nThere's a sitting room where you're kind of near with tables and benches and a few off-duty guards\n\n01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.560\nsitting and drinking and talking.\n\n01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:24.560\nNo, these guys.\n\n01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:32.560\nI give, I pull up a table and I put down tea for everybody.\n\n01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.560\nIt's a dry city.\n\n01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.560\nSorry?\n\n01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.560\nIt's a dry city.\n\n01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560\nLike, no, no.\n\n01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560\nFor alcohol.\n\n01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.560\nThat's white tea.\n\n01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.560\nSorry?\n\n01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.560\nOh, right.\n\n01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.560\nEveryone's drinking tea.\n\n01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.560\nEven those guys drinking earlier were drinking tea.\n\n01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:51.560\nI wouldn't mind going and finding out these crystal crabs and shit that we've gotten.\n\n01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.560\nThe Purple Cave are worth.\n\n01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.560\nRemember those things?\n\n01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.560\nYeah, like crab things.\n\n01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.560\nIs there someone in town that can appraise those items for us?\n\n01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.560\nWho are you talking to?\n\n01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.560\nOne of the guards.\n\n01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.560\nI'm off duty.\n\n01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.560\nIs anybody on duty?\n\n01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.560\nNo one on duty is in the realm.\n\n01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.560\nShe's off duty, right?\n\n01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:17.560\nYou're off duty?\n\n01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:20.560\nYeah, I'm off duty spiritually.\n\n01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:23.560\nI bet she doesn't even work here.\n\n01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:26.560\nWho knows, man?\n\n01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.560\nYou know these guys.\n\n01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.560\nSpencer, do I know of a guy?\n\n01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.560\nA what?\n\n01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.560\nWhat was it we were just looking for?\n\n01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560\nI saw the guards.\n\n01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.560\nIn 40 minutes or so, there's a giant storm brewing that's coming our way.\n\n01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560\nWe need to defend the city.\n\n01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.560\nDo you guys have defenses in an army that can protect us?\n\n01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.560\nYes.\n\n01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.560\nYou sense of urgency worries me.\n\n01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.560\nThat was me the Dungeon Master because you weren't asking anybody.\n\n01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560\nThat's from the guard.\n\n01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.560\nThey're off duty.\n\n01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.560\nLook.\n\n01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.560\nDo I know?\n\n01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.560\nSpencer, I appealed to their desire to be alive later on.\n\n01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.560\nWhether they're working or not.\n\n01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:13.560\nAs dignity, do I have knowledge of who's in charge of defense for the city?\n\n01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.560\nYeah.\n\n01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:19.560\nThe guy who's in charge of everything, including the defense of the city, is the main patriarch,\n\n01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.560\nwhose name is Father Tender.\n\n01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.560\nHey.\n\n01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:23.560\nHi.\n\n01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.560\nDon't have to ask me twice.\n\n01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.560\nHey, little guy.\n\n01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.560\nNo, look up.\n\n01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.560\nHey.\n\n01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.560\nHi.\n\n01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560\nMy name is Quark.\n\n01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.560\nQuark.\n\n01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.560\nYes.\n\n01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.560\nDignity.\n\n01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.560\nHello.\n\n01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.560\nHi.\n\n01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.560\nThank you for the warm reception.\n\n01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560\nYou got it.\n\n01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.560\nI heard you talking.\n\n01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560\nI would like to introduce you to the...\n\n01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.560\nI know.\n\n01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.560\nYou keep coming up into our sidebars.\n\n01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.560\nYeah.\n\n01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.560\nTwice a week.\n\n01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.560\nI wash my hair twice a week.\n\n01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:57.560\nSo I would like to introduce you to a very special person.\n\n01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.560\nHe's right around the corner.\n\n01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.560\nCan I lead you there?\n\n01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.560\nI know you're talking about defense.\n\n01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.560\nYes.\n\n01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.820\nAs a new member of your gang that will forever be with you and never leave, I would like\n\n01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.560\nto show you...\n\n01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.560\nNo matter even if someone says on Reddit to change your character.\n\n01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.560\nThis one's here to stay.\n\n01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.560\nLook, I'm not looking for more compliments.\n\n01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.560\nAll right.\n\n01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:20.560\nSo we...\n\n01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.560\nSo I lead them.\n\n01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.560\nI gesture to them and walk out and show them Father Tender's.\n\n01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.560\nYeah.\n\n01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:32.560\nBut before you could even open the door, the doors swing wide and you can see Father Tender\n\n01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.560\nhimself was striding through.\n\n01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:39.560\nHe's a very handsome older man in white robes embroidered with red roses.\n\n01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.560\nHe marches inside with guardsmen to his left and to his right.\n\n01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.560\nHe says, greetings, guardsmen.\n\n01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.560\nFather Tender here.\n\n01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.560\nThank you for your service.\n\n01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.560\nYou're all doing a fine job.\n\n01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.560\nThen he looks at Quark and his face hardens.\n\n01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.560\nHe glances over at Dignity.\n\n01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.560\nDignity, who are all these new faces?\n\n01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:06.560\nThese are my best friends.\n\n01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.560\nThese are my best friends.\n\n01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560\nThese are my potential lovers.\n\n01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.560\nThese are my future adventure haver together withers.\n\n01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.560\nThese are the most important people on the face of the planet.\n\n01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.560\nThis is Quark.\n\n01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.560\nHe's great.\n\n01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.560\nAnd this is Sharpie.\n\n01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.560\nI overheard your name.\n\n01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.560\nHe's very strong.\n\n01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:28.560\nThis is Avenger.\n\n01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.560\nThis is Christopher, who's been quietly listening.\n\n01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.560\nPleased to meet you.\n\n01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:43.560\nHe's very fancy.\n\n01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:51.560\nMy new friends are concerned with the safety of the city and I would like to help them\n\n01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.560\nprotect the city.\n\n01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.560\nThere's a big white ball coming.\n\n01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.560\nOh, I know.\n\n01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.560\nYour adventure is, huh?\n\n01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.560\nIt's dangerous work, isn't it?\n\n01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.560\nIt brings danger all around, doesn't it?\n\n01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560\nThere's a big white ball coming.\n\n01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.560\nWe don't really like danger so much here in Roseville.\n\n01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.560\nAre you animatronic?\n\n01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.560\nNo, no.\n\n01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:16.560\nWe follow our beliefs strictly and the Rosa Crucian Codex clearly states that\n\n01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:19.560\ndanger is evil.\n\n01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.560\nAnd right now, we've got a whole lot of it.\n\n01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.560\nI don't know if you know out there, but there's a demon coming right for us,\n\n01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.560\nblasting hellfire and screaming bloody murder.\n\n01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560\nAnd I think you're behind it, Gnome.\n\n01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560\nGnomes are always trouble.\n\n01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560\nI'm not behind it.\n\n01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560\nIt just came in here.\n\n01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560\nWe just brought a gnome in.\n\n01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.560\nYeah, he points at the broken gnome.\n\n01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.560\nEver since this gnome has been coming through town, making immoral drinks and\n\n01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.560\npoisoning our citizens, we've lost our God's favor.\n\n01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.560\nIf you could excuse me, I need to pray.\n\n01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.560\nMy clerics are already at the Soul Rods, reinforcing our wards.\n\n01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.560\nHe looks over at dignity with a lecherous gaze and says,\n\n01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.560\nyou know, my Soul Rods already rigidly reinforced.\n\n01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.560\nSo, as he walks out, he says,\n\n01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:08.560\nfeel free to stop by my juicery if anyone wants me to give him my special juice.\n\n01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.560\nWhat?\n\n01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.560\nNew friends, you don't want the special juice.\n\n01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:19.560\nIt's not that special. Everyone in this town can generate it, and his is warm.\n\n01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.560\nHey, Sharpie, Chris, let's get the hell out of this town.\n\n01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.560\nI don't like the looks of Father Tender.\n\n01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.560\nI don't like anything about this town.\n\n01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560\nWe dropped the guy off. We did our duty. Let's just keep moving.\n\n01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.560\nYeah.\n\n01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:34.560\nCan I run out after Father Tender and use diplomacy?\n\n01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.560\nSure.\n\n01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.560\nOkay. Chase after Father Tender.\n\n01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.560\nWhat are you saying?\n\n01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:46.560\nThis gnome is not responsible for this demon.\n\n01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.560\nThis gnome is necessary to the safety of this town,\n\n01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.560\nand you should treat this gnome like the special guest that he is.\n\n01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:59.560\nAh, you're right. I'll do that.\n\n01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.560\nBut I got my eye on him.\n\n01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:12.560\nIf you guys bring any more trouble, you're all fucked.\n\n01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.560\nIt's what he says when he leaves every room.\n\n01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.560\nIt's his thing.\n\n01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.560\nAnd he traipses out.\n\n01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.560\nAll right. Well, I don't know. I feel bad for this town. There's a thing coming.\n\n01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.560\nI guess I don't feel bad about this town at all.\n\n01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:31.560\nWe've got a shitty reception from the get-go.\n\n01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:33.560\nYeah, I guess you're right.\n\n01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.560\nWe've done worse things to people who have done less to us.\n\n01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.560\nWait, do we still have a robot baby with us?\n\n01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560\nJust checking.\n\n01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.560\nI'm a power unit. I'm 300 gold.\n\n01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.560\nHe could have been the robot baby. Fuck.\n\n01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.560\nThat's on me, man. You're doing a great hawk, though.\n\n01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.560\nThe hawk is the highlight of my life.\n\n01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.560\nIt's my new ring.\n\n01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.560\nHow far is it?\n\n01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:06.560\nI go up to the walls, the rosy walls of Rosebook and look over and check out the light storm coming towards.\n\n01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.560\nYou can see the light storm drying nearer.\n\n01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.560\nIt's coming way faster than you'd ever expected.\n\n01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:15.560\nAnd as it nears, you can hear a voice calling out from the void.\n\n01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.560\nIt sounds like...\n\n01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.560\nOh, shit.\n\n01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.560\nHeading straight towards the town.\n\n01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:27.560\nAnd with an instance, it's upon you, but crashing towards the town,\n\n01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:30.560\nit smashes directly into solid air above the town.\n\n01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.560\nYou see white wards sizzling and popping in midair,\n\n01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:37.560\nburning the angel's flesh and compelling it outside of the city.\n\n01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.560\nIt circles around a few times, crashing into the barrier for longer.\n\n01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560\nIt stands firm.\n\n01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.560\nYoshi, the angel, right?\n\n01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.560\nYep. Yomiji?\n\n01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.560\nYomiji.\n\n01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:52.560\nYou can't seem to get into the barrier.\n\n01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.560\nWow, the soul rods kept him out.\n\n01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:56.560\nI told you!\n\n01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.560\nAside from that guy's lack of sexual harassment training,\n\n01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.560\nI guess he's an effective leader.\n\n01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.560\nHe's got this place buckled down.\n\n01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.560\nOne of the guards pokes at her and speaks up.\n\n01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.560\nHe's like, you know, that guy wasn't always a perv.\n\n01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.560\nUh, hi.\n\n01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:19.560\nThat's all. See ya.\n\n01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:23.560\nThis is a weird city's town, that's weird.\n\n01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.560\nSo we're safe, we're good.\n\n01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.560\nIt's over.\n\n01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:30.560\nWhere do we go next?\n\n01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:37.560\nI walk out of the constabulary and walk into town to see if there's anyone...\n\n01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:41.560\nAre we going to try to cash in our little crystal crab thingies?\n\n01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:45.560\nEveryone seems kind of occupied, looking at a giant flaming angel demon.\n\n01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.560\nIs it still, it's just hovering out there?\n\n01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.560\nYeah, it's attacking this barrier immensely.\n\n01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.560\nIt's still trying to get in.\n\n01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:55.560\nYeah, it's like a velociraptor, texting the weaknesses in an electrical fence.\n\n01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:59.560\nI don't think we're leaving this place until we take care of this guy.\n\n01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:02.560\nIs there a wise man in town, a dignity?\n\n01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.560\nNo.\n\n01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.560\nDo we know that there's a wise man?\n\n01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.560\nOr a wise woman?\n\n01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:17.560\nI mean, Mr. Father Tender is basically our wise man, and you saw how wise he is.\n\n01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:28.560\nI mean, it could be the first on a list of many harrowing great adventures for you to join me in defending this city.\n\n01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:33.560\nAnd we can all jam towards the light.\n\n01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:41.560\nAnd if there was ever someone I wanted to jam towards light with, I mean, I think it would be you.\n\n01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:48.560\nYou're very particular.\n\n01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:51.560\nAnd I like that.\n\n01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.560\nI like how particular you are.\n\n01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.560\nI realize you just lost your friend.\n\n01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:57.560\nI don't think you care at all.\n\n01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.560\nReally?\n\n01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.560\nNo.\n\n01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560\nI know, of course I do.\n\n01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.560\nYou never met her.\n\n01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.560\nYou don't know how much we cared about her.\n\n01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.560\nI have her horse.\n\n01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.560\nI fucked that horse.\n\n01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:13.560\nWell, then you love her.\n\n01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:19.560\nI'm saying, maybe we got off on the wrong foot, we've had a very long day.\n\n01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.560\nThe last thing you want is more adventures.\n\n01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.560\nWe've had it up to here with adventures.\n\n01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:34.560\nWell, then come to the flat where I'm staying and I made a blanket fort.\n\n01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.560\nYou're not concerned about this angel attacking?\n\n01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:39.560\nNo, I am, but you're telling me that you're tired.\n\n01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.560\nI'm saying this when we first met, you wanted to go on more adventures.\n\n01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.560\nI'm saying, look, it was like we're tired.\n\n01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.560\nFriends just got killed.\n\n01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.560\nWell, she killed us all.\n\n01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:53.560\nJeff, say we don't want to go on any more adventures again.\n\n01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:58.560\nBut say my name is my actual name, Quirk.\n\n01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.560\nWe don't want to go on any more adventures.\n\n01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.560\nWell, Quirk.\n\n01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.560\nAnd I look up at the angel.\n\n01:55:04.560 -->
