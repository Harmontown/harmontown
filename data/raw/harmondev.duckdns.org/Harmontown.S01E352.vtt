Herman yeah I what what what I can make my own cable now like it doesn't even

03:17.840 --> 03:28.560
matter what kind why are you doing that what what channels can you make your

03:28.560 --> 03:37.440
splicing cables yeah cuz that will you splice the food network with Comedy

03:37.440 --> 03:49.320
Central go can you splice the history channel with Nickelodeon Nickelodeon's

03:49.320 --> 04:03.520
go can you splice I don't know I got it I got it can you splice spike TV with

04:03.520 --> 04:09.000
Namden the reason for making your own cable is for cable management you want

04:09.000 --> 04:11.760
to you don't want to have a bunch of extra loopy loops you get a hundred feet

04:11.760 --> 04:15.280
of cable what are the odds that you need to go a hundred feet away you know you

04:15.280 --> 04:19.560
probably usually need 71 feet of cable right you know I got I got one 100 foot

04:19.560 --> 04:24.200
cable and had a bunch of extra going to the monitor I needed then I took all the

04:24.200 --> 04:29.760
extra and I just cut it through another connector on there took the extra slack

04:29.760 --> 04:34.040
that I cut off use that to keep the chain going to another monitor it's really

04:34.040 --> 04:39.360
satisfying I got I took that hundred foot cable and I turned it into a feed

04:39.360 --> 04:45.960
for three different monitors in my in my gym can you rewire my sound system no

04:45.960 --> 04:52.200
oh so you don't know how to well I don't actually don't know how to make

04:52.200 --> 05:00.560
audio cable yeah okay I can only make coax call me when you're ready I think

05:00.560 --> 05:06.000
all music is just streamed now I think you can just stream it not not when I'm

05:06.000 --> 05:11.400
watching a movie and the sounds coming through the speakers you can't stream

05:11.400 --> 05:17.600

I'm a bad I'm a bad introducer I said please welcome Matt, Ben and Noel and

11:22.720 --> 11:25.880
and they waited because they thought I was gonna say Shaq it was just much

11:25.880 --> 11:34.840
farther away I thought I thought you nailed it okay thank you I don't I'm

11:34.840 --> 11:41.000
waiting to decide so when I was much younger Art Bell was still on the air

11:41.000 --> 11:46.840
with coast-to-coast and he would he would open up his lines to like alien

11:46.840 --> 11:52.680
abductees time travelers and he'd talk about all the usual stuff and reptoids

11:52.680 --> 11:58.960
hallowearth holla back there was typically I think we were in a kind of a

11:58.960 --> 12:03.120
Camelot for a while even when there were Republican presidents is like life was

12:03.120 --> 12:08.640
not so politically mired it really didn't matter and Art Bell was so long

12:08.640 --> 12:13.480
ago and then his his the throne's been handed off and stuff and it was just I

12:13.480 --> 12:18.920
just recently listened to this is my opening question I just recently

12:18.920 --> 12:22.640
listened to whoever it was who's the guy that took over for for art George Norrie

12:22.640 --> 12:26.800
George yeah I was listening to it just happened across an episode of his show

12:26.800 --> 12:30.800
maybe a couple years ago and there was some guy that was like talking about you

12:30.800 --> 12:34.360
know carnivorous plants or something and how they're still hiding their

12:34.360 --> 12:37.520
existence in the hallowearth or whatever he was talking about and the guy was

12:37.520 --> 12:40.280
just going on and on on the phone and then he's like and that's why they don't

12:40.280 --> 12:43.760
want you to believe in Donald Trump that's the thing and he started going

12:43.760 --> 12:47.640
because he's not part of the system and they're trying to hold him back and he

12:47.640 --> 12:52.280
got like he got a couple sentences out and then George eventually he's just

12:52.280 --> 12:56.520
like Tom Tom Tom I got to cut you off there that's I'm sorry but that is the

12:56.520 --> 13:01.080
one topic the one topic we just can't talk about on this show and I thought

13:01.080 --> 13:06.920
that was so striking conspiracy theory culture like you got the we are now

13:06.920 --> 13:12.960
living in this time when it's like there's like eight ironies there that I

13:12.960 --> 13:18.200
can't describe but anyways I you guys have like this super intelligent kind of

13:18.200 --> 13:22.520
approach to talking about conspiracy theories you you you're you and and

13:22.520 --> 13:28.440
that's what impresses me about your show you keep it you keep it unmyred you

13:28.440 --> 13:32.480
don't lose your wigs and you don't have call-ins from people that are like hey I

13:32.480 --> 13:36.480
just talked about we have a hotline we do we do do call-in episodes or we play

13:36.480 --> 13:41.280
back the the most bad shit ones it's just not live just in case and I guess

13:41.280 --> 13:44.640
that's just kind of how we met is that I was commenting to Spencer we were talking

13:44.640 --> 13:50.080
about that NPR the radio lab episode where you and I were disagreeing and I

13:50.080 --> 13:55.320
brought these guys up I just mentioned them and said you know I've been as a

13:55.320 --> 14:03.080
hobbyist I've been getting into centrisms no offense I was like wow

14:03.080 --> 14:05.880
these guys have been talking about this topic for an hour and they haven't like

14:05.880 --> 14:09.040
and then you might be somebody must have told you guys as they do in the

14:09.040 --> 14:12.280
internet a Dan Harmon talked about you or whatever then we then now we've met

14:12.280 --> 14:19.640
now you're on the show Dan ask them a question the how are you guys pretty

14:19.640 --> 14:25.240
great yeah this is absurdly surreal what is it like to be smart and into

14:25.240 --> 14:31.880
conspiracy theories well loaded question yeah yeah you definitely framed us up

14:31.880 --> 14:37.760
there yeah I I what do we what do we call we call it a critical thinking

14:37.760 --> 14:42.240
approach to conspiracy yeah which is important distinction yeah because so

14:42.240 --> 14:48.520
there's when I think any of us hear the term conspiracy theory especially now

14:48.520 --> 14:52.800
and I appreciate that you pointed out this like schism that's occurring where

14:52.800 --> 14:57.440
the there are a bunch of very far right people who are now into conspiracy

14:57.440 --> 15:00.880
theories yeah well they always were but they were never I think it's the other

15:00.880 --> 15:03.840
way around it not to get derailed by this but I almost feel like people that

15:03.840 --> 15:08.120
were fringe it's just it was the same on the on the left with the Bernie Sanders

15:08.120 --> 15:12.280
phenomena is it people that considered themselves fringe in the camelot of the

15:12.280 --> 15:16.840
bipartisan days people that were like what's with this election shit and it's

15:16.840 --> 15:22.040
like like the fringe got drawn into the to the process and I think that like

15:22.040 --> 15:26.560
people that didn't know they were right wing 15 years ago figured out that they

15:26.560 --> 15:29.880
were yeah which was really disconcerting for me because I'm like hey I wanted to

15:29.880 --> 15:33.880
talk about hollow earth and flat earth and anything but I can't do it anymore

15:33.880 --> 15:39.320
when it's now it's connected directly to yeah that's why women should yeah there's

15:39.320 --> 15:43.880
always that plot twist and it happens to us a lot too we'll be reading what what

15:43.880 --> 15:47.960
I think we all agree is like a fascinating correspondence or something

15:47.960 --> 15:51.680
where someone has this really out there idea but they've thought it through they

15:51.680 --> 15:56.760
have internal logic and we we get into like paragraph four page four and they

15:56.760 --> 16:02.880
go and that's why Donald Trump just like just like George Norrie runs into we

16:02.880 --> 16:08.320
we prefer the term conspiracy realist because there's there's insidious

16:08.320 --> 16:13.000
language that happens if you are on the new or you're watching a new show a few

16:13.000 --> 16:19.080
years ago someone would say the idea that the international banks are laundry

16:19.080 --> 16:23.920
money for drug cartels is a conspiracy theory and then they would say that

16:23.920 --> 16:27.800
because it's sort of a thought terminating cliche and now all the

16:27.800 --> 16:32.800
sudden saying that drug cartels are working with banks to launder dirty

16:32.800 --> 16:36.600
money is the same thing is saying that the Queen of England is somehow a half

16:36.600 --> 16:41.480
reptilian alien and the difference is that one of those things is fucking true

16:41.480 --> 16:57.720
you know yeah yeah that's a really good point the and you guys always parse out

16:57.720 --> 17:02.600
your your things the structure of your show is that you you kind of announce

17:02.600 --> 17:08.440
the topic and then you you you say here are the facts and you you you lay them

17:08.440 --> 17:13.520
all out it is it I always find it kind of important to go like oh yeah yeah yeah

17:13.520 --> 17:18.040
it is it is important to keep those things separated that I can't I can't

17:18.040 --> 17:22.040
think of a good example of a topic where you're kind of like yeah I thought I knew

17:22.040 --> 17:25.040
the facts but actually what's important is to build a little box around what you

17:25.040 --> 17:29.640
know to be the case because it often contains a bunch of crazy shit and then

17:29.640 --> 17:35.120
you you'll typically take a little break and then you usually will then come

17:35.120 --> 17:38.800
back from that break and say here's where it gets crazy and then talk about

17:38.800 --> 17:48.560
the the more unproven assertions that may be associated with those things and so

17:48.560 --> 17:54.160
is that why you guys got into it in the first place or is it among this among

17:54.160 --> 17:59.640
this trio is there a are there differing philosophies on this is is Noel like a

17:59.640 --> 18:03.680
dude there's a big foot for real and I have to hang out these fucking nerds

18:03.680 --> 18:08.000
just to get them to talk about it I don't know like I guess there's sort of we

18:08.000 --> 18:11.320
do have kind of like different roles I guess I'm sort of maybe more of the

18:11.320 --> 18:16.040
skeptic Matt's a bit more of a true believer about some of these things I

18:16.040 --> 18:21.080
don't want to like it has a lot to do with their background I grew up in the

18:21.080 --> 18:26.880
church very heavily when I was growing up church it was the United Methodist

18:26.880 --> 18:30.920
Church that's where how I got my start and I did too but I think yours was a

18:30.920 --> 18:38.720
little more hardcore than mine yeah sure but our core Methodist those

18:38.720 --> 18:46.280
wafers oh so we I lost my religion as you know many of us probably have a

18:46.280 --> 18:50.000
little bit at least when you get to college or you're really like getting

18:50.000 --> 18:54.360
more academic and listen to Pink Floyd and you're like there's no way God is

18:54.360 --> 19:00.440
right I was honestly I was listening to jars of clay right up into college like

19:00.440 --> 19:06.320
that kind of music that record fucking slaps I do praise yeah no it's all good

19:06.320 --> 19:09.440
yeah that's just that's just where I was I mean that's where I grew up is in an

19:09.440 --> 19:14.560
isolated town in in Georgia called coming it was literally called coming

19:14.560 --> 19:20.240
how's it spelled man see you MMING it's for Scythe County it's one of the it was

19:20.240 --> 19:28.040
the most I think it was yeah it was it well certainly but it was one of it was

19:28.040 --> 19:33.800
one of the most conservative towns in all of America is where I grew up it's

19:33.800 --> 19:39.440
it's changed a little bit at this point I'm not there anymore but it it shaped

19:39.440 --> 19:43.720
the way that I viewed the world all of just all of that and it's just most of

19:43.720 --> 19:48.880
us where we're born and the economic strata in which we're born it shapes us

19:48.880 --> 19:53.800
a lot and the struggles that we go through for me it was all internal

19:53.800 --> 19:59.080
because I was very privileged in in my position and the struggle was learning

19:59.080 --> 20:05.080
that my worldview was not necessarily correct and the things that I'd based my

20:05.080 --> 20:09.880
entire life on were not necessarily correct and you came to conspiracy theory

20:09.880 --> 20:15.440
because you had been brainwashed potentially well I I think I yeah I knew

20:15.440 --> 20:20.840
that there that had been pulled over my eyes and it wasn't necessarily my fault

20:20.840 --> 20:24.520
it was other people trying to shape me because they believed a certain thing

20:24.520 --> 20:29.000
right at least that's how I ended up getting there and I also spent a long

20:29.000 --> 20:34.240
a long about five summers working at a private club in Atlanta where it was

20:34.240 --> 20:38.840
the most wealthy people in all of Atlanta going to hang out and eat she

20:38.840 --> 20:44.760
grabbed soup by the pool and I really didn't like what I felt there I bet you

20:44.760 --> 20:47.920
heard some shit by the pool though did you not like come on you had to have

20:47.920 --> 20:52.560
heard some it was mostly griping about Pinot Grigio but it was I mean really

20:52.560 --> 20:56.280
influential cool people I'm sure but it was it shaped it also shaped my worldview

20:56.280 --> 21:02.560
anyway I'm talking for too long it can conspiracy theories were this this

21:02.560 --> 21:07.000
window that I could view the world through that felt like there might be

21:07.000 --> 21:11.600
something there because I couldn't trust what I believed in for so long that I

21:11.600 --> 21:14.040
should at least examine it but that's thing too like with a lot of the things

21:14.040 --> 21:18.080
we look into it's like even as bonkers as they get there's usually a nugget of

21:18.080 --> 21:22.160
truth like buried somewhere in there and that's the part that's fun about like I

21:22.160 --> 21:25.480
consider it almost like a thought experiment what we do sometimes we talk

21:25.480 --> 21:29.000
about this stuff as opposed to being like a true believer like a tinfoil hat

21:29.000 --> 21:32.880
type it's more like this is interesting what do people think what does the

21:32.880 --> 21:36.680
internet say what's the science how do we get through all that to something

21:36.680 --> 21:39.760
that's real and I think that's what we attempt to do anyway and it's sort of a

21:39.760 --> 21:44.240
false dichotomy to to say that something has to be absolutely true or absolutely

21:44.240 --> 21:49.760
false right it's it's easy to say that it's comforting to say that but it's

21:49.760 --> 21:55.080
usually not the case you know yeah I mean we look for we look for meaning in

21:55.080 --> 22:01.120
chaos I can do the conspiracy theories are kind of there's a conspiracy theory

22:01.120 --> 22:05.800
if you call it something different it's a religion as you you know God conspired

22:05.800 --> 22:10.040
to you know this is unseen forces controlling the world like we fall

22:10.040 --> 22:13.040
back on the positive version of a conspiracy theory when we lose a friend

22:13.040 --> 22:18.760
and and we because the the alternative is to stand there throwing dirt on

22:18.760 --> 22:23.040
somebody's box that should still be standing there and what else are you

22:23.040 --> 22:27.280
gonna do is that the only reason why conspiracy theories get get get get

22:27.280 --> 22:34.440
created is it is it is it just that like need for control I don't want to

22:34.440 --> 22:39.360
discount the other reason which would be that they're true I don't I don't want

22:39.360 --> 22:45.600
to but I mean like the ones that like kind of just blossom organically do

22:45.600 --> 22:50.600
they do is that the have you guys noticed anything in your studies because

22:50.600 --> 22:54.920
you've been doing this for over a decade right like do you have a kind of

22:54.920 --> 23:01.920
unifying theory about how conspiracy theories get born that's so that's that's

23:01.920 --> 23:07.400
a big one yeah so two things I really like they pointed out that sometimes

23:07.400 --> 23:13.520
they're true right not often not near as often as the people calling coast to

23:13.520 --> 23:20.640
coast may want to believe but we see we see two interesting things first some

23:20.640 --> 23:26.560
conspiracy theory stuff is ultimately classification and categorization which

23:26.560 --> 23:32.080
are things that our species is brilliant at you know we we are hardwired to

23:32.080 --> 23:37.520
connect dots because back in the day that kept us alive right and nothing

23:37.520 --> 23:42.360
really has changed with our neurochemistry but the the second thing

23:42.360 --> 23:49.480
you know sometimes let's real quick short the reason we all know the term

23:49.480 --> 23:55.680
conspiracy theory today is because the US government sent out a memo after the

23:55.680 --> 24:00.920
assassination of Kennedy after the assassination of then-president Kennedy

24:00.920 --> 24:06.480
and the memo sent to papers of note and to broadcast radio said the following

24:06.480 --> 24:10.520
they said okay this is the official story this is what we figured out no we're

24:10.520 --> 24:16.920
not we don't have any secret smoky back rooms Lyndon Johnson is just a dick he's

24:16.920 --> 24:21.640
not some mastermind and if you hear anything else other than this official

24:21.640 --> 24:26.080
narrative you are to call it a conspiracy theory it's a term of abuse from

24:26.080 --> 24:29.640
the start like it's it's meant to discount everything that comes after you

24:29.640 --> 24:33.520
know yeah that's that's the whole point we sometimes say on the show like this

24:33.520 --> 24:37.720
isn't a conspiracy theory this is a fucking conspiracy yeah that one yeah

24:37.720 --> 24:41.560
thing sometimes you have to throw up our hands and say well how that one's true

24:41.560 --> 24:48.280
what did happen to JFK may as well while we're here yeah I listen to I was

24:48.280 --> 24:54.040
doing can we can we do that can we throw out conspiracy I just did yeah yeah I'm

24:54.040 --> 24:57.560
saying we should do that and then and then Brandon should do one and I can do

24:57.560 --> 25:03.600
one oh yeah yeah I listen to I'm afraid none of you can do that because the Jews

25:03.600 --> 25:10.840
won't let you all right so Dan you start it I listen to a podcast where a guy

25:10.840 --> 25:15.240
said like his dad was involved in like the State Department and stuff and he

25:15.240 --> 25:20.320
mentioned like like stuff happened to Kennedy and I was like I'm sure this is

25:20.320 --> 25:23.040
a lie but it was just crazy and obviously there's tons and tons of

25:23.040 --> 25:26.320
conspiracies theories are about but this was someone purporting that to that

25:26.320 --> 25:31.680
their family member was like talking some shit about shit he did to JFK and

25:31.680 --> 25:38.160
that's just crazy well there's a we can confirm he is dead he did get shot sure

25:38.160 --> 25:41.800
that part I agree with that those are the facts those are yeah those are the

25:41.800 --> 25:47.200
facts the facts are assassinations have happened yeah the fact is America has

25:47.200 --> 25:52.560
ordered them yeah and the fact is there are there are factions in both the

25:52.560 --> 25:56.320
private industry and in the criminal industry which is also private I guess

25:56.320 --> 26:01.800
and in our own state supported at times criminal industry that very much wanted

26:01.800 --> 26:07.240
that president out of the picture those things are true but you know one thing

26:07.240 --> 26:11.080
you have to be careful about when we put all these puzzle pieces together is we

26:11.080 --> 26:17.720
have to remember that in addition to being brilliant at creating pattern or

26:17.720 --> 26:24.320
seeing some where none might actually exist our species really really shits

26:24.320 --> 26:28.360
the bed when it comes to working together so the idea that there would be

26:28.360 --> 26:34.600
there would be a nefarious shadowy empire that somehow even though they're

26:34.600 --> 26:38.640
at loggerheads every other goddamn day of the week the fact that they would have

26:38.640 --> 26:45.620
some sort of Avengers level team up is it asked for us to believe in a lot of

26:45.620 --> 26:50.840
good things about humanity that are unfortunately that would be anomalous it

26:50.840 --> 26:54.280
is especially funny now like I remember when I saw Oliver Stone's movie how

26:54.280 --> 26:58.600
terrified I was and how anti-government the whole thing made me because I was

26:58.600 --> 27:03.600
just like he it was it was Camelot back then when that movie was made and it was

27:03.600 --> 27:09.120
talking about a time in which from the standpoint of that that movies production

27:09.120 --> 27:14.680
it was like god damn can you imagine oh the people that did this they're they're

27:14.680 --> 27:18.080
still watching there they've only gotten more powerful but it's funny now I'm

27:18.080 --> 27:23.800
46 and I live in this world where I'm thinking about the the idea of JFK

27:23.800 --> 27:27.480
getting assassinated and I I don't think this will offend anybody but I also don't

27:27.480 --> 27:32.000
want people to take this the wrong way but it's almost like I'm unlike God how

27:32.000 --> 27:36.760
great that would be if we're a war fishing government our government was

27:36.760 --> 27:42.080
that powerful because what what have we learned in the last two three years it's

27:42.080 --> 27:47.760
like we've we've been dissecting a pickled frog and we've been uncovering

27:47.760 --> 27:53.440
these things that that we're like well that's impressive that's complicated but

27:53.440 --> 27:57.480
we're certainly learning no one can start this thing's heart it's been soaked in

27:57.480 --> 28:02.040
formaldehyde the fact that I'm looking inside of it is because this frog is

28:02.040 --> 28:09.600
destroyed it cannot hop it cannot do anything that it we are we used to have

28:09.600 --> 28:14.560
three branches of government and right now as of three years look like like we

28:14.560 --> 28:19.920
now have like 12 to 25 just like Game of Thrones factions I'm I'm sure it's

28:19.920 --> 28:23.320
temporary I hope it is I hope the Constitution holds up but it's just

28:23.320 --> 28:29.600
amazing how how quickly you're reading headlines that say White House decision

28:29.600 --> 28:35.520
to pull out of this flummoxes the Pentagon while the CIA accuses the FBI

28:35.520 --> 28:41.120
whistleblower of co-operating with the Attorney General who was doing this all

28:41.120 --> 28:44.720
for the Supreme Court I was like goddamn I used I used to panic that all these

28:44.720 --> 28:48.560
dudes were out to get me yeah together I got out to give each other they're too

28:48.560 --> 28:52.120
fucking busy I should knock over a bank we're missing them I think we're missing

28:52.120 --> 28:56.800
the big question here I stopped using my tour browser oh shit I just want to know

28:56.800 --> 29:01.880
I just want to know what Moby knows okay his got his finger on the pulse of all

29:01.880 --> 29:05.040
this shit like there was a story that came out a year or so ago or Moby like

29:05.040 --> 29:09.160
talked some shit about how he was friends with an SA guy and knew that the

29:09.160 --> 29:13.040
Trump p-tape was real and knew all this stuff and then it just came out as like a

29:13.040 --> 29:17.200
very buried lead in like a Rolling Stone article that in fact Moby is friends

29:17.200 --> 29:22.240
with some deep level CIA types and he was telling the truth but it'll be funny

29:22.240 --> 29:29.200
if the guy like tweeted those like friends we fucked yeah I wouldn't call

29:29.200 --> 29:35.320
it friends yeah he gets reverse I wonder you know because that's that goes

29:35.320 --> 29:40.680
that's excellent point goes back to you know the JFK question which the thing

29:40.680 --> 29:45.880
that's so fascinating about it is every time they think ah this is crazy then a

29:45.880 --> 29:50.280
little bit of something that actually happened turns out to be true right like

29:50.280 --> 29:54.840
there's there are always these you know you can think of them as breadcrumbs but

29:54.840 --> 29:59.720
I think that's why it remains one of the most popular right in any poll how come

29:59.720 --> 30:05.640
he did not tell us what happened though Moby huh no what happened to Kennedy

30:05.640 --> 30:10.520
yeah well do you guys have a kind of like a trick this is their trip you are

30:10.520 --> 30:14.680
Harmontown bro you ain't gonna be able to fudge your way out well here's the

30:14.680 --> 30:17.800
deal with a lot of the things that we end up researching like this what you

30:17.800 --> 30:21.080
know you get to the here's where where it gets crazy part of our show and we

30:21.080 --> 30:25.360
have to analyze 12 things that are the possibilities of the theories that have

30:25.360 --> 30:30.040
been approached with something like JFK being shot and you kind of have to just

30:30.040 --> 30:34.840
weigh what feels the most plausible what feels the most possible and that's

30:34.840 --> 30:37.000
generally what we do we have a discussion about that but you guys are

30:37.000 --> 30:39.320
myth busters there's not a point at the end of each episode where you go

30:39.320 --> 30:44.560
Kennedy yeah who assassinated busted we also don't agree actually on this right

30:44.560 --> 30:49.840
particular okay well now okay okay power round go down the line all right

30:49.840 --> 30:58.120
tell us tell us tell us just cuz make you feel good yeah yeah all right well

30:58.120 --> 31:01.920
I'll just okay yeah so what we're talking about overall is the compartmentalization

31:01.920 --> 31:06.200
of intelligence agencies and you you never want the left hand to know what

31:06.200 --> 31:09.320
the right hand is doing if you're gonna do something in secret and that is

31:09.320 --> 31:14.120
that's something that people who have been creating intelligence agencies for

31:14.120 --> 31:18.240
a long time have been doing since the the world wars that's just the way they

31:18.240 --> 31:25.640
run and I believe that JFK was taken out for a lot of reasons and it I believe

31:25.640 --> 31:30.720
personally this does not mean it's true that it that he was taken out by some

31:30.720 --> 31:36.320
small group of people within I'm just gonna be as broad as I can within the

31:36.320 --> 31:39.960
deep state that took him out for reasons that perhaps we don't even know I think

31:39.960 --> 31:44.200
that makes other hundred percent sense but I also don't fucking know I think

31:44.200 --> 31:50.200
it's really I think it's really really weird it beggars belief to say that Lee

31:50.200 --> 31:54.480
Harvey Oswald given connections with Russia and given his international

31:54.480 --> 32:02.400
passage back and forth could have been a lone person it's it's also like think

32:02.400 --> 32:08.640
about think about first off the fact that his records show he was a piss-poor

32:08.640 --> 32:13.760
shot like that is that is clear that's been confirmed by multiple sources he's

32:13.760 --> 32:18.320
not some kind of you know born candidate who you know he are a

32:18.320 --> 32:22.120
Manchurian candidate born identity Manchurian candidate thank you that's

32:22.120 --> 32:27.080
the one yeah yeah you know I got the main words in there but yeah but the the

32:27.080 --> 32:35.400
idea I am of the belief that as much as we want to believe in state actors

32:35.400 --> 32:43.840
often what purports to be a state action is ultimately just like the state is the

32:43.840 --> 32:48.640
finger on the hand of larger private industry and you know wars are about

32:48.640 --> 32:53.600
resource extraction fuck idealism honestly and when it gets to the back

32:53.600 --> 32:57.920
room when the rubber hits the road so I believe that there were heavy private

32:57.920 --> 33:05.840
interests that were let's say if not directly if not directly like sending

33:05.840 --> 33:11.560
some you know bank hit man or whatever to do some some shady stuff I believe

33:11.560 --> 33:15.680
that there were private interests that were heavily involved and had the where

33:15.680 --> 33:20.640
with all to at least produce an assassination really fast can we get

33:20.640 --> 33:23.840
into your background a little bit then because this I think this is one of the

33:23.840 --> 33:29.000
reasons why our show is so interesting because Ben Ben was studying to perhaps

33:29.000 --> 33:33.560
you know do this kind to understand at least the way these things function and

33:33.560 --> 33:39.240
you were you were gonna be an assassin yeah he's gonna be an assassin he's a

33:39.240 --> 33:45.560
great shot to no just book depository management yeah yeah Ben you have a

33:45.560 --> 33:50.560
working understanding of the way states function so when Ben is telling you

33:50.560 --> 33:55.120
things like this a lot of times you know you may be a little skeptical listening

33:55.120 --> 33:58.520
to the things and take them as fact but Ben knows what he's talking about is what

33:58.520 --> 34:03.040
I'm trying to say throw me under the grass well I did I gotta say I was

34:03.040 --> 34:06.920
listening to the Odessa episode just this morning and there was this like

34:06.920 --> 34:11.320
weird thing dropped in there about like Ben how many times have you had to

34:11.320 --> 34:19.240
escape a country and there was no laughter and you just went seven eight

34:21.720 --> 34:29.880
that is that is primarily due to my my poor planning skills perhaps is the

34:29.880 --> 34:34.760
best way to say it I was originally you know in some universe to the left of

34:34.760 --> 34:40.520
ours I'm working for the State Department but in the course of pursuing

34:40.520 --> 34:48.760
that as as a career or whatever I mean I I quickly became disillusioned because I

34:48.760 --> 34:57.080
do not I believe there are many great people sounds great like we killed some

34:57.080 --> 35:04.080
people I know it's a good job if you want it I think it's I mean podcasting

35:04.080 --> 35:07.840
am I right right right that's where that's awesome shit that made you be

35:07.840 --> 35:12.080
like this might not be the job for me yeah it's not I mean it's not can't even

35:12.080 --> 35:17.160
talk about it right now okay it's just not it's I'm torn I'm torn Brandon

35:17.160 --> 35:21.840
because I don't want to say I don't want to say that everyone who works in the

35:21.840 --> 35:25.840
State Department or any of the alphabet soups of agencies here I don't want to

35:25.840 --> 35:30.880
say that they're automatically villains I but I do want to say like when you have

35:30.880 --> 35:35.600
a monolith it's a banality of evil when you have this monolithic entity with

35:35.600 --> 35:41.760
such power and such influence and such reach then very quickly morality becomes

35:41.760 --> 35:46.560
a matter of convenience and performance sure and I couldn't I can't hang with

35:46.560 --> 35:52.520
that it's got to be a crazy weird dental floss mobius floss thing like this way

35:52.520 --> 35:58.960
the idea that if you love America enough undoubtedly what you probably love is the

35:58.960 --> 36:03.640
idea of the Democratic Republic the idea of the thing that you're protecting then

36:03.640 --> 36:08.360
I could see like crossing that threshold of like I love that so much I'm gonna

36:08.360 --> 36:13.680
separate myself from that in what I know and what I'm able to share and I'm in

36:13.680 --> 36:17.800
even maybe some of what I do because hey that's how the sausage is made

36:17.800 --> 36:22.880
internationally and all these things but then it's like I can only imagine like

36:22.880 --> 36:29.320
where the dealbreakers are the greater good is the greater good is like jam

36:29.320 --> 36:34.400
tomorrow it's always a moving goalpost you know and people like no one thinks

36:34.400 --> 36:40.160
no one thinks yeah I'm the bad guy history is gonna fucking hate me man I'm

36:40.160 --> 36:46.760
just gonna go all out everybody who not everybody but people who often do

36:46.760 --> 36:52.120
terrible horrific atrocious things tend to think that they are doing it for a

36:52.120 --> 36:55.840
greater good they feel like they're you know rust cold they're they're like the

36:55.840 --> 36:59.640
bad man who keep the other bad men from the door and that's just not true

36:59.640 --> 37:04.680
they're regular people doing bad things you know and and when you're just like

37:04.680 --> 37:16.360
you said when you're does Trump have a time machine okay Trump's uncle still

37:16.360 --> 37:25.080
leaving where's the booze is it yeah was it Trump's uncle like was was like

37:25.080 --> 37:31.760
deciphering Tesla's like notes and stuff like that and and he found the secret

37:31.760 --> 37:37.880
set hell yeah Steve Levy ladies and gentlemen time travel do you know

37:37.880 --> 37:42.640
what okay okay okay okay okay buckle up all right so I actually do want to get

37:42.640 --> 37:46.200
on into something that we've we've talked about before on the show and that

37:46.200 --> 37:52.160
is the the concept of gaming out what could possibly happen using simulations

37:52.160 --> 37:58.840
on a global scale of governments of populations and the way a certain what

37:58.840 --> 38:02.080
X factor we're gonna hear about time machines no but this is what I'm telling

38:02.080 --> 38:06.160
we're talking about time machines but this is the setup this is almost a time

38:06.160 --> 38:09.720
machine where if imagine you had a simulator of the world in global

38:09.720 --> 38:14.840
politics where you could done you could see what happens if you could run a

38:14.840 --> 38:19.480
simulation if there's unrest in Nicaragua or something for some reason or if we

38:19.480 --> 38:24.320
happen to invade Iran next week what would occur what what all the what would

38:24.320 --> 38:27.080
the puzzle pieces look like from that point forward if you could do that

38:27.080 --> 38:30.680
effectively enough and accurately enough you could essentially have a time

38:30.680 --> 38:34.960
machine or at least a crystal ball yeah a version of it to where you could

38:34.960 --> 38:40.560
decide precisely which actions you could take and then you know a through z

38:40.560 --> 38:43.280
certainly even the public information that we have about Cambridge

38:43.280 --> 38:49.200
Analytica like like that's only what we know that that AI is already getting to

38:49.200 --> 38:52.160
that point to the extent that we are online to the extent that we behave in

38:52.160 --> 39:03.240
swarms the extent that you're right man it's kind of a time machine so are you

39:03.240 --> 39:07.880
talking about basically you know what I'm talking about are you talking about

39:07.880 --> 39:15.040
physically transporting someone but there's if that thing exists there's

39:15.040 --> 39:19.720
no fucking way that guy could figure out how to operate but the theory is the

39:19.720 --> 39:27.520
reason his brain is melting is because time travel is cancerous I mean he's

39:27.520 --> 39:36.120
losing his fucking mind well okay so first off I would watch that fringe

39:36.120 --> 39:39.600
episode but so what in like how is this like helping him out like how is this

39:39.600 --> 39:46.240
time he does look like Biff from back to the future too I mean he would be upon

39:46.240 --> 39:49.160
that's the scary thing about this morning's headline where he I don't

39:49.160 --> 39:53.080
even fucking understand enough about the reason to know that he that he pulled

39:53.080 --> 39:57.240
troops out of this and the some people are going why'd you do that I'm also and

39:57.240 --> 40:00.880
it's just like flash of those time travel theory where it's like this guy's

40:00.880 --> 40:05.880
just some Biff Tannen that's been like fucking thrust into the gear works by

40:05.880 --> 40:11.120
it's like it's not by his design yeah if he had a time machine he would have

40:11.120 --> 40:16.920
just invented cocaine yeah like he would just be hanging out he'd be a he'd

40:16.920 --> 40:20.400
have a successful hot tub company and he'd be like blowing David Hasselhoff

40:20.400 --> 40:24.760
he'd be fine and he'd have the dog track numbers or something yeah he'd be like

40:24.760 --> 40:39.680
part of the island yeah but but but he's not it's like he's he's like he like it is easy to believe in him as like a fucking crazy like monkey wrench that an

40:39.680 --> 40:45.360
alien or a time traveler would just casually knock in not not throughout just

40:45.360 --> 40:49.360
random like rhinestone cowboy like the next guy that walks on the door and like

40:49.360 --> 40:54.720
I've got a bet like but by virtue of his sheer proximity as Spencer's pointed

40:54.720 --> 40:58.640
out many times Donald Trump and running for president for 25 years there's no

40:58.640 --> 41:04.000
like we he constantly was running for president he and then finally like these

41:04.000 --> 41:10.560
like he did it's like if you look at the swarming behaviors and things like but

41:10.560 --> 41:14.920
him winning and the way he won and things and then and now the things he's

41:14.920 --> 41:20.160
doing it's just like it does lend itself to a crazy cosmic theory like you can't

41:20.160 --> 41:27.080
imagine anyone but a fallen angel or a robot profiting like evil Promethean

41:27.080 --> 41:30.680
figure bringing and the way that we're all kind of going like like we can

41:30.680 --> 41:34.880
remember Minority Report when she's like walking Tom Cruise through the mall and

41:34.880 --> 41:39.080
she's like duck now get an ice cream now all these things because she can see a

41:39.080 --> 41:43.680
little bit into the future and when you so what if you look at Tom Cruise's

41:43.680 --> 41:50.720
behavior as he's being serenade by this precog his behavior per our

41:50.720 --> 41:55.560
observation is crazy right because it's like now browse this magazine now do

41:55.560 --> 42:00.440
this now be random put on this hat duck buy a balloon held this pause three

42:00.440 --> 42:06.680
seconds now move forward that's Donald Trump like like and it's also our

42:06.680 --> 42:11.160
reaction like like what we the way that we're reacting to him being president

42:11.160 --> 42:14.960
reminds me of all of the people in the mall and Minority Report like we're

42:14.960 --> 42:20.520
we're always just just shy of going like wait a minute what the fuck you can't

42:20.520 --> 42:25.280
spell every time we're always just like like like well he can't he could never

42:25.280 --> 42:30.040
spell I don't I've got to get a great card it's always been true there's never

42:30.040 --> 42:34.560
the swarm never works and it's almost like there's been this tipping point now

42:34.560 --> 42:41.720
which scares me more that's like we're seeing this shift it feels like times up

42:41.720 --> 42:47.480
like like I think the bomb is armed so the Russians have a time machine right

42:47.480 --> 42:52.120
that they used to influence the election Baron Trump yeah and Nikola Tesla

42:52.120 --> 42:55.320
somehow was involved and the tweets are you know what I'm talking about I know

42:55.320 --> 43:00.120
who this book from the 1900s early 1900s that talks about this character who's a

43:00.120 --> 43:04.360
Trump and he meets a grandmaster who calls himself the Don and he takes him

43:04.360 --> 43:09.880
through time and he has a son no it was Baron Trump and Trump right and there's

43:09.880 --> 43:14.480
just these similarities in the book and then it's in a YouTube video but the

43:14.480 --> 43:17.680
YouTube video is kind of the thing where they kind of put their finger on the

43:17.680 --> 43:21.360
scale where they make it feel a bit closer and then they use them things that

43:21.360 --> 43:24.680
aren't true to kind of connect the dots a little harder than they're connecting

43:24.680 --> 43:28.240
but the end result is there's this book in the 1900s that's like there's this

43:28.240 --> 43:31.920
Trump guy and he becomes the president of the world and it's in this place it's

43:31.920 --> 43:36.440
like he has a mansion on on whatever the place the actual Trump tower is and so

43:36.440 --> 43:40.160
there's these weird connections right so we're talking about yeah yeah yeah that

43:40.160 --> 43:44.600
book real I mean the books real is a book a book is called the last president

43:44.600 --> 43:51.440
wow well you guys remember when the last president like all of the all of the

43:51.440 --> 43:54.480
rumors and things that were going on where people were like oh that guy's

43:54.480 --> 43:58.880
definitely the anti-Christ oh that guy's definitely these it's so much more

43:58.880 --> 44:03.760
about Clinton and Obama than they should about the guy yeah I read

44:03.760 --> 44:09.760
revelations Trump has a wound on his head that he survived scalp surgery

44:09.760 --> 44:14.880
anyways I remember yeah I guess what I'm trying to get at is anytime there's

44:14.880 --> 44:20.800
somebody in power we we tend to distrust enough it's just how we view

44:20.800 --> 44:23.600
authority a lot of times and I'm not speaking for everyone of course but a

44:23.600 --> 44:28.280
lot of us just have that in us where we don't want to necessarily agree with

44:28.280 --> 44:31.520
everything the person who's telling us what to do says this guy just lays it

44:31.520 --> 44:36.920
all out man in such a brazen way it's and I'm not excusing his insanity like in

44:36.920 --> 44:39.600
what we're going through right now my wife and I have a running joke that we

44:39.600 --> 44:44.320
feel like we did jump timelines around to 2016 because something feels off

44:44.320 --> 44:49.120
something feels time travel time travel machine I mean steam baron stain

44:49.120 --> 44:53.800
Mandela effect right yeah baron trump I mean and that's just a baron steam

44:53.800 --> 45:00.640
trump shit I don't know I'm glad that you still feel it's like a joke though you

45:00.640 --> 45:08.040
know that's got to be comfortable no it's not a joke the whole situation did

45:08.040 --> 45:14.120
you just yes no no no really no I'm continually Matt's very bothered by

45:14.120 --> 45:20.560
this and I am I'm bothered as well like I I'm to the point where someone makes a

45:20.560 --> 45:26.800
Trump joke and I think yeah but he's still fucking somehow up there you know

45:26.800 --> 45:31.440
what I mean and then it also as a cheapskate it bothers the shit out of me

45:31.440 --> 45:35.280
that every time I get a check from somewhere that guy's getting some of the

45:35.280 --> 45:40.560
money I don't know what he's gonna do with it he's an unhinged lunatic and and

45:40.560 --> 45:45.000
like it's not funny to me anymore we are in the wrong timeline I feel like I

45:45.000 --> 45:49.200
I'm so confused I go up and down I go to his sheer panic because I feel like I'm

45:49.200 --> 45:54.480
always in a good mood when he's in a bad mood and then I'm like why is what is

45:54.480 --> 45:58.960
that I didn't have that relationship with Obama like I don't why am I why do I

45:58.960 --> 46:02.760
care that like I'm so happy that the president's upset is he not in a bad

46:02.760 --> 46:07.440
well he's he's not a jolly guy but I like I like watching him I like I like

46:07.440 --> 46:17.640
waking up in the morning to a bunch of things even the fucking cynics and the

46:17.640 --> 46:21.760
what do you what do you call him kind of contrarians like they can't even

46:21.760 --> 46:26.080
muster the point of view that you're underestimating him again he's he's

46:26.080 --> 46:29.680
trolling you like I like those weeks where it's just like damn this dude

46:29.680 --> 46:34.400
fucking up like and then he's not taking it well and then like his tweets are

46:34.400 --> 46:38.560
like wins an egg not an egg I got a horseshoe and everyone's like what the

46:38.560 --> 46:44.880
fuck he spelled horseshoe wrong and I like those moments because it feels like

46:44.880 --> 46:51.000
a resolution as a writer I feel like the Mad King is like on the pyre and like

46:51.000 --> 46:56.360
dousing himself but I should know by now that that doesn't happen you know it's

46:56.360 --> 47:00.960
up like like like like but so then I and then I go into this panic where I'm

47:00.960 --> 47:06.320
like this whole thing is like beyond my control that's the reason why it's bad

47:06.320 --> 47:10.840
in the first place so in these moments when he's sweating and the CIA is yelling

47:10.840 --> 47:14.000
at the FBI and the FBI is yelling to the Supreme Court I was like I should be in a

47:14.000 --> 47:18.080
higher state of panic than when everything is running smoothly but we're

47:18.080 --> 47:22.760
just torturing children at the border yeah that's the thing that sadly has

47:22.760 --> 47:28.840
occurred to us I remember a while back Matt you and Noel and I were hanging

47:28.840 --> 47:33.480
out and we were we were talking about something we had lost some of the VIM and

47:33.480 --> 47:39.000
vigor about this fucking guy which is how we were phrased them and then and then

47:39.000 --> 47:44.280
we said like we had this moment where we we went back at an arms remove and

47:44.280 --> 47:48.960
thought about what future historians would think and then it hit us you know

47:48.960 --> 47:53.200
just how going back to your frog example like there's that old cliche about

47:53.200 --> 47:59.160
slowly boiling I know I know it's lazy writing but it's real and we also had

47:59.160 --> 48:03.680
this we had this moment where we're like it is stunning and astonishing and

48:03.680 --> 48:09.080
terrifying how quickly things become normal we're watching this guy publicly

48:09.080 --> 48:14.480
and hilariously fall down a set of stairs and everybody's like oh that's

48:14.480 --> 48:18.080
the bottom stair yeah right that's the last I'm just really pumped for the

48:18.080 --> 48:23.440
biopic when Gary Busey plays him I think that's gonna be a lot of fun I want to

48:23.440 --> 48:26.280
talk about something really uncomfortable that you're hitting on

48:26.280 --> 48:31.520
something that really resonates with me Dan like that the reveling in somebody

48:31.520 --> 48:38.800
else's misery because you dislike them speaking of but but isn't it

48:38.800 --> 48:43.840
uncomfortable to think that this man leads our country and we're happy that

48:43.840 --> 48:51.480
the leader of our country is doing the is is well if I was wrong thing what's

48:51.480 --> 48:55.880
the alternative if I was gonna counter that what I would say is I the part of

48:55.880 --> 48:59.480
what upsets me about the guy that makes me afraid of him when I'm in serious mode

48:59.480 --> 49:05.800
is that he represents this everything that he says oh he's joking about it

49:05.800 --> 49:10.160
he's oh or he's got the heart of America in his hand whatever but everything

49:10.160 --> 49:14.960
that comes out of his mouth is about an end of free press is about is it is

49:14.960 --> 49:20.160
about I I am the only kind of patriot I could ever possibly be is the kind of

49:20.160 --> 49:24.200
patriot that says I have a right to hate America etc that whole flim flam like

49:24.200 --> 49:27.480
like this idea that the reason this country is great is because you don't

49:27.480 --> 49:31.080
have to love it for God's fucking sake what kind of co-dependent relationship

49:31.080 --> 49:35.040
is that and everything out of his big blithery fucking syphilitic mouth is

49:35.040 --> 49:39.600
about how if I had it my I wish it was like Korea I just go back from Korea

49:39.600 --> 49:42.320
it's great over there you can they can turn you into soup if you don't like

49:42.320 --> 49:45.720
things and I'm just like I don't care that you're joking or that you're

49:45.720 --> 49:48.920
stupid that's fucking dangerous because it doesn't take intelligence to

49:48.920 --> 49:53.920
overthrow what we have which is Jesus Christ it's a fucking luxury that we

49:53.920 --> 50:00.600
like a whole engine is driven by a patriotic derision a cynicism like we

50:00.600 --> 50:05.800
constantly going I don't like the way this country is being run right now so

50:05.800 --> 50:12.160
I on one hand I know what you're saying is shouldn't it shouldn't it shouldn't

50:12.160 --> 50:16.920
drive us all into the streets in our underwear that we we can derive pleasure

50:16.920 --> 50:22.400
from the president's misery for me in those moments I think because I'm so

50:22.400 --> 50:27.680
deprived of them in an extreme way in in all of his other days to me I'm just

50:27.680 --> 50:34.240
like it feels like a brief suspension of a migraine and that registers as

50:34.240 --> 50:37.480
pleasure if you suffer from chronic migraines it's like oh there's not a

50:37.480 --> 50:42.720
nail being driven into my temple right now Trump like any fucking person who

50:42.720 --> 50:47.840
occupies that office is sweating bullets that's what you should be doing

50:47.840 --> 50:51.160
because part of your job is you're allowed to invade countries at your whim

50:51.160 --> 50:54.600
you're allowed to like launch missiles you're allowed to do whatever the fuck

50:54.600 --> 51:01.360
you want but I mean like if it doesn't just devolve in the total like totalitarianism

51:01.360 --> 51:05.040
Mad Max kind of situation at least it showed us the holes in this system in

51:05.040 --> 51:08.840
a way we haven't quite seen in this has been refreshing but I do also worry

51:08.840 --> 51:12.320
about it because it's like what we've been silver lining we've been seeing in

51:12.320 --> 51:16.440
this cow's stomach window for those who have state fairs and they're from their

51:16.440 --> 51:22.240
hometowns the 4h fans what we've been what we've been gazing into is there's

51:22.240 --> 51:26.240
this constant fear of like god damn it this guy was six IQ points from

51:26.240 --> 51:31.120
successfully being Hitler like like he was oh it's every time he fucks up

51:31.120 --> 51:35.280
every time he gets on a phone call it's being recorded or transcribed every time

51:35.280 --> 51:40.280
he every time he decides that I mean what if the the next guy it doesn't

51:40.280 --> 51:44.440
matter what his political leanings are our definition of insanity has been

51:44.440 --> 51:50.000
forever changed and the envelope is too loose now there are the checks and

51:50.000 --> 51:57.160
balances have been eroded if a gig becomes president and wears a burgundy

51:57.160 --> 52:03.480
jumper that with a logo on it that is the earth with a with a heart above it

52:03.480 --> 52:07.480
that represents like no more fucking bullshit no more hatred and we're like

52:07.480 --> 52:12.960
yay and then he tweets every once in a while hey Betty Cracker got her spoon in

52:12.960 --> 52:18.600
my ass and he misspells ass we're gonna be like well Trump misspelled his own

52:18.600 --> 52:23.040
name well that's Pete yeah that's how it's like we're gonna we're it's like

52:23.040 --> 52:27.560
we shouldn't we shouldn't tolerate that much insanity it scares me that forever

52:27.560 --> 52:33.840
now the office of the president is just like it used to be steeped in starch that

52:33.840 --> 52:38.160
like I think kept me safe but is there a course correction well that's I don't

52:38.160 --> 52:42.840
think so that's the thing that I love that you said forever that's a that's a

52:42.840 --> 52:47.880
fascinating word in this conversation because what we keep forgetting I think

52:47.880 --> 52:54.440
in national discourse in any conversation about this is that this is you

52:54.440 --> 52:58.080
know you'll see that shit around July 4th when people are like what a bold

52:58.080 --> 53:03.080
experiment but the American experiment it's great but it's true 200 years is

53:03.080 --> 53:10.880
not a long time at all really right now if this if this shit collapses right and

53:10.880 --> 53:15.120
we're all just running around having that conversation about when we have to

53:15.120 --> 53:20.360
eat a dead body then what what's gonna happen is that in the future people will

53:20.360 --> 53:25.920
say a bunch of folks got together in this one part of the world and for a little

53:25.920 --> 53:32.360
like for around 200 years worked okay yeah but everybody saw the signs right

53:32.360 --> 53:36.960
and so but the unspoken part of that is that well and the people before them

53:36.960 --> 53:42.920
had they had it right because that lasted 1500 years where whoever was the son of

53:42.920 --> 53:48.160
whoever was had the crown on last it's like time moves more slowly underneath

53:48.160 --> 53:52.440
those crowns because those people were even dumber and and we sped up time

53:52.440 --> 53:57.680
because we fucking rule and we we we we took capitalism and democracy to an

53:57.680 --> 54:01.640
extreme we did the most bad and we're on the most on record and we opened our

54:01.640 --> 54:06.560
books and we add fucking things to the Constitution it's like it's our we're

54:06.560 --> 54:12.240
the best of a bad lot as one of our guess what said I would disagree on two

54:12.240 --> 54:18.080
points first off I would disagree on two points and the first point is that

54:18.080 --> 54:24.360
while this purports to be a meritocracy anyone here would have a very

54:24.360 --> 54:29.160
difficult time explaining to someone from another place like yeah we elect

54:29.160 --> 54:32.800
people because they're the best they just happen to be fucking related to each

54:32.800 --> 54:37.120
other what a coincidence right that's like winning the lottery 12 times that

54:37.120 --> 54:43.320
that that kind of hierarchy that kind of a risk aristocratic approach to things

54:43.320 --> 54:50.080
happens and you know like like okay if the president is the the best compromise

54:50.080 --> 54:57.680
right the way the system was designed then why are so many related I always

54:57.680 --> 55:01.800
hated that and that's the thing that's like fucking just winded me is that I

55:01.800 --> 55:08.440
everything that got this guy elected or things that I felt like like in an

55:08.440 --> 55:12.040
objective sense in terms of a view of the bipartisan system I was like people

55:12.040 --> 55:16.360
would say I'm afraid Trump's gonna win and I would say Trump's not going to win

55:16.360 --> 55:20.600
because there's no difference between Democrats and Republicans and the whole

55:20.600 --> 55:24.560
systems rigged in there it doesn't even matter if you vote and everything that I

55:24.560 --> 55:29.800
said when I went into that Glockenspiel routine is that's how and why he got

55:29.800 --> 55:34.040
elected and it's also like he could be standing here and he'd be like doing the

55:34.040 --> 55:37.240
same thing and saying the same thing that I was saying and it like it is a

55:37.240 --> 55:41.440
bummer because I was like why so many Clintons why so many Bushes what why do

55:41.440 --> 55:44.840
we have dynasties if this if this job has anything to do with anything and now

55:44.840 --> 55:50.560
here here he is the first guy to break a streak and well not the first guy there

55:50.560 --> 55:54.560
was just why people like him so much because it wasn't broken a streak because

55:54.560 --> 55:59.560
it's Harvard it's it's that yeah it's basically that these clans set up a

55:59.560 --> 56:04.520
hierarchy and then they dominate for for more than 200 years true I'm getting

56:04.520 --> 56:09.200
another year that's a good point the other issue is that this is the conspiracy is

56:09.200 --> 56:14.800
that the presidency is what's causing this it's not one individual or one one

56:14.800 --> 56:19.160
government or branch of government it's a group of individuals that are half

56:19.160 --> 56:25.440
elected half not elected you know we are where we are because we allowed some

56:25.440 --> 56:29.480
of our power to be given up into politics instead of just basic daily

56:29.480 --> 56:36.600
maintenance so there's the the larger lie is that it's Trump because the truth

56:36.600 --> 56:42.560
of the matter is it's us we saw it we were told it was coming and we did not

56:42.560 --> 56:51.000
believe it well said this is Harmontown you guys this is like I love this all

56:51.000 --> 56:53.880
right moving on to our next segment halloween

56:53.880 --> 57:00.120
yeah yeah I don't want to get bought down to this guy but I think it's so

57:00.120 --> 57:04.240
amazing that they part of his culture is literally is all the conspiracy stuff

57:04.240 --> 57:08.480
and it's so funny that he's taken all the joy out of it too yeah yeah I like

57:08.480 --> 57:12.120
sucked all the meaning out of just like words you know I remember I was into

57:12.120 --> 57:17.080
Alex Jones like I didn't know Alex Jones for his he was really fun when he was

57:17.080 --> 57:20.360
on table Jones was the guy who thought everyone was a lizard I thought he was

57:20.360 --> 57:25.120
the guy in waking life and then I was that guy has a show and he was the guy

57:25.120 --> 57:31.440
that broke into the Bohemian Grove yeah they do that yeah that's creepy they do

57:31.440 --> 57:34.800
do that have you ever been there Dan will say what have you ever been to the

57:34.800 --> 57:39.800
be me I don't think I'm I may be a one percenter but I think part what one of

57:39.800 --> 57:45.520
the greatest tricks the one percent plays on you guys is it's like stock

57:45.520 --> 57:49.600
the one percent is there's a hundred percent of a one the one percent and

57:49.600 --> 57:55.440
there's a one percent of them okay I'm I just have a pool oh yeah yeah yeah but

57:55.440 --> 57:59.640
it's a nice pool yeah it's amazing to me when I look on Google I go like wait

57:59.640 --> 58:03.200
where what is the one percent all this stuff but I look depending on how you

58:03.200 --> 58:06.960
define it it's kind of like trying to define generation acts and generation

58:06.960 --> 58:13.040
they're millennial or whatever but I unless my unless I'm googling wrong or

58:13.040 --> 58:17.000
something I'm like what I'm a one percenter but then I'm like oh yeah I get

58:17.000 --> 58:22.080
well yeah who the fuck else like lives like this okay what really one percent

58:22.080 --> 58:26.280
they I think maybe I'm like what and then I go yeah I think I'm one percenter

58:26.280 --> 58:31.600
that's how fucked up it is out there that that there's like that me 21

58:31.600 --> 58:35.960
percenters but the rest the other 200 million of us are nine I hate to be

58:35.960 --> 58:41.320
really polyanna but I truly believe that my life is not that like like I feel

58:41.320 --> 58:46.720
like everyone should live like I live no that sounds so fucking even sad and I

58:46.720 --> 58:51.440
also do feel this is I guess why I you know I tend to I lean in the you know

58:51.440 --> 58:56.240
the more liberal direction is because they do I do feel like I'm like yeah I'm

58:56.240 --> 59:03.360
I'm clearly not holding like I like I got a lot of luck going on here and I'm

59:03.360 --> 59:08.440
only falling back on the fact that I'm not forced to share but like I do feel

59:08.440 --> 59:13.280
like like I look at my house and I go if I had to give up like 12 square feet you

59:13.280 --> 59:18.920
know that in a like I look at it like a video game I go like I'm pretty sure

59:18.920 --> 59:27.800
everyone could have a modest hacienda a modest hacienda with a pool Dan Harmon

59:27.800 --> 59:33.440
I really do feel I mean I don't like like we have these giant urban centers

59:33.440 --> 59:39.520
that are like we stack people up in these tenements but are we like those as we

59:39.520 --> 59:44.160
know they can have neighbors who are living very comfortably so we know that

59:44.160 --> 59:47.800
there's nothing necessarily about stacking people up in a giant urban

59:47.800 --> 59:52.800
center that necessarily means you have to live in squalor we just use that as an

59:52.800 --> 59:57.680
excuse and then like I just feel like people could live everyone could live

59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.320
pretty comfortably I mean the math is there that is correct logistically if

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:09.680
you look at it logistically everybody all the billions could have something

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.520
like an an equitable I don't want to say worry-free because there's no worry-free

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:21.880
life but could have some kind of situation where we are not I want to be

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.760
careful but we're not we're not having people who are starving we're not

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.160
having people who are dying of preventable disease well there's a

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.000
conspiracy theory that I'm sure you guys have explored in various parts of

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.280
in various episodes there that's a classic conspiracy theory that is

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:45.360
absolutely true which is that the the the more rich people you get getting

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.520
like access to technology and and and free time and a larger view of things

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:55.800
the more they are going to tend to use their power influence and wealth to

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.360
create a situation where they're not going to do what you do with weed

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.160
they're not gonna go holy shit I'm really high how can I get more of this and

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.840
share it with more people they're gonna do what you do with cocaine which is

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.800
like holy shit this is really good who saw me go in the bathroom they're there

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.440
you're you're going to be like I gotta get this shit on lockdown or it like like

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.920
there's just an instinct about it and it's all like you don't even need guys

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:32.760
in a cigar smoke room it's money itself will create a system it will if you

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.640
don't and here's where I say dirty words that I don't want to be associated

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:44.920
with if you don't regulate it unmitigated unregulated rampant fucking

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:53.440
high noon capitalism it is going to go and tear the middle class in half and

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:59.040
not not in half it's gonna tear the top 1% of the middle class and shove it up

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.280
and it's gonna tear the bottom 99% of the middle class and shove it down it's

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:10.680
going to capitalism unregulated doesn't become this perfect pyramid of money it

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:19.320
becomes it well it becomes feudal it becomes it becomes monarchs overseeing

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.920
potato people like the coke industry is actively working toward what I would

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.920
argue is neo feudalism also you know I find it very optimistic that we're

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:39.400
speaking in the conditional at this point like this this idea it's what an

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.320
adu is yes an adu is you can build a poor person's shack on your huge fucking

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.280
piece of land and charge them for it just like we did during the feudal shit

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.040
where you might have two three people who are paying you rent to live on your

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.800
manner so you don't have to sell your manner it is it isn't conditional it's

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.600
where we are and and should they not be able to afford that rent maybe there's

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.040
things they could do to keep the land

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.660
maybe there's a direct deposit for their paycheck like hey thank you you trimmed

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.280
a bush now you can live here for another month if there were a specific form of

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.320
currency that only applied right to that manner right to that land and this this

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:29.480
is something that we're right with your face on it so this is something though

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.440
we talked about that we had a difficult time cracking the three of us Matt

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:41.120
Nolan and I were thinking we we posed this question we're we're kind of we're

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.760
kind of shitting each other in conversation I don't know if you picked

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.720
that up because because we're like we pose questions that we don't have answers

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.680
to right and one of the questions that do with us that's just the nature of this

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.920
kind of discourse that is shitty though well you're right do you mean on this

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.960
show or on your podcast or what do you what do you say more in our personal

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.880
yeah like we're at Dave and Buster's or something I think it's inspiring how

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.200
kind you guys are to each other on the podcast like like I don't know how much

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.000
you edit if like you guys are dicks to each other then you edit out yeah but I

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.960
think it's right you guys take great pains or maybe you don't take great pains

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.480
maybe that's me projecting I must hurt to be nice but you guys like like one of

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.680
you will say something and then like like you guys have a like an almost tick of

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.920
going like even if it's absolutely not what you were talking about you'll you'll

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.760
you'll go like that you know what that's a good way of putting it and then you'll

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:37.400

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:43.040
that's kind of made its way all the way to 2019 do you think there's anything to

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.080
any of like ritual ritualized versions of that literally anything to yeah yes

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.440
because I'm whether or even if it's just the intention of wanting something so

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.960
badly and then ritualizing the the act of saying that this is what I want like

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:02.520
prayer even if it's silly okay well I mean no yeah I believe in a subjective

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.120
level like I think that there's there's almost no limit on what you can

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.920
accomplish ritualistically with yourself like like it's you know that's the

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.760
boring answer it's like the miracle in 24th Street well he thinks he's Santa but

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.160
I think you could I think you can't you can convince yourself anyone that's in

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.200
the room with you when you cast a spell I I don't think there's any limit on what

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.760
you can like make those people do so you're talking in terms of practical

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:41.480
effect right yeah I'm saying like like the human capacity to believe in well I

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.800
would use the word bullshit but like that makes that's pejorative but like like

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.720
phenomena to believe in shit that has no corporeal like like like cause-effect

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:54.200
relationship like you you could draw a circle of chalk on the ground and say

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.920
the reason I'm drawing the circle of chalk on the ground is because you're a

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.560
winner and you're a loser and I'm gonna flip that right now by saying chaka chaka

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:08.240
mooka mooka oh no I said it backwards oh no freaky Friday like like I mean

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.800
though I believe that we've seen we see all the time like people will drop down

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.480
on the floor speaking tongues though people regress in their hypnotic

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.800
sessions it really does it's almost a moot point whether or not it's real or

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:27.440
not really a Hulk exist could could a Hulk exist yeah yeah like an incredible

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:35.240
whole totally maybe not like a fair to mid-late yeah yeah yeah just a story you

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.400
know I'm glad you say that because I I think you know I was again I best

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.040
definition I heard of magic by the way Matt I think we talked about this

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.240
weaponized psychology which I think is in line right you are saying um Hulk back

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.160
to back thank you yeah yeah yeah of course um thank you for considering me

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.720
you picked up on how interrupted I was and okay yeah I want you to see

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.120
grease grease that wheel I'm just gonna sit here yeah no you'll be rewarded

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.800
grease him grease him up so so you're gonna fly through the grocery store it

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.880
goes pay attention to him see at the finish line well this is something I

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.520
want everybody's opinion on because like so so there's this there's this thing

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.440
with with the Olympics right the Olympics are always like eye is the

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:25.360
peak of human ability right and drugs every one's on drugs though every one

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.680
well they're on like a lot of green people it's so loop holy okay so you're

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:41.560
married to the color idea of it wouldn't be thank you and read for a time oh

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:47.240
what yeah are you sure yeah and then also Thunderbolt whatever there's

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:53.720
different we could go on but but the idea is like why so baseball when

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:58.520
baseball first started it was considered cheating to use a black people to catch

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:16.280
the ball I mean I thought we were just a couple more episodes left I think the

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.680
idea of like it being like an unfair advantage or like corking your bat or

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.320
something like that or like greasing you know like spitting on the ball or

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.400
whatever that was a thing and now it's like you know without the racism which

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.880
was fucking terrible and huge there there's still this idea that like Lance

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:37.360
Armstrong an amazing cyclist got in trouble right a boo who he used drugs

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.160
he only had one not so he got a pass yeah and so so I want to see I think our

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.320
best chance to see a fair to middling Hulk as you describe it is to have an

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.680
Olympic event of some sort people sign a release like yeah I might die whatever

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.960
and they can do what whatever the fuck they want you know what I mean oh yeah

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.800
what kind of engineer Olympics holy shit yeah you should have a separate fucking

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:17.000
holy shit I'm thinking like the idea like the idea of people doping it's a

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.320
lost battle it's going to happen the the lid of Pandora's jar is unscrewed and

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.040
everybody's lying to themselves yeah if they think they can screw it back the

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.640
reporters covering how many cups of coffee it was a jar it was a jar it was a

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:38.600
jar it sounds dumb just sounds dumb it sounds dumb but it was a jar what

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:47.080
caliber of Hulk was was Hogan was he a middling Hulk or was he did you guys see

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:55.080
the video by any chance of the I think quadriplegic is the word you if the

01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:02.520
quiet that he's paralyzed from below his neck and he's operating a full body

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:08.600
the exoskeleton yeah yeah yeah yeah that's cool that's awesome I tell that guy

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.880
that the Olympics should eliminate drugs well that you know what I mean that's

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.840
that's a good point and he's like oh yeah cuz like well you to eliminate drugs

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.560
we gotta eliminate what you're born there should be mechs in the genetic

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.480
engineered Olympics that sounds great yeah there should there should be one

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:32.040
category that I think would quickly lose its luster if it because it was

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.720
Evelyn no I'm saying the league I'm saying like everyone could have their

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.560
purest Olympics and and there wouldn't even it would the problem would solve

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.720
itself people wouldn't be incentivized to cheat in those they wouldn't like go

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.680
into the purest Olympics and like sneak steroids they'd be like I want to go

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.320
into the steroids Olympics and and then just have this like crazy fucking like

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.480
weird like dark future thing where it's like and coming to the corner using the

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:04.880
latest in cybernetic augmentation Andre on drop off the blood dope robot from

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:15.120
Mars 30% humans according to some experts he is mostly pickup truck but

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:23.320
oh Russian I just have a race around a circle everyone's gonna watch that you

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.480
would want I'd watch it yeah like I'm not gonna watch it people in Vegas would

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.720
go crazy no I'm gonna watch the swimming competition that were the guy that was

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:37.040
born with long feet wins the organic Olympics really oh felpy you did it

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.320
again with your weird long feet it's all about the human interest story there

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.560
it's true so this is a perfect transition to like Boston Dynamics and DARPA and

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.880
some of the robots and androids that are being created some of them are very

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.480
humanoid like what do you guys think about all of that stuff oh that's real

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.320
yeah yeah it's completely real but what do you where do you think we're headed

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:06.040
with all of that is it we're headed toward yikes shit we're all definitely the

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.680
question is in our lifetime you guys look younger than me if most of your hair

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.960
I am I gonna see like an actual like fucking like just like wake up one

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.600
morning and it's like bleh everything's just like just converted to AI algorithm

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.760
thing or will I just be like a 70-year-old guy going like I don't like

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.920
these new fangled USB ports on your forehead I need that like a hole in my

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:45.080
head write that down Cody and Cody will be like I'm 40 yeah I don't you know it's

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:51.360
it's it's more and more I went back and I rewatched the Terminator franchise

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.480
with parts of it and I was like yeah the the robots when they started out people

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.200
would talk about it in hindsight and they only like we could tell the

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.000
difference between those right and it's a fit it's a story about a physical

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.520
analog but now we're at the point where in terms of software in terms of like

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.720
online non-corporeal conversation it can be difficult to tell to discern the

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.440
difference when it's also becoming increasingly apparent that our biggest

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:23.840
sins are original ones like we we have rounded a corner our friend Asperger

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.960
detective that's our horrible word for him his name is Ryan Krause the host of

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:36.280
cold case murder mystery files he he constantly he's talking about just like

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.000
look talk about the shit all you want we're all gonna become AI and then our

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.840
problems are gonna be solved and all and he talks about the Terminator

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:50.080
franchise and our relationship with it as sort of measuring that that the you've

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:57.160
got your 1981-83 movie where the you know the robot is unquestionably the bad

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.920
guy the whole premise is set up it's based on our fetishization of fearing

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.840
technology it's classic beautiful wonderful modern myth that's just like

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.640
that before the words algorithm and AI where household words it was just sort

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.160
of like they put they put this thing in charge of defending the country and then

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.680
this thing decided that the best way to defend it was to get rid of all the

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.760
people beautiful perfect it set this thing back in time if you blow its fake

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:32.040
skin off what's underneath death but chrome it comes for you the sequel comes

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.600
years later and immediately what are we doing and why did we love that movie our

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.480
our love affair with our villains we love our Jason Voorhees our Freddy

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.800
Krueger like we don't love the screen Queens that run from them we love this

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.040
metal robot and then he's the good guy in the next movie we love the guy that

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.320
said I'll be back we love the guy that is the robot the robot in that movie that

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.320
people a lot of people say that movie is why I know about the first movie I

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:05.080
fucking love that New Testament where now the robots the good guy the as that

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:10.720
franchise continues and as our sci-fi kind of relationship continues like we're

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.120
we're getting increasingly more like we're doing a mating dance with

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.920
technology we are we we used to simply Rod Serling would simply come out and

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:27.360
basically say imagine a world where we get so automated we basically become

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.800
Russian a garage door that opens when your car pulls up but where are the

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.920
limits and if that garage door knew you murdered someone who should it and it was

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.240
like technology is like like like what where will it end and you proceed

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.480
forward along those lines we're like cautious we're cautious we're cautious

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.480
but that's how a tango begins that's how a mating dance about a mating dance he

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.440
got movies like her like ex machina literally about like a relationship with

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.000
an AI that's better than a relationship with someone that you know you know he

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.320
has to he has to accept that because yeah I mean exactly that's why that we're

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.560
getting increasingly comfortable with those stories we're we're we're becoming

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:16.640
aware that not that we're shaking are it's ironic because we're shaking our

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.680
xenophobia when it comes to the difference between human and non-human

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.920
we're getting increasingly racist we're getting increasingly like heightened

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.840
about like your cheekbones are different what's with your identity politics and

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.200
just because a woman did this doesn't mean like it's like we're regressing

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:38.080
we're going but we're worshiping the idea of we got it and it's almost like you

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.760
wonder what a crayfish or a dragonfly or anything it sheds its skin feels about

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.400
itself as it starts to evolve does it start to just pick in itself is it's

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.680
like oh well it does that is that a metaphor for like what we're doing was

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.840
like this war between the genders and the races and the cultures and the classes

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:02.480
and we're just like shredding ourselves is it because what's underneath is we

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.680
gotta like we got to just become an algorithm or we're gonna die where we

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.280
it's like we're it's not gonna work this this plan where there's just like an

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.520
eight billion barrel of monkeys like sitting on top of a planet that needs to

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.360
give up its oil or fucking die well I think where we we we have messed up

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:28.280
often is this assumption that what's going on now is the end point you know

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.720
what I mean like some species of life sort of exist in this in this state

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:37.120
where they have you know they have like the origin point right and then they

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.040
create the other the other animal that is or life form this midway point and the

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.840
thing at the end just to your your idea about shedding skin or I would say

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.640
entering a chrysalis as well it is something different fundamentally alien

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:59.360
unrecognizable it's it's preposterously self-centered for us here now to assume

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:06.040
that in a thousand or maybe even six hundred years the the people that call

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.920
themselves people are also going to refer to us as people yeah it's pretty

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.480
ridiculous I I feel like it's optimistic they're gonna we're going to be

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.760
narcissistic not their species that is like a fundamental like like cup of

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.360
coffee like like you're thinking about it like there is absolute it should we

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.120
survive six hundred years from now there's absolutely no way that what we

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.760
are six hundred years from now is going to refer to us as the same species that

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:37.160
that is well there's one one scenario in which they will it's the kormic

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.960
McCarthy the road yeah oh yeah they'll they'll they'll go like oh the

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:46.280
progenitors the people that had computers all out shit you know they'll be in

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.000
like bunkers they won't go outside we don't care about their opinion yeah

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.600
assuming we continue to evolve we along even the slowest lines six hundred

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:03.240
years which anthropologically is it is nothing we are we are at the point where

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:11.920
we are either going to change so much that what we are now it will be forgotten

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:17.480
historical neanderthalic like we will we will simply there will be people that

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.520
will study how we thought there will be people who will I hope they'll listen

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:27.840
to this podcast and they'll go what weren't they cute there's skulls were

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:32.080
separated and they just kept blithering and blabbering and like they

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.320
self-medicated and they coped with all this shit they had a whole internet and

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.800
they just used it to be racist they had these things called hands they had to

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.240
use everything was fingers and typing and they're just like they they kept

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.600
talking about holograms like that was the future they didn't understand that

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:52.640
like intelligence was a field and that they were a proxy and that what we

01:21:52.640 --> 01:22:00.000
became was it or I or they or them and yeah we will yeah that's for sure that

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.160
kind of takes the pressure off doesn't it totally like who cares nukes like

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.560
fucking Bay of Pigs who cares how we go out is there a is there a way to spot a

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:14.760
conspiracy that has legs versus a way that like classic line conspiracies

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:21.560
follow this pattern absolutely yeah yeah you can you can just see it like

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.840
there's a trick to see it like do you check for like three or four things where

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.760
you're like all right that's yeah like that's worth researching like a towel

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:36.120
well I would just say generally just and sorry Ben to step on you here if we can

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.680
go back and say historically there are there's more than one version of this

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.600
kind of conspiracy that has occurred that's generally the first step to going

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.360
okay well there's at least a precedent to something like this happening which

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:56.960
means it's not completely implausible and generally that's if less sure like

01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:07.400
just like that but like syphilis testing has happened human human testing that's

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:14.240
not a theory that should happens a lot and over the years it has and it's

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.720
really hard to even detect oh god I'll go down a rabbit hole let's not do that

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:24.400
okay you got it experimenting with humans I mean some of the most brilliant

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.120
people on this planet have been really fucked up and wanted to see what things

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:34.600
happen like if you think about anatomy and Franklin had a tool shed oh no so

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:38.160
you pointed out I was good I was making a joke

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.120
he dissected corpses or something right no they found with somebody for search

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.180
where they found a bunch of bodies yeah yeah yeah yeah Ben Franklin damn

01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:01.240
he had a tool shed it was a what they call a resurrection man right yeah well

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:08.640
he was resurrection adjacent reaction manager he his landlords is one of his

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:14.200
landlords children was a resurrection man the house he was living in at the time

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:20.200
was like the next place over was where they publicly hanged people so they

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:26.320
would hang someone and then the long story short he may not have been

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.640
dissecting people but he fucking knew the smell think about the smell he knew

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.880
there was no way to take Ben Franklin lived next door to a place where they

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.920
hang people and he liked it and he was like like hauling people into his tool

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.680
shed what's the resurrection man it's like when you dig up bodies and use it

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.680
to for experiment science because think about it you had to we didn't know much

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.320
about what was inside of these things that we walk around in and the only way

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.640
to figure it out was to cut them open after they were dead and just pull all

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:01.640
the bits out and CEO women had fewer teeth yeah yeah which is weird cuz he

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:06.200
was around so many mouths he could have just looked and you think it wasn't a

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:12.360
life expectancy 17 back then you could just like same number of teeth but I

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.880
don't think you just didn't want to talk to I guess he was born to the theory

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.200
side of it I don't know right and he probably died at 19 like he just right

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.960
yeah one of these days I should count women's teeth I'll get to it I'll get

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.880
to it in the meantime give me a lever and a place to stand and I'll move the

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.680
world that's our committees that's our committees but he was probably always in

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.880
a sorry I derailed you please I'm not going anywhere

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.640
human experimentation resurrection resurrection there was a loophole in

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:46.320
European law at the time which said that it was okay to dissect dead bodies

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.880
human bodies cadavers but it was there was no legal way to procure them it was

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.080
like a grizzly version of how marijuana has worked in some parts of this

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.880
country like you can own it but if we catch you buying it if it gets you

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.200
digging it up yeah if we catch you digging it up and then that goes back I

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.640
think what you're building toward is this idea of human experimentation yeah

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.760
okay this is this is the point I want to make talking about this and it's it's

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.120
only tangential but we've had a couple of thought experiments on our show

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.280
before when you think about World War two and unit 731 in Japan and what the

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.040
Nazis were doing in several places they were experimenting on humans and they

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:32.640
were taking humans to to to see the limits of what a person can withstand

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.560
right and they wrote all of this shit down after they tortured people this

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.040
way and they took a ton of data and we've had a discussions about well what

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.840
do you do at the end of that conflict where you stop those evil people from

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.800
doing terrible things to other humans but they've got all of these pieces of

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.040
paper written down filing cabinets full of with data data that could possibly be

01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:00.040
useful for for us to know about what humanity can withstand just ergonomic

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.360
desk chair industry stuff like wow I didn't know you could make someone's

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:10.520
slouch for 90 hours well Herman Miller was really into all this because you

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:17.840
can't repeat the experiments yes you should do you talk to the data well

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.080
and that's what we've been doing it's the the palimpsest thing that been you're

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.760
really great about talking about with history we've been doing that to each

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.360
other that kind of thing where we're we do terrible things to each other but we

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.000
figure out something and then we know for the future that that is something we

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.920
can or cannot do there's always someone saying I'm not the bad guy it's the

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:42.680
greater good serious yeah well I think about the origins of gynecology which

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:52.240
are barbaric the vagina just so I mean yes definitely your that origin you're

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:58.880
in the ballpark yeah it was the doctor who performed on slaves yeah exactly

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:05.320
recently ripped his statue down in New York thank God finally man thank you I

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.360
honestly don't know where we were going with this whole thing but we were

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.200
talking about conspiracies and the reason is how to recognize one is one

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.200
of legs trying to figure out if there's yeah if there's a if there's like oh we

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.440
have four things we're definitely on the right path or if you're like you know

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.280
it's missing these four things it's probably just the ones with the ones

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.560
with ghosts are usually bullshit I'll put that one out there it's like a

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.800
guarantee well there's ghost conspiracies oh yeah times mainly by

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:34.720
ghosts for you two episodes a week dude we got a we got a dig yeah I mean I was

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:41.800
just talking to Kate the star of that shuttered show that Rob does you know

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.360
she's a producer and stuff and she said that two different psychics told her

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:52.520
she had an Italian speaking evil spirit and then she also had in the same spot

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.080
she was diagnosed a spirit she had an aura photographer take a photo of her

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:03.320
aura and had a spot right in that same spot but that's crazy not like a holy

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.440
shit she didn't have a proper or I understand she just had this you know

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.280
spirit spot above her head I'm also like I'm being a cynic but like I'm not

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.440
saying that spiritual stuff and ghosts aren't real but it's that I tend to

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:21.760
gravitate more towards the provable kind of government that's proof there's a

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:26.760
photo you know seriously what happens when we die guys are we get can we come

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:30.800
to a consensus right here on the stage right now what exactly not what I'm

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.560
saying is there they're we we don't know really I want spirits exist in demons

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.160
and shit I haven't seen anything but man that would be so cool would be

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:47.120
live enough I know I just around people keep sending me links to this Navy UFO

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:51.000
thing yeah yeah yeah it might people might yell at me for having you guys on

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.680
the stage and not bringing that up right okay because I live in gravel like I'm

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.480
separated from the earth and I've gotten from more than one person like have you

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:03.040
seen this so that means everyone's talking about a little flippy crafts where

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.760
they're talking about a long time to me it just reminds me of the 70s it's like

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.280
it's like the same old shit it's like but it's it's funny to watch like a new

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:17.880
generation saying the exact same things about the exact same amount of obfuscation

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:22.200
and like it's just sort of like they like there's articles about people going

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.760
like yeah there's three categories of these things there's the diamond-shaped

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.120
ones I'm like yeah this is all the same stuff from the 70s have you guys been

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:37.920
following this like maybe footage yeah so this this ties into the way to the way

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.760
to identify something that might have some sand to it versus something that's

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:49.120
sort of you know a creepypasta because we're also like conspiracy theory itself

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:55.360
is a genre of folklore that is like that is an accurate question was asking

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.360
which maybe we don't have an answer to is can you tell one that has like a

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:04.440
political weaponized stinger on it yeah like oh Jenny McCarthy wants you to not

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:08.760
vaccinate your children so she reverse engineered a story about Ben Franklin

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:14.480
vaccinating his kid with yeah yes the that's exactly it so quick way to

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.640
identify something that might have some sand with it is usually it's people who

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:22.280
have some sort of power whether financial right or socio-political who want

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:26.440
more of it and have figured out want to lose what they have or don't want to lose

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.560
what they have to that that conversation the the thing that's

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:36.800
interesting about UFO calm common ideas is that we conflate the idea that

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:43.240
there's something in the sky which most people don't understand we conflate

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:48.120
that with the idea that extraterrestrials a give a shit enough about

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:53.320
this planet that they would they would span the vast chasms of time and space

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.720
to show up and like stick things up people's butts it's they that's a weird

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:02.480
that's you know what I say you're being reductive there I am being I am

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:06.320
reductive I am being reductive because we don't know what they do when they get

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:10.160
here we might perceive it as they stuck something up my butt because of our

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.680
tendency to like that's that's our takeaway we're very butt-centric we're

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:17.360
like then they put something in my butt and the aliens are like watching the

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.920
news and going like what we did more than that yeah like we taught them

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:26.560
technically the way it's like if our dogs described like those taking them

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:31.640
for a walk or like they fucking choked me and he's gonna I was like well come

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.560
on you were wagging your tail that's a that's a really good point and the the

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.480
thing is so like we're also I would I would further add to that point that we

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.400
are we are operating from our understanding of physics right we're

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:49.040
operating from our understanding is reality in the world as we perceive it

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.120
which is at best kind of a shitty flashlight in a very big very dark room

01:32:53.120 --> 01:33:00.520
but we what we know and what we can prove we know and what we can all agree on

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:05.560
is that yeah we see shit in the sky we don't know what it is it is literally an

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:10.240
unidentified flying object yeah and that doesn't that doesn't mean that's

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.720
anything other also we have a government that spends billions and

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:21.840
billions and billions of undocumented money making shit that is now real this

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.320
is true that we're not gonna see 10 15 there is an area 51 yeah that's just a

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:40.000
thing yes like no it's it's not good for a first world empire that's in charge

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.800
of everything and has unlimited spending to have a place where cameras can watch

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:50.040
them do the equivalent of all the black and white footage of the guys trying to

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:57.280
invent the helicopter it's just like that it's the area 51 is just a place

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.880
where the Air Force is constantly trying and failing to make like a diamond

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.880
shaped helicopters right and then and then people are like whoa look at that

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.680
and it's like yeah that's a it's gotta be it's I mean I'm not a guy that doesn't

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:18.040
believe in aliens I just I just yeah I think that any anybody that was ever

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:26.520
visiting us why would they send it's not gonna I just yeah is there a little

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:33.160
dude in a thing going like humans I'm watching them with my sports car that I

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:38.240
fly it's like obviously no they would they probably poke a hole in space and

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:42.760
time and the thing that popped out would likely not be visible to us in the

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.720
equivalent of a drone right what's the conspiracy we should have paid

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:58.440
attention to but did not whitewater we might have three different answers yeah

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:03.400
what do you think that I just before we get there the important thing with the

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:11.560
UFOs bendy buck let's just milk it was an inside job milk was an inside job the

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.680
important thing with the UFOs story was that we know about Project Blue Book and

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.840
bunch of these projects that occurred from the 40s onward up that we're

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:24.040
studying the government studying UFOs what is it what could it possibly be it

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.840
had to do with the Cold War as well as we got into that era just trying to

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.400
figure out which country maybe is outclassing us with technology should

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:34.520
be worried about that well agreed at that time but then the official story was

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:37.240
that it went away we don't we're not worried about anything like that anymore

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.200
that's that stuff is hogwash there's no extra terrestrials everything's fine then

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.520
this footage gets leaked and then we find out that wait in fact our government

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.720
has been studying unidentified flying objects this whole time and there's a

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.960
lot of data there and there are people that you know about like names within

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.280
our government that were actually Tom DeLonge no it wasn't Tom DeLonge there

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.480
are there are people he's in the Senate that were running stuff I mean it how

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.520
does it make you guys feel when because the big headline of that thing seems to

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:12.560
be that the Navy said in an uncharacteristic like they're like yes

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.960
that's legit they tried to get in front of it we didn't want you to see it I found

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:22.360
it weirdly underwhelming why is that isn't that sad I couldn't tell I was in

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.480
this day and age when everything's been so stirred up I was sort of like my I

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:31.640
guess my my gut was sort of like ah is everybody just so scared right now that

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:37.000
that like we're just being gentle people now like like that the Navy's like

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.480
like some guy who's in charge is like you know I'm probably gonna get fired

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.600
tomorrow for like saying the wrong thing about a haircut so like what is my job

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:50.240
for real like am I gonna be an admiral tomorrow am I gonna end up the Secretary

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:53.800
of State probably I get like like I've I've had this conversation with my

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.920
fiancee I'm gonna fucking play it as it lays and it came across as jaskin he's

01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.920
like just tell him the truth Henderson and Henderson's like the truth sir it's

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.560
like you hurt me at ease do whatever it's like tell him what's it like yeah it

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.240
leaked it's not footage that the Navy hands out we don't know if it's a you

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:17.480
a fucking alien but like fuck it things are like operating bureaucratically

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.760
that was just like the Navy says real footage of a real UFO don't know if

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:27.800
it's an alien yes those bros you hear flying those top gun planes that's them

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:32.560
going like what the fuck bro that is then as opposed to the traditional thing

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:37.560
of like we can either confirm no denials are you and you who got to me yeah it

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.960
was like I that was my that was what my heart said but then I had to follow it

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:44.920
up with like panic of like ah that's what they I know this is what they want you

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:49.360
to think but disinformation within that realm is just the norm I mean if you

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.360
think about the Vietnam War what was allowed to actually be reported within

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.040
United States of what's going on for strategic advantage something like that

01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.000
if we're if there are actually extraterrestrial species of some sort or

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.760
some faction visiting us then why on earth would anyone who knows about it

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.160
who's afraid for national security purposes for humanity's purposes why

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.800
would they ever come out on any news source anywhere and say yes this is a

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:18.240
thing like they died I can't imagine that ever occurring but also people are

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.560
very terrible at keeping secrets like super shit it's certainly what we've

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:28.360
learned yeah like and we and we've pitted the height of like this could

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:34.400
profit you against it like we have seen people definitely facing like we've been

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:41.080
so cynical about the the supposed incentive of like well nobody wants to

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:45.080
get fired and everyone just does what they're supposed to do and it's like a

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.040
jumper cable has been attached to the wrong post of a system and I'm not

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.840
saying is perfect and has any kind of inherent like integrity to it but it's

01:38:53.840 --> 01:39:01.080
just like this weird fucking rando dude like has revealed that most human

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:06.720
beings even if they work on a government payroll are kind of like cool yes sir

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.880
I'll do that god damn it do your diary this motherfucker made me do some fucked

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:15.680
up shit hey Stacy if I get shot tomorrow tell them and Stacy's like what

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.500
did you just tell me what I think you told I got it you know I gotta tell

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:22.760
Marshall tell Marshall fuck you I was like like I'm finished with my job this

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.080
motherfucker told me to do some crazy shit yeah I quit well you should quit well

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.600
then I did quit you're a whistleblower so are you who you should quit and meanwhile

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:33.080
he's like you're fired you're fired you're fired and everybody it's it's

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.200
working the same way a Starbucks does and I find that refreshing that they're

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.960
not so different I that's the one layer of it but I'm like this is all working

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:48.280
the exact way I would think human beings that are that they're on they're not all

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:54.080
weird people in warehouses keeping the Illuminati secrets from us that it's

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.880
been exposed that they're mostly just dunder Mifflin right and to to what

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:04.080
you're saying like there's this paradigm shift and it goes to like the cost of

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:10.280
information right in the 50s for instance people would say you know if

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.160
we're a G person we're a government agent we would say well the truth can't

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:20.600
get out people learn about shit through you know one of the following 16 ways

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:27.240
we'll shut those 16 ways down and now that there are billions I I always think

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.800
about like if you guys ever growing up and your parents did something fallible

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.720
and human and you were like what the fuck you're someone yeah someone's supposed

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:42.360
to be in charge you know what I mean and like I'm I can't believe mom just

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:49.320
threw my birthday cake at my dad yeah did I turn 10 or not yeah right exactly

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.640
and so seeing seeing that fuck it moment from the Navy or from people who are

01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.040
supposed to be kind of psychologically a fill-in for an authoritarian figure it's

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.620
a lot like the cake throwing not to mention what you said at the top of the

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:07.360
show about how like that level of cooperation just doesn't happen I mean

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.200
it really doesn't I mean I think Matt is unless unless it's an internment camp

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:24.360
yep unless it's a Grenada invasion or a government toppling say the Panama

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:30.600
Canal yeah then you have multi levels of agencies coming together trading

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.400
information between each other sending agents in well you can count it you can

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.200
count on America sorry to interrupt you but yeah which is like it's like yeah

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:44.520
you look at a black box and it's like you it it's it's it's effortless the

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:54.000
silence if everyone's on the same page it's a that's it's like relative like

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.920
outside the box of America conspiracies abound because with lots of

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:07.000
cooperation because it's it's all dead man switches where if no one hits a

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:14.640
button nothing happens and yeah I would I would I would counter though I would

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.600
counter though how did everybody in this room immediately know the three to

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.920
four things you named because I didn't oh okay well I just recognized them as

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:30.460
problematic I'm just like oh yeah no for sure like honestly I but I only point

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:34.440
that out actually because that's part of how it works is that there is no point

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:39.040
to understanding what's happening in Nicaragua Granada there's no point in

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.360
understanding these sort of boring details and that part of politics is to

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:50.240
try to put things in that box like healthcare is the forces that be like

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.960
they try to put health they try to make healthcare feel like the invasion of a

01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:00.560
foreign country in Central America they try whatever I'm derailing it but but

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:06.840
like it is your point you're making which is actually 250 million people can

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.640
effectively relative to Ethiopia they can they could keep a real big secret yeah

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.800
like no one blows any whistles yeah and Cambodia no one blows any whistles and

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.220
anybody in a third-world country like like like from their perspective you

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.840
wonder how those people feel they go like god damn you people work together

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:30.080
pretty pretty nicely I mean absolutely it's not it's even more from where I'm

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:35.560
sitting there's incredible incredible cooperation there's and that's the

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:38.840
interesting thing about conspiracy theories and I just real quick is that

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.760
yeah it depends on what side of the coin you're on whether or not you believe in

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:47.840
them if you have if you have seen a system actively hunt kill find maim do

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.720
destroy entire communities that when somebody drops a conspiracy theory on

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.560
you you're like yeah that sounds probable and but if you have lived in a

01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.240
privileged society and you've been a beneficiary of that privilege you're like

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.760
why the fuck would you like coordinate Tony and mark you ever try to get Tony

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.400
in marketing to do something right yeah right so from definitely from where

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.760
you're sitting there it looks like people aren't that fucking smart but I

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.840
really can tell you how smart they get well CIA crack cocaine that's a great

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.960
example of an actively think that's a great example of an actively perpetrated

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.000
and relatively easy to prove conspiracy but here's the perfidious insidious part

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.400
it's not so much about keeping a secret as it is about devaluing the truth right

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.600
so so again the things you name sure people can black box as you said Dan a

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:43.040
secret for some some set amount of time eventually the truth outs right well

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:49.000
eventually the truth becomes more valuable than the crack right and so then

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.800
we have to ask ourselves what crack are we smoking that like what that gets you

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.080
high first that is worth money for 60 years that's worth more than the truth

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:06.360
I see what defeats conspiracy is a a transparency and a ground game that is

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.440
people talking amongst each other mm-hmm so that is one of the reasons I feel

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:14.200
like certain communities are able to survive those conspiracies no matter

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.000
what the cooperation is on the earth the other end because of the price of this

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.520
particular item in this neighborhood has changed or has not changed you can't

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.920
talk to me about global markets do you know what I'm saying yes okay absolutely

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:35.120
because it's the the the question here it also becomes a question of I love that

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.840
you said transparency because what people dismiss as conspiracies whether

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:48.640
whether it might be demonstrably untrue or very provably a fact the the one

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.240
thing those have in common is that speculation thrives in the absence of

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:58.760
transparency and then also people are you know people are inherently

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.840
narcissistic which is not necessarily a bad thing people are explaining the

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:09.800
story of themselves to a worldview so like these like the far-right deep state

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.480
people are always there they're not looking at stuff that makes them go oh I

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.720
should change the way I approach it they're not like I have a teaching moment

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:23.840
or a learning thing here they're always like oh yeah I was fucking more right

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.880
than I thought it was multiple levels and so what what I appreciate here is the

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.480
point that you're raising that we have to emphasize it is we have to emphasize

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.480
that highlight it italicize it I don't give a fuck the important part here but

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:44.680
just put apostrophes everywhere I'm sure it'll you know yeah if the if the

01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.520
New York Times removes them then they're trying to make us look stupid and then

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:55.720
they're in on it but the the thing is that that the people are not idiots people

01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:02.880
are not stupid whenever we run into a community that has something that is

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:09.600
demonstrably from the first approach seems untrue or seems crazy you have to

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.120
listen to those people because they're not making it up for shits and giggles

01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:22.280
nobody serious like nobody woke up one day and said hey I think the I think this

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:28.160
law enforcement department and this part of this community is actively hunting

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.440
these people nobody said you know what would be funny you know it'd be a real

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.960
like just a great bit right that that comes from a real place women didn't

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.440
come together and go let's fuck with them on equal pay let's see what happens

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:44.560
we'll lie about how much we make on the dollar we'll keep it a secret that we

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:49.440
actually get paid more right right well there's enough prisons are great all

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.560
those secrets so let's amend it to say let's if we want to be completely clear

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:59.720
let's amend it to say that groups of people or institutions or you know

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.920
organizations religious groups whatever you want to however people get

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.280
together and hang out they are capable of cooperating when as Noel said they

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.160
are either preserving what they see as their status quo or they are increasing

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.560
what they see is like the share of whatever pie they have made in their

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:22.440
head going back to your idea of non-corporeal I mean articles of faith

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.120
right yeah it's ultimately what it is well I think that's a really interesting

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.880
thought to arrive at is that because I certainly I never parsed conspiracy

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.520
theory in that sense that actually if you if you unhitch from the stigma that

01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.120
the historical stigma that says conspiracy theory is a term of abuse like

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.560
you said and then you start to ask well what is a conspiracy and what is a

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.600
theory and then start to actually probably the most valuable way we can

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:54.840
like digest conspiracy theories and start to ask ourselves in what way am I a

01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:00.640
Bilderberg and what in what way am I like someone else's conspiracy because

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.920
that's like like why was I why do I have this life and who doesn't have this

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.720
life and from their perspective and is it possible I'm in cahoots with my

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.040
neighbor even though I don't like them as a but like from someone else's

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.080
perspective couldn't you say I'm in cahoots with them and like to kind of

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:24.600
like actually look at life in terms of those connections which is really just

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.080
another way of saying problematization like you're looking at who's benefiting

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:35.480
and who's not what a drag but for me anyway it's true it's I have nothing to

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:38.720
gain from it so I'm probably just gonna convince everybody that the Jews are

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:45.400
controlling them oh that didn't get a big enough laugh it's too real it's too

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:50.120
close to the holiday my fiance is one come on I'm not anti-semitic it's

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:53.720
impossible yeah right out there was some of my best you can't have sex with

01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:00.280
people you hate when does that ever happen no never a million of us I like

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:06.600
girlfriends probably watching this sometimes I say things that I think I'm

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.520
like wow this will get a big great big laugh because the joke is I could never

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.760
be that shitty a person and everyone's like oh and the worst part the worst

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:21.880
part is if you see someone the back going yeah hopefully you're not back

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:28.920
there oh boy in my dream I mean that would I take that over the judgment but

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:33.360
