03:28.560\nmatter what kind why are you doing that what what channels can you make your\n\n03:28.560 --> 03:37.440\nsplicing cables yeah cuz that will you splice the food network with Comedy\n\n03:37.440 --> 03:49.320\nCentral go can you splice the history channel with Nickelodeon Nickelodeon's\n\n03:49.320 --> 04:03.520\ngo can you splice I don't know I got it I got it can you splice spike TV with\n\n04:03.520 --> 04:09.000\nNamden the reason for making your own cable is for cable management you want\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.760\nto you don't want to have a bunch of extra loopy loops you get a hundred feet\n\n04:11.760 --> 04:15.280\nof cable what are the odds that you need to go a hundred feet away you know you\n\n04:15.280 --> 04:19.560\nprobably usually need 71 feet of cable right you know I got I got one 100 foot\n\n04:19.560 --> 04:24.200\ncable and had a bunch of extra going to the monitor I needed then I took all the\n\n04:24.200 --> 04:29.760\nextra and I just cut it through another connector on there took the extra slack\n\n04:29.760 --> 04:34.040\nthat I cut off use that to keep the chain going to another monitor it's really\n\n04:34.040 --> 04:39.360\nsatisfying I got I took that hundred foot cable and I turned it into a feed\n\n04:39.360 --> 04:45.960\nfor three different monitors in my in my gym can you rewire my sound system no\n\n04:45.960 --> 04:52.200\noh so you don't know how to well I don't actually don't know how to make\n\n04:52.200 --> 05:00.560\naudio cable yeah okay I can only make coax call me when you're ready

they thought I was gonna say Shaq it was just much\n\n11:25.880 --> 11:34.840\nfarther away I thought I thought you nailed it okay thank you I don't I'm\n\n11:34.840 --> 11:41.000\nwaiting to decide so when I was much younger Art Bell was still on the air\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:46.840\nwith coast-to-coast and he would he would open up his lines to like alien\n\n11:46.840 --> 11:52.680\nabductees time travelers and he'd talk about all the usual stuff and reptoids\n\n11:52.680 --> 11:58.960\nhallowearth holla back there was typically I think we were in a kind of a\n\n11:58.960 --> 12:03.120\nCamelot for a while even when there were Republican presidents is like life was\n\n12:03.120 --> 12:08.640\nnot so politically mired it really didn't matter and Art Bell was so long\n\n12:08.640 --> 12:13.480\nago and then his his the throne's been handed off and stuff and it was just I\n\n12:13.480 --> 12:18.920\njust recently listened to this is my opening question I just recently\n\n12:18.920 --> 12:22.640\nlistened to whoever it was who's the guy that took over for for art George Norrie\n\n12:22.640 --> 12:26.800\nGeorge yeah I was listening to it just happened across an episode of his show\n\n12:26.800 --> 12:30.800\nmaybe a couple years ago and there was some guy that was like talking about you\n\n12:30.800 --> 12:34.360\nknow carnivorous plants or something and how they're still hiding their\n\n12:34.360 --> 12:37.520\nexistence in the hallowearth or whatever he was talking about and the guy was\n\n12:37.520 --> 12:40.280\njust going on and on on the phone and then he's like and that's why they don't\n\n12:40.280 --> 12:43.760\nwant you to believe in Donald Trump that's the thing and he started going\n\n12:43.760 --> 12:47.640\nbecause he's not part of the system and they're trying to hold him back and he\n\n12:47.640 --> 12:52.280\ngot like he got a couple sentences out and then George eventually he's just\n\n12:52.280 --> 12:56.520\nlike Tom Tom Tom I got to cut you off there that's I'm sorry but that is the\n\n12:56.520 --> 13:01.080\none topic the one topic we just can't talk about on this show and I thought\n\n13:01.080 --> 13:06.920\nthat was so striking conspiracy theory culture like you got the we are now\n\n13:06.920 --> 13:12.960\nliving in this time when it's like there's like eight ironies there that I\n\n13:12.960 --> 13:18.200\ncan't describe but anyways I you guys have like this super intelligent kind of\n\n13:18.200 --> 13:22.520\napproach to talking about conspiracy theories you you you're you and and\n\n13:22.520 --> 13:28.440\nthat's what impresses me about your show you keep it you keep it unmyred you\n\n13:28.440 --> 13:32.480\ndon't lose your wigs and you don't have call-ins from people that are like hey I\n\n13:32.480 --> 13:36.480\njust talked about we have a hotline we do we do do call-in episodes or we play\n\n13:36.480 --> 13:41.280\nback the the most bad shit ones it's just not live just in case and I guess\n\n13:41.280 --> 13:44.640\nthat's just kind of how we met is that I was commenting to Spencer we were talking\n\n13:44.640 --> 13:50.080\nabout that NPR the radio lab episode where you and I were disagreeing and I\n\n13:50.080 --> 13:55.320\nbrought these guys up I just mentioned them and said you know I've been as a\n\n13:55.320 --> 14:03.080\nhobbyist I've been getting into centrisms no offense I was like wow\n\n14:03.080 --> 14:05.880\nthese guys have been talking about this topic for an hour and they haven't like\n\n14:05.880 --> 14:09.040\nand then you might be somebody must have told you guys as they do in the\n\n14:09.040 --> 14:12.280\ninternet a Dan Harmon talked about you or whatever then we then now we've met\n\n14:12.280 --> 14:19.640\nnow you're on the show Dan ask them a question the how are you guys pretty\n\n14:19.640 --> 14:25.240\ngreat yeah this is absurdly surreal what is it like to be smart and into\n\n14:25.240 --> 14:31.880\nconspiracy theories well loaded question yeah yeah you definitely framed us up\n\n14:31.880 --> 14:37.760\nthere yeah I I what do we what do we call we call it a critical thinking\n\n14:37.760 --> 14:42.240\napproach to conspiracy yeah which is important distinction yeah because so\n\n14:42.240 --> 14:48.520\nthere's when I think any of us hear the term conspiracy theory especially now\n\n14:48.520 --> 14:52.800\nand I appreciate that you pointed out this like schism that's occurring where\n\n14:52.800 --> 14:57.440\nthe there are a bunch of very far right people who are now into conspiracy\n\n14:57.440 --> 15:00.880\ntheories yeah well they always were but they were never I think it's the other\n\n15:00.880 --> 15:03.840\nway around it not to get derailed by this but I almost feel like people that\n\n15:03.840 --> 15:08.120\nwere fringe it's just it was the same on the on the left with the Bernie Sanders\n\n15:08.120 --> 15:12.280\nphenomena is it people that considered themselves fringe in the camelot of the\n\n15:12.280 --> 15:16.840\nbipartisan days people that were like what's with this election shit and it's\n\n15:16.840 --> 15:22.040\nlike like the fringe got drawn into the to the process and I think that like\n\n15:22.040 --> 15:26.560\npeople that didn't know they were right wing 15 years ago figured out that they\n\n15:26.560 --> 15:29.880\nwere yeah which was really disconcerting for me because I'm like hey I wanted to\n\n15:29.880 --> 15:33.880\ntalk about hollow earth and flat earth and anything but I can't do it anymore\n\n15:33.880 --> 15:39.320\nwhen it's now it's connected directly to yeah that's why women should yeah there's\n\n15:39.320 --> 15:43.880\nalways that plot twist and it happens to us a lot too we'll be reading what what\n\n15:43.880 --> 15:47.960\nI think we all agree is like a fascinating correspondence or something\n\n15:47.960 --> 15:51.680\nwhere someone has this really out there idea but they've thought it through they\n\n15:51.680 --> 15:56.760\nhave internal logic and we we get into like paragraph four page four and they\n\n15:56.760 --> 16:02.880\ngo and that's why Donald Trump just like just like George Norrie runs into we\n\n16:02.880 --> 16:08.320\nwe prefer the term conspiracy realist because there's there's insidious\n\n16:08.320 --> 16:13.000\nlanguage that happens if you are on the new or you're watching a new show a few\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:19.080\nyears ago someone would say the idea that the international banks are laundry\n\n16:19.080 --> 16:23.920\nmoney for drug cartels is a conspiracy theory and then they would say that\n\n16:23.920 --> 16:27.800\nbecause it's sort of a thought terminating cliche and now all the\n\n16:27.800 --> 16:32.800\nsudden saying that drug cartels are working with banks to launder dirty\n\n16:32.800 --> 16:36.600\nmoney is the same thing is saying that the Queen of England is somehow a half\n\n16:36.600 --> 16:41.480\nreptilian alien and the difference is that one of those things is fucking true\n\n16:41.480 --> 16:57.720\nyou know yeah yeah that's a really good point the and you guys always parse out\n\n16:57.720 --> 17:02.600\nyour your things the structure of your show is that you you kind of announce\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:08.440\nthe topic and then you you you say here are the facts and you you you lay them\n\n17:08.440 --> 17:13.520\nall out it is it I always find it kind of important to go like oh yeah yeah yeah\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:18.040\nit is it is important to keep those things separated that I can't I can't\n\n17:18.040 --> 17:22.040\nthink of a good example of a topic where you're kind of like yeah I thought I knew\n\n17:22.040 --> 17:25.040\nthe facts but actually what's important is to build a little box around what you\n\n17:25.040 --> 17:29.640\nknow to be the case because it often contains a bunch of crazy shit and then\n\n17:29.640 --> 17:35.120\nyou you'll typically take a little break and then you usually will then come\n\n17:35.120 --> 17:38.800\nback from that break and say here's where it gets crazy and then talk about\n\n17:38.800 --> 17:48.560\nthe the more unproven assertions that may be associated with those things and so\n\n17:48.560 --> 17:54.160\nis that why you guys got into it in the first place or is it among this among\n\n17:54.160 --> 17:59.640\nthis trio is there a are there differing philosophies on this is is Noel like a\n\n17:59.640 --> 18:03.680\ndude there's a big foot for real and I have to hang out these fucking nerds\n\n18:03.680 --> 18:08.000\njust to get them to talk about it I don't know like I guess there's sort of we\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.320\ndo have kind of like different roles I guess I'm sort of maybe more of the\n\n18:11.320 --> 18:16.040\nskeptic Matt's a bit more of a true believer about some of these things I\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:21.080\ndon't want to like it has a lot to do with their background I grew up in the\n\n18:21.080 --> 18:26.880\nchurch very heavily when I was growing up church it was the United Methodist\n\n18:26.880 --> 18:30.920\nChurch that's where how I got my start and I did too but I think yours was a\n\n18:30.920 --> 18:38.720\nlittle more hardcore than mine yeah sure but our core Methodist those\n\n18:38.720 --> 18:46.280\nwafers oh so we I lost my religion as you know many of us probably have a\n\n18:46.280 --> 18:50.000\nlittle bit at least when you get to college or you're really like getting\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.360\nmore academic and listen to Pink Floyd and you're like there's no way God is\n\n18:54.360 --> 19:00.440\nright I was honestly I was listening to jars of clay right up into college like\n\n19:00.440 --> 19:06.320\nthat kind of music that record fucking slaps I do praise yeah no it's all good\n\n19:06.320 --> 19:09.440\nyeah that's just that's just where I was I mean that's where I grew up is in an\n\n19:09.440 --> 19:14.560\nisolated town in in Georgia called coming it was literally called coming\n\n19:14.560 --> 19:20.240\nhow's it spelled man see you MMING it's for Scythe County it's one of the it was\n\n19:20.240 --> 19:28.040\nthe most I think it was yeah it was it well certainly but it was one of it was\n\n19:28.040 --> 19:33.800\none of the most conservative towns in all of America is where I grew up it's\n\n19:33.800 --> 19:39.440\nit's changed a little bit at this point I'm not there anymore but it it shaped\n\n19:39.440 --> 19:43.720\nthe way that I viewed the world all of just all of that and it's just most of\n\n19:43.720 --> 19:48.880\nus where we're born and the economic strata in which we're born it shapes us\n\n19:48.880 --> 19:53.800\na lot and the struggles that we go through for me it was all internal\n\n19:53.800 --> 19:59.080\nbecause I was very privileged in in my position and the struggle was learning\n\n19:59.080 --> 20:05.080\nthat my worldview was not necessarily correct and the things that I'd based my\n\n20:05.080 --> 20:09.880\nentire life on were not necessarily correct and you came to conspiracy theory\n\n20:09.880 --> 20:15.440\nbecause you had been brainwashed potentially well I I think I yeah I knew\n\n20:15.440 --> 20:20.840\nthat there that had been pulled over my eyes and it wasn't necessarily my fault\n\n20:20.840 --> 20:24.520\nit was other people trying to shape me because they believed a certain thing\n\n20:24.520 --> 20:29.000\nright at least that's how I ended up getting there and I also spent a long\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:34.240\na long about five summers working at a private club in Atlanta where it was\n\n20:34.240 --> 20:38.840\nthe most wealthy people in all of Atlanta going to hang out and eat she\n\n20:38.840 --> 20:44.760\ngrabbed soup by the pool and I really didn't like what I felt there I bet you\n\n20:44.760 --> 20:47.920\nheard some shit by the pool though did you not like come on you had to have\n\n20:47.920 --> 20:52.560\nheard some it was mostly griping about Pinot Grigio but it was I mean really\n\n20:52.560 --> 20:56.280\ninfluential cool people I'm sure but it was it shaped it also shaped my worldview\n\n20:56.280 --> 21:02.560\nanyway I'm talking for too long it can conspiracy theories were this this\n\n21:02.560 --> 21:07.000\nwindow that I could view the world through that felt like there might be\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:11.600\nsomething there because I couldn't trust what I believed in for so long that I\n\n21:11.600 --> 21:14.040\nshould at least examine it but that's thing too like with a lot of the things\n\n21:14.040 --> 21:18.080\nwe look into it's like even as bonkers as they get there's usually a nugget of\n\n21:18.080 --> 21:22.160\ntruth like buried somewhere in there and that's the part that's fun about like I\n\n21:22.160 --> 21:25.480\nconsider it almost like a thought experiment what we do sometimes we talk\n\n21:25.480 --> 21:29.000\nabout this stuff as opposed to being like a true believer like a tinfoil hat\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:32.880\ntype it's more like this is interesting what do people think what does the\n\n21:32.880 --> 21:36.680\ninternet say what's the science how do we get through all that to something\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:39.760\nthat's real and I think that's what we attempt to do anyway and it's sort of a\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:44.240\nfalse dichotomy to to say that something has to be absolutely true or absolutely\n\n21:44.240 --> 21:49.760\nfalse right it's it's easy to say that it's comforting to say that but it's\n\n21:49.760 --> 21:55.080\nusually not the case you know yeah I mean we look for we look for meaning in\n\n21:55.080 --> 22:01.120\nchaos I can do the conspiracy theories are kind of there's a conspiracy theory\n\n22:01.120 --> 22:05.800\nif you call it something different it's a religion as you you know God conspired\n\n22:05.800 --> 22:10.040\nto you know this is unseen forces controlling the world like we fall\n\n22:10.040 --> 22:13.040\nback on the positive version of a conspiracy theory when we lose a friend\n\n22:13.040 --> 22:18.760\nand and we because the the alternative is to stand there throwing dirt on\n\n22:18.760 --> 22:23.040\nsomebody's box that should still be standing there and what else are you\n\n22:23.040 --> 22:27.280\ngonna do is that the only reason why conspiracy theories get get get get\n\n22:27.280 --> 22:34.440\ncreated is it is it is it just that like need for control I don't want to\n\n22:34.440 --> 22:39.360\ndiscount the other reason which would be that they're true I don't I don't want\n\n22:39.360 --> 22:45.600\nto but I mean like the ones that like kind of just blossom organically do\n\n22:45.600 --> 22:50.600\nthey do is that the have you guys noticed anything in your studies because\n\n22:50.600 --> 22:54.920\nyou've been doing this for over a decade right like do you have a kind of\n\n22:54.920 --> 23:01.920\nunifying theory about how conspiracy theories get born that's so that's that's\n\n23:01.920 --> 23:07.400\na big one yeah so two things I really like they pointed out that sometimes\n\n23:07.400 --> 23:13.520\nthey're true right not often not near as often as the people calling coast to\n\n23:13.520 --> 23:20.640\ncoast may want to believe but we see we see two interesting things first some\n\n23:20.640 --> 23:26.560\nconspiracy theory stuff is ultimately classification and categorization which\n\n23:26.560 --> 23:32.080\nare things that our species is brilliant at you know we we are hardwired to\n\n23:32.080 --> 23:37.520\nconnect dots because back in the day that kept us alive right and nothing\n\n23:37.520 --> 23:42.360\nreally has changed with our neurochemistry but the the second thing\n\n23:42.360 --> 23:49.480\nyou know sometimes let's real quick short the reason we all know the term\n\n23:49.480 --> 23:55.680\nconspiracy theory today is because the US government sent out a memo after the\n\n23:55.680 --> 24:00.920\nassassination of Kennedy after the assassination of then-president Kennedy\n\n24:00.920 --> 24:06.480\nand the memo sent to papers of note and to broadcast radio said the following\n\n24:06.480 --> 24:10.520\nthey said okay this is the official story this is what we figured out no we're\n\n24:10.520 --> 24:16.920\nnot we don't have any secret smoky back rooms Lyndon Johnson is just a dick he's\n\n24:16.920 --> 24:21.640\nnot some mastermind and if you hear anything else other than this official\n\n24:21.640 --> 24:26.080\nnarrative you are to call it a conspiracy theory it's a term of abuse from\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:29.640\nthe start like it's it's meant to discount everything that comes after you\n\n24:29.640 --> 24:33.520\nknow yeah that's that's the whole point we sometimes say on the show like this\n\n24:33.520 --> 24:37.720\nisn't a conspiracy theory this is a fucking conspiracy yeah that one yeah\n\n24:37.720 --> 24:41.560\nthing sometimes you have to throw up our hands and say well how that one's true\n\n24:41.560 --> 24:48.280\nwhat did happen to JFK may as well while we're here yeah I listen to I was\n\n24:48.280 --> 24:54.040\ndoing can we can we do that can we throw out conspiracy I just did yeah yeah I'm\n\n24:54.040 --> 24:57.560\nsaying we should do that and then and then Brandon should do one and I can do\n\n24:57.560 --> 25:03.600\none oh yeah yeah I listen to I'm afraid none of you can do that because the Jews\n\n25:03.600 --> 25:10.840\nwon't let you all right so Dan you start it I listen to a podcast where a guy\n\n25:10.840 --> 25:15.240\nsaid like his dad was involved in like the State Department and stuff and he\n\n25:15.240 --> 25:20.320\nmentioned like like stuff happened to Kennedy and I was like I'm sure this is\n\n25:20.320 --> 25:23.040\na lie but it was just crazy and obviously there's tons and tons of\n\n25:23.040 --> 25:26.320\nconspiracies theories are about but this was someone purporting that to that\n\n25:26.320 --> 25:31.680\ntheir family member was like talking some shit about shit he did to JFK and\n\n25:31.680 --> 25:38.160\nthat's just crazy well there's a we can confirm he is dead he did get shot sure\n\n25:38.160 --> 25:41.800\nthat part I agree with that those are the facts those are yeah those are the\n\n25:41.800 --> 25:47.200\nfacts the facts are assassinations have happened yeah the fact is America has\n\n25:47.200 --> 25:52.560\nordered them yeah and the fact is there are there are factions in both the\n\n25:52.560 --> 25:56.320\nprivate industry and in the criminal industry which is also private I guess\n\n25:56.320 --> 26:01.800\nand in our own state supported at times criminal industry that very much wanted\n\n26:01.800 --> 26:07.240\nthat president out of the picture those things are true but you know one thing\n\n26:07.240 --> 26:11.080\nyou have to be careful about when we put all these puzzle pieces together is we\n\n26:11.080 --> 26:17.720\nhave to remember that in addition to being brilliant at creating pattern or\n\n26:17.720 --> 26:24.320\nseeing some where none might actually exist our species really really shits\n\n26:24.320 --> 26:28.360\nthe bed when it comes to working together so the idea that there would be\n\n26:28.360 --> 26:34.600\nthere would be a nefarious shadowy empire that somehow even though they're\n\n26:34.600 --> 26:38.640\nat loggerheads every other goddamn day of the week the fact that they would have\n\n26:38.640 --> 26:45.620\nsome sort of Avengers level team up is it asked for us to believe in a lot of\n\n26:45.620 --> 26:50.840\ngood things about humanity that are unfortunately that would be anomalous it\n\n26:50.840 --> 26:54.280\nis especially funny now like I remember when I saw Oliver Stone's movie how\n\n26:54.280 --> 26:58.600\nterrified I was and how anti-government the whole thing made me because I was\n\n26:58.600 --> 27:03.600\njust like he it was it was Camelot back then when that movie was made and it was\n\n27:03.600 --> 27:09.120\ntalking about a time in which from the standpoint of that that movies production\n\n27:09.120 --> 27:14.680\nit was like god damn can you imagine oh the people that did this they're they're\n\n27:14.680 --> 27:18.080\nstill watching there they've only gotten more powerful but it's funny now I'm\n\n27:18.080 --> 27:23.800\n46 and I live in this world where I'm thinking about the the idea of JFK\n\n27:23.800 --> 27:27.480\ngetting assassinated and I I don't think this will offend anybody but I also don't\n\n27:27.480 --> 27:32.000\nwant people to take this the wrong way but it's almost like I'm unlike God how\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:36.760\ngreat that would be if we're a war fishing government our government was\n\n27:36.760 --> 27:42.080\nthat powerful because what what have we learned in the last two three years it's\n\n27:42.080 --> 27:47.760\nlike we've we've been dissecting a pickled frog and we've been uncovering\n\n27:47.760 --> 27:53.440\nthese things that that we're like well that's impressive that's complicated but\n\n27:53.440 --> 27:57.480\nwe're certainly learning no one can start this thing's heart it's been soaked in\n\n27:57.480 --> 28:02.040\nformaldehyde the fact that I'm looking inside of it is because this frog is\n\n28:02.040 --> 28:09.600\ndestroyed it cannot hop it cannot do anything that it we are we used to have\n\n28:09.600 --> 28:14.560\nthree branches of government and right now as of three years look like like we\n\n28:14.560 --> 28:19.920\nnow have like 12 to 25 just like Game of Thrones factions I'm I'm sure it's\n\n28:19.920 --> 28:23.320\ntemporary I hope it is I hope the Constitution holds up but it's just\n\n28:23.320 --> 28:29.600\namazing how how quickly you're reading headlines that say White House decision\n\n28:29.600 --> 28:35.520\nto pull out of this flummoxes the Pentagon while the CIA accuses the FBI\n\n28:35.520 --> 28:41.120\nwhistleblower of co-operating with the Attorney General who was doing this all\n\n28:41.120 --> 28:44.720\nfor the Supreme Court I was like goddamn I used I used to panic that all these\n\n28:44.720 --> 28:48.560\ndudes were out to get me yeah together I got out to give each other they're too\n\n28:48.560 --> 28:52.120\nfucking busy I should knock over a bank we're missing them I think we're missing\n\n28:52.120 --> 28:56.800\nthe big question here I stopped using my tour browser oh shit I just want to know\n\n28:56.800 --> 29:01.880\nI just want to know what Moby knows okay his got his finger on the pulse of all\n\n29:01.880 --> 29:05.040\nthis shit like there was a story that came out a year or so ago or Moby like\n\n29:05.040 --> 29:09.160\ntalked some shit about how he was friends with an SA guy and knew that the\n\n29:09.160 --> 29:13.040\nTrump p-tape was real and knew all this stuff and then it just came out as like a\n\n29:13.040 --> 29:17.200\nvery buried lead in like a Rolling Stone article that in fact Moby is friends\n\n29:17.200 --> 29:22.240\nwith some deep level CIA types and he was telling the truth but it'll be funny\n\n29:22.240 --> 29:29.200\nif the guy like tweeted those like friends we fucked yeah I wouldn't call\n\n29:29.200 --> 29:35.320\nit friends yeah he gets reverse I wonder you know because that's that goes\n\n29:35.320 --> 29:40.680\nthat's excellent point goes back to you know the JFK question which the thing\n\n29:40.680 --> 29:45.880\nthat's so fascinating about it is every time they think ah this is crazy then a\n\n29:45.880 --> 29:50.280\nlittle bit of something that actually happened turns out to be true right like\n\n29:50.280 --> 29:54.840\nthere's there are always these you know you can think of them as breadcrumbs but\n\n29:54.840 --> 29:59.720\nI think that's why it remains one of the most popular right in any poll how come\n\n29:59.720 --> 30:05.640\nhe did not tell us what happened though Moby huh no what happened to Kennedy\n\n30:05.640 --> 30:10.520\nyeah well do you guys have a kind of like a trick this is their trip you are\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:14.680\nHarmontown bro you ain't gonna be able to fudge your way out well here's the\n\n30:14.680 --> 30:17.800\ndeal with a lot of the things that we end up researching like this what you\n\n30:17.800 --> 30:21.080\nknow you get to the here's where where it gets crazy part of our show and we\n\n30:21.080 --> 30:25.360\nhave to analyze 12 things that are the possibilities of the theories that have\n\n30:25.360 --> 30:30.040\nbeen approached with something like JFK being shot and you kind of have to just\n\n30:30.040 --> 30:34.840\nweigh what feels the most plausible what feels the most possible and that's\n\n30:34.840 --> 30:37.000\ngenerally what we do we have a discussion about that but you guys are\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.320\nmyth busters there's not a point at the end of each episode where you go\n\n30:39.320 --> 30:44.560\nKennedy yeah who assassinated busted we also don't agree actually on this right\n\n30:44.560 --> 30:49.840\nparticular okay well now okay okay power round go down the line all right\n\n30:49.840 --> 30:58.120\ntell us tell us tell us just cuz make you feel good yeah yeah all right well\n\n30:58.120 --> 31:01.920\nI'll just okay yeah so what we're talking about overall is the compartmentalization\n\n31:01.920 --> 31:06.200\nof intelligence agencies and you you never want the left hand to know what\n\n31:06.200 --> 31:09.320\nthe right hand is doing if you're gonna do something in secret and that is\n\n31:09.320 --> 31:14.120\nthat's something that people who have been creating intelligence agencies for\n\n31:14.120 --> 31:18.240\na long time have been doing since the the world wars that's just the way they\n\n31:18.240 --> 31:25.640\nrun and I believe that JFK was taken out for a lot of reasons and it I believe\n\n31:25.640 --> 31:30.720\npersonally this does not mean it's true that it that he was taken out by some\n\n31:30.720 --> 31:36.320\nsmall group of people within I'm just gonna be as broad as I can within the\n\n31:36.320 --> 31:39.960\ndeep state that took him out for reasons that perhaps we don't even know I think\n\n31:39.960 --> 31:44.200\nthat makes other hundred percent sense but I also don't fucking know I think\n\n31:44.200 --> 31:50.200\nit's really I think it's really really weird it beggars belief to say that Lee\n\n31:50.200 --> 31:54.480\nHarvey Oswald given connections with Russia and given his international\n\n31:54.480 --> 32:02.400\npassage back and forth could have been a lone person it's it's also like think\n\n32:02.400 --> 32:08.640\nabout think about first off the fact that his records show he was a piss-poor\n\n32:08.640 --> 32:13.760\nshot like that is that is clear that's been confirmed by multiple sources he's\n\n32:13.760 --> 32:18.320\nnot some kind of you know born candidate who you know he are a\n\n32:18.320 --> 32:22.120\nManchurian candidate born identity Manchurian candidate thank you that's\n\n32:22.120 --> 32:27.080\nthe one yeah yeah you know I got the main words in there but yeah but the the\n\n32:27.080 --> 32:35.400\nidea I am of the belief that as much as we want to believe in state actors\n\n32:35.400 --> 32:43.840\noften what purports to be a state action is ultimately just like the state is the\n\n32:43.840 --> 32:48.640\nfinger on the hand of larger private industry and you know wars are about\n\n32:48.640 --> 32:53.600\nresource extraction fuck idealism honestly and when it gets to the back\n\n32:53.600 --> 32:57.920\nroom when the rubber hits the road so I believe that there were heavy private\n\n32:57.920 --> 33:05.840\ninterests that were let's say if not directly if not directly like sending\n\n33:05.840 --> 33:11.560\nsome you know bank hit man or whatever to do some some shady stuff I believe\n\n33:11.560 --> 33:15.680\nthat there were private interests that were heavily involved and had the where\n\n33:15.680 --> 33:20.640\nwith all to at least produce an assassination really fast can we get\n\n33:20.640 --> 33:23.840\ninto your background a little bit then because this I think this is one of the\n\n33:23.840 --> 33:29.000\nreasons why our show is so interesting because Ben Ben was studying to perhaps\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:33.560\nyou know do this kind to understand at least the way these things function and\n\n33:33.560 --> 33:39.240\nyou were you were gonna be an assassin yeah he's gonna be an assassin he's a\n\n33:39.240 --> 33:45.560\ngreat shot to no just book depository management yeah yeah Ben you have a\n\n33:45.560 --> 33:50.560\nworking understanding of the way states function so when Ben is telling you\n\n33:50.560 --> 33:55.120\nthings like this a lot of times you know you may be a little skeptical listening\n\n33:55.120 --> 33:58.520\nto the things and take them as fact but Ben knows what he's talking about is what\n\n33:58.520 --> 34:03.040\nI'm trying to say throw me under the grass well I did I gotta say I was\n\n34:03.040 --> 34:06.920\nlistening to the Odessa episode just this morning and there was this like\n\n34:06.920 --> 34:11.320\nweird thing dropped in there about like Ben how many times have you had to\n\n34:11.320 --> 34:19.240\nescape a country and there was no laughter and you just went seven eight\n\n34:21.720 --> 34:29.880\nthat is that is primarily due to my my poor planning skills perhaps is the\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:34.760\nbest way to say it I was originally you know in some universe to the left of\n\n34:34.760 --> 34:40.520\nours I'm working for the State Department but in the course of pursuing\n\n34:40.520 --> 34:48.760\nthat as as a career or whatever I mean I I quickly became disillusioned because I\n\n34:48.760 --> 34:57.080\ndo not I believe there are many great people sounds great like we killed some\n\n34:57.080 --> 35:04.080\npeople I know it's a good job if you want it I think it's I mean podcasting\n\n35:04.080 --> 35:07.840\nam I right right right that's where that's awesome shit that made you be\n\n35:07.840 --> 35:12.080\nlike this might not be the job for me yeah it's not I mean it's not can't even\n\n35:12.080 --> 35:17.160\ntalk about it right now okay it's just not it's I'm torn I'm torn Brandon\n\n35:17.160 --> 35:21.840\nbecause I don't want to say I don't want to say that everyone who works in the\n\n35:21.840 --> 35:25.840\nState Department or any of the alphabet soups of agencies here I don't want to\n\n35:25.840 --> 35:30.880\nsay that they're automatically villains I but I do want to say like when you have\n\n35:30.880 --> 35:35.600\na monolith it's a banality of evil when you have this monolithic entity with\n\n35:35.600 --> 35:41.760\nsuch power and such influence and such reach then very quickly morality becomes\n\n35:41.760 --> 35:46.560\na matter of convenience and performance sure and I couldn't I can't hang with\n\n35:46.560 --> 35:52.520\nthat it's got to be a crazy weird dental floss mobius floss thing like this way\n\n35:52.520 --> 35:58.960\nthe idea that if you love America enough undoubtedly what you probably love is the\n\n35:58.960 --> 36:03.640\nidea of the Democratic Republic the idea of the thing that you're protecting then\n\n36:03.640 --> 36:08.360\nI could see like crossing that threshold of like I love that so much I'm gonna\n\n36:08.360 --> 36:13.680\nseparate myself from that in what I know and what I'm able to share and I'm in\n\n36:13.680 --> 36:17.800\neven maybe some of what I do because hey that's how the sausage is made\n\n36:17.800 --> 36:22.880\ninternationally and all these things but then it's like I can only imagine like\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:29.320\nwhere the dealbreakers are the greater good is the greater good is like jam\n\n36:29.320 --> 36:34.400\ntomorrow it's always a moving goalpost you know and people like no one thinks\n\n36:34.400 --> 36:40.160\nno one thinks yeah I'm the bad guy history is gonna fucking hate me man I'm\n\n36:40.160 --> 36:46.760\njust gonna go all out everybody who not everybody but people who often do\n\n36:46.760 --> 36:52.120\nterrible horrific atrocious things tend to think that they are doing it for a\n\n36:52.120 --> 36:55.840\ngreater good they feel like they're you know rust cold they're they're like the\n\n36:55.840 --> 36:59.640\nbad man who keep the other bad men from the door and that's just not true\n\n36:59.640 --> 37:04.680\nthey're regular people doing bad things you know and and when you're just like\n\n37:04.680 --> 37:16.360\nyou said when you're does Trump have a time machine okay Trump's uncle still\n\n37:16.360 --> 37:25.080\nleaving where's the booze is it yeah was it Trump's uncle like was was like\n\n37:25.080 --> 37:31.760\ndeciphering Tesla's like notes and stuff like that and and he found the secret\n\n37:31.760 --> 37:37.880\nset hell yeah Steve Levy ladies and gentlemen time travel do you know\n\n37:37.880 --> 37:42.640\nwhat okay okay okay okay okay buckle up all right so I actually do want to get\n\n37:42.640 --> 37:46.200\non into something that we've we've talked about before on the show and that\n\n37:46.200 --> 37:52.160\nis the the concept of gaming out what could possibly happen using simulations\n\n37:52.160 --> 37:58.840\non a global scale of governments of populations and the way a certain what\n\n37:58.840 --> 38:02.080\nX factor we're gonna hear about time machines no but this is what I'm telling\n\n38:02.080 --> 38:06.160\nwe're talking about time machines but this is the setup this is almost a time\n\n38:06.160 --> 38:09.720\nmachine where if imagine you had a simulator of the world in global\n\n38:09.720 --> 38:14.840\npolitics where you could done you could see what happens if you could run a\n\n38:14.840 --> 38:19.480\nsimulation if there's unrest in Nicaragua or something for some reason or if we\n\n38:19.480 --> 38:24.320\nhappen to invade Iran next week what would occur what what all the what would\n\n38:24.320 --> 38:27.080\nthe puzzle pieces look like from that point forward if you could do that\n\n38:27.080 --> 38:30.680\neffectively enough and accurately enough you could essentially have a time\n\n38:30.680 --> 38:34.960\nmachine or at least a crystal ball yeah a version of it to where you could\n\n38:34.960 --> 38:40.560\ndecide precisely which actions you could take and then you know a through z\n\n38:40.560 --> 38:43.280\ncertainly even the public information that we have about Cambridge\n\n38:43.280 --> 38:49.200\nAnalytica like like that's only what we know that that AI is already getting to\n\n38:49.200 --> 38:52.160\nthat point to the extent that we are online to the extent that we behave in\n\n38:52.160 --> 39:03.240\nswarms the extent that you're right man it's kind of a time machine so are you\n\n39:03.240 --> 39:07.880\ntalking about basically you know what I'm talking about are you talking about\n\n39:07.880 --> 39:15.040\nphysically transporting someone but there's if that thing exists there's\n\n39:15.040 --> 39:19.720\nno fucking way that guy could figure out how to operate but the theory is the\n\n39:19.720 --> 39:27.520\nreason his brain is melting is because time travel is cancerous I mean he's\n\n39:27.520 --> 39:36.120\nlosing his fucking mind well okay so first off I would watch that fringe\n\n39:36.120 --> 39:39.600\nepisode but so what in like how is this like helping him out like how is this\n\n39:39.600 --> 39:46.240\ntime he does look like Biff from back to the future too I mean he would be upon\n\n39:46.240 --> 39:49.160\nthat's the scary thing about this morning's headline where he I don't\n\n39:49.160 --> 39:53.080\neven fucking understand enough about the reason to know that he that he pulled\n\n39:53.080 --> 39:57.240\ntroops out of this and the some people are going why'd you do that I'm also and\n\n39:57.240 --> 40:00.880\nit's just like flash of those time travel theory where it's like this guy's\n\n40:00.880 --> 40:05.880\njust some Biff Tannen that's been like fucking thrust into the gear works by\n\n40:05.880 --> 40:11.120\nit's like it's not by his design yeah if he had a time machine he would have\n\n40:11.120 --> 40:16.920\njust invented cocaine yeah like he would just be hanging out he'd be a he'd\n\n40:16.920 --> 40:20.400\nhave a successful hot tub company and he'd be like blowing David Hasselhoff\n\n40:20.400 --> 40:24.760\nhe'd be fine and he'd have the dog track numbers or something yeah he'd be like\n\n40:24.760 --> 40:39.680\npart of the island yeah but but but he's not it's like he's he's like he like it is easy to believe in him as like a fucking crazy like monkey wrench that an\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:45.360\nalien or a time traveler would just casually knock in not not throughout just\n\n40:45.360 --> 40:49.360\nrandom like rhinestone cowboy like the next guy that walks on the door and like\n\n40:49.360 --> 40:54.720\nI've got a bet like but by virtue of his sheer proximity as Spencer's pointed\n\n40:54.720 --> 40:58.640\nout many times Donald Trump and running for president for 25 years there's no\n\n40:58.640 --> 41:04.000\nlike we he constantly was running for president he and then finally like these\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:10.560\nlike he did it's like if you look at the swarming behaviors and things like but\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:14.920\nhim winning and the way he won and things and then and now the things he's\n\n41:14.920 --> 41:20.160\ndoing it's just like it does lend itself to a crazy cosmic theory like you can't\n\n41:20.160 --> 41:27.080\nimagine anyone but a fallen angel or a robot profiting like evil Promethean\n\n41:27.080 --> 41:30.680\nfigure bringing and the way that we're all kind of going like like we can\n\n41:30.680 --> 41:34.880\nremember Minority Report when she's like walking Tom Cruise through the mall and\n\n41:34.880 --> 41:39.080\nshe's like duck now get an ice cream now all these things because she can see a\n\n41:39.080 --> 41:43.680\nlittle bit into the future and when you so what if you look at Tom Cruise's\n\n41:43.680 --> 41:50.720\nbehavior as he's being serenade by this precog his behavior per our\n\n41:50.720 --> 41:55.560\nobservation is crazy right because it's like now browse this magazine now do\n\n41:55.560 --> 42:00.440\nthis now be random put on this hat duck buy a balloon held this pause three\n\n42:00.440 --> 42:06.680\nseconds now move forward that's Donald Trump like like and it's also our\n\n42:06.680 --> 42:11.160\nreaction like like what we the way that we're reacting to him being president\n\n42:11.160 --> 42:14.960\nreminds me of all of the people in the mall and Minority Report like we're\n\n42:14.960 --> 42:20.520\nwe're always just just shy of going like wait a minute what the fuck you can't\n\n42:20.520 --> 42:25.280\nspell every time we're always just like like like well he can't he could never\n\n42:25.280 --> 42:30.040\nspell I don't I've got to get a great card it's always been true there's never\n\n42:30.040 --> 42:34.560\nthe swarm never works and it's almost like there's been this tipping point now\n\n42:34.560 --> 42:41.720\nwhich scares me more that's like we're seeing this shift it feels like times up\n\n42:41.720 --> 42:47.480\nlike like I think the bomb is armed so the Russians have a time machine right\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:52.120\nthat they used to influence the election Baron Trump yeah and Nikola Tesla\n\n42:52.120 --> 42:55.320\nsomehow was involved and the tweets are you know what I'm talking about I know\n\n42:55.320 --> 43:00.120\nwho this book from the 1900s early 1900s that talks about this character who's a\n\n43:00.120 --> 43:04.360\nTrump and he meets a grandmaster who calls himself the Don and he takes him\n\n43:04.360 --> 43:09.880\nthrough time and he has a son no it was Baron Trump and Trump right and there's\n\n43:09.880 --> 43:14.480\njust these similarities in the book and then it's in a YouTube video but the\n\n43:14.480 --> 43:17.680\nYouTube video is kind of the thing where they kind of put their finger on the\n\n43:17.680 --> 43:21.360\nscale where they make it feel a bit closer and then they use them things that\n\n43:21.360 --> 43:24.680\naren't true to kind of connect the dots a little harder than they're connecting\n\n43:24.680 --> 43:28.240\nbut the end result is there's this book in the 1900s that's like there's this\n\n43:28.240 --> 43:31.920\nTrump guy and he becomes the president of the world and it's in this place it's\n\n43:31.920 --> 43:36.440\nlike he has a mansion on on whatever the place the actual Trump tower is and so\n\n43:36.440 --> 43:40.160\nthere's these weird connections right so we're talking about yeah yeah yeah that\n\n43:40.160 --> 43:44.600\nbook real I mean the books real is a book a book is called the last president\n\n43:44.600 --> 43:51.440\nwow well you guys remember when the last president like all of the all of the\n\n43:51.440 --> 43:54.480\nrumors and things that were going on where people were like oh that guy's\n\n43:54.480 --> 43:58.880\ndefinitely the anti-Christ oh that guy's definitely these it's so much more\n\n43:58.880 --> 44:03.760\nabout Clinton and Obama than they should about the guy yeah I read\n\n44:03.760 --> 44:09.760\nrevelations Trump has a wound on his head that he survived scalp surgery\n\n44:09.760 --> 44:14.880\nanyways I remember yeah I guess what I'm trying to get at is anytime there's\n\n44:14.880 --> 44:20.800\nsomebody in power we we tend to distrust enough it's just how we view\n\n44:20.800 --> 44:23.600\nauthority a lot of times and I'm not speaking for everyone of course but a\n\n44:23.600 --> 44:28.280\nlot of us just have that in us where we don't want to necessarily agree with\n\n44:28.280 --> 44:31.520\neverything the person who's telling us what to do says this guy just lays it\n\n44:31.520 --> 44:36.920\nall out man in such a brazen way it's and I'm not excusing his insanity like in\n\n44:36.920 --> 44:39.600\nwhat we're going through right now my wife and I have a running joke that we\n\n44:39.600 --> 44:44.320\nfeel like we did jump timelines around to 2016 because something feels off\n\n44:44.320 --> 44:49.120\nsomething feels time travel time travel machine I mean steam baron stain\n\n44:49.120 --> 44:53.800\nMandela effect right yeah baron trump I mean and that's just a baron steam\n\n44:53.800 --> 45:00.640\ntrump shit I don't know I'm glad that you still feel it's like a joke though you\n\n45:00.640 --> 45:08.040\nknow that's got to be comfortable no it's not a joke the whole situation did\n\n45:08.040 --> 45:14.120\nyou just yes no no no really no I'm continually Matt's very bothered by\n\n45:14.120 --> 45:20.560\nthis and I am I'm bothered as well like I I'm to the point where someone makes a\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:26.800\nTrump joke and I think yeah but he's still fucking somehow up there you know\n\n45:26.800 --> 45:31.440\nwhat I mean and then it also as a cheapskate it bothers the shit out of me\n\n45:31.440 --> 45:35.280\nthat every time I get a check from somewhere that guy's getting some of the\n\n45:35.280 --> 45:40.560\nmoney I don't know what he's gonna do with it he's an unhinged lunatic and and\n\n45:40.560 --> 45:45.000\nlike it's not funny to me anymore we are in the wrong timeline I feel like I\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:49.200\nI'm so confused I go up and down I go to his sheer panic because I feel like I'm\n\n45:49.200 --> 45:54.480\nalways in a good mood when he's in a bad mood and then I'm like why is what is\n\n45:54.480 --> 45:58.960\nthat I didn't have that relationship with Obama like I don't why am I why do I\n\n45:58.960 --> 46:02.760\ncare that like I'm so happy that the president's upset is he not in a bad\n\n46:02.760 --> 46:07.440\nwell he's he's not a jolly guy but I like I like watching him I like I like\n\n46:07.440 --> 46:17.640\nwaking up in the morning to a bunch of things even the fucking cynics and the\n\n46:17.640 --> 46:21.760\nwhat do you what do you call him kind of contrarians like they can't even\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:26.080\nmuster the point of view that you're underestimating him again he's he's\n\n46:26.080 --> 46:29.680\ntrolling you like I like those weeks where it's just like damn this dude\n\n46:29.680 --> 46:34.400\nfucking up like and then he's not taking it well and then like his tweets are\n\n46:34.400 --> 46:38.560\nlike wins an egg not an egg I got a horseshoe and everyone's like what the\n\n46:38.560 --> 46:44.880\nfuck he spelled horseshoe wrong and I like those moments because it feels like\n\n46:44.880 --> 46:51.000\na resolution as a writer I feel like the Mad King is like on the pyre and like\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:56.360\ndousing himself but I should know by now that that doesn't happen you know it's\n\n46:56.360 --> 47:00.960\nup like like like like but so then I and then I go into this panic where I'm\n\n47:00.960 --> 47:06.320\nlike this whole thing is like beyond my control that's the reason why it's bad\n\n47:06.320 --> 47:10.840\nin the first place so in these moments when he's sweating and the CIA is yelling\n\n47:10.840 --> 47:14.000\nat the FBI and the FBI is yelling to the Supreme Court I was like I should be in a\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:18.080\nhigher state of panic than when everything is running smoothly but we're\n\n47:18.080 --> 47:22.760\njust torturing children at the border yeah that's the thing that sadly has\n\n47:22.760 --> 47:28.840\noccurred to us I remember a while back Matt you and Noel and I were hanging\n\n47:28.840 --> 47:33.480\nout and we were we were talking about something we had lost some of the VIM and\n\n47:33.480 --> 47:39.000\nvigor about this fucking guy which is how we were phrased them and then and then\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:44.280\nwe said like we had this moment where we we went back at an arms remove and\n\n47:44.280 --> 47:48.960\nthought about what future historians would think and then it hit us you know\n\n47:48.960 --> 47:53.200\njust how going back to your frog example like there's that old cliche about\n\n47:53.200 --> 47:59.160\nslowly boiling I know I know it's lazy writing but it's real and we also had\n\n47:59.160 --> 48:03.680\nthis we had this moment where we're like it is stunning and astonishing and\n\n48:03.680 --> 48:09.080\nterrifying how quickly things become normal we're watching this guy publicly\n\n48:09.080 --> 48:14.480\nand hilariously fall down a set of stairs and everybody's like oh that's\n\n48:14.480 --> 48:18.080\nthe bottom stair yeah right that's the last I'm just really pumped for the\n\n48:18.080 --> 48:23.440\nbiopic when Gary Busey plays him I think that's gonna be a lot of fun I want to\n\n48:23.440 --> 48:26.280\ntalk about something really uncomfortable that you're hitting on\n\n48:26.280 --> 48:31.520\nsomething that really resonates with me Dan like that the reveling in somebody\n\n48:31.520 --> 48:38.800\nelse's misery because you dislike them speaking of but but isn't it\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:43.840\nuncomfortable to think that this man leads our country and we're happy that\n\n48:43.840 --> 48:51.480\nthe leader of our country is doing the is is well if I was wrong thing what's\n\n48:51.480 --> 48:55.880\nthe alternative if I was gonna counter that what I would say is I the part of\n\n48:55.880 --> 48:59.480\nwhat upsets me about the guy that makes me afraid of him when I'm in serious mode\n\n48:59.480 --> 49:05.800\nis that he represents this everything that he says oh he's joking about it\n\n49:05.800 --> 49:10.160\nhe's oh or he's got the heart of America in his hand whatever but everything\n\n49:10.160 --> 49:14.960\nthat comes out of his mouth is about an end of free press is about is it is\n\n49:14.960 --> 49:20.160\nabout I I am the only kind of patriot I could ever possibly be is the kind of\n\n49:20.160 --> 49:24.200\npatriot that says I have a right to hate America etc that whole flim flam like\n\n49:24.200 --> 49:27.480\nlike this idea that the reason this country is great is because you don't\n\n49:27.480 --> 49:31.080\nhave to love it for God's fucking sake what kind of co-dependent relationship\n\n49:31.080 --> 49:35.040\nis that and everything out of his big blithery fucking syphilitic mouth is\n\n49:35.040 --> 49:39.600\nabout how if I had it my I wish it was like Korea I just go back from Korea\n\n49:39.600 --> 49:42.320\nit's great over there you can they can turn you into soup if you don't like\n\n49:42.320 --> 49:45.720\nthings and I'm just like I don't care that you're joking or that you're\n\n49:45.720 --> 49:48.920\nstupid that's fucking dangerous because it doesn't take intelligence to\n\n49:48.920 --> 49:53.920\noverthrow what we have which is Jesus Christ it's a fucking luxury that we\n\n49:53.920 --> 50:00.600\nlike a whole engine is driven by a patriotic derision a cynicism like we\n\n50:00.600 --> 50:05.800\nconstantly going I don't like the way this country is being run right now so\n\n50:05.800 --> 50:12.160\nI on one hand I know what you're saying is shouldn't it shouldn't it shouldn't\n\n50:12.160 --> 50:16.920\ndrive us all into the streets in our underwear that we we can derive pleasure\n\n50:16.920 --> 50:22.400\nfrom the president's misery for me in those moments I think because I'm so\n\n50:22.400 --> 50:27.680\ndeprived of them in an extreme way in in all of his other days to me I'm just\n\n50:27.680 --> 50:34.240\nlike it feels like a brief suspension of a migraine and that registers as\n\n50:34.240 --> 50:37.480\npleasure if you suffer from chronic migraines it's like oh there's not a\n\n50:37.480 --> 50:42.720\nnail being driven into my temple right now Trump like any fucking person who\n\n50:42.720 --> 50:47.840\noccupies that office is sweating bullets that's what you should be doing\n\n50:47.840 --> 50:51.160\nbecause part of your job is you're allowed to invade countries at your whim\n\n50:51.160 --> 50:54.600\nyou're allowed to like launch missiles you're allowed to do whatever the fuck\n\n50:54.600 --> 51:01.360\nyou want but I mean like if it doesn't just devolve in the total like totalitarianism\n\n51:01.360 --> 51:05.040\nMad Max kind of situation at least it showed us the holes in this system in\n\n51:05.040 --> 51:08.840\na way we haven't quite seen in this has been refreshing but I do also worry\n\n51:08.840 --> 51:12.320\nabout it because it's like what we've been silver lining we've been seeing in\n\n51:12.320 --> 51:16.440\nthis cow's stomach window for those who have state fairs and they're from their\n\n51:16.440 --> 51:22.240\nhometowns the 4h fans what we've been what we've been gazing into is there's\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:26.240\nthis constant fear of like god damn it this guy was six IQ points from\n\n51:26.240 --> 51:31.120\nsuccessfully being Hitler like like he was oh it's every time he fucks up\n\n51:31.120 --> 51:35.280\nevery time he gets on a phone call it's being recorded or transcribed every time\n\n51:35.280 --> 51:40.280\nhe every time he decides that I mean what if the the next guy it doesn't\n\n51:40.280 --> 51:44.440\nmatter what his political leanings are our definition of insanity has been\n\n51:44.440 --> 51:50.000\nforever changed and the envelope is too loose now there are the checks and\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:57.160\nbalances have been eroded if a gig becomes president and wears a burgundy\n\n51:57.160 --> 52:03.480\njumper that with a logo on it that is the earth with a with a heart above it\n\n52:03.480 --> 52:07.480\nthat represents like no more fucking bullshit no more hatred and we're like\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:12.960\nyay and then he tweets every once in a while hey Betty Cracker got her spoon in\n\n52:12.960 --> 52:18.600\nmy ass and he misspells ass we're gonna be like well Trump misspelled his own\n\n52:18.600 --> 52:23.040\nname well that's Pete yeah that's how it's like we're gonna we're it's like\n\n52:23.040 --> 52:27.560\nwe shouldn't we shouldn't tolerate that much insanity it scares me that forever\n\n52:27.560 --> 52:33.840\nnow the office of the president is just like it used to be steeped in starch that\n\n52:33.840 --> 52:38.160\nlike I think kept me safe but is there a course correction well that's I don't\n\n52:38.160 --> 52:42.840\nthink so that's the thing that I love that you said forever that's a that's a\n\n52:42.840 --> 52:47.880\nfascinating word in this conversation because what we keep forgetting I think\n\n52:47.880 --> 52:54.440\nin national discourse in any conversation about this is that this is you\n\n52:54.440 --> 52:58.080\nknow you'll see that shit around July 4th when people are like what a bold\n\n52:58.080 --> 53:03.080\nexperiment but the American experiment it's great but it's true 200 years is\n\n53:03.080 --> 53:10.880\nnot a long time at all really right now if this if this shit collapses right and\n\n53:10.880 --> 53:15.120\nwe're all just running around having that conversation about when we have to\n\n53:15.120 --> 53:20.360\neat a dead body then what what's gonna happen is that in the future people will\n\n53:20.360 --> 53:25.920\nsay a bunch of folks got together in this one part of the world and for a little\n\n53:25.920 --> 53:32.360\nlike for around 200 years worked okay yeah but everybody saw the signs right\n\n53:32.360 --> 53:36.960\nand so but the unspoken part of that is that well and the people before them\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:42.920\nhad they had it right because that lasted 1500 years where whoever was the son of\n\n53:42.920 --> 53:48.160\nwhoever was had the crown on last it's like time moves more slowly underneath\n\n53:48.160 --> 53:52.440\nthose crowns because those people were even dumber and and we sped up time\n\n53:52.440 --> 53:57.680\nbecause we fucking rule and we we we we took capitalism and democracy to an\n\n53:57.680 --> 54:01.640\nextreme we did the most bad and we're on the most on record and we opened our\n\n54:01.640 --> 54:06.560\nbooks and we add fucking things to the Constitution it's like it's our we're\n\n54:06.560 --> 54:12.240\nthe best of a bad lot as one of our guess what said I would disagree on two\n\n54:12.240 --> 54:18.080\npoints first off I would disagree on two points and the first point is that\n\n54:18.080 --> 54:24.360\nwhile this purports to be a meritocracy anyone here would have a very\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:29.160\ndifficult time explaining to someone from another place like yeah we elect\n\n54:29.160 --> 54:32.800\npeople because they're the best they just happen to be fucking related to each\n\n54:32.800 --> 54:37.120\nother what a coincidence right that's like winning the lottery 12 times that\n\n54:37.120 --> 54:43.320\nthat that kind of hierarchy that kind of a risk aristocratic approach to things\n\n54:43.320 --> 54:50.080\nhappens and you know like like okay if the president is the the best compromise\n\n54:50.080 --> 54:57.680\nright the way the system was designed then why are so many related I always\n\n54:57.680 --> 55:01.800\nhated that and that's the thing that's like fucking just winded me is that I\n\n55:01.800 --> 55:08.440\neverything that got this guy elected or things that I felt like like in an\n\n55:08.440 --> 55:12.040\nobjective sense in terms of a view of the bipartisan system I was like people\n\n55:12.040 --> 55:16.360\nwould say I'm afraid Trump's gonna win and I would say Trump's not going to win\n\n55:16.360 --> 55:20.600\nbecause there's no difference between Democrats and Republicans and the whole\n\n55:20.600 --> 55:24.560\nsystems rigged in there it doesn't even matter if you vote and everything that I\n\n55:24.560 --> 55:29.800\nsaid when I went into that Glockenspiel routine is that's how and why he got\n\n55:29.800 --> 55:34.040\nelected and it's also like he could be standing here and he'd be like doing the\n\n55:34.040 --> 55:37.240\nsame thing and saying the same thing that I was saying and it like it is a\n\n55:37.240 --> 55:41.440\nbummer because I was like why so many Clintons why so many Bushes what why do\n\n55:41.440 --> 55:44.840\nwe have dynasties if this if this job has anything to do with anything and now\n\n55:44.840 --> 55:50.560\nhere here he is the first guy to break a streak and well not the first guy there\n\n55:50.560 --> 55:54.560\nwas just why people like him so much because it wasn't broken a streak because\n\n55:54.560 --> 55:59.560\nit's Harvard it's it's that yeah it's basically that these clans set up a\n\n55:59.560 --> 56:04.520\nhierarchy and then they dominate for for more than 200 years true I'm getting\n\n56:04.520 --> 56:09.200\nanother year that's a good point the other issue is that this is the conspiracy is\n\n56:09.200 --> 56:14.800\nthat the presidency is what's causing this it's not one individual or one one\n\n56:14.800 --> 56:19.160\ngovernment or branch of government it's a group of individuals that are half\n\n56:19.160 --> 56:25.440\nelected half not elected you know we are where we are because we allowed some\n\n56:25.440 --> 56:29.480\nof our power to be given up into politics instead of just basic daily\n\n56:29.480 --> 56:36.600\nmaintenance so there's the the larger lie is that it's Trump because the truth\n\n56:36.600 --> 56:42.560\nof the matter is it's us we saw it we were told it was coming and we did not\n\n56:42.560 --> 56:51.000\nbelieve it well said this is Harmontown you guys this is like I love this all\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.880\nright moving on to our next segment halloween\n\n56:53.880 --> 57:00.120\nyeah yeah I don't want to get bought down to this guy but I think it's so\n\n57:00.120 --> 57:04.240\namazing that they part of his culture is literally is all the conspiracy stuff\n\n57:04.240 --> 57:08.480\nand it's so funny that he's taken all the joy out of it too yeah yeah I like\n\n57:08.480 --> 57:12.120\nsucked all the meaning out of just like words you know I remember I was into\n\n57:12.120 --> 57:17.080\nAlex Jones like I didn't know Alex Jones for his he was really fun when he was\n\n57:17.080 --> 57:20.360\non table Jones was the guy who thought everyone was a lizard I thought he was\n\n57:20.360 --> 57:25.120\nthe guy in waking life and then I was that guy has a show and he was the guy\n\n57:25.120 --> 57:31.440\nthat broke into the Bohemian Grove yeah they do that yeah that's creepy they do\n\n57:31.440 --> 57:34.800\ndo that have you ever been there Dan will say what have you ever been to the\n\n57:34.800 --> 57:39.800\nbe me I don't think I'm I may be a one percenter but I think part what one of\n\n57:39.800 --> 57:45.520\nthe greatest tricks the one percent plays on you guys is it's like stock\n\n57:45.520 --> 57:49.600\nthe one percent is there's a hundred percent of a one the one percent and\n\n57:49.600 --> 57:55.440\nthere's a one percent of them okay I'm I just have a pool oh yeah yeah yeah but\n\n57:55.440 --> 57:59.640\nit's a nice pool yeah it's amazing to me when I look on Google I go like wait\n\n57:59.640 --> 58:03.200\nwhere what is the one percent all this stuff but I look depending on how you\n\n58:03.200 --> 58:06.960\ndefine it it's kind of like trying to define generation acts and generation\n\n58:06.960 --> 58:13.040\nthey're millennial or whatever but I unless my unless I'm googling wrong or\n\n58:13.040 --> 58:17.000\nsomething I'm like what I'm a one percenter but then I'm like oh yeah I get\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:22.080\nwell yeah who the fuck else like lives like this okay what really one percent\n\n58:22.080 --> 58:26.280\nthey I think maybe I'm like what and then I go yeah I think I'm one percenter\n\n58:26.280 --> 58:31.600\nthat's how fucked up it is out there that that there's like that me 21\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:35.960\npercenters but the rest the other 200 million of us are nine I hate to be\n\n58:35.960 --> 58:41.320\nreally polyanna but I truly believe that my life is not that like like I feel\n\n58:41.320 --> 58:46.720\nlike everyone should live like I live no that sounds so fucking even sad and I\n\n58:46.720 --> 58:51.440\nalso do feel this is I guess why I you know I tend to I lean in the you know\n\n58:51.440 --> 58:56.240\nthe more liberal direction is because they do I do feel like I'm like yeah I'm\n\n58:56.240 --> 59:03.360\nI'm clearly not holding like I like I got a lot of luck going on here and I'm\n\n59:03.360 --> 59:08.440\nonly falling back on the fact that I'm not forced to share but like I do feel\n\n59:08.440 --> 59:13.280\nlike like I look at my house and I go if I had to give up like 12 square feet you\n\n59:13.280 --> 59:18.920\nknow that in a like I look at it like a video game I go like I'm pretty sure\n\n59:18.920 --> 59:27.800\neveryone could have a modest hacienda a modest hacienda with a pool Dan Harmon\n\n59:27.800 --> 59:33.440\nI really do feel I mean I don't like like we have these giant urban centers\n\n59:33.440 --> 59:39.520\nthat are like we stack people up in these tenements but are we like those as we\n\n59:39.520 --> 59:44.160\nknow they can have neighbors who are living very comfortably so we know that\n\n59:44.160 --> 59:47.800\nthere's nothing necessarily about stacking people up in a giant urban\n\n59:47.800 --> 59:52.800\ncenter that necessarily means you have to live in squalor we just use that as an\n\n59:52.800 --> 59:57.680\nexcuse and then like I just feel like people could live everyone could live\n\n59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.320\npretty comfortably I mean the math is there that is correct logistically if\n\n01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:09.680\nyou look at it logistically everybody all the billions could have something\n\n01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.520\nlike an an equitable I don't want to say worry-free because there's no worry-free\n\n01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:21.880\nlife but could have some kind of situation where we are not I want to be\n\n01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.760\ncareful but we're not we're not having people who are starving we're not\n\n01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.160\nhaving people who are dying of preventable disease well there's a\n\n01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.000\nconspiracy theory that I'm sure you guys have explored in various parts of\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.280\nin various episodes there that's a classic conspiracy theory that is\n\n01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:45.360\nabsolutely true which is that the the the more rich people you get getting\n\n01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.520\nlike access to technology and and and free time and a larger view of things\n\n01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:55.800\nthe more they are going to tend to use their power influence and wealth to\n\n01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.360\ncreate a situation where they're not going to do what you do with weed\n\n01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.160\nthey're not gonna go holy shit I'm really high how can I get more of this and\n\n01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.840\nshare it with more people they're gonna do what you do with cocaine which is\n\n01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.800\nlike holy shit this is really good who saw me go in the bathroom they're there\n\n01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.440\nyou're you're going to be like I gotta get this shit on lockdown or it like like\n\n01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.920\nthere's just an instinct about it and it's all like you don't even need guys\n\n01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:32.760\nin a cigar smoke room it's money itself will create a system it will if you\n\n01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.640\ndon't and here's where I say dirty words that I don't want to be associated\n\n01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:44.920\nwith if you don't regulate it unmitigated unregulated rampant fucking\n\n01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:53.440\nhigh noon capitalism it is going to go and tear the middle class in half and\n\n01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:59.040\nnot not in half it's gonna tear the top 1% of the middle class and shove it up\n\n01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.280\nand it's gonna tear the bottom 99% of the middle class and shove it down it's\n\n01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:10.680\ngoing to capitalism unregulated doesn't become this perfect pyramid of money it\n\n01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:19.320\nbecomes it well it becomes feudal it becomes it becomes monarchs overseeing\n\n01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.920\npotato people like the coke industry is actively working toward what I would\n\n01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.920\nargue is neo feudalism also you know I find it very optimistic that we're\n\n01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:39.400\nspeaking in the conditional at this point like this this idea it's what an\n\n01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.320\nadu is yes an adu is you can build a poor person's shack on your huge fucking\n\n01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.280\npiece of land and charge them for it just like we did during the feudal shit\n\n01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.040\nwhere you might have two three people who are paying you rent to live on your\n\n01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.800\nmanner so you don't have to sell your manner it is it isn't conditional it's\n\n01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.600\nwhere we are and and should they not be able to afford that rent maybe there's\n\n01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.040\nthings they could do to keep the land\n\n01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.660\nmaybe there's a direct deposit for their paycheck like hey thank you you trimmed\n\n01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.280\na bush now you can live here for another month if there were a specific form of\n\n01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.320\ncurrency that only applied right to that manner right to that land and this this\n\n01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:29.480\nis something that

01:03:41.120\nNolan and I were thinking we we posed this question we're we're kind of we're\n\n01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.760\nkind of shitting each other in conversation I don't know if you picked\n\n01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.720\nthat up because because we're like we pose questions that we don't have answers\n\n01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.680\nto right and one of the questions that do with us that's just the nature of this\n\n01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.920\nkind of discourse that is shitty though well you're right do you mean on this\n\n01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.960\nshow or on your

that's nice that's nice hey hey you guys seriously do you think\n\n01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.360\nthere's anything too magic I don't I don't mean illusions I fucking you mean\n\n01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:37.520\ngathering or do no no I mean I mean like spell casting from the Dark Ages like\n\n01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:43.040\nthat's kind of made its way all the way to 2019 do you think there's anything to\n\n01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.080\nany of like ritual ritualized versions of that literally anything to yeah yes\n\n01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.440\nbecause I'm whether or even if it's just the intention of wanting something so\n\n01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.960\nbadly and then ritualizing the the act of saying that this is what I want like\n\n01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:02.520\nprayer even if it's silly okay well I mean no yeah I believe in a subjective\n\n01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.120\nlevel like I think that there's there's almost no limit on what you can\n\n01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.920\naccomplish ritualistically with yourself like like it's you know that's the\n\n01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.760\nboring answer it's like the miracle in 24th Street well he thinks he's Santa but\n\n01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.160\nI think you could I think you can't you can convince yourself anyone that's in\n\n01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.200\nthe room with you when you cast a spell I I don't think there's any limit on what\n\n01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.760\nyou can like make those people do so you're talking in terms of practical\n\n01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:41.480\neffect right yeah I'm saying like like the human capacity to believe in well I\n\n01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.800\nwould use the word bullshit but like that makes that's pejorative but like like\n\n01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.720\nphenomena to believe in shit that has no corporeal like like like cause-effect\n\n01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:54.200\nrelationship like you you could draw a circle of chalk on the ground and say\n\n01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.920\nthe reason I'm drawing the circle of chalk on the ground is because you're a\n\n01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.560\nwinner and you're a loser and I'm gonna flip that right now by saying chaka chaka\n\n01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:08.240\nmooka mooka oh no I said it backwards oh no freaky Friday like like I mean\n\n01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.800\nthough I believe that we've seen we see all the time like people will drop down\n\n01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.480\non the floor speaking tongues though people regress in their hypnotic\n\n01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.800\nsessions it really does it's almost a moot point whether or not it's real or\n\n01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:27.440\nnot really a Hulk exist could could a Hulk exist yeah yeah like an incredible\n\n01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:35.240\nwhole totally maybe not like a fair to mid-late yeah yeah yeah just a story you\n\n01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.400\nknow I'm glad you say that because I I think you know I was again I best\n\n01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.040\ndefinition I heard of magic by the way Matt I think we talked about this\n\n01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.240\nweaponized psychology which I think is in line right you are saying um Hulk back\n\n01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.160\nto back thank you yeah yeah yeah of course um thank you for considering me\n\n01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.720\nyou picked up on how interrupted I was and okay yeah I want you to see\n\n01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.120\ngrease grease that wheel I'm just gonna sit here yeah no you'll be rewarded\n\n01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.800\ngrease him grease him up so so you're gonna fly through the grocery store it\n\n01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.880\ngoes pay attention to him see at the finish line well this is something I\n\n01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.520\nwant everybody's opinion on because like so so there's this there's this thing\n\n01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.440\nwith with the Olympics right the Olympics are always like eye is the\n\n01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:25.360\npeak of human ability right and drugs every one's on drugs though every one\n\n01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.680\nwell they're on like a lot of green people it's so loop holy okay so you're\n\n01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:41.560\nmarried to the color idea of it wouldn't be thank you and read for a time oh\n\n01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:47.240\nwhat yeah are you sure yeah and then also Thunderbolt whatever there's\n\n01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:53.720\ndifferent we could go on but but the idea is like why so baseball when\n\n01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:58.520\nbaseball first started it was considered cheating to use a black people to catch\n\n01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:16.280\nthe ball I mean I thought we were just a couple more episodes left I think the\n\n01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.680\nidea of like it being like an unfair advantage or like corking your bat or\n\n01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.320\nsomething like that or like greasing you know like spitting on the ball or\n\n01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.400\nwhatever that was a thing and now it's like you know without the racism which\n\n01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.880\nwas fucking terrible and huge there there's still this idea that like Lance\n\n01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:37.360\nArmstrong an amazing cyclist got in trouble right a boo who he used drugs\n\n01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.160\nhe only had one not so he got a pass yeah and so so I want to see I think our\n\n01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.320\nbest chance to see a fair to middling Hulk as you describe it is to have an\n\n01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.680\nOlympic event of some sort people sign a release like yeah I might die whatever\n\n01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.960\nand they can do what whatever the fuck they want you know what I mean oh yeah\n\n01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.800\nwhat kind of engineer Olympics holy shit yeah you should have a separate fucking\n\n01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:17.000\nholy shit I'm thinking like the idea like the idea of people doping it's a\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.320\nlost battle it's going to happen the the lid of Pandora's jar is unscrewed and\n\n01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.040\neverybody's lying to themselves yeah if they think they can screw it back the\n\n01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.640\nreporters covering how many cups of coffee it was a jar it was a jar it was a\n\n01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:38.600\njar it sounds dumb just sounds dumb it sounds dumb but it was a jar what\n\n01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:47.080\ncaliber of Hulk was was Hogan was he a middling Hulk or was he did you guys see\n\n01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:55.080\nthe video by any chance of the I think quadriplegic is the word you if the\n\n01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:02.520\nquiet that he's paralyzed from below his neck and he's operating a full body\n\n01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:08.600\nthe exoskeleton yeah yeah yeah yeah that's cool that's awesome I tell that guy\n\n01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.880\nthat the Olympics should eliminate drugs well that you know what I mean that's\n\n01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.840\nthat's a good point and he's like oh yeah cuz like well you to eliminate drugs\n\n01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.560\nwe gotta eliminate what you're born there should be mechs in the genetic\n\n01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.480\nengineered Olympics that sounds great yeah there should there should be one\n\n01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:32.040\ncategory that I think would quickly lose its luster if it because it was\n\n01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.720\nEvelyn no I'm saying the league I'm saying like everyone could have their\n\n01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.560\npurest Olympics and and there wouldn't even it would the problem would solve\n\n01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.720\nitself people wouldn't be incentivized to cheat in those they wouldn't like go\n\n01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.680\ninto the purest Olympics and like sneak steroids they'd be like I want to go\n\n01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.320\ninto the steroids Olympics and and then just have this like crazy fucking like\n\n01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.480\nweird like dark future thing where it's like and coming to the corner using the\n\n01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:04.880\nlatest in cybernetic augmentation Andre on drop off the blood dope robot from\n\n01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:15.120\nMars 30% humans according to some experts he is mostly pickup truck but\n\n01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:23.320\noh Russian I just have a race around a circle everyone's gonna watch that you\n\n01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.480\nwould want I'd watch it yeah like I'm not gonna watch it people in Vegas would\n\n01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.720\ngo crazy no I'm gonna watch the swimming competition that were the guy that was\n\n01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:37.040\nborn with long feet wins the organic Olympics really oh felpy you did it\n\n01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.320\nagain with your weird long feet it's all about the human interest story there\n\n01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.560\nit's true so this is a perfect transition to like Boston Dynamics and DARPA and\n\n01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.880\nsome of the robots and androids that are being created some of them are very\n\n01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.480\nhumanoid like what do you guys think about all of that stuff oh that's real\n\n01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.320\nyeah yeah it's completely real but what do you where do you think we're headed\n\n01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:06.040\nwith all of that is it we're headed toward yikes shit we're all definitely the\n\n01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.680\nquestion is in our lifetime you guys look younger than me if most of your hair\n\n01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.960\nI am I gonna see like an actual like fucking like just like wake up one\n\n01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.600\nmorning and it's like bleh everything's just like just converted to AI algorithm\n\n01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.760\nthing or will I just be like a 70-year-old guy going like I don't like\n\n01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.920\nthese new fangled USB ports on your forehead I need that like a hole in my\n\n01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:45.080\nhead write that down Cody and Cody will be like I'm 40 yeah I don't you know it's\n\n01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:51.360\nit's it's more and more I went back and I rewatched the Terminator franchise\n\n01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.480\nwith parts of it and I was like yeah the the robots when they started out people\n\n01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.200\nwould talk about it in hindsight and they only like we could tell the\n\n01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.000\ndifference between those right and it's a fit it's a story about a physical\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.520\nanalog but now we're at the point where in terms of software in terms of like\n\n01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.720\nonline non-corporeal conversation it can be difficult to tell to discern the\n\n01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.440\ndifference when it's also becoming increasingly apparent that our biggest\n\n01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:23.840\nsins are original ones like we we have rounded a corner our friend Asperger\n\n01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.960\ndetective that's our horrible word for him his name is Ryan Krause the host of\n\n01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:36.280\ncold case murder mystery files he he constantly he's talking about just like\n\n01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.000\nlook talk about the shit all you want we're all gonna become AI and then our\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.840\nproblems are gonna be solved and all and he talks about the Terminator\n\n01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:50.080\nfranchise and our relationship with it as sort of measuring that that the you've\n\n01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:57.160\ngot your 1981-83 movie where the you know the robot is unquestionably the bad\n\n01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.920\nguy the whole premise is set up it's based on our fetishization of fearing\n\n01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.840\ntechnology it's classic beautiful wonderful modern myth that's just like\n\n01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.640\nthat before the words algorithm and AI where household words it was just sort\n\n01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.160\nof like they put they put this thing in charge of defending the country and then\n\n01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.680\nthis thing decided that the best way to defend it was to get rid of all the\n\n01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.760\npeople beautiful perfect it set this thing back in time if you blow its fake\n\n01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:32.040\nskin off what's underneath death but chrome it comes for you the sequel comes\n\n01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.600\nyears later and immediately what are we doing and why did we love that movie our\n\n01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.480\nour love affair with our villains we love our Jason Voorhees our Freddy\n\n01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.800\nKrueger like we don't love the screen Queens that run from them we love this\n\n01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.040\nmetal robot and then he's the good guy in the next movie we love the guy that\n\n01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.320\nsaid I'll be back we love the guy that is the robot the robot in that movie that\n\n01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.320\npeople a lot of people say that movie is why I know about the first movie I\n\n01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:05.080\nfucking love that New Testament where now the robots the good guy the as that\n\n01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:10.720\nfranchise continues and as our sci-fi kind of relationship continues like we're\n\n01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.120\nwe're getting increasingly more like we're doing a mating dance with\n\n01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.920\ntechnology we are we we used to simply Rod Serling would simply come out and\n\n01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:27.360\nbasically say imagine a world where we get so automated we basically become\n\n01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.800\nRussian a garage door that opens when your car pulls up but where are the\n\n01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.920\nlimits and if that garage door knew you murdered someone who should it and it was\n\n01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.240\nlike technology is like like like what where will it end and you proceed\n\n01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.480\nforward along those lines we're like cautious we're cautious we're cautious\n\n01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.480\nbut that's how a tango begins that's how a mating dance about a mating dance he\n\n01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.440\ngot movies like her like ex machina literally about like a relationship with\n\n01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.000\nan AI that's better than a relationship with someone that you know you know he\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.320\nhas to he has to accept that because yeah I mean exactly that's why that we're\n\n01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.560\ngetting increasingly comfortable with those stories we're we're we're becoming\n\n01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:16.640\naware that not that we're shaking are it's ironic because we're shaking our\n\n01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.680\nxenophobia when it comes to the difference between human and non-human\n\n01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.920\nwe're getting increasingly racist we're getting increasingly like heightened\n\n01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.840\nabout like your cheekbones are different what's with your identity politics and\n\n01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.200\njust because a woman did this doesn't mean like it's like we're regressing\n\n01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:38.080\nwe're going but we're worshiping the idea of we got it and it's almost like you\n\n01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.760\nwonder what a crayfish or a dragonfly or anything it sheds its skin feels about\n\n01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.400\nitself as it starts to evolve does it start to just pick in itself is it's\n\n01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.680\nlike oh well it does that is that a metaphor for like what we're doing was\n\n01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.840\nlike this war between the genders and the races and the cultures and the classes\n\n01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:02.480\nand we're just like shredding ourselves is it because what's underneath is we\n\n01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.680\ngotta like we got to just become an algorithm or we're gonna die where we\n\n01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.280\nit's like we're it's not gonna work this this plan where there's just like an\n\n01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.520\neight billion barrel of monkeys like sitting on top of a planet that needs to\n\n01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.360\ngive up its oil or fucking die well I think where we we we have messed up\n\n01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:28.280\noften is this assumption that what's going on now is the end point you know\n\n01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.720\nwhat I mean like some species of life sort of exist in this in this state\n\n01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:37.120\nwhere they have you know they have like the origin point right and then they\n\n01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.040\ncreate the other the other animal that is or life form this midway point and the\n\n01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.840\nthing at the end just to your your idea about shedding skin or I would say\n\n01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.640\nentering a chrysalis as well it is something different fundamentally alien\n\n01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:59.360\nunrecognizable it's it's preposterously self-centered for us here now to assume\n\n01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:06.040\nthat in a thousand or maybe even six hundred years the the people that call\n\n01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.920\nthemselves people are also going to refer to us as people yeah it's pretty\n\n01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.480\nridiculous I I feel like it's optimistic they're gonna we're going to be\n\n01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.760\nnarcissistic not their species that is like a fundamental like like cup of\n\n01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.360\ncoffee like like you're thinking about it like there is absolute it should we\n\n01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.120\nsurvive six hundred years from now there's absolutely no way that what we\n\n01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.760\nare six hundred years from now is going to refer to us as the same species that\n\n01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:37.160\nthat is well there's one one scenario in which they will it's the kormic\n\n01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.960\nMcCarthy the road yeah oh yeah they'll they'll they'll go like oh the\n\n01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:46.280\nprogenitors the people that had computers all out shit you know they'll be in\n\n01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.000\nlike bunkers they won't go outside we don't care about their opinion yeah\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.600\nassuming we continue to evolve we along even the slowest lines six hundred\n\n01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:03.240\nyears which anthropologically is it is nothing we are we are at the point where\n\n01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:11.920\nwe are either going to change so much that what we are now it will be forgotten\n\n01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:17.480\nhistorical neanderthalic like we will we will simply there will be people that\n\n01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.520\nwill study how we thought there will be people who will I hope they'll listen\n\n01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:27.840\nto this podcast and they'll go what weren't they cute there's skulls were\n\n01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:32.080\nseparated and they just kept blithering and blabbering and like they\n\n01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.320\nself-medicated and they coped with all this shit they had a whole internet and\n\n01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.800\nthey just used it to be racist they had these things called hands they had to\n\n01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.240\nuse everything was fingers and typing and they're just like they they kept\n\n01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.600\ntalking about holograms like that was the future they didn't understand that\n\n01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:52.640\nlike intelligence was a field and that they were a proxy and that what we\n\n01:21:52.640 --> 01:22:00.000\nbecame was it or I or they or them and yeah we will yeah that's for sure that\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.160\nkind of takes the pressure off doesn't it totally like who cares nukes like\n\n01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.560\nfucking Bay of Pigs who cares how we go out is there a is there a way to spot a\n\n01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:14.760\nconspiracy that has legs versus a way that like classic line conspiracies\n\n01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:21.560\nfollow this pattern absolutely yeah yeah you can you can just see it like\n\n01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.840\nthere's a trick to see it like do you check for like three or four things where\n\n01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.760\nyou're like all right that's yeah like that's worth researching like a towel\n\n01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:36.120\nwell I would just say generally just and sorry Ben to step on you here if we can\n\n01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.680\ngo back and say historically there are there's more than one version of this\n\n01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.600\nkind of conspiracy that has occurred that's generally the first step to going\n\n01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.360\nokay well there's at least a precedent to something like this happening which\n\n01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:56.960\nmeans it's not completely implausible and generally that's if less sure like\n\n01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:07.400\njust like that but like syphilis testing has happened human human testing that's\n\n01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:14.240\nnot a theory that should happens a lot and over the years it has and it's\n\n01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.720\nreally hard to even detect oh god I'll go down a rabbit hole let's not do that\n\n01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:24.400\nokay you got it experimenting with humans I mean some of the most brilliant\n\n01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.120\npeople on this planet have been really fucked up and wanted to see what things\n\n01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:34.600\nhappen like if you think about anatomy and Franklin had a tool shed oh no so\n\n01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:38.160\nyou pointed out I was good I was making a joke\n\n01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.120\nhe dissected corpses or something right no they found with somebody for search\n\n01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.180\nwhere they found a bunch of bodies yeah yeah yeah yeah Ben Franklin damn\n\n01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:01.240\nhe had a tool shed it was a what they call a resurrection man right yeah well\n\n01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:08.640\nhe was resurrection adjacent reaction manager he his landlords is one of his\n\n01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:14.200\nlandlords children was a resurrection man the house he was living in at the time\n\n01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:20.200\nwas like the next place over was where they publicly hanged people so they\n\n01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:26.320\nwould hang someone and then the long story short he may not have been\n\n01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.640\ndissecting people but he fucking knew the smell think about the smell he knew\n\n01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.880\nthere was no way to take Ben Franklin lived next door to a place where they\n\n01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.920\nhang people and he liked it and he was like like hauling people into his tool\n\n01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.680\nshed what's the resurrection man it's like when you dig up bodies and use it\n\n01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.680\nto for experiment science because think about it you had to we didn't know much\n\n01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.320\nabout what was inside of these things that we walk around in and the only way\n\n01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.640\nto figure it out was to cut them open after they were dead and just pull all\n\n01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:01.640\nthe bits out and CEO women had fewer teeth yeah yeah which is weird cuz he\n\n01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:06.200\nwas around so many mouths he could have just looked and you think it wasn't a\n\n01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:12.360\nlife expectancy 17 back then you could just like same number of teeth but I\n\n01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.880\ndon't think you just didn't want to talk to I guess he was born to the theory\n\n01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.200\nside of it I don't know right and he probably died at 19 like he just right\n\n01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.960\nyeah one of these days I should count women's teeth I'll get to it I'll get\n\n01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.880\nto it in the meantime give me a lever and a place to stand and I'll move the\n\n01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.680\nworld that's our committees that's our committees but he was probably always in\n\n01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.880\na sorry I derailed you please I'm not going anywhere\n\n01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.640\nhuman experimentation resurrection resurrection there was a loophole in\n\n01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:46.320\nEuropean law at the time which said that it was okay to dissect dead bodies\n\n01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.880\nhuman bodies cadavers but it was there was no legal way to procure them it was\n\n01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.080\nlike a grizzly version of how marijuana has worked in some parts of this\n\n01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.880\ncountry like you can own it but if we catch you buying it if it gets you\n\n01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.200\ndigging it up yeah if we catch you digging it up and then that goes back I\n\n01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.640\nthink what you're building toward is this idea of human experimentation yeah\n\n01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.760\nokay this is this is the point I want to make talking about this and it's it's\n\n01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.120\nonly tangential but we've had a couple of thought experiments on our show\n\n01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.280\nbefore when you think about World War two and unit 731 in Japan and what the\n\n01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.040\nNazis were doing in several places they were experimenting on humans and they\n\n01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:32.640\nwere taking humans to to to see the limits of what a person can withstand\n\n01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.560\nright and they wrote all of this shit down after they tortured people this\n\n01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.040\nway and they took a ton of data and we've had a discussions about well what\n\n01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.840\ndo you do at the end of that conflict where you stop those evil people from\n\n01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.800\ndoing terrible things to other humans but they've got all of these pieces of\n\n01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.040\npaper written down filing cabinets full of with data data that could possibly be\n\n01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:00.040\nuseful for for us to know about what humanity can withstand just ergonomic\n\n01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.360\ndesk chair industry stuff like wow I didn't know you could make someone's\n\n01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:10.520\nslouch for 90 hours well Herman Miller was really into all this because you\n\n01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:17.840\ncan't repeat the experiments yes you should do you talk to the data well\n\n01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.080\nand that's what we've been doing it's the the palimpsest thing that been you're\n\n01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.760\nreally great about talking about with history we've been doing that to each\n\n01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.360\nother that kind of thing where we're we do terrible things to each other but we\n\n01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.000\nfigure out something and then we know for the future that that is something we\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.920\ncan or cannot do there's always someone saying I'm not the bad guy it's the\n\n01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:42.680\ngreater good serious yeah well I think about the origins of gynecology which\n\n01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:52.240\nare barbaric the vagina just so I mean yes definitely your that origin you're\n\n01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:58.880\nin the ballpark yeah it was the doctor who performed on slaves yeah exactly\n\n01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:05.320\nrecently ripped his statue down in New York thank God finally man thank you I\n\n01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.360\nhonestly don't know where we were going with this whole thing but we were\n\n01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.200\ntalking about conspiracies and the reason is how to recognize one is one\n\n01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.200\nof legs trying to figure out if there's yeah if there's a if there's like oh we\n\n01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.440\nhave four things we're definitely on the right path or if you're like you know\n\n01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.280\nit's missing these four things it's probably just the ones with the ones\n\n01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.560\nwith ghosts are usually bullshit I'll put that one out there it's like a\n\n01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.800\nguarantee well there's ghost conspiracies oh yeah times mainly by\n\n01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:34.720\nghosts for you two episodes a week dude we got a we got a dig yeah I mean I was\n\n01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:41.800\njust talking to Kate the star of that shuttered show that Rob does you know\n\n01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.360\nshe's a producer and stuff and she said that two different psychics told her\n\n01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:52.520\nshe had an Italian speaking evil spirit and then she also had in the same spot\n\n01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.080\nshe was diagnosed a spirit she had an aura photographer take a photo of her\n\n01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:03.320\naura and had a spot right in that same spot but that's crazy not like a holy\n\n01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.440\nshit she didn't have a proper or I understand she just had this you know\n\n01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.280\nspirit spot above her head I'm also like I'm being a cynic but like I'm not\n\n01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.440\nsaying that spiritual stuff and ghosts aren't real but it's that I tend to\n\n01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:21.760\ngravitate more towards the provable kind of government that's proof there's a\n\n01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:26.760\nphoto you know seriously what happens when we die guys are we get can we come\n\n01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:30.800\nto a consensus right here on the stage right now what exactly not what I'm\n\n01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.560\nsaying is there they're we we don't know really I want spirits exist in demons\n\n01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.160\nand shit I haven't seen anything but man that would be so cool would be\n\n01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:47.120\nlive enough I know I just around people keep sending me links to this Navy UFO\n\n01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:51.000\nthing yeah yeah yeah it might people might yell at me for having you guys on\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.680\nthe stage and not bringing that up right okay because I live in gravel like I'm\n\n01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.480\nseparated from the earth and I've gotten from more than one person like have you\n\n01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:03.040\nseen this so that means everyone's talking about a little flippy crafts where\n\n01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.760\nthey're talking about a long time to me it just reminds me of the 70s it's like\n\n01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.280\nit's like the same old shit it's like but it's it's funny to watch like a new\n\n01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:17.880\ngeneration saying the exact same things about the exact same amount of obfuscation\n\n01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:22.200\nand like it's just sort of like they like there's articles about people going\n\n01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.760\nlike yeah there's three categories of these things there's the diamond-shaped\n\n01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.120\nones I'm like yeah this is all the same stuff from the 70s have you guys been\n\n01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:37.920\nfollowing this like maybe footage yeah so this this ties into the way to the way\n\n01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.760\nto identify something that might have some sand to it versus something that's\n\n01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:49.120\nsort of you know a creepypasta because we're also like conspiracy theory itself\n\n01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:55.360\nis a genre of folklore that is like that is an accurate question was asking\n\n01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.360\nwhich maybe we don't have an answer to is can you tell one that has like a\n\n01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:04.440\npolitical weaponized stinger on it yeah like oh Jenny McCarthy wants you to not\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:08.760\nvaccinate your children so she reverse engineered a story about Ben Franklin\n\n01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:14.480\nvaccinating his kid with yeah yes the that's exactly it so quick way to\n\n01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.640\nidentify something that might have some sand with it is usually it's people who\n\n01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:22.280\nhave some sort of power whether financial right or socio-political who want\n\n01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:26.440\nmore of it and have figured out want to lose what they have or don't want to lose\n\n01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.560\nwhat they have to that that conversation the the thing that's\n\n01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:36.800\ninteresting about UFO calm common ideas is that we conflate the idea that\n\n01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:43.240\nthere's something in the sky which most people don't understand we conflate\n\n01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:48.120\nthat with the idea that extraterrestrials a give a shit enough about\n\n01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:53.320\nthis planet that they would they would span the vast chasms of time and space\n\n01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.720\nto show up and like stick things up people's butts it's they that's a weird\n\n01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:02.480\nthat's you know what I say you're being reductive there I am being I am\n\n01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:06.320\nreductive I am being reductive because we don't know what they do when they get\n\n01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:10.160\nhere we might perceive it as they stuck something up my butt because of our\n\n01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.680\ntendency to like that's that's our takeaway we're very butt-centric we're\n\n01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:17.360\nlike then they put something in my butt and the aliens are like watching the\n\n01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.920\nnews and going like what we did more than that yeah like we taught them\n\n01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:26.560\ntechnically the way it's like if our dogs described like those taking them\n\n01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:31.640\nfor a walk or like they fucking choked me and he's gonna I was like well come\n\n01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.560\non you were wagging your tail that's a that's a really good point and the the\n\n01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.480\nthing is so like we're also I would I would further add to that point that we\n\n01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.400\nare we are operating from our understanding of physics right we're\n\n01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:49.040\noperating from our understanding is reality in the world as we perceive it\n\n01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.120\nwhich is at best kind of a shitty flashlight in a very big very dark room\n\n01:32:53.120 --> 01:33:00.520\nbut we what we know and what we can prove we know and what we can all agree on\n\n01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:05.560\nis that yeah we see shit in the sky we don't know what it is it is literally an\n\n01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:10.240\nunidentified flying object yeah and that doesn't that doesn't mean that's\n\n01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.720\nanything other also we have a government that spends billions and\n\n01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:21.840\nbillions and billions of undocumented money making shit that is now real this\n\n01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.320\nis true that we're not gonna see 10 15 there is an area 51 yeah that's just a\n\n01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:40.000\nthing yes like no it's it's not good for a first world empire that's in charge\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.800\nof everything and has unlimited spending to have a place where cameras can watch\n\n01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:50.040\nthem do the equivalent of all the black and white footage of the guys trying to\n\n01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:57.280\ninvent the helicopter it's just like that it's the area 51 is just a place\n\n01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.880\nwhere the Air Force is constantly trying and failing to make like a diamond\n\n01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.880\nshaped helicopters right and then and then people are like whoa look at that\n\n01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.680\nand it's like yeah that's a it's gotta be it's I mean I'm not a guy that doesn't\n\n01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:18.040\nbelieve in aliens I just I just yeah I think that any anybody that was ever\n\n01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:26.520\nvisiting us why would they send it's not gonna I just yeah is there a little\n\n01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:33.160\ndude in a thing going like humans I'm watching them with my sports car that I\n\n01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:38.240\nfly it's like obviously no they would they probably poke a hole in space and\n\n01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:42.760\ntime and the thing that popped out would likely not be visible to us in the\n\n01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.720\nequivalent of a drone right what's the conspiracy we should have paid\n\n01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:58.440\nattention to but did not whitewater we might have three different answers yeah\n\n01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:03.400\nwhat do you think that I just before we get there the important thing with the\n\n01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:11.560\nUFOs bendy buck let's just milk it was an inside job milk was an inside job the\n\n01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.680\nimportant thing with the UFOs story was that we know about Project Blue Book and\n\n01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.840\nbunch of these projects that occurred from the 40s onward up that we're\n\n01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:24.040\nstudying the government studying UFOs what is it what could it possibly be it\n\n01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.840\nhad to do with the Cold War as well as we got into that era just trying to\n\n01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.400\nfigure out which country maybe is outclassing us with technology should\n\n01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:34.520\nbe worried about that well agreed at that time but then the official story was\n\n01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:37.240\nthat it went away we don't we're not worried about anything like that anymore\n\n01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.200\nthat's that stuff is hogwash there's no extra terrestrials everything's fine then\n\n01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.520\nthis footage gets leaked and then we find out that wait in fact our government\n\n01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.720\nhas been studying unidentified flying objects this whole time and there's a\n\n01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.960\nlot of data there and there are people that you know about like names within\n\n01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.280\nour government that were actually Tom DeLonge no it wasn't Tom DeLonge there\n\n01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.480\nare there are people he's in the Senate that were running stuff I mean it how\n\n01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.520\ndoes it make you guys feel when because the big headline of that thing seems to\n\n01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:12.560\nbe that the Navy said in an uncharacteristic like they're like yes\n\n01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.960\nthat's legit they tried to get in front of it we didn't want you to see it I found\n\n01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:22.360\nit weirdly underwhelming why is that isn't that sad I couldn't tell I was in\n\n01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.480\nthis day and age when everything's been so stirred up I was sort of like my I\n\n01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:31.640\nguess my my gut was sort of like ah is everybody just so scared right now that\n\n01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:37.000\nthat like we're just being gentle people now like like that the Navy's like\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.480\nlike some guy who's in charge is like you know I'm probably gonna get fired\n\n01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.600\ntomorrow for like saying the wrong thing about a haircut so like what is my job\n\n01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:50.240\nfor real like am I gonna be an admiral tomorrow am I gonna end up the Secretary\n\n01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:53.800\nof State probably I get like like I've I've had this conversation with my\n\n01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.920\nfiancee I'm gonna fucking play it as it lays and it came across as jaskin he's\n\n01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.920\nlike just tell him the truth Henderson and Henderson's like the truth sir it's\n\n01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.560\nlike you hurt me at ease do whatever it's like tell him what's it like yeah it\n\n01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.240\nleaked it's not footage that the Navy hands out we don't know if it's a you\n\n01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:17.480\na fucking alien but like fuck it things are like operating bureaucratically\n\n01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.760\nthat was just like the Navy says real footage of a real UFO don't know if\n\n01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:27.800\nit's an alien yes those bros you hear flying those top gun planes that's them\n\n01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:32.560\ngoing like what the fuck bro that is then as opposed to the traditional thing\n\n01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:37.560\nof like we can either confirm no denials are you and you who got to me yeah it\n\n01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.960\nwas like I that was my that was what my heart said but then I had to follow it\n\n01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:44.920\nup with like panic of like ah that's what they I know this is what they want you\n\n01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:49.360\nto think but disinformation within that realm is just the norm I mean if you\n\n01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.360\nthink about the Vietnam War what was allowed to actually be reported within\n\n01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.040\nUnited States of what's going on for strategic advantage something like that\n\n01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.000\nif we're if there are actually extraterrestrial species of some sort or\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.760\nsome faction visiting us then why on earth would anyone who knows about it\n\n01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.160\nwho's afraid for national security purposes for humanity's purposes why\n\n01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.800\nwould they ever come out on any news source anywhere and say yes this is a\n\n01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:18.240\nthing like they died I can't imagine that ever occurring but also people are\n\n01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.560\nvery terrible at keeping secrets like super shit it's certainly what we've\n\n01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:28.360\nlearned yeah like and we and we've pitted the height of like this could\n\n01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:34.400\nprofit you against it like we have seen people definitely facing like we've been\n\n01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:41.080\nso cynical about the the supposed incentive of like well nobody wants to\n\n01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:45.080\nget fired and everyone just does what they're supposed to do and it's like a\n\n01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.040\njumper cable has been attached to the wrong post of a system and I'm not\n\n01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.840\nsaying is perfect and has any kind of inherent like integrity to it but it's\n\n01:38:53.840 --> 01:39:01.080\njust like this weird fucking rando dude like has revealed that most human\n\n01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:06.720\nbeings even if they work on a government payroll are kind of like cool yes sir\n\n01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.880\nI'll do that god damn it do your diary this motherfucker made me do some fucked\n\n01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:15.680\nup shit hey Stacy if I get shot tomorrow tell them and Stacy's like what\n\n01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.500\ndid you just tell me what I think you told I got it you know I gotta tell\n\n01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:22.760\nMarshall tell Marshall fuck you I was like like I'm finished with my job this\n\n01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.080\nmotherfucker told me to do some crazy shit yeah I quit well you should quit well\n\n01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.600\nthen I did quit you're a whistleblower so are you who you should quit and meanwhile\n\n01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:33.080\nhe's like you're fired you're fired you're fired and everybody it's it's\n\n01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.200\nworking the same way a Starbucks does and I find that refreshing that they're\n\n01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.960\nnot so different I that's the one layer of it but I'm like this is all working\n\n01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:48.280\nthe exact way I would think human beings that are that they're on they're not all\n\n01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:54.080\nweird people in warehouses keeping the Illuminati secrets from us that it's\n\n01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.880\nbeen exposed that they're mostly just dunder Mifflin right and to to what\n\n01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:04.080\nyou're saying like there's this paradigm shift and it goes to like the cost of\n\n01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:10.280\ninformation right in the 50s for instance people would say you know if\n\n01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.160\nwe're a G person we're a government agent we would say well the truth can't\n\n01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:20.600\nget out people learn about shit through you know one of the following 16 ways\n\n01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:27.240\nwe'll shut those 16 ways down and now that there are billions I I always think\n\n01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.800\nabout like if you guys ever growing up and your parents did something fallible\n\n01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.720\nand human and you were like what the fuck you're someone yeah someone's supposed\n\n01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:42.360\nto be in charge you know what I mean and like I'm I can't believe mom just\n\n01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:49.320\nthrew my birthday cake at my dad yeah did I turn 10 or not yeah right exactly\n\n01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.640\nand so seeing seeing that fuck it moment from the Navy or from people who are\n\n01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.040\nsupposed to be kind of psychologically a fill-in for an authoritarian figure it's\n\n01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.620\na lot like the cake throwing not to mention what you said at the top of the\n\n01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:07.360\nshow about how like that level of cooperation just doesn't happen I mean\n\n01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:14.200\nit really doesn't I mean I think Matt is unless unless it's an internment camp\n\n01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:24.360\nyep unless it's a Grenada invasion or a government toppling say the Panama\n\n01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:30.600\nCanal yeah then you have multi levels of agencies coming together trading\n\n01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.400\ninformation between each other sending agents in well you can count it you can\n\n01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.200\ncount on America sorry to interrupt you but yeah which is like it's like yeah\n\n01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:44.520\nyou look at a black box and it's like you it it's it's it's effortless the\n\n01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:54.000\nsilence if everyone's on the same page it's a that's it's like relative like\n\n01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.920\noutside the box of America conspiracies abound because with lots of\n\n01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:07.000\ncooperation because it's it's all dead man switches where if no one hits a\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:14.640\nbutton nothing happens and yeah I would I would I would counter though I would\n\n01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.600\ncounter though how did everybody in this room immediately know the three to\n\n01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.920\nfour things you named because I didn't oh okay well I just recognized them as\n\n01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:30.460\nproblematic I'm just like oh yeah no for sure like honestly I but I only point\n\n01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:34.440\nthat out actually because that's part of how it works is that there is no point\n\n01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:39.040\nto understanding what's happening in Nicaragua Granada there's no point in\n\n01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.360\nunderstanding these sort of boring details and that part of politics is to\n\n01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:50.240\ntry to put things in that box like healthcare is the forces that be like\n\n01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.960\nthey try to put health they try to make healthcare feel like the invasion of a\n\n01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:00.560\nforeign country in Central America they try whatever I'm derailing it but but\n\n01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:06.840\nlike it is your point you're making which is actually 250 million people can\n\n01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.640\neffectively relative to Ethiopia they can they could keep a real big secret yeah\n\n01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.800\nlike no one blows any whistles yeah and Cambodia no one blows any whistles and\n\n01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.220\nanybody in a third-world country like like like from their perspective you\n\n01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.840\nwonder how those people feel they go like god damn you people work together\n\n01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:30.080\npretty pretty nicely I mean absolutely it's not it's even more from where I'm\n\n01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:35.560\nsitting there's incredible incredible cooperation there's and that's the\n\n01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:38.840\ninteresting thing about conspiracy theories and I just real quick is that\n\n01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.760\nyeah it depends on what side of the coin you're on whether or not you believe in\n\n01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:47.840\nthem if you have if you have seen a system actively hunt kill find maim do\n\n01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.720\ndestroy entire communities that when somebody drops a conspiracy theory on\n\n01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.560\nyou you're like yeah that sounds probable and but if you have lived in a\n\n01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.240\nprivileged society and you've been a beneficiary of that privilege you're like\n\n01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.760\nwhy the fuck would you like coordinate Tony and mark you ever try to get Tony\n\n01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.400\nin marketing to do something right yeah right so from definitely from where\n\n01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.760\nyou're sitting there it looks like people aren't that fucking smart but I\n\n01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.840\nreally can tell you how smart they get well CIA crack cocaine that's a great\n\n01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.960\nexample of an actively think that's a great example of an actively perpetrated\n\n01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.000\nand relatively easy to prove conspiracy but here's the perfidious insidious part\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.400\nit's not so much about keeping a secret as it is about devaluing the truth right\n\n01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.600\nso so again the things you name sure people can black box as you said Dan a\n\n01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:43.040\nsecret for some some set amount of time eventually the truth outs right well\n\n01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:49.000\neventually the truth becomes more valuable than the crack right and so then\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.800\nwe have to ask ourselves what crack are we smoking that like what that gets you\n\n01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.080\nhigh first that is worth money for 60 years that's worth more than the truth\n\n01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:06.360\nI see what defeats conspiracy is a a transparency and a ground game that is\n\n01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.440\npeople talking amongst each other mm-hmm so that is one of the reasons I feel\n\n01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:14.200\nlike certain communities are able to survive those conspiracies no matter\n\n01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.000\nwhat the cooperation is on the earth the other end because of the price of this\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.520\nparticular item in this neighborhood has changed or has not changed you can't\n\n01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.920\ntalk to me about global markets do you know what I'm saying yes okay absolutely\n\n01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:35.120\nbecause it's the the the question here it also becomes a question of I love that\n\n01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.840\nyou said transparency because what people dismiss as conspiracies whether\n\n01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:48.640\nwhether it might be demonstrably untrue or very provably a fact the the one\n\n01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.240\nthing those have in common is that speculation thrives in the absence of\n\n01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:58.760\ntransparency and then also people are you know people are inherently\n\n01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.840\nnarcissistic which is not necessarily a bad thing people are explaining the\n\n01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:09.800\nstory of themselves to a worldview so like these like the far-right deep state\n\n01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.480\npeople are always there they're not looking at stuff that makes them go oh I\n\n01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.720\nshould change the way I approach it they're not like I have a teaching moment\n\n01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:23.840\nor a learning thing here they're always like oh yeah I was fucking more right\n\n01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.880\nthan I thought it was multiple levels and so what what I appreciate here is the\n\n01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.480\npoint that you're raising that we have to emphasize it is we have to emphasize\n\n01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.480\nthat highlight it italicize it I don't give a fuck the important part here but\n\n01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:44.680\njust put apostrophes everywhere I'm sure it'll you know yeah if the if the\n\n01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.520\nNew York Times removes them then they're trying to make us look stupid and then\n\n01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:55.720\nthey're in on it but the the thing is that that the people are not idiots people\n\n01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:02.880\nare not stupid whenever we run into a community that has something that is\n\n01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:09.600\ndemonstrably from the first approach seems untrue or seems crazy you have to\n\n01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.120\nlisten to those people because they're not making it up for shits and giggles\n\n01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:22.280\nnobody serious like nobody woke up one day and said hey I think the I think this\n\n01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:28.160\nlaw enforcement department and this part of this community is actively hunting\n\n01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.440\nthese people nobody said you know what would be funny you know it'd be a real\n\n01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.960\nlike just a great bit right that that comes from a real place women didn't\n\n01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.440\ncome together and go let's fuck with them on equal pay let's see what happens\n\n01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:44.560\nwe'll lie about how much we make on the dollar we'll keep it a secret that we\n\n01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:49.440\nactually get paid more right right well there's enough prisons are great all\n\n01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.560\nthose secrets so let's amend it to say let's if we want to be completely clear\n\n01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:59.720\nlet's amend it to say that groups of people or institutions or you know\n\n01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.920\norganizations religious groups whatever you want to however people get\n\n01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.280\ntogether and hang out they are capable of cooperating when as Noel said they\n\n01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.160\nare either preserving what they see as their status quo or they are increasing\n\n01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.560\nwhat they see is like the share of whatever pie they have made in their\n\n01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:22.440\nhead going back to your idea of non-corporeal I mean articles of faith\n\n01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.120\nright yeah it's ultimately what it is well I think that's a really interesting\n\n01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.880\nthought to arrive at is that because I certainly I never parsed conspiracy\n\n01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.520\ntheory in that sense that actually if you if you unhitch from the stigma that\n\n01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.120\nthe historical stigma that says conspiracy theory is a term of abuse like\n\n01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.560\nyou said and then you start to ask well what is a conspiracy and what is a\n\n01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.600\ntheory and then start to actually probably the most valuable way we can\n\n01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:54.840\nlike digest conspiracy theories and start to ask ourselves in what way am I a\n\n01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:00.640\nBilderberg and what in what way am I like someone else's conspiracy because\n\n01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.920\nthat's like like why was I why do I have this life and who doesn't have this\n\n01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.720\nlife and from their perspective and is it possible I'm in cahoots with my\n\n01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.040\nneighbor even though I don't like them as a but like from someone else's\n\n01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.080\nperspective couldn't you say I'm in cahoots with them and like to kind of\n\n01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:24.600\nlike actually look at life in terms of those connections which is really just\n\n01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.080\nanother way of saying problematization like you're looking at who's benefiting\n\n01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:35.480\nand who's not what a drag but for me anyway it's true it's I have nothing to\n\n01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:38.720\ngain from it so I'm probably just gonna convince everybody that the Jews are\n\n01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:45.400\ncontrolling them oh that didn't get a big enough laugh it's too real it's too\n\n01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:50.120\nclose to the holiday my fiance is one come on I'm not anti-semitic it's\n\n01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:53.720\nimpossible yeah right out there was some of my best you can't have sex with\n\n01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:00.280\npeople you hate when does that ever happen no never a million of us I like\n\n01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:06.600\ngirlfriends probably watching this sometimes I say things that I think I'm\n\n01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.520\nlike wow this will get a big great big laugh because the joke is I could never\n\n01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.760\nbe that shitty a person and everyone's like oh and the worst part the worst\n\n01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:21.880\npart is if you see someone the back going yeah hopefully you're not back\n\n01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:28.920\nthere oh boy in my dream I mean that would I take that over the judgment but\n\n01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:33.360\nthese atoms they got a guy that's just a hand\n\n01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.520\nhe's just like a
