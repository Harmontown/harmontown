{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.200\nMusic\n\n00:11.200 --> 00:15.000\nHollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:22.500\nMusic\n\n00:22.500 --> 00:26.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.wn.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:38.000\nMusic\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:41.000\nI think we can owe that warmness to our warm-up guy.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:42.000\nYeah.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:44.000\nWas that Kevin? Did Kevin come out?\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:47.000\nIt feels like a real TV show. I thought there was someone juggling out there.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nIs there an actual proper TV warm-up guy?\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:57.000\nKevin Day, for those of you who are probably on the Reddit, maybe know that Kevin Day has arrived along with our ambition to...\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:01.000\nThis is all a hobby, all this shit. I'm just a rich, fat asshole that's just like...\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:07.000\nI'm not trying to accomplish anything other than just seeing what the hell we can accomplish,\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:12.000\nbut Kevin Day is like the Alfred to my Batman, the microchip to my Punisher.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:23.000\nI love that he came out and did warm-up. It's a really triumphant Asperger's story.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:27.000\nI'm starting to think he might not have Asperger's.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:31.000\nThere are so many cameras. I want cameras on how many cameras we have.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:38.000\nWe have these racks of cameras, like velcroed to pillars and things here in this pretty unfilmable site.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:46.000\nThere's Chris back there, who's a genius, who's like, here's my goal.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nI haven't really been on the record about this. What are you doing, Dan Harmon?\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nWhat are you doing? Is the podcast going to change you doing anything? No.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:58.000\nIf all you do is listen to the podcast and when you cut your character on the way to work, you're doing fine.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nYou can always do that. Who cares? Who gives a shit?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:05.000\nIt costs me nothing to do to talk and it costs you nothing to listen.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:12.000\nYour camera's license is showing on camera right now.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nWe're filming your personal details right now.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nSee, that's Kevin. He's a hacker. He thinks like that.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:27.000\nHe's Alfred. He's like, Mr. Wayne, you should know that Deadshot has the ability to holographically simulate your next move.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:35.000\nWhy would you be thinking about that? Because if Kevin were working for the dark side, we'd all be dead.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:39.000\nI was just told tonight's the last show where I get to use music of my choosing.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nWe have to go to non-licensed music from now on.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nThat is one thing that I will admit is...\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nYeah, show is over, everybody.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:54.000\nI think that is the one thing. That is a price we will pay.\n\n02:54.000 --> 03:00.000\nCan we just do it until someone tells us to stop?\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:05.000\nRemember, there was a show on Channel 101 called House of Cosby's where I did a voice-on.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nJustin O'Reilly made it. And then we got a call from Cosby's people.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:14.000\nI was like, stop doing that. But we got five or six House of Cosby's out before that happened.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nAnd then we just stopped doing House of Cosby's.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nStop doing that.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:25.000\nI'm busy with the women and the drugs.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:30.000\nCome to my cabin to discuss creative endeavors.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nOkay. Well, whatever. Hey, let's not...\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nIt's not too soon for that shit.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nSome things, it's supposed to be too soon.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nSorry.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:50.000\nSo anyways, I didn't really get a ratchet. What you're watching is, I don't know, I'm like the Howard Hughes of Narcissism.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nHoward Hughes was the Howard Hughes of Narcissism.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nI'm just seeing what we can do. I guarantee you one thing, you'll never...\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.000\nAnything that you haven't, that you've never paid for it, you're never going to start paying for it.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:06.000\nI'm not going to suddenly tell you that cost a quarter. I don't think.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:16.000\nWhat I am going to do experimentally, because my fantasy as a Minecraft player is about autonomy, efficiency.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:26.000\nI want to create a solar-powered, like, biodome of a video podcast where all these guys, like Chris back there,\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:34.000\nDustin, our producer, Kevin, and people who help us, if they could draw salaries off of all of the energy that they put into the show,\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:39.000\nif people were on a subscription basis, which seems to be the model that kind of works,\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:43.000\nif people are willing to pay for things that they want, if they want to go the extra mile,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:47.000\nthey're making a donation at the same time as they're buying the product, they're subscribing to it.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:51.000\nI'm going with the porn model, because the truth is...\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nWhat's her name?\n\n04:53.000 --> 05:00.000\nFor 20 years, you know, rich white men have been trying to figure out how to monetize the internet,\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:08.000\nbut almost as soon as it started, a class of very independently-minded, like, poor women immediately figured out.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:13.000\nYou'd think that they were being exploited every time you see, like, that there's a lot of exploitation of pornography,\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:19.000\nand I'm sure there is, but there's also a lot of very impressive, like, there's a lot of entrepreneurship\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:26.000\nand, like, independent, like, people that know how to sell themselves can do so very well on the internet, and that's what you can do.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:32.000\nI was thinking, let's take a page from their playbook, like, if you love me so much that you can't get enough,\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:37.000\nif you want my dirty panties, like, that's what you got to pay for.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:43.000\nIf you want to just see something, you can probably get it illegally.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nGive me a, for instance, there, like, what do you mean?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nThere's no, for instance.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nWhat's your dirty panties version of the other?\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nNo, the dirty panties is the video feeds.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nYeah, that's the dirty panties.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nIt's what you can see.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nYeah. All right.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nIt's bad to start a show talking about the show.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nIt's like trying to fuel a lawnmower on lawnmower.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nLiquid.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nInstead of gasoline.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt shouldn't do that.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nThe lawnmower won't start.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nWe should have started with my new segment,\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:26.000\nQuestions About Grocery Stores.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:38.000\nUh, how much, how much do you, it's starting off great.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nI love this segment.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nI really love this segment.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nCyberbullied.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nDon't abuse this camera with camera tapes.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:56.000\nNow they can see that I'm a human being.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nI'm a victim.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nAlso, we know your driver's license info.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nWell, and that was going to happen no matter, yeah.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nThat's a good point, I guess.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nBut I'm, is that on the outside of your phone?\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:08.000\nWhat's happening there?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nWell, it's, yeah, it's, I bend it over backwards.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nAll right.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nOkay.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nI'll tell you one thing.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:19.000\nAs a Sony employee, this is the least of my fucking worries.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:24.000\nConsidering the news considers it juicy that Joel McHale got a discount on a TV.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nYou don't know what I'm talking about.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:32.000\nBut I'm telling you like sooner or later, like, boy, oh boy, I'm good at emails.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd I've been working for Sony for six years.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nAnd the shit you know is juicy.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nI am good at emails.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nRead a couple for us.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nGet fired again, man.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nRemember how exciting it was when you got fired last time?\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nWe went on a tour and made a movie.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nIt was great.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nOkay.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nSo anyways, what was the segment?\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nGrocery store questions.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:13.000\nYeah.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nAll that music goes away.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nIt's next fucking time.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nI'm going to do as many musical things in the show as I possibly can.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nUntil Bill Cosby himself calls me up and says, don't do it.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nIt felt like Big Red was back.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nOh, I miss Big Red.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nWhere did he go?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nHe died in a shone.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nHe's exploded.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nIs that right?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:39.000\nIt's always too soon for Adam Goldberg.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:45.000\nAdam Goldberg is so jealous of the most loved person to ever come up on stage.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:50.000\nIt's like, I guess the Hamburglar probably hates grimace.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:56.000\nIt goes home at night, just stabs his grimace eyes.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nNo, not Christmas questions.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nThat's our next segment.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nGrocery store questions.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:11.000\nHow much do you think one costs?\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nA grocery store?\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nYeah.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nIf you wanted to buy a grocery store, filled with stuff.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nFilled with stuff?\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nEmployees?\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nThe whole truck?\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nDelivery?\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nEmployees, I don't know.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nYou're saying if you want to buy one, outright.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nYeah.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:28.000\nI guess let's keep the fact that it's like a business.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:34.000\nLet's just go with all of the things in a grocery store minus the things in back.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nI think you'd get one for $350,000.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nI think that takes it away.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nThat seems very conservative to me.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\n$50,000 and $1.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nAdam, shut the fuck up.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:50.000\nAnd obviously, you're saying that all of the Skittles, all of the marshmallows, all the\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nfrying pans, all the pantyhose, they all add up to $350,000.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nYou're just saying all the stuff out of the shelves.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nThe furniture too, like the cash registers and all the apparatus, or just the items that\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nyou could buy in there.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\nI'm just saying all the shit on the shelves in the public area.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nLet's start the bidding.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\n$125,000.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\n$125,000.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\n$2,000,000.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\n$2,000,000.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nNo, that's too much.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:17.000\nYou think all the food in a supermarket costs $2,000,000?\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nI haven't even actually thought of my own guess, but I guess $2,000,000.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:24.000\nIt does sound high, but I actually, I was like, now we're talking.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nOkay, let's high-ball it at $2,000,000.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nLet's say that's the number.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nLet's call it $2,000,000.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nLet's say that's the number.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nThis is part of your premise as to how much does it cost.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nOh, no, no, no.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nWell, okay.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nWell...\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nWhat was the name of this segment again?\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:56.000\nIt's grocery store questions.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nOur show is eating itself.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:04.000\nI was wondering, I was in a grocery store recently, which is a rarity for me since I was 35,\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:07.000\nand I found out that you can escape that life.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nBy having an assistant or what?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nYeah, a girlfriend or...\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nOkay.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nCombinations thereof.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nOkay.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nDifferent services, websites, whatever I can do to stay out of the place.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nSo you rarely walk physically into a supermarket?\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nI try not to.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nBad place for bad people.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.000\nBut before that, before 35, I spent a lot of time in them.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nIt's a common location.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:36.000\nI always, I find myself wondering, for instance, like what would happen if centipedes attacked\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nlike giant centipedes?\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nLike centipedes the size of Dobermans.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nAttacked a grocery store.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nLike where would you hide, like I think about that stuff.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nI would write a script about that.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nI would set it in a grocery store and I would feel comfortable doing that because I've spent\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\na lot of time.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nI've logged in my grocery store hours.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:58.000\nWhere would you hide from Doberman-sized centipedes inside a Trader Joe's?\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nI would...\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nWell, I would...\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nI'm assuming that they're coming in like the front door.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nOkay.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:10.000\nSo first there would be this like period of like, Jesus Christ, what's happening?\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nSomeone's screaming and everyone flocks to the screaming.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nAnd then you see that there's like a CG monster.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nAre these Doberman-sized centipedes out to kill people?\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nYes.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nOkay, they're after people.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nYeah, they're monsters.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nThis is a movie.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nOkay.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nAnd so there's like a CG centipede like killing, I don't know, Susan Sarandon or whatever.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nIt's like a cameo who's like the first to die.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nYou got her so you could get funding.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:36.000\nAnd so she's getting eaten and then there's going to be a guy who's like the most heroic\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:42.000\nbut the second to die because he grabs like a egg beater and goes like, what the fuck?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nAnd then he's like a really...\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nWho do you cast?\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nWho's your guy for this?\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nThat's Chris Pratt for sure.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:55.000\nBecause again, he's a cameo and he's like, listen, we'll drag your body out and set it\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:58.000\non fire in the first act and just come by for a day of shooting.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nI'd really appreciate it.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nBut like somebody like charges the thing with an egg beater and it's like the big beefy\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.000\nguy that you thought was the hero because of course this is an ironic age and you have\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nto remove that guy.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:14.000\nIt's like the post-survivor world of it's not the alpha male you were counting on.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:23.000\nIt's the, you know, it's the whoever the new, who's that IBM PC kid, John Long, Long,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:33.000\nJohn, Justin Long, I'm sure he's 53 now but whoever the new him is, assuming someone from\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:38.000\nYo Gabba Gabba, I don't know, what do you, what do you people watch?\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:46.000\nSome Pokemon with like, he's like, I'm only at the grocery store because I have asthma.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nOh, I have to fight the centipedes?\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nI know all about them.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:56.000\nWho the hell invited this goddamn centipede expert?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nTo our grocery store.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:03.000\nAlso, who keeps inviting people to our grocery store?\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nAlso, what's my statement?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nI've been a meat salesman for 35 goddamn years.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:13.000\nThis is my Keith David impression.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nThis is a good cast so far.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:21.000\nHe works at, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the pivot.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nHe's the, he's the black guy in the monster movie.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.000\nWhat am I, why am I, why am I mincing words?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:29.000\nHe's Keith David and he works the butcher section and he's like, God damn it.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nWhat are these goddamn centipedes going on?\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:36.000\nAnd then, and then when the kid, the kid starts going like, he's like, actually that species wouldn't\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:44.000\ntechnically be called a centipede if they're, they can see heat but not color or something.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd then Keith David's the one that goes like, God damn it, am I taking orders from my boss\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nor this goddamn nerd over here?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:54.000\nBut then he like, he's the guy that, all I know is that this kid said three things\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nand they all turned out to be right.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nAnd everything you're saying, and then every time the kid said something like, a centipede's\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nfollow, there's a thermographic entity.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:06.000\nWait a minute, are you telling me these goddamn things can see heat?\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nAnd that's his job.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.000\nTranslate for the streets.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nAll right, where was that?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:22.000\nMy question about grocery stores is, we're moving way too slow.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:27.000\nI got a list of shit.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:33.000\nMy question about grocery stores is how, the reason I want to know how much they cost\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:40.000\nis because I want to buy one because I want to know how easy is it to push over the shelves.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nThe whole thing?\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:47.000\nYeah, because you always think of it when you walk in, like you think that you're in a room\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:53.000\nand that like part of the room is that there's these aisles, but those are just things they put up.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:59.000\nThe reality of a grocery store is it's a big empty warehouse and they just put up these like shitty,\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:05.000\nI just wonder like if you, I want to like run up and like, I want to push.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:09.000\nLike how hard would you have to push to knock over a whole grocery store?\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nA grocery store.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nIt's 150 pounds.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:21.000\nI feel like I understand a library, like I feel like I know when I look at a library shelf\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nlike what I would have to push to make it happen.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd I don't even, but I don't even, but also it's like, let's see if that feels profane, lady.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:37.000\nI think if you went at the bread aisle, that would be the lightest one because bread is like very airy.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nYou kind of take on the frozen foods.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nI don't think it has a lot to do with the content.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:48.000\nI don't know if those things are anchored to the ground or if they just like, yeah, did anyone work in a grocery store here?\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nDid you work in a grocery store?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nYou worked at a super target?\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nWhat's a super target?\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nIn the Midwest, there are a few.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nPlease welcome our first guest, Super Target, when playing.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:08.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:09.000\nIt's Scoota.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nScoota?\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nYeah.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nOkay.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nSomeone said fake.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nIs it an acronym?\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nSelf-contained underwater.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nMy last name.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nTarget employee.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nYeah, so it's my last name.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nMy first name's Matt, but I'm from a place that had like too many mats.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nSo it's easier to go by my last name.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:30.000\nWas it Scoota, like you have an accent when you say Scooter?\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nIt's S-K-U-T-A.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nS-K-U-T-A.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nScoota.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nScoota.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nAnd then the T is usually pronounced with a B for some reason.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nScoota.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nYeah.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nAlright.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nScoota.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nScoota.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nSuper Target.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nTalk.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nTell us about it.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:49.000\nSo they're not out here for some reason, but there's several different types of targets.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:53.000\nThere is the normal target.\n\n17:53.000 --> 18:00.000\nThis is a, if Liam Neeson did this speech, it would be terrifying.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:06.000\nThere's something called a P-Fresh target, and those are the ones that are out here mostly.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nP-Fresh?\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nYeah.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nIs that like some horrible cynical attempt with the urban demographic?\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:14.000\nI think, I think, I think.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nNo, the P stands for produce.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:20.000\nSo it's like, it's a slightly bigger target that has a produce section.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:25.000\nA relatively big grocery section, and then a super target has a full grocery section,\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:28.000\nincluding like a butcher, a deli.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nA candlestick maker.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nSo they're just bigger.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nWow.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nSuper target.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nAlright, so you worked on a super target.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:40.000\nYou've worked around these shelving units that grocery stores and things have.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nSo you've, are they fixed to the floor?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:47.000\nThe only ones that are kind of fixed to the floor is like the frozen sections, like you\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:51.000\nknow, they do have a lot of like electrical stuff that they are nailed down.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:56.000\nAll the other shelves are just really bottom heavy, because we do like a seasonal time.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:59.000\nWe're getting real information about something.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nSo it's called life hacking.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:05.000\nI love our, we would be the best trivia team if we all went to a bar and played bar.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nSee, they put heavy shit on the bottom.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nIt's not just that.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nAn empty shelf is incredibly bottom heavy.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nOh, okay.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:17.000\nYeah, when they do like, they do like the called planograms, that's the way that you\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nget a sheet.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nPlanograms.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nAnd that is how you're supposed to set up the shelf.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nLike what goes on the bottom, what goes in the middle, what goes on the top.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nWho decides that?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nThere are people who, that is their job.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nAt Target?\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nOr how much does Big Snicker?\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nSo Big Snicker has like a lot of say in it.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:40.000\nLike there are like certain parts of the store where it's like, we really want it this way.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd then there are certain things we're like, well, you know, flexibility here.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:47.000\nAnd then as things like sell out, like in the store, we can't have empty shelves.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:53.000\nSo people have to go around and then decide how we're going to flex out the shelves.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nIs that what they call it?\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nYeah, sort of flexing.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nTrying to make you feel like you're working for Patrick Swayze.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nYeah, no.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nOkay, no.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nSorry, I won't say this one again.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nYou know we're going to super target.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nThis is a fucking bank heist.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nLet's flex out.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nNo, okay.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:12.000\nAnd an insane thing about Target is like the, I think like the slogan is like, expect more pay less.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:16.000\nBut the corporate slogan is the greatest company ever.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:22.000\nSo, like, so not, no, no, we agree.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:34.000\nYou'd see, but if you go like in the back room or if you go like in the break room, there are these posters on the wall, like, like 1984, where it's Target's headquarters in like Minnesota, Milwaukee, somewhere, somewhere up north.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.000\nAnd it just has like a giant animated Target logo and then in big bold letters.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nOr I think it might be the best company ever.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nSo the best company ever.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:46.000\nAnd it's okay.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nI've got himself couldn't destroy Target.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nI defy you, Lord.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:55.000\nI've never been blown away by it, but I guess, I guess it's the best company ever.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:59.000\nAll I know about Target is once in a while, for some sad reason, you have to go to Target.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nYou have to go get a thing.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.000\nGod damn it, I need a trash can for my kitchen.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nI got to go to fucking Target.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:08.000\nAnd then it's the most depressing afternoon of your life.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nIt's the worst.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nIt's not super.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nYeah.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:14.000\nI want to say about Target, though, when I was, how old are you, Scoota?\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nYou look like you can ask.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\n23.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nI was going to say 23.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:29.000\nLike around that age, when I was getting my first steps into like, oh, I have an apartment or whatever, like I have a property.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nI need a plunger.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nI need a dish rack.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:41.000\nAnd it's Target, at least in Wisconsin, it was like, that is the synagogue you go to, you know, achieve manhood.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:53.000\nA very late manhood in an infantilized empire where you're like picking your dish rack and you're like, oh, there's eight kinds of brush that I thought just grew out of my mom.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:59.000\nAnd then I now realize I need, because I was like, there's shit everywhere.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nOh, mom, used a brush.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nThere's a brush I let Target.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nIt's kind of fun.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:08.000\nLike Target is sort of a religious, it's like a little cove in the woods.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nFor me, I'm sure there's other stories that accomplish that fact.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nHow long did you work at Target, Scoota?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nSo I worked there from like 2008 to 2012.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nAnd did you climb the ranks?\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nI'm hoping there's names for your job description that are very hilarious.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nKind of, yeah.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nSo I started as a cashier.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nRight.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nAnd then that is genuinely the worst job ever.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nReally?\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.000\nYeah.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nSo at least I thought it was.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nYou have to deal, so you're kind of dealing with people kind of constantly.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nAnd there are main, you know, people like to make the jokes.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nAnd those get annoying very quickly.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:43.000\nLike if you're just a little bit too slow scanning something, the person will go, oh, I guess it's free.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nAnd you just want, yeah, you really wanted to just kind of throw it in the bag.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nYep, it is.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nNow you're just dealing with it.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:53.000\nDo you like it's all free and you're going to do it?\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:57.000\nYeah, so I was having like, so I was kind of dealing with kind of those same jokes over and over again.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nIt became incredibly frustrating.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nSo anything ever needed to be done in the store, like we need someone to take out the trash.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nI was like, I will do it.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nSo they're like, oh, this guy really, he's really trying to work hard.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:08.000\nSo not just not talking to people.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nJust to get away from people.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nJust to get away from the check lanes.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nI didn't like that kind of the repetition there.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:19.000\nAnd so I ended up, I did, I volunteered to be trained on the cart pusher in the parking lot.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:23.000\nSo I pushed, so then I went and did that and then I did a guest service.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nShe's like Charlie Sheen in platoon.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:29.000\nLike you were a cashier and then you're like, can I go and, can I go push carts?\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nSo another really bizarre thing.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nWas Keith David out there?\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nKeith David.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nWhy are you pushing carts?\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nSniffing that cross, man.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nI'll push you down by the river.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nWe got ourselves a goddamn hero.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:43.000\nWe got here as a crusader.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nOh yeah.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nOkay.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:51.000\nLike another thing we think the new speak though is like, you can't, if you're heard by one\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:57.000\nof your higher ups, your team leads, calling a customer, or sorry, a guest, a customer\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nyou'll get a talking to.\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nA guest.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nYeah.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nIt's like, they're guests.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nYou have to call them guests.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nAnd when is carousel?\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:11.000\n17%, 17% as we all slowly die.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:15.000\nThe irony is it's a Logan's run joke about how when you're so old, you have to die.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nAll right.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nWell, Scoota, I got a full plate tonight.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nYou're lovely.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nI think we could have done a two hour target show.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.000\nYou're charismatic.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nYou're full of energy.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.000\nYou make everyone pumped with target steam.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:32.000\nLet's have a hand for Scoota.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:46.000\nThey're a very fresh faced, like a Boy Scout energy.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nI liked Scoota.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nAnd Target didn't crush his soul.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:50.000\nIt seems like that's it.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nYeah.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:54.000\nThat's either nice or it's either uplifting or horrible.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:58.000\nI worked at a trader, Joe's briefly, when I was 17 and it was the worst.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nAll right.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nI'm going to go down to the checklist and we're going to start triaging because there's\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nthings that will just...\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nDid we answer your question about knocking things over in the supermarket?\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nNo.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nWell, yeah, they're bottom heavy.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nIt kind of makes more sense.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:14.000\nScoota, if you, me, and Dan ran with all of our might towards, let's call it the bread\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\naisle.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:21.000\nIf we went right at the center of it, at the highest center of gravity and we just tried\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nto knock it over, could three people knock it over?\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nI don't think so.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:27.000\nI think you could dent one of the shelves and the shelves are also renewable.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nSo I think those would take the project.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nRight.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:33.000\nI'm going to take the knock over a full thing and start a domino effect down the thing.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nRight.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:37.000\nI think it would be hard to do it because, like I said, it's bottom heavy, but the bottom\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nshelf is like, you know, it's like six feet.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nYeah.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nSo you can't, your arms aren't long enough to do it.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nI think they thought about this.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nDid you hear that?\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:51.000\nDid you hear that, America?\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nThe ownership class has thought about it.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nHave you?\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nYour move.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:03.000\nBut don't name me and the, I don't get to, okay.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nAll right.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nHere's it.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nHere's it.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nAll right.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nI was really compelled to talk about Lena Dunham tonight.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nI can sum it up.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nJust leave her alone.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:15.000\nFuck you if you're like trying to burn her at the stake.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nOkay.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:17.000\nMoving on.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nYou can Google that.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:24.000\nOur friend, Linahan was here last week and I noticed him tweeting about something about\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nMs. Dunham and then I went down a rabbit hole Googling.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nWhat's he talking about?\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:35.000\nShe's undergoing what I would describe as a Salem level of like witch hunt.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:39.000\nAnd I guess that's a hot topic, but, and I don't imagine we have a lot of people in\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nthe audience going like, oh no, you don't have all the facts.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nI want to really be, I think it's more of a right wing, left wing thing, which I also\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:52.000\ndon't give a fuck about, but it's like, there are moments in this culture and our new\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:58.000\nhashtaggy, the social justice like awareness of each other and everything's evolving.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:02.000\nThere are moments when there are things that you could do that are brave and there are\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nthings that you can do that are, that are not brave and you don't always have to do\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:10.000\nbrave things, but I would urge people to knock over the bread.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:15.000\nTo run everything that you're about to do or say through a little one item checklist,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:19.000\nwhich is, is this, do I risk anything by saying this or doing this?\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:22.000\nBecause if you don't, then it's not brave.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:25.000\nAre you making a gesture at me or are you rubbing your, okay.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:29.000\nI'm like, I'm like, I, I, it's like, no, no, wait.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:33.000\nThe new president just got elected.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nHe's a misogynist.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nYou've got to cut it, cut it, cut it.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:40.000\nCut the segment, cut the segment.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:43.000\nI mean, just, just, just Google it.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.000\nI think it's a fact.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:48.000\nI think what's happening to her is fascinating.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nShe is a creative.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nShe shares things.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nShe expresses things.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nShe explores things.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:58.000\nThere are people who don't like young women with power.\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nI'm not me.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:03.000\nI'm not trying to get a jump on a bandwagon of that.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:07.000\nI think it's actually, there are times when it's actually difficult to be a feminist.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:12.000\nThere are times when it's difficult to be progressive when, and I think that she is\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nbeing ganged up on right now.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:18.000\nIt took me a very long time to get to the bottom of what was going on.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:23.000\nThere was a lot of shit on the surface that, that, that threatens to suffocate.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:26.000\nLike what is actually, what, what the deal is.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:30.000\nI urge you to Google it and, and explore it because I think it's edifying.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nI think it's very interesting.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:35.000\nAnd I won't, I won't bother with any more time with that because there's probably a\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.000\nmillion podcasts that talk about it and you can, you can do your own exploring.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nBut I, I ultimately, it's like, what do we do?\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nI just, I just want to know what is it?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:49.000\nI, I, I, I, why is it that when these things come up, why, what is it in us?\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:56.000\nWhat is it in our national psyche where we, when we hear about, for instance, the\n\n28:56.000 --> 29:02.000\ntopic of sexual assault or rape, that we, that we, we, that what, what muscle is it\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:07.000\nin us that flexes where we have to figure out if it's right or wrong or\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nprovable or all these things.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nLike what are we doing?\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nIt's a question that needs to be asked.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:16.000\nIt doesn't have to come down to some battlefield where you're for or against\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:17.000\nanything.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:22.000\nWhat, what is important as is, whether these, like, like all of these, you know,\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:25.000\nthe last week when we talked, we were talking about police brutality and all\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nthese things.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nThe questions that we emerge with are the important things to ask.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nWhat is the role of police?\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:36.000\nAnd I think, like, like, what is, what is the point when somebody talks about\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:40.000\nsexual assault, talks about rape, whether they're joking about it, whether\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:44.000\nthey're exploring it in a memoir, whether they're, I don't know, there's probably\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:50.000\neight other ways you could, you could, you could dance around that, that hot fire.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nWhat, is there a responsibility?\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nAre we supposed to, are we policing it?\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nAnd what is our, what is our role?\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:59.000\nWhy is it that we respond in certain ways to certain people?\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nJust let's ask ourselves that.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:05.000\nI, I, I spent the day going down a rabbit hole.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:11.000\nI, as, as our friend Graham said in his tweet, I think that if you can judge\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:15.000\npeople by who, who their enemies are, I think, you know, Lena Dunham is, well,\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nI can't remember how he put it.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nShe's, she's, she's Christ.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nThat's not what he said.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nBut she's, she's, she's, she's being ganged up on it.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nIt's, it's pretty fucked up.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nAll right.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nChristmas questions.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nNo, we can put that off till after New Year's.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nSniffers.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nI don't like people who sniff things.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:37.000\nOkay.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:40.000\nGive, give me a, for instance, on that one.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nI just don't like sniffers.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:44.000\nLike, like, I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not, I'm not going to judge them.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nPeople walk into a shop and sniff something?\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nOr are they, are they, like, what do you mean?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nWhat, we better bring out, I guess.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:54.000\nLike, no, no, not until you've explained sniffers to me.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nThere's people who sniff things.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nThere's people, there are people in the audience.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nI would love to talk to a sniffer.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nI dated a sniffer once.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:03.000\nI need to know what you're talking about, like on a day to day.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nSniff, they sniff things.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nEven though they know they're going to smell bad.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nLike, they sniff, they pick up a piece of shit off of them.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nThey're like, ugh, ugh.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nAnd it's like, what are you doing?\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nDon't, why are you, why did you do that?\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:14.000\nWhy did you sniff that?\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nIt's like a thing you found in a mailbox.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nI'm doing a camera take.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nUgh.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:22.000\nLet's bring out, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nWe're not done with sniffers.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nWhy, who's sniffing what?\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nWhy are people sniffing things?\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nLike, like.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nI don't know.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nI tell you about someone that goes into a bakery and goes, this muffin.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nI want this muffin or that muffin.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nSniff a muffin.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nSniff it.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:38.000\nYour experience there is defined by margins.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nIt's either going to be a bad smelling muffin.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nWho is sniffing what wrong?\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nI don't understand that.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nThere are people who obsessively sniff everything they're about to eat.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:50.000\nThey sniff, they sniff like shit that they find.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:53.000\nLike, they go like, what is this thing on the side of the napkin dispenser?\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nLike, it's like brown.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:58.000\nI love it like, I was like, why are you sniffing it?\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nWhat?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nWho did this?\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nThere's got to be a sniffer in this audience.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nDoes anybody, does this resonate at all?\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nThere's a guy that's kind of like that.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nI'm telling you, I think it's like some kind of tick.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nThat you have to sniff things.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nYou got to sniff it.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:14.000\nEven something that you know is going to smell like something bad probably.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nIt's too time consuming.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nA guy that worked at Target.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:20.000\nI'll fucking, I want to talk about sniffing for the rest of my life.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:26.000\nLet's talk about sniffing with, my compulsion is to bring up both guests at once so that\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nwe can.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nLet's do it.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:31.000\nLet's get that guy out.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:34.000\nKumail Nanjiani and John Roy.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\nIf you sit too close to me, then it means you're gay.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nOh, well fuck then.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:52.000\nAll right.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:53.000\nLet's do it.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nI'm with you on sniffers.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nAnti-sniffing.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nYou've met sniffers, right?\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nYeah.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:01.000\nI don't know whether before or against his stance.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:05.000\nI haven't fully explained what a sniffer.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:09.000\nI don't even like when people are choosing muffins and then they sniff it.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nDon't take some of that.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nWhere are their loose muffins?\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nLike Starbucks, they have them behind the counter.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nYou can't just look at them and smell it.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:19.000\nI've been there when they're like, can I see that muffin and people hand them the muffin\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nfrom behind the counter.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nThey smell it and they're like, no, I want a different one.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nThey'll hand it to you?\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:26.000\nYeah, they'll do anything.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:29.000\nI don't like sniffers.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:35.000\nI've known people that will take off their shoe and they'll look at the bottom of it\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:39.000\nand there'll be some gum or something on it and they'll sniff it.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nYeah.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:45.000\nThat's the term, it's bug trawlers, not just sniffers, but people who smell something nasty\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:48.000\ncan feel GTRO, TTE.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:52.000\nI kind of want to not talk at all for the rest of the show.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:59.000\nSit in silence for an hour and all go home.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:03.000\nThat would be an amazing thing to do for his birthday.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:06.000\nYou finally had the last word.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:13.000\nJust wait, yeah, and give Adam the gift of showing him what would happen if everyone\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:19.000\njust listened and it would be like time enough at last when the glasses break, you know?\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:24.000\nIt's just like, oh, everyone, and then you slowly walk up and you'd be like, and another\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:28.000\nthing about this, you were saying this other thing earlier and everyone would just keep\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:32.000\nnodding and listening.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:33.000\nBlog trawlers?\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:34.000\nBlog trawlers.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nBlog trawlers.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:42.000\nI always felt like, if you know how when you were at a party and a couple of people are\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:47.000\ntalking and then someone yells out something from across the room and it kind of kills\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:51.000\nthe conversation.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:55.000\nThat's not happening here.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:58.000\nWe do have a more open format here.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nAnd it's Adam Goldberg.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nThat's his role.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nYeah, I mean, that's his role.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:05.000\nAnd our role is to be annoyed by it.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:08.000\nJohn Roy, what do you think of Adam Goldberg?\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:11.000\nI don't really know what the issues are.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nI have a late comer to this.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:17.000\nI don't know anything about the man that didn't tell you the truth.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nAll right, you guys want something to talk about?\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:24.000\nCan I say something, one thing real quick about Target?\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:30.000\nI was at, this was a Brooklyn Target and this to me encompasses Target and Brooklyn.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:34.000\nEmily was walking around and she had a pen in her hand and this guy yelled at her.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nHe was like, why you got a pen in your hand?\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:40.000\nYou're not at work.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nThat's Target.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:46.000\nThat's Target.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nTarget.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:49.000\nYeah.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:50.000\nThank you.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nA pause break.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nOne man applause break for Target.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nThat's my audience.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:58.000\nIt's one person.\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nWas that you, Adam?\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:00.000\nYeah.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nGod damn it.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nI'm starting to see the issues I think now.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nI think I'm getting caught up to speed.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nYeah, buddy.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nI'm with you on the Lena Dunham thing.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nI don't ever talk about it more, but it really angers me.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:19.000\nI think she's so talented and so good and it is so gross.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nThe methodology is the disgusting part.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:29.000\nIt's beyond whether or not, the attempt to make it an issue about whether something is or isn't or is right or is wrong.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:37.000\nThe methodology that people try to use when they attack people is very telling and it's very disgusting.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nIt just grosses me out.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:43.000\nIt really sums it up to say, wow, you really, she's really an important person.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:51.000\nShe really fucking is forcing weird ooze to come out of the ground on all sides all around.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:56.000\nWho had any idea that this was still needed to be resolved?\n\n36:56.000 --> 37:01.000\nThis idea that you can't as a, well, we're talking about it now.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:04.000\nShe's going to be making awesome stuff for the next 50 years.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nMy parents love girls.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nThey're always telling me to watch it.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nIs it good?\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nIs it that I really like it?\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nYes, it's good.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nShe's a good writer.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:16.000\nI would not want to get in a writing contest with her and she's 28.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nAnd I'm a genius.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:21.000\nAnd I'm old.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:24.000\nI would say that about very few people.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:29.000\nI was intimidating because she makes choices that would not be instinctive for me to make,\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nwhich is what an important writer does.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:32.000\nI feel that way about Woody Allen.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:36.000\nI feel that way about the writers that I really respect.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nI watch a Coen Brothers movie when I watch it.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:41.000\nShe's a good writer and that I would easily,\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:47.000\nbefore I would even touch all of this ridiculousness and this political fucking socio-psychological bullshit,\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:54.000\nI will definitely easily in a court of law prove to you that she's a good writer or your money back.\n\n37:54.000 --> 38:00.000\nAnd that is why I guess the elitist side of me is a little invoked when people gang up on her,\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:05.000\nparticularly for things, because if you were a writer with a stutter,\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:10.000\nif you were a writer with a limp,\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:17.000\nthe things that made it harder for you to wake up in the morning,\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:22.000\neven though it would fuel your work and make it important to other people,\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:26.000\nit wouldn't also be the thing that people could throw at you.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:30.000\nBut for women writers in this modern world, it's like they're half the population\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:34.000\nand it's not a disability to be a woman and yet it gets thrown at you.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:40.000\nIt's like you can make people angry, this is becoming very clear to me,\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:45.000\nand three years ago I wouldn't be having this conversation,\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nI wouldn't be feeling the way that I feel about this,\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nbut it's just like everything is coming to the surface.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:57.000\nYou can just make people angry just by being a woman, you really can, it's fucking true.\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:05.000\nAnd you can especially do it by doing that plus doing something like writing a television show.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:10.000\nI was reading this interview for the CEO of Yahoo, I forget her name,\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nI think it's Melissa Meir.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:15.000\nAnd the interviewer described in great detail what she was wearing,\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nlike that would never happen to a dude.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:21.000\nAll that stuff really, it's so insidious and you don't even think of it,\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nbut every time there's an interview with a woman,\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:28.000\nit's about what kind of shoes she was wearing before talking about how she thinks, you know.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:34.000\nI was on Fox News on one of these shows and the piggy host of the show\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:37.000\nmade this comment about one of the female Fox personalities\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:40.000\nthat she wasn't showing as much skin as she normally does.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:43.000\nMe and Andrew W.K. was the other guys, we looked at each other like Jesus.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nI thought you were going to say Andrew Dice Clay.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:48.000\nNo, he is more appropriate for their network.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:51.000\nSo I looked at it and I go, that's fucking weird, right?\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nI would a creepy joke, but it wasn't a joke.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:58.000\nShe came back later, changed with more cleavage showing\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:02.000\nbecause it was a serious order that she was given by the host.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:08.000\nThat laugh was laughing at something other than her misfortune.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nAll right, so done with that.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:18.000\nSeriously, what I'm saying is Google the shit and spend 30 minutes\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:22.000\nbecause it's kind of a study in history that's happening around you right now.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:26.000\nBecause I honestly, as a 41-year-old person with my full faculties\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:30.000\nand my ability to Google stuff, I went from hearing some shit\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:33.000\nto figuring out what the truth was.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:36.000\nIt took me an inordinately long time.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:39.000\nAnd the truth is like, I mean, we just,\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nwe'd have to do a whole podcast to talk about it,\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:47.000\nbut the bottom line is that there's aggression toward people,\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:50.000\nthat people want, that needs to be addressed.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:56.000\nIt's not science, it's not argument, it's not debate.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:59.000\nThis isn't like an ancient Rome platform where it's like,\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nwell, is this logical or is it a thing?\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:06.000\nIt's not true. You hate. You don't like something.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nYou're angry.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:11.000\nAnd I think that I have felt that too.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nAnd I think I can understand it,\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:18.000\nbut I think that it's like you have to look at moments of opportunity\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:26.000\nto reverse or at least let go of shit that is inexplicably driving you.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:31.000\nBecause before you know it, you're passionate about something\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:34.000\nand it doesn't make any sense that you're passionate about it.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:38.000\nYou're yelling at somebody and you're using your full IQ\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:41.000\nand all of your academic research to wave a book in your hand\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:45.000\nand yell at somebody about logic and flawed argument and all this stuff,\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:48.000\nbut it doesn't matter anything you're saying.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:51.000\nThe whole reason why you went down that road with your book and with your IQ\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:55.000\nhas to do with some weird moment with your mom and your kitchen.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:59.000\nIt's just come down to that, which is kind of exhilarating.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:07.000\nAnd the aplomb with which she handles this fucking like a 28-year-old.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:11.000\nWhen I was 28, fuck, dude, I was like, why don't you like my band? Fuck you.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:17.000\nI couldn't even imagine being responsible for any kind of responsible opinions.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nYeah, I would have fled.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:22.000\nI leaked a Chevy Chase voicemail and some Fletch fans called me an asshole\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:25.000\nand I almost killed myself.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:28.000\nI definitely almost left the country.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:35.000\nI was a 40-year-old white man that had never had any problems in his life.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:38.000\nFletch is a pretty good movie.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nIt's great, it's great, it's great.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:41.000\nThe underhills?\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nIt's great, but I didn't do anything in front of his wife and kids.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:44.000\nHis kids are 50.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nAll right.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:51.000\nThere is children, Dan.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:56.000\nThey were babies 49 years ago.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nSniffers, Gotham, I got sold on Gotham.\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nWe don't have to talk about that.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:02.000\nThat's like the nerd equivalent of Lena Dunham conversation.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:05.000\nSomebody sold me on Gotham.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:08.000\nDid you have a run-in with a sniffer recently that brings this up?\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:11.000\nI sniffed some milk coming out of the fridge and I thought,\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:14.000\nisn't it a drag that we have to sniff milk?\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:18.000\nBecause isn't sniffing a debasing, horrible experience where you're sniffing?\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:21.000\nYeah, but if you drink the shit milk, you want to have sniffing.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:22.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nI mean, fuck it, I gotta do this, I'm gonna do it.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:28.000\nThat made me think of people who choose, or maybe don't choose, maybe it's a compulsion.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nThey live in a world of sniffing.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nThey sniff shit, they don't have to sniff.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nThat's what I thought of it.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:34.000\nMilk, you have to sniff.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:37.000\nIf you go down the road of having milk in your fridge too long, you gotta sniff the milk.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nYou gotta sniff milk kids.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:45.000\nBut even if milk kids, Google Lena Dunham, learn about misogyny and start sniffing milk.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nAnd stop sniffing everything else.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:51.000\nEven if it's good, milk smells horrible.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:52.000\nThat's true.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:55.000\nIt's always organic, you always know it's from an animal.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:59.000\nWhat other animal are there grown-ups still drinking milk?\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:03.000\nLet alone another fucking species milk.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nNone, it's just us.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:09.000\nWe modified a gene to still drink milk after infancy.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nWe're crazy people.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:18.000\nHere's a continuation of my Unsung Heroes segment, which I started with Lena Dunham.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nUnsung Heroes!\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:24.000\nWhat was that?\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nLena Dunham's pretty sung as a hero, she's fine.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.000\nWhat song was that?\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:30.000\nIt's You Drive Me Eight by the Dickies.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nOh, right.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:37.000\nWhat's your favorite song of theirs, John?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:42.000\nOh, probably Sniffer.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nI think that's on their second EP.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nBog Stompers or whatever that word was.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:48.000\nBog Trotter?\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:55.000\nI think Bog Trotter opened for Jethro Tull on the 72 Tour, I think.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:58.000\nHey, you guys, what happened to Russell Brandt?\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nWhat happened to him, Dan?\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:05.000\nI retweeted a thing that he said about how when he was poor and he complained about the class system,\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:08.000\npeople called him, what, I can't remember what he said.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:13.000\nAnd then he had a quote that somebody tweeted to me,\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:17.000\nbecause probably because it reminded them as a Harmontown fan of things that I kind of express,\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:22.000\nbecause I'm a privileged, I've cheated the system, I live at the top.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:28.000\nI'm one percenter, but I got a guy that mows my lawn.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:36.000\nAnd so months back when I was ranting a lot about capitalism, remember that episode?\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:41.000\nSometimes the response is like, fuck you, why don't you give all your money away then?\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:44.000\nAnd I was like, that's fucking horse shit.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nHow's that a response to any system?\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nIf you didn't like communism when you were in the party,\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:54.000\ngive your power to some other dude, that's pretty convenient response to criticizing a system.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nWhy don't you go fuck off?\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nHow does that solve anything?\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:05.000\nSomebody sent me a quote that he had somewhere that I immediately retweeted,\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nbecause I was like, oh yeah, exactly.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nAnd I can't remember it exactly.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:17.000\nIt was like, when I was poor and I talked about class, people called me a hater.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:20.000\nBitter, a hater.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:23.000\nThey told me it was taking too much hater aid.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:26.000\nWhen I was poor and I talked about class, they called me a hater.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nWhen I was rich and I talked about class, they called me a hypocrite.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nA hypocrite, right?\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:34.000\nAnd it's like, I'm getting the feeling nobody wants to talk about class.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:39.000\nAnd I retweeted it, and you know, I have 250,000 followers.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:42.000\nThey're all pretty, what?\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:46.000\nYeah, no, that's okay, thank you.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:50.000\nSo this isn't even a sample size from the ocean of humanity.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:53.000\nThis is a sample from my Twitter followers.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:59.000\nOverwhelmingly, just 10 or 20 people just kind of just responding back to go,\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:04.000\nI think maybe it's possible they don't want to hear from fucking Russell Brand.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nI get it.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:14.000\nThe weird thing is, I spent all of the time up until his disappearance from the earth,\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:18.000\nwhich is what my question is about, going, why is he popular?\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:21.000\nI like getting him to the Greek. I think it's a funny movie.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nIs that even wrong? It's a good movie.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nIt's got a really nice Hollywood mainstream structure.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:29.000\nWhere did he go? Is he now blacklisted?\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nHe wrote a book.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:36.000\nHe had a few movies in a row that didn't do well here, and I think he went back.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nSo it wasn't because he became...\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nIt wasn't because he became...\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nThat's what happened. That's what I'm terrified of.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:47.000\nJust like, sorry, didn't work out.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:53.000\nI met him once. It was at a dinner with him, and he was incredibly charming.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nHe was very smart and very funny and very nice.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:56.000\nHe's very eloquent.\n\n47:56.000 --> 48:02.000\nBut also, his shirt had buttons on it, but he wasn't using any of them.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nIt was completely unbuttoned.\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nLike a Robert Plant-ish sort of thing?\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:11.000\nYeah, but it was like, maybe the button that was so low, it was below his belt,\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:16.000\nit didn't even need to be buttoned, because he was more or less shirtless the whole time.\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:20.000\nAnd when he talked to me and he talked to women, like he was just very...\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nHe'd write a book and he'd say,\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:26.000\nchest to chest, nipple to nipple with Russell Brandt.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:30.000\nAnd he makes you feel very wanted.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nI think for me, that's what's for sale.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:39.000\nHe kind of makes you feel like you're about to get maybe made out with by a next heroin user.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\nIt's very exciting.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:46.000\nOur built-in spring-loaded mechanism by which anyone who lives a privileged lifestyle,\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:50.000\nlike an actor who happens to be a celebrity, who should be so thankful for the lifestyle\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:56.000\nthey've been granted by the government-slash-people-slash-people magazine-slash-government magazine,\n\n48:56.000 --> 49:07.000\nthere are instincts to clamp down on their necks until they're dead the minute they talk about anything other than red carpets\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:08.000\nand what they're wearing.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nYou're supposed to have been bought off.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nI thought we had to shut up.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nYou're famous, all right? Why don't you shut the fuck up?\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:18.000\nYeah, I get like, stick to your jokes so many times on Twitter.\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:23.000\nIf I say anything that's like some sort of opinion of political or anything.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nI think it's so many times.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:26.000\nI think it's fine.\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:29.000\nIf Bruce Willis got on Twitter and was like,\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:32.000\nhey, you know, six million, it's a pretty high number.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:36.000\nYou know, I think it's fine to say to him,\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:40.000\nyou're in fucking diehard, why are you a revisionist?\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:45.000\nOh, got it.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:48.000\nThat number has been 9-11, by the way, huh?\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nWhenever you think of six million?\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:51.000\nYeah, you can't be like, yeah.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nCertain numbers are ruined.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:55.000\nThanks a lot.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nYeah, way to go, Germany.\n\n49:57.000 --> 50:00.000\nYou ruin the number of six million for everybody.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:04.000\nSo if you were going to get paid six million, could you just pay me 5,990,000?\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:07.000\nI just feel more comfortable, I think, with that number on the chat.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nIt's like the 13th floor of a hotel.\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:10.000\nYeah, we just stop using it at all.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:13.000\nJust eliminate it.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:14.000\nIt's fine.\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nAs a consumer, you have the right to say,\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nI enjoy Liam Neeson fighting wolves.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:21.000\nI do not enjoy Liam Neeson's opinion about breast cancer.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:25.000\nYou have a right to buy anything you want.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nBut you don't have a right to tell them to shut up.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nWell, you do have a right to tell them to shut up.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:37.000\nBut what I am saying is, our instinct to do so collectively is,\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:42.000\nI'm telling you, when you do that, whose side are you on?\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:45.000\nYou are on the side of all, I just keep saying,\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:48.000\nwhen you tell someone to shut up,\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:51.000\nwhen you tell someone that they should be less ambitious,\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.000\nwhen you tell someone that they should be less ignorant.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:58.000\nIgnorance, a hugely important thing in all life.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:03.000\nIt is the thing that happens before knowing things.\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nIt's different from intolerance.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:09.000\nIgnorance, when you meet someone who just doesn't know something yet,\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:12.000\nthe way you're going to find out that they don't know it yet\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.000\nis through their big fucking flappy mouth.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:19.000\nWhen we discourage that, which is what kittens are doing\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:22.000\nwhen they're attacking a paper ball on the floor,\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:27.000\nyou don't tell the kitten, that's not a dog, knock it off.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:31.000\nYou can't eat that. Get in your kitten hole.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:34.000\nBe a more efficient kitten.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:37.000\nWe love experimentation and play.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:40.000\nIt is vital to us as a species.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:45.000\nWhen we discourage it, can we not just realize\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:49.000\nthat when you're saying something to someone,\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:53.000\nif it's not something that Snickers would disagree with?\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:54.000\nBig Snickers.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nBig Snickers.\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nYou can still say it,\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:01.000\nbecause maybe Snickers isn't wrong about everything,\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:04.000\nbut are you a hero?\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:08.000\nWhat do you think Liam Neeson's stance on breast cancer is, Dan?\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:09.000\nControversially enough?\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:12.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:13.000\nNo, it does, Liam.\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nI know he has a horrible controversial PSA.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:18.000\nIt doesn't matter if you have breast cancer.\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:22.000\nIt doesn't matter if it's the number one killer of women.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:25.000\nWolves matter.\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:28.000\nHe's going somewhere as a conceit with that.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nHe doesn't just stop there. It doesn't matter.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nCancerous breasts don't have cubs.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nThey can't kill you with their teeth.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:37.000\nDo you think that Liam Neeson was into wolves before that movie,\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nor the movie was made around him?\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:40.000\nI think he called him.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nI think he saw it was being made.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:45.000\nI think it was starring Tom Green or something.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:48.000\nIt was going to go a whole different way with wacky wolves.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:51.000\nJudging from how that movie goes, I think it was a comedy.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:54.000\nIt was like Rob Schneider can't get a break.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:57.000\nWhen Rob Schneider beats these four wolves,\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nhe's got a wolf.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nI think the wolves probably talked in a lot of the seats.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:04.000\nLike, hey, Rob, you know we're going to kill you in act two.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nNo.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nAnd then it's like, I have Liam Neeson on line one.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nWhat?\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:13.000\nI'm very passionate about the movie you're making.\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nThe wolf movie?\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nThe Rob Schneider movie?\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:22.000\nI spent time with my daughter at the Botanical Gardens.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nGo on.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:28.000\nHow did wolves tie into the Botanical Gardens?\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:32.000\nThe Botanical Gardens are the one type of garden wolves shouldn't be in.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nExactly.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nAnd the last thing that would remind you of the snow.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:41.000\nI also like that the people making the movie are calling it that wolves movie.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nSo dismissive.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:47.000\nAnd that they're ready to drop Schneider and the comedic tone in a fucking one phone call.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:50.000\nThey can't eat without plates.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nYeah.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nAll right.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nSo Rob Schneider and...\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nCan Rob Schneider talk about his opinions?\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nSure, everybody can.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nEverybody can.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:06.000\nAnd we do a podcast and all we do is mouth off about our stupid opinions about everything.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nSo like, we can't really say anything.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:11.000\nBut I think it is really dumb to expect celebrities to have,\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:14.000\nfor their opinions, to wave anything at all.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:18.000\nOnce in a while there will be a celebrity who is thoughtful and intelligent\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nand will say something that actually means something.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nBut who gives a fuck what Kevin Bacon thinks?\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:25.000\nThat shouldn't matter on the face of, at face value.\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:30.000\nYeah, Charles Barkley said something about how he was like,\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nracial profiling isn't bad for cops.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:35.000\nAnd it's like, who the fuck cares what Charles Barkley thinks about?\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:39.000\nWell, also you can't be profiled if you're more famous than the type that you look.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nLike, oh, it's Charles Barkley.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nI know exactly who that is.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nYeah, he looks like Charles Barkley.\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:48.000\nYeah, he's like, I'm a black man and everyone's nice to me.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:52.000\nThe first thought is in black man.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nIt's, oh, Charles Barkley, the famous NBA star.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:59.000\nI've seen him more than I've seen any black man here on TV.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:02.000\nI met Charles Barkley in Portland after doing a show on time.\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nAnd we were all going to get the bar closed down.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:07.000\nAnd he just started telling me stories about being best friends with Michael Jordan.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nAnd it was like the coolest night.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nHe was just like, he's fucking hilarious.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:12.000\nHow did Jordan come off?\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:16.000\nJordan comes off like a guy that, you know, like a nice guy gambling problem.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:17.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nAnd so it's just like, he's like Jeff.\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:20.000\nHe's like Jeff.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:21.000\nWhen you met Michael Jordan.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:25.000\nNo, I met Charles Barkley who talked about being best friends with Michael Jordan.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:28.000\nCharles Barkley tells stories about being friends with Michael Jordan,\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nwhich is the Michael Jordan stories.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:33.000\nEverybody is, yeah, even his name dropped.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nAnd so that's, yeah, exactly.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:39.000\nHe could tell a story about just himself and it would be name dropped.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:42.000\nBut then no ring club drops the ring club.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:45.000\nI mean, like that's the only long crowd buddy.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:46.000\nThey don't know about rings.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:47.000\nOh, they don't.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:48.000\nSome basketball.\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:52.000\nThese five blonde women came in the bar and they were all local news anchors.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:55.000\nLike they're all the women that worked in the local news channel in Portland, apparently.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:59.000\nAnd he's like, he's like, Jeff, apparently we were best friends now.\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:03.000\nI was sitting next to him and he's like, we got to go to another bar after this.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:06.000\nI go, there's a bar right on the corner that's open.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:13.000\nA little after this, he's like, you realize you and I have to fuck some of these women.\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nI'm like, aren't you married?\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nHe's like, yeah.\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:21.000\nI'm Charles Barkley married.\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nYou know, I'm tall.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:24.000\nHe's a little tall.\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nHe's twice as tall.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nHe's a big, he's a big fucker.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:29.000\nHe's huge.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nI could get inside him like a costume.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nLike a tauntaun.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:34.000\nExactly.\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:37.000\nI got to cut open Charles Barkley to get all inside him.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nI thought Charles Barkley is so bad.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nOn the outside.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nSo I go, okay, this is bar.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.000\nI invite these girls to this bar.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nI go, it's just like, we can walk there.\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:49.000\nIt's like two blocks away.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:52.000\nHe's like, Jeff, Jeff, we're not walking anywhere, baby.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nI got the van.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:58.000\nAnd sure enough, a fucking A-team, a fucking mystery machine, fucking full on.\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:01.000\nWindowless, white van.\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:04.000\nAnd glamorizing John Wayne Gacy.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:08.000\nMan, I got the wagon, man.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:13.000\nWe're going to take these teenage boys home and show them the rope trick.\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nHe's a welder.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nI got the crawl space, man.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:20.000\nWe don't have to deal with this.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:23.000\nI got the crawl space, baby.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:28.000\nYou know you and I have to eat some of these children.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:33.000\nWe are hip-deep in human lampshade right now.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:36.000\nNot fucking a full on A-team black van.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:39.000\nThat with a sliding door, like an old school fucking like,\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nlike a Fort O'Connor line pulled up with like a,\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nmaybe I'm mythologizing.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:44.000\nI think it had a heart.\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nWell, I'd love to see like security footage of this,\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:49.000\nand it's not Charles Barkley.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nIt's just some dude.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nIt's Jeff and a broom.\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:57.000\nHe was just Barkley profiling a broom.\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:00.000\nExactly.\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nHe sounded just like him, you guys.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:05.000\nYeah, the five newscasters are just like three cats.\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:08.000\nLook, he was certainly a large black man.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nHe was a large black man.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nIt might as well have been Charles Barkley.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:16.000\nWhat is the team of the six blonde newscaster women?\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:20.000\nMaybe you just gave a random dude courage enough to fuck these women\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nbecause he thought he was Charles Barkley for a second.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:25.000\nLook, whether it was Charles Barkley or not,\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nI got Charles Barkley laid that night.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nBecause all he wanted was a wingman.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nSo like, you know, Drew Carey's there.\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:32.000\nWe're all hanging out.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:33.000\nThe only reason that he was there.\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:34.000\nWhere did you go?\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:38.000\nLike playing at Hollywood in the dream of the people who founded it?\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:43.000\nLike, where was this place?\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:46.000\nThere was a colorized John Wayne.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:49.000\nGet on some of this pussy.\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:52.000\nThe Star Wars band with the big heads.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:56.000\nGene Kelly dances.\n\n58:56.000 --> 59:04.000\nWe're going to fuck some of these pilgrims.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:05.000\nRussell Brand not there.\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nHe dropped off the face of the earth.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:08.000\nThere's no more.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nIt was a goucho grill in Portland, Oregon.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:11.000\nAnd that's the end.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:12.000\nBut so we get this.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:13.000\nI was like, we can walk.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nThey're like, no, we're not walking anywhere, baby.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:16.000\nI got the van.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:20.000\nAnd he puts his arm around me in a very like dominating fashion,\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:21.000\nlike headlocks me.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.000\nHe's like, you're rolling with me tonight, Jeff.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:31.000\nLike training day.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:32.000\nSo we get to the bar.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:35.000\nI go, Sir Charles, can I get you a drink?\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:38.000\nHe's like, give me like a triple vodka cranberry.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:39.000\nSomething awesome.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nLike he ordered a triple because he's huge.\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:42.000\nAnd so I go to the bar.\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:46.000\nHe goes and meets these girls and instantly leaves with them.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.000\nHe's gone.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:48.000\nHe goes up there.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nNo, we're there for a minute.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:51.000\nAnd then we're up there hanging out.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:52.000\nAnd I go up to go to the bathroom.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nHe's like, Jeff, baby, baby, you're not leaving, baby.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:55.000\nYou're not leaving.\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:56.000\nYou're not leaving.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:57.000\nI go, I'm just going to go to the bathroom.\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:58.000\nCharles Barkley.\n\n59:58.000 --> 59:59.000\nI'll be right back.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nAnd then I came back.\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nAnd when I came back, he was gone.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nHe was gone.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nHe took all the girls and left.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nThe Charles Barkley pickup line book is like, hey, I'm Charles Barkley.\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nAnd that's the book.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nLike once you say that, like.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nWell, he got me in a van.\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nI didn't even say shit.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nLike, I guess like.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nI do like the idea of him like the about going back to his race stuff.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nLike thinking that his like experiences.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nLike, oh, things are much easier for black people.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nAs soon as I joined the Phoenix.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nIf it came, everything is equal.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nThat's his advice to be able to just join the suns and.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nYou have to be Charles Barkley because he's kind of adorable and he's funny.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nJason Kidd is seems like an asshole.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nHe was in the suns too.\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nNo one likes that guy.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nWell, he also had some spies to the abuse stuff.\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nYou know, he's got stuff.\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nIt's still sports talk, even if there's child abuse involved.\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nYou're still talking about sports.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nSorry.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nDeal breaker.\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nAll right.\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nI want to, I want to, I want to go into our heartbreaker segment.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nIs that more dickies?\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nIt's still dickies.\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nSo it's just the same thing, but we advanced.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nDo you want different music?\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nBecause we have.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nNo, that's good.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nThat's good.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nWe have to use up my music before we have to change everything.\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nThis is a heartbreaker that I want to do our old friend, our friend of the show.\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nDick Donnelly, who I tweeted.\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nHe was, he was here one night.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nHe had a massive eruption of bullshit in his brain.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nWhat was this?\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nI think that's the medical term.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nIt was, he didn't, it wasn't an aneurysm.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nWe'll let him, we'll let him describe it for a second.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nBut actually, I think if I just bottomed through the explanation.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nBontrotters.\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nI, he, he, and he, like, he came back.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nNow I'm stuttering while I'm describing it.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nHe came back into the green room and his stutter was like, like, because it had hit his verbal\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\ncenter.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nAnd I was, I thought about bringing him up that night, but I'm telling you, it was just\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nlike too, it was like, it's too frustrating for him to talk.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nWe've been tracking this guy's adventures since, since we met him.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nAnd, and then was that night.\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nAnd I tweeted like, oh my God, he's all, this thing happened and he's, he's pretty fucked\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nup.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nBut he's, he's here tonight and he's, he's, he's going to, going to see his mom for Christmas\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nas a seeker you hear.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nCan you, can you come up?\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nI wanted to touch base with you and send you off for the holidays because so many people\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nwere so concerned about you when I tweeted that stuff because it was a tragedy.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nWell, but you talk now, you sound better.\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nThank you.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nI want to say thanks to everyone.\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nI'm now nervous, but everyone who wrote based off your tweet and said nice things to me.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nI don't, I didn't know I had such an impact on people.\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nIt was a, it was an eye-opener for me.\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nI think I knew that when we talked about the Kickstarter and saw everyone fund it in a day.\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nAnd that was the first time it really clicked with me, but then to see a lot of people respond\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000\non Reddit and, and, and on Twitter and write me personal messages.\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nIt just, I just want to say being a Armenian has been like the best thing ever.\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nAnd you guys are all really awesome people.\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nThere's like a crazy thing that you said to me in the green room because the first time we met you,\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nthe first conversation we had with you on stage, we talked about the tragedy,\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nwhich I remember like Erin was like crying because like, like she heard it for the first time on stage.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nThat you're, when you had your, to catch you up, Iron Man 3, the seek, seek for whatever reason,\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nhe's a medical phenomenon, has had multiple aneurysms and has survived them,\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nbut has no guarantee that he won't continue to have them and has gone through experimental treatment\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nat the hands of these people.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nAnd then there was an episode where Seek said, said, said to us that, that he told these people\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nwho had been experimentally treating his aneurysms, which had had some results,\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nbut that ultimately there was a point where you said, for better or for worse, I am ending this chapter.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nI'm going forward into a world without this particular treatment where they put these coils in stuff like that.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nAnd then you went off and we were like, okay, Godspeed, what's going to happen now?\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nBecause as you said, like as you were off the treatment, like your memories were starting to happen\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nand your visual centers were starting to light up.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nThis tragedy that happened to you recently was actually one of these coils blue.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nYeah, no, one of the coils, which is rare that this would happen, slid out\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nand punctured another piece of my brain.\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nAnd it was a Sunday night and I remember waking up screaming and was taken to the ER\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nand they weren't my normal doctor.\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nSo they did a CT scan at MRI, they didn't find anything.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nBut I knew something was wrong, so I kept screaming about pain.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nAnd then I left to go do a comic book signing in Arizona while in pain.\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nThe show must go on.\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nYeah, pretty much, because they kept telling me nothing was wrong.\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nAnd sometimes I have things that are psychological.\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nSo I'll go, okay, maybe this is one of those things, I'm not in pain.\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nAnd then I came back the next day from Arizona and couldn't talk, almost at all.\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nAnd then I felt trapped because that happened to me when the first aneurysm ruptured.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nAnd I've had nine scents and luckily none ruptured.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nSo the coil slid out of the ninth one and it punctured a piece of my brain\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nand my brain bled for five days until I went back to the doctor\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nand saw my doctor a second time and they found the problem.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nBut at that point, it was too late, the damage was done.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nThe bleeding stopped on its own, luckily, because it wasn't a lot,\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nbut just enough to break a levy or something.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nBut the good news is that when you came out of the green room that night\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nto do an impression of it, you couldn't say a single word without eight stutters.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nIt was frustrating for me.\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nIt must be being trapped in a coffin.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nYeah, to me it was awful.\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nI feel weird complaining about it because when I go to the hospital to deal with these things,\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nI meet people who are way worse.\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nAnd I'm part of aneurysm groups where people are way worse.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nSo I try to let that keep me grounded of how much I complain about it.\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nBut you look, I mean, listening to you has so much perspective.\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nWe take so much for granted.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nI was complaining about people telling me on Twitter to stick to my jokes.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nThat's fine though.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nThat's all real fun.\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nI don't know if this is the worst problem anyone's ever had.\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nThat was me.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nI don't think that that's the key to life.\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nI don't think that the key to life is all of us figuring out\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nthat we should be using a metric by which every day we wake up in bed\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nif we don't have every problem that everyone has.\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nI'm not saying that what I'm saying is having perspective for me is it really helps.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nYeah, it's very important.\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nAnd you get, like, you see the big picture and just because, you know,\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000\npeople are starving in Africa doesn't mean you can't get pissed about being stuck in a traffic jam.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nI'm not saying that.\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nEspecially if a starving African child cuts you off.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nWhich I forgot to talk about.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nThat is number one on my list of shit.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nYeah, I'm like, why are you starving? Just sell the car.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nIt's a fucking hummer.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nBut I think for, obviously, we all have problems and relative to us,\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nthose are big problems, but to hear you talk about some of the issues you've had\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nand then to hear you say that you don't think those issues are as major as what someone else has,\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nlike, that's very inspiring.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nAnd it's just good to have perspective.\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nSorry.\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nSee, are your memories still the same?\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nAre you making memories again or no?\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nYeah, I mean, I'm going to see my mom and this will, I haven't seen her in a couple of years.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nThis is the good news that I want to talk about.\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nOkay, go.\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nBut I own this. I own this.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nThis is all from Dan.\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nMy mom, we kind of grew apart when I didn't have any memories of her.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nSo she didn't know how to handle that, like, you know, and I don't blame her.\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nAnd you literally had no, like, no old memories, no childhood memories, nothing?\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nNo, I mean, I don't, I didn't get visual, you know, so I could kind of know that she was my mom,\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nbut I felt it.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nBut you don't conjure up any visual attachment?\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nNo, no, but now I can.\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nReally?\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nAnd I mean, I know what NT looks like and Adam Goldberg looks like.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nHey, there's pros and cons to everything.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nI only know what he sounds like.\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nOh, wait, oh, I know you now.\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nOkay, all right, no, all right.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nShut the fuck up.\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nGoldberg had, like, an achievement unlocked thing.\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nHe gets the green lightsaber now.\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nEasy shot, easy shot.\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nSo my mom, my mom, she just, she's, we, you know, I'm a big Superman fan, big Star Wars fan.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nSo my mom is, we had this connection recently where she said, I said, mom, I remember you and I used to drive her,\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nlike, whenever she had extra money on a, we grew up poor, like, we're both still poor, my mom and I.\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nAnd she was like, do you remember driving around looking for Star Wars figures, like, to different toy stores\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nand, you know, trying to find, like, the R2-D2 that, like, was the rare figure in the set,\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nor the slave-layer, you know, variant or whatever.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nAnd so we recently had been buying Star Wars figures together, like me on the east,\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nthey're here west coast and her on the east coast, and it kind of rebuilt this, like, connection with us.\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nAnd so she'll send me pictures of the stuff she's buying, which are waiting for me when I go home,\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nand I've been Instagramming them, like, look at the toy my mom found me,\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nand it kind of gave my Instagram a purpose, besides, like, pictures of my dog.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nSo it's, so it's been, it's been kind of nice, and so now we, I have almost every memory of her, I think.\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nIt's been coming back to you, you said, like, you, you're, and I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing,\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nI don't know if this should be a celebrated, like, Reese Witherspoon seeing things in color in Pleasantville.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nYou are in a sleepless state, you can't sleep right now, your brain is exploding with, that's a bad idiom.\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nYour mind is exploding with, you can't tell the difference between dreams and memories right now.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nYeah, because it's so overwhelming, like, I, like my neighbor who, like, is a really good friend of mine,\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nand she, I can now close my eyes and I know, and I can see what she looks like.\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nShe's not even in the room.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nWhereas before someone had to describe an apple, and you would like,\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nand we can't even comprehend it, because we're, we're trying to figure out what that even meant before,\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nwhere you were like learning to draw because you were an artist, lost your visual memory,\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nand you had to like, you couldn't see that.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nNow you can't not see things, now you close your eyes and you see things.\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nAnd it's, it's pretty horrifying.\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nBecause, because I've been remembering things that aren't good things either, you know, like, I, I'm, I mean, I never thought I,\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nI don't know, I never thought I was a good person, like I grew up pretty broken, abusive dad, you know, like a poor,\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nran away from home, got into drugs, I was a narc, like, I mean, I've done like really crazy things.\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nWow.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nAnd you were a narc?\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nIn Atlanta.\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nThis is turning into memento.\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nOne memory is going to come back.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nNot the money!\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nLike, like, it's buried in Central Park!\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nOh wait, I was undercover!\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nThat's who that guy is!\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nOh my God, he's been following people for a year!\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nUm, yeah, so I, but I remember when you, when you forget your life, it's easy to reset and be a good person.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nBecause I feel like deep down we all want to be good people.\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nAnd so it was easy for me, but now it's a, I, I am like, I, people don't, you know, like, I don't go out as much anymore.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nI stay recluse in my apartment because I'm afraid because I start remembering all these things and I'm like, well,\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nthat guy ever come back, you know, or now that he, now that I know, or am I smart enough now, I've done enough good now,\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nI've given more than I've taken, like, did I, am I okay, am I in the clear, you know?\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nSo I, so I've been struggling a lot lately and it's brought me in and out of depression and brought me, you know,\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000\na lot of places emotionally I couldn't go before because I had emotional problems.\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nSo now, like, as far as, you know, knowing when to be sad and when the right time to be sad, I had issues with that.\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nNow I know when to cry, I know when to be upset.\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nAnd so to know that and to know, like, the good and bad things you've done in your life and to know that there are people out there\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nthat have kept, like, those things, like, private, you know, like, I just, like, it's like a lot to digest.\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nSo, um...\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nDo you think that people should always be transparent about every scrap of darkness inside of them,\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nor do you think it's important for us to hold on to the things, protect them, guard them, have shameful things that way?\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nI mean, I don't, I don't know.\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nIt's, that's a good question.\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nI think it's, it gets case by case.\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000\nI think, I think, like, for me, I probably won't share some of those things,\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:06.000\nbut I will try to make amends with someone who I think I've wronged on a personal level and secretly with them,\n\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nand just hope that's enough.\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nAnd, and I will, you know, I mean, yeah, it's, it's, I think it's just case by case.\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nMe, I've lived these past five years, you know, I'll be, I'll be 33 in May next year.\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nSo it'll be my, it's essentially my fifth birthday.\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nAnd out of this new life, and I, I want to keep going with this new life.\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nI want to look at the mistakes I've made, and I think that's everyone, everyone who's made a mistake.\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nYou look at it, you dissect it.\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nEvery morning you wake up.\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nYou have this new chance.\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nIt's kind of like, not to crassly like force that weld to all the stuff that we were talking about with the online culture.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nBut it's like, you do have an opportunity every morning to wake up to kind of change.\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nYou could, you could just go, you know what, I may, I may not be reacting with, like, regular shit.\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nBut I thought, I thought my, what I thought was my neutral gear actually is like a weird gear that was like handed to me by somebody above me or my past.\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nAnd actually there is a true neutral and you can just achieve it.\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nThat's a, I don't, well, I'm not a doctor, but I doubt that you'll be overtaken in your wildest dreams that would happen.\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nI think we would love to have evil seek back.\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nYou come back and tell us how women shouldn't vote.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nI remember now.\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nSuperman.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nThis is for faggots.\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nI think we would, the crazy thing is those seriously, like there would be a huge lesson too.\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nBecause we could, we could, I think, I think all of the women and faggots in this audience could like watch you bound out like the Hulk and go, I love that guy.\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nI'm glad he's back.\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nI'm glad he didn't.\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nI think it's a cool opportunity in a way.\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nI mean, obviously you want to be able to have all your memories back.\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nBut to be able to say this, I'm like, I don't, like, I get to choose right now whether I am a good person or I, or do I dwell on the bad things that I did.\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nAnd that's, we should all wake up tomorrow morning and say, fuck all the bad shit I did.\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nLet's just start being good from here forward.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nAnd like, and absolutely just hit control, alternate delete and reset everything.\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nAnd walk forward and don't feel ashamed of all the things that you've done.\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nI mean, certainly you want to go back and make amends for wrongs you've done people.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nSure.\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nBut I think you'd find that that's probably a very small part of you.\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nWell, and you'll also find that people are forgiving.\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nI learned that, you know, pretty recently.\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nAnd I think, I think, I wake up every morning with the question of like, like, because I, like I said, I'm part of aneurysm groups.\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nI meet other people, I go to hospitals and, and, and was at one point part of like a monthly group that we met.\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nAnd I see that I'm, I'm doing much better than a lot of people and other people are doing better than me too.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nBut so I wake up every day going, what, what can I do that they can't that, but should be done?\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nYou know, like, what can I do for them to help spread a message or help, you know, do something good, light a fire under somebody who needs inspiration?\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nYou know, like, how can I give?\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nAnd I think if we wake up every day with that, I think, I mean, I think then we will stop giving a shit about people.\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000\nLike, what does, you know, Kevin Costner think about this?\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nOr, you know, who cares what Christian Bale is thinks about the new Batman?\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nLike, who gives a shit that's not news?\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nLike, here's a new Batman.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nThere's a new Batman every five years.\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nI'll be Batman in five years.\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nAlso, the fact that you just spoke for a couple of minutes without stuttering a single time in a while and just recently you couldn't talk.\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nAnd that's the miracle of our podcast.\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nAnd you at home, if you're watching, we need your money.\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nUnless you want to seek on other people to continue to suffer, sign the back of your social security check and mail it into Harmontown.\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nI have a question.\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nSorry, go ahead.\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nNo, go ahead, please.\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nI was going to ask you how, I don't know how brains work.\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nHow is your, how are your memories coming back?\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nIt's interesting that it was in there.\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nIt wasn't that it was gone.\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nIt just, you couldn't access it.\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nDo you know how it's all coming back?\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nWell, I mean, stuff heals over time, especially the mind.\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nAnd so sometimes it's, it's not like one set spot where everything is in your brain.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nIt's different for everyone.\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nIt's, I, that's why I think like, I don't know, I admit this is, I don't want to get too out there with this, but I, I, I look at a very good blend of the supernatural and the scientific.\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nYou know, like I feel like I'm surrounded by that a lot because I feel like I've dodged more bullets than I would have.\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nIf I was a God in charge, I would have given me.\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nSo just to be clear, would you mean like when the tissue is damaged,\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nthe memories that that tissue was responsible for go offline?\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nBut when the tissue heals, then those memories like reappear in the hard drive?\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000\nNo, not in every case.\n\n01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nBut in some cases, mine, it seems where it was damaged.\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nIt was just the link going to memories was the damage part.\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nSo now when things kind of rewire and rewire around the damage, things start coming together.\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nIt's not a real thing. It's these ideas are just stored somewhere in this lump of toothpaste we have in our heads.\n\n01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nThat's some of the, I mean, I'm not allowed to talk about most of it, but some of the research stuff I've been part of is, is that kind of stuff.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nIt's asking a big way.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nIs it Spoilers?\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nIs Will Smith doing the research?\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nHey, Spoilers!\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nThere's research that's gonna come out for the four years.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nThey're giving him standards powers, man. You can't talk about that shit.\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nIf anyone's allowed to talk about anything.\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nYeah, fuck them.\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nI sign a lot of documents.\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nBut you can just say you didn't remember that, and they'll have to buy it.\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000\nAre they gonna sue you?\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nYou have the best excuse for anything.\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nOh yeah, you can be like, that was evil seeks not bad.\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nI want to get my wife and my Dungeon Master out here pretty quickly.\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nBut Seek, what is there anything else you want to say before you go out for the holidays?\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nYeah, I mean, I know my boss would love me to plug something, but instead I'd rather everyone here just do something nice for somebody for the holidays.\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nGive to Feral Audio if you can donate.\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nGive to Brainiers and Foundation, or the Joe Necro Foundation.\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nGive it to the Brainiers and yourism.\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nOkay, Feral, thank you.\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nGive it to something that really needs it.\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nBut just do something selfless. That's all I ask.\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nDustin's giving you the finger right now.\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nWell, people have brain problems, Dustin.\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nI'm joking, he wasn't doing that. I'm sure he agrees with you.\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nNow he is.\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000\nI'm sure he agrees with you.\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nThank you for having me.\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nMerry Christmas. Happy holidays.\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nTell your mom we said hi.\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nLet's bring out Erin McGathy and Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nYay!\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nOh, shit.

Wait for the theme song.\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nHi. Hi.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nAre you high or mad?\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nI'm both. Let me tell you guys something.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nThen that's shit weave.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nWhen he's both, that's a fucking podcast goal.\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nThis is all, I'm just putting it on for the audience.\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nIt's not marijuana. It's not.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nBut, you know, Target, I'm pretty sure.\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nWait, is it a gateway? What?\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nAre you co-baiting?\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nIs there a gateway?\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nThere is a gateway. Have you gone through it?\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nNo, what?\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nJust trying to, you know, Russell Brand, he's not off the map.\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nHe hasn't fallen off the map at all.\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nHe's become a lot, a lot, very politicized, and he has his own YouTube TV show where it's like the O'Reilly Factor,\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nbut with Russell Brand.\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nThat sounds like falling off the map.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nThat's so weird. Doesn't Charlie Sheen have that?\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nYeah, exactly. Tom Green has that.\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nHe's making the real grassroots.\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nIsn't there a Nambla channel on YouTube?\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nHe's making a huge comeback. I resent that very much.\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nWhat are you mad about?\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nHe just hit a thousand subscribers on his channel.\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nWait till the Namblates hear about this.\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nThe Namblates?\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nYeah, yeah, me and the Namblates.\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nAll right, sorry, we're derailing you. What are you?\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nWhat's on your mind, Spencer?\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nNothing's on my mind. Just you guys are hating on Russell Brand just because he's trying to make a political difference.\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nNo, I said he was sexy and didn't button his shirt.\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nHe said the movie was good.\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nYeah, I said nothing bad about him either.\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nHe's not falling off. He's not falling off, Russell.\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nI know. I know.\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nMe and Russ. Rusty.\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nHe's saying he's falling off. I was on his side.\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nI call him Rusty.\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nRusty Rockets.\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nI was suspicious that he was being targeted and punished by...\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nLena Dunham?\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nYou know, her dog...\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nYou don't listen in the back.\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nLena Dunham's dog bites people.\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nHe's not okay.\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nIt's not okay.\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nHe's getting his memories back one at a time, but just from 20 minutes ago, so it's not...\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nWell, yeah, I have to catch up. Russell Brand target.\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nYou know those aisles, those shelves?\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nIn California, they bolt him down because of earthquakes.\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nAnd this guy can kill your character at any time?\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nWhat character? We're already dead.\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nThey bolt him down because of earthquakes. How do you know that?\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nWell, I mean, they bolted the ones at borders down.\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nAnd those are the same concept, you know, shelves with product on them.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nDid you work?\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nIt's a building code thing.\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nDid you work at borders?\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nWe knew all about...\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nYeah, you know, bookshelves are just borders.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nYou've got a real...\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nWith books on them.\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nProfessor, do you... I don't know.\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nWho's Andy Rooney?\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nWho's Andy Rooney?\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nWho's this Andy Rooney I keep hearing about?\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nSeems like every time I turn on a podcast that has someone over 30 on it, they're referencing Andy Rooney.\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nIs that a gene salad?\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nI take exception at a reference I don't understand.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nI'd like people to reference things I do understand.\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nThat's with soap.\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nHow small does it have to get?\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nAndy Rooney was a guy at 60 Minutes who would basically do...\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nOne of the most brilliant pieces I ever saw in Spy Magazine existed is they created a column that was a...\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nOn one side it was Andy Rooney comments, and on the other side it was Jerry Seinfeld bits.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nAnd you had to figure out who was who.\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nAnd it was tough.\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nWell Rooney just would do the premises, but there wouldn't be any jokes after that.\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nIt would just be like, what's the deal? And then he would just keep saying that in different ways.\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nYou'd be surprised though...\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nDid he get some good lines?\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nNo, no, I'm saying you'd be surprised at how little bit you let Jerry Seinfeld get away with.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nI think the point of that column wasn't look how funny Andy Rooney is.\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nOr is it...\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nIt's not like after Seinfeld asks the question where's the sock in the dryer, he lands the fucking...\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nHe doesn't put on a Darth Vader mask and do a thing where I found the sock.\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nHe asks the question and that's what Andy really does.\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nWhere'd the sock go? Where's it go?\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nWho wears sweaters?\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nThe end.\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nDid you guys know that you can measure the passage of time by how many of Dan's buttons are unbuttoned?\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nOh, you're Russell Branding!\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nYou're Russell Branding!\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nYou're Branding, bro!\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nI'm splitting like a...\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nYou're three down to Russell.\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nI'm like a tamale.\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nDan, did you unbutton those or did your kknave. prehensile?\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nHow did that happen?\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nI assume that they were kind of...\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nI assume that I'm fat.\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nThat's not how buttons work.\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nThey'll pop off before they'll just unbutton themselves.\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nI think they will before they pop off they'll unbutton.\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nYou think so?\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nYeah, that's the... I think.\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nAlright, restart the podge.\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nThey're not on Mythbusters.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nWhat do buttons really do?\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nGet them open again.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nTry your hardest.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nDo it!\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nYou can do it!\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nBy the way, that is doing things I didn't think it could do.\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nThat...\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nOh my god!\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nHoly shit!\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nI want to open it and there's another Dan face on it.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nThis is a really good commercial for subscribing to the video feed.\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nOh yeah, if you're listening right now,\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nyou're listening later than this is happening\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nand you didn't get to see what I just did.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nLet's play some...\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nI've been away for a very long time.\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nCan we play some little D&D, please?\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nApparently, I found out terrible things happened to my character.\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nOh yeah, so many.\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nD&D, Spencer, hold on.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nIt's a game where you roll dice and we portray characters.\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nOh great, can you teach us all how to play?\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nWhoa!\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nFuck, Spencer, hey!\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nHow's it feel, Jeff?\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nIt's fucking... wow.\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nYou missed a lot, Jeff.\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nYou missed a lot.\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nDon't be angry with me, man.\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nI grew three more testicles.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nFor a total of nine.\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nWell, while Spencer's setting up,\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000\ncan I briefly also say something about Target?\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nYes.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nThank you.\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nI don't know what I would have done if you would have said no.\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nYou may speak, woman.\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nTell us about leaving to Dunham.\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nWell, one day I took my vagina into Target.\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nA couple years ago, I was at the Target on Sunset in Hollywood\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nand I was walking around and I was wearing a red shirt.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nAnd I don't know if this is still the policy,\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nbut I think the employees can just wear any old red shirt\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nas long as it doesn't have anything on it.\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nIs that correct?\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nStore-to-store.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nStore-to-store.\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nOh, cool.\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nStore-to-store.\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nInteresting.\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nSo you're saying at a PFresh, you could have meant...\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nHey, this really is the best company ever.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nYou mean I could wear a red shirt of any kind,\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nno matter where I go?\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nSo I was walking around.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nI was in the automotive section and I was in a hurry\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\ntrying to find something and this guy walked up to me\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nand he was like, hey, hey, hey.\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nCan you tell me where the blah-blah-blah is?\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nAnd I said, oh, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nI don't work here.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nAnd he's like, okay, can you tell me where the blah-blah-blah is?\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nI was asking.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nAnd it was so...\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nIt was bewildering and I found...\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nI walked with him and found it with him.\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nAnd the entire time I was waiting for him to say something,\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nand he knew I wasn't...\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nHe knew I didn't work there.\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nI was sure to leave and say,\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nI'm going to go continue my shopping.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nThat is really weird.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nThat guy was that unwilling to say in the moment,\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000\noh, sorry.\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nWell, if you ask someone individually for help,\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nthey'll do it if you're in need,\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nwhich is so strange in a store\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nwhere there are people that are paid to do that exact thing.\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nDo you think it's like I'm just maybe flirting with you possibly?\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nI don't want this transaction to be over.\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nI don't think you flirt by going,\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nokay, so you can do it anyway.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nI don't think that's...\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nMaybe Charles Barkley can get away with that,\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nbut I don't think...\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nCharles, you haven't read the game?\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nIt turns a woman on like a light.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nHe was negating her.\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nYeah, it was a long neg.\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nYou're not resulting in a purchasing name.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nSpencer, why are you so mad right now, man?\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nI hate to see you like this.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nYou guys are talking a lot of shit about Target.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nThey make a fine product.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nSpencer, do you get high before the show or during the show?\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nNo.\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nWhen you're backstage, are you getting high while we're out here?\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nThat would be illegal.\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nAll permutations, you'd suggest it just then.\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nI think we have our answers.\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nYou have a prescription.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nYou can get high anywhere you want.\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nWhat?\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nYou have a prescription, don't you?\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nNo, that stuff's illegal, man.\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nThe feds, I'm not doing it.\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nFederally, okay.\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nI have a prescription.\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nCome get me.\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nNo, you don't.\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nHey, he doesn't.\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nIn case you're wondering.\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nIt expired two years ago.\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nI'm so lazy that the feds would find nothing.\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nAre you high on your picture, on your card,\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nbecause I've seen it before and you look super high.\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nNo, I'm just that happy to be getting a pot card.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nEvery pot card picture is like, ehhh.\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nI don't think I have it in my wallet,\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nbut I'm so proud of it because I've always said,\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nwhen I looked at the photo, I was like,\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nthis is like a billboard for a Jason Sudeikis's movie\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nabout getting a pot card.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nPot card.\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nJason Sudeikis's.\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nIt's kind of like prescription because I'm in the photo,\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nI'm like.\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nI didn't get a card.\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nI just got a sheet that said with the doctor and everything.\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nYou pay extra for the card, which I was happy to do.\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nI have never, in my life,

most highbrow yo mama,\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nI fucked yo mama job?\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nOne is of Sikh's mother.\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nI have a memory of your mother.\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nWith a multiple aneurysm survivor,\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nyou don't have to fuck him.\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nYou can just say, I remember your mama.\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nToo soon?\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nNo, you gotta get him in.\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nOh fuck it.\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nThe, damn it, you guys.\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nWalking to my car after,\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nlike with a bag, a pharmacy bag with marijuana in it,\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000\nwith a receipt stapled to it that said visa.\n\n01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nI bought it with a credit card.\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nPot, because I'm Sikh and I need medicine.\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nAnd capitalism and democracy.\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nWhat is your main element, Dan, that necessitates the pot?\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nI think they led me into nausea?\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nOh, do they like lead you?\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nI like walk you down the path.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nThere's three doorways that you have to step through.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nI have answered the pot riddle,\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nor the pot will not be granted.\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nI think ultimately it came down to...\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nSpencer, can you give me pot dungeon master?\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nWait, what?\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nPot dungeon master.\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nWhat are you...\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nI'm not sure if I'm doing it,\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nor if I just don't get what your premise is.\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nSpencer, how high are you?\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nYou just said pot dungeon master, like that means anything.\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nI'm walking into a pot store,\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nand you're describing me walking into the dispensary.\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000\nYou're walking into a pot store.\n\n01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nThere's magazines.\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nYou gotta sign in.\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nSpencer, things have changed since I saw you last night.\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nYeah, man.\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nIt's these testicles.\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nPrescriptions, you know,\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nmaybe Dan doesn't want to talk to them about this,\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nbut you got a prescription.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nI have a giggling deficiency.\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nIs what it came down to.\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nDan recently got a prescription.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000\nI guess you don't want to... sorry.\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nOh, you mean my... yeah, no.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nI don't think I want to... yeah.\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nIt's perfectly legal.\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nYou recently diagnosed with ADD.\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nYou have ADD. We've known this.\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nWait, is that...\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nYou got diagnosed with ADD?\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nWas it you in a waiting room with, like, all eight-year-olds?\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000\nYes.\n\n01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nAnd you?\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nDid you, like, vision during a test,\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nor, like, how did they know?\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nIt took surprisingly little time to get diagnosed.\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nI feel like I had to answer three questions.\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nIs this about scoring Adderall? Is that the point?\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nWell, let's just say I went to Yelp's top psychiatrist\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nso that season six could get done.\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nIt was harder for me to get a pop license.\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nIt's news to your wife.\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nSo this is news.\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nIt's a medicine.\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nWait, you haven't shared this with your betrothed?\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nWas it beloved?\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000\nWe're a past it.\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nI'm a little ashamed of it and just wanted to take it.\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nYou mean... it's a medicine.\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nPeople do this all the time,\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nand it's signed off on by doctors everywhere\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nand politicians.\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nEveryone loves it.\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nIt's, you know, overdoses are one of the leading causes\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nof preventable death in America,\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000\nand everyone's just smiling about it.\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nI don't...\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000\nThere's nothing to be ashamed of except America.\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nIt is...\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nI think we have the title of our episode.\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nYeah, I went in and I...\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000\nYeah, I'm sorry, Dan.\n\n01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000\nI thought this is just, you know...\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nYeah.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000\nIt's...\n\n01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nCool, is Dan dating anyone, or is there...\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000\nWell, I mean, Dan.\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000\nHe's got a role for that, I think, you see.\n\n01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nYeah.\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000\nI was gonna tell you eventually.\n\n01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000\nI didn't think...\n\n01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nWhat do you mean, yeah, sarcastic?\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nNo, no, yeah.\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000\nNo, no, no, I feel weird.\n\n01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nNo, it's fine.\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nAre you upset that he's been, like, not sharing the...\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nMaybe that's part of it.\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000\nI'm not upset you're not sharing it.\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nIt seems like a secret the way it came out,\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nbut it's fine.\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nYou know, I also...\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000\nHere's some other things.\n\n01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nI've been getting a lot of CAT scans\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nabout the things wrong with my chest,\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nmy enlarged lymph nodes and my sarcoidosis.\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000\nYeah, and then you get a...\n\n01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000\nHe goes to the doctor.\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nI just want you to be safe.\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nI just want you to be safe.\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nI'm not sharing...\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nDan hasn't been sleeping a lot lately,\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nbecause he's working on community...\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000\nHe's filled with Adderall.\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nYou can't sleep on that, yeah?\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000\nWell, he has to stay up, because he's working late,\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nand I'm a little concerned about his health.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nHow much do you sleep a night, Dan?\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nThree.\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nHours?\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nOn a scale of one to ten, I don't know.\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000\nThree.\n\n01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nThree.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000\nThree.\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nThree balls.\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nI'm doing fine.\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nBy the way, I found out...\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000\nHe's fine.\n\n01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nWhat this isn't.\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nIt went away.\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000\nWhich guy?\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nYou're healed.\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nYou're cured.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nI can smell it.\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000\nI don't think so.\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nSo that, it turns out, is tracheal stenosis,\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nwhich I think is just a heartening of the cartilage\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nand the trachea.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nThere's enlarged lymph nodes in my trachea\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nthat I have to get biopsied,\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nbecause they have to rule out sarcoidosis,\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000\nwhich is only fatal five percent of the time.\n\n01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nAll right.\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nNow you're all caught up.\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nThey have to, like...\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nThey've got to put a thing down my throat\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nand grab some cells,\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nand then diagnose or not diagnose sarcoidosis.\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nIf they diagnose it,\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nthen it's a simple, like, it's 95 percent chance I'll live.\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nAccording to Dungeon Master terms.\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nLike, you roll two dice and then...\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nYeah, that's like five rolls.\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nSpencer, roll Danza.\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nI would have to get a critical hit by God to die.\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nNo, we're good.\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nWe're good.\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nWait.\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nMaybe.\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nGod autocrates.\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nGod will one-shot you.\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nHe autocrates.\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000\nThere's no...\n\n01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000\nYou don't have to wait for the 20 if you're God.\n\n01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nThey have to really...\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nGod doesn't play dice, man.\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000\nI have...\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nI have it in large lymph nodes,\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nwhich are battling something,\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000\nthat they have to find out what they're battling.\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000\nYou know what they say?\n\n01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nYou have a 5 percent chance of surviving.\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000\nOf dying, sorry.\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000\nBut also, in the meantime,\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nI did pop by a doctor who I did tell\n\n01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nI have trouble reading books.\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nYou do.\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000\nAnd...\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nI see him at work.\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000\nThat's just because you're late.\n\n01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nDid you go to the doctor with him?\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nWere you like his, like, hype man?\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nYes, he did.\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nYeah.\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000\nHe's my chauffeur.\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nI don't have a car.\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000\nAre you for a job?\n\n01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nI can't tell.\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000\nI'm for it.\n\n01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000\nI think that he needs it more than a lot of people I've seen\n\n01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000\nget at or all and give it to me before.\n\n01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000\nBut you're saying that people...\n\n01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nNot for Dan for my personal use in the past.\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000\nSorry.\n\n01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nI wasn't clear.\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nCan you just say that it causes death,\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nthat people are ODing on it?\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nAnd American shame?\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nPrescription drugs kill more people than any other drug.\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000\nAny illegal drug.\n\n01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nRight.\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000\nAll of it.\n\n01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nAnd it's everyone's fine with it.\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000\nEveryone's fine with people prescribing drugs all the time.\n\n01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000\nSo you're being sarcastic when you say it's good\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000\nthat he's doing this?\n\n01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000\nNo, I'm saying he needs it more than other people\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000\nthat are using it, you know, to kill themselves.\n\n01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nAnd he's using it responsibly.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nBecause he's making something while he's going.\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000\nNo, because a lot of people who have focus problems\n\n01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nand do work, you know, creative work, work that requires\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\na lot of hours who have serious ADD,\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\noftentimes take medicine to treat that ADD.\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000\nI don't...\n\n01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nWhy is this so controversial?\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000\nI don't get it.\n\n01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nOn what use, Spencer?\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000\nI understand.\n\n01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000\nYou're saying in this case these drugs are good.\n\n01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000\nOverall, pharmaceuticals.\n\n01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000\nBig, overprescribed problem in America.\n\n01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000\nYeah, and it's a problem that a lot of people\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000\nactually hurt themselves with,\n\n01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nwhereas Dan feels guilty about this responsible usage.\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nBecause I'm taking advantage of a drug dealing nation.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000\nBecause they actually need the drug.\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000\nWell, I agree with you.\n\n01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nBut everyone would agree that one hour a night\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nasleep, no hours, three hours sometimes,\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000\nis really unhealthy.\n\n01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nThat's not...\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000\nYeah, well, that's not...\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000\nThat is the case in, like, spurts,\n\n01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nwith or without Adderall.\n\n01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000\nThat's a fact.\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000\nLike, that just happens.\n\n01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000\nThat's workaholism.\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000\nThat's something that there is no drug for.\n\n01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000\nExcept therapy.\n\n01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000\nExcept money.\n\n01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000\nI mean, you know, I didn't want to...\n\n01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000\nI wanted to bring it up on my own time.\n\n01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nI was excited about it.\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nBecause also, I don't want to be like a...\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000\nI don't want to be like a whistleblower.\n\n01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000\nBecause it was kind of fascinating.\n\n01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000\nLike, I got a prescription for Adderall.\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nAnd it took about 20 minutes.\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nAnd I answered three questions.\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nAnd then the doctor said,\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nyou definitely have ADD.\n\n01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nWhich I don't think doctors are supposed to say\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000\nabout anything ever.\n\n01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nWait, what are the questions they ask you?\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000\nWhat's this like?\n\n01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nI'm genuinely curious.\n\n01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000\nI feel like I'm kind of like...\n\n01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000\nIf you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.\n\n01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000\nThey give you like a little cat laser\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000\nand you're like, we're out in the room.\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000\nAnd if you look at it once,\n\n01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000\nthen you get the prescription.\n\n01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nThey were questions that I answered honestly.\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000\nI don't think that they're the questions\n\n01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000\nyou need to triangulate ADD as a diagnosis.\n\n01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000\nI don't think, you know...\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nWhat do you think about Russell Brand?\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000\nWhat do you think about Lady Dunham?\n\n01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nOkay, good.\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000\nYeah, now here you go.\n\n01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000\nI described my situation and why I was there.\n\n01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nI said, honestly, I felt like honestly,\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000\npeople had given me Adderall in the past\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000\nand I had taken it and had a speedy effect\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nand kept me up.\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000\nAnd that recently,\n\n01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nit actually had more of a focusing effect.\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nI'm actually able to get work done\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000\ninstead of not wanting to get work done.\n\n01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nAnd then I'm actually also nicer to Aaron.\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000\nI find myself kind of like...\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nIf I take 10 milligrams,\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000\nI will actually kind of...\n\n01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nI'm a little more respectful to her.\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nWhich I'm embarrassed about it\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nbecause it's a pharmaceutical.\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nI'm genuinely embarrassed about it.\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nPeople take drugs and it helps them.\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000\nI honestly don't think it's anything to do with drugs.\n\n01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000\nI don't think that this guy is qualified to say...\n\n01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000\nNo, but you are.\n\n01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000\nThat's not your responsibility.\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000\nIt seems like you've used this drug before\n\n01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nand it helped you in a good effect.\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000\nPeople are depressed and they take drugs\n\n01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nand then it makes them better.\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000\nI don't think there's anything wrong with that.\n\n01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000\nIt's over-prescribed but in a lot of cases.\n\n01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000\nI don't want to think that my personality is based on...\n\n01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nBut it's not.\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nI don't like that idea.\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000\nIt's not like these drugs you're taking are changing your personality.\n\n01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000\nIs it better than that dirty street\n\n01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000\nAdderall you were getting but until now?\n\n01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000\nIt's all the same.\n\n01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nI mean, I do.\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000\nIt's just making your brain better at being yourself.\n\n01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000\nThere's better be a fucking good season of Community Man.\n\n01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000\nIt's gonna be great.\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000\nIt fucking hurts.\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nIt's like scraping metal against concrete.\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000\nBut Aaron said that I...\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000\nI guess I always say that?\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000\nYes.\n\n01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nI feel really bummed about that one time you texted me.\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000\nI was really, really upset about that.\n\n01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000\nWait.\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nWhen you texted me...\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000\nI don't know if we should talk about that.\n\n01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nWait, what did I...\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nYou texted me about Community.\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000\nWhat did I say?\n\n01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nWhat did I say?\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nWell, I don't know for...\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nJust say it.\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nYou were like,\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nI'm gonna come and do something about that.\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000\nOh.\n\n01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nAnd then I couldn't do it.\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nAnd I was really bummed out that I couldn't do it.\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nSecond choice.\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000\nYou texted me after Kumail.\n\n01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000\nWait, is he gonna be on Community?\n\n01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nNo.\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000\nThat's the other Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:47.000\nMy rule with him is that you have to land one bit from the audience.\n\n01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nThat's why he keeps trying.\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000\nSmash this grasshopper from my hands.\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000\nIf you can hook one ring around the pole.\n\n01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nYeah, a bunch of monkeys just wrote a Shakespeare play before you landed the line.\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nI am zero for 116.\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000\n117.\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nI actually got through that.\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000\nYou know what bums me out is that we got...\n\n01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nI'm back.\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000\nWe got the whole fucking cast here.\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nAnd we're over time.\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000\nWe can't play D&D now.\n\n01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nI know.\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000\nWe started so late, though, technically.\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nWell, I mean, even starting that late, we're still pretty much.\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nNo, yeah.\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nWhy don't we just...\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nNo, that's dumb.\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000\nI was gonna say, why don't we just explain to Jeff what happened?\n\n01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nFill me in what I've missed and we'll be ready to go for next time.\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nI would like to hear.\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000\nI also haven't been around.\n\n01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000\nI have a pitch.\n\n01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nYes.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.000\nI want to use my power to make the audience applaud at something so that Spencer is compelled to it.\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:56.000\nI think what would be amazing is if Spencer did whatever he wanted to do tonight, but\n\n01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000\nthen the next time we see him in the new year, he has learned and is ready to start a Shadowrun\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000\ncampaign.\n\n01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nWhat is that?\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000\nYou see, it didn't pull.\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nOkay.\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nYou're hearing mostly Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nIt's a cyberpunk thing from the 80s.\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nIs that what...\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nHey, it was from the 80s, but now it's from the 40s.\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nIt's like a William Gibson...\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nIt's like a Genesis game.\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000\nIt's like Blade Runner.\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nYeah.\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nYeah, but there's elves and dwarves and shit, too.\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000\nIt's set in a world where magic has returned to an apocalyptically technotopic world.\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nIt was called the NGE.\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000\nThere was an acronym for it.\n\n01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nIt was like the big awakening.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000\nIt's a role-playing game like D&D.\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000\nYeah.\n\n01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nIt's like D&D, but with guns and lasers and racism.\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000\nWell, I guess it's like...\n\n01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000\nIt's like D&D.\n\n01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nSold.\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000\nAll the...\n\n01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000\nDo you have that as a stat?\n\n01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000\nRacism 15 or like...\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000\nYou got to roll for your racism.\n\n01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nAh, fuck, I'm a big...\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000\nI'm plus 15 versus Asians.\n\n01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000\nOh, yeah, I guess different races.\n\n01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nYou're more powerful.\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000\nDoes that mean...\n\n01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nLike, what are you trying to pull off when you need a higher racism?\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000\nDo you need to say something...\n\n01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nRacist country or something?\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000\nMaybe they would give you more gold or...\n\n01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:23.000\nYou make Thanksgiving more uncomfortable for other people.\n\n01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000\nAll right.\n\n01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000\nIt's a great game.\n\n01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000\nI'm still learning how to play, so it'll be embarrassing for me.\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000\nDid Shadowrun start as that video game?\n\n01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nI only know it from the video game.\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000\nNo.\n\n01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nIt was around paper first.\n\n01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000\nIt was around in like early 80s, and it was like...\n\n01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000\nThey were like, cool things like comlink cell phones and like...\n\n01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000\nYou know, pocket computer cell phones again.\n\n01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000\nSmall flashlights.\n\n01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000\nIs there always a fake internet?\n\n01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nSmall flashlights.\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000\nThat was a huge component of Shadowrun.\n\n01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000\nYes.\n\n01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000\nHealthy generators, cell phones.\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nCat picture storage.\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000\nYeah.\n\n01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nYeah.\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000\nLena Dunham buggers.\n\n01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000\nBuggers?\n\n01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000\nIt's a bok trotter, I think.\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000\nI'm sure she's feeling very bugged right now.\n\n01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000\nSpencer, do you want music where you recap for me what happened to catch me up to date?\n\n01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000\nMe?\n\n01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000\nNo.\n\n01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000\nI don't know what happened.\n\n01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000\nWhat's the last thing you remember?\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000\nOh, God.\n\n01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nI...\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nNothing.\n\n01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000\nOkay.\n\n01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000\nWell, that's probably saved.\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nI mean, shoot.\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nI mean, at some point, we were in a toilet.\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000\nI know that.\n\n01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nIt's been a long time.\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000\nThere was a bucket.\n\n01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000\nWe were going back and forth in a bucket.\n\n01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000\nWe were doing portal jumping through a bucket.\n\n01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nThat was when I was around.\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nBill Mardigans and there was that.\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nYou went to Stony...\n\n01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000\nWhat was the book?\n\n01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000\nRose Book.\n\n01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000\nRose Book.\n\n01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000\nYou went to Rose Book.\n\n01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nRight.\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000\nBecause there was intrigue happening in Rose Book with Father Tinder.\n\n01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000\nHe turned out to be a kind of unsavory sort of figure and you were snooping around in his juice.\n\n01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nAll right.\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nWe were snooping?\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000\nYou were, yeah.\n\n01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nSomeone attacked him and killed him.\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.500\nIt turned out it was him.\n\n01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.000\nIt was just a big trick to lure you guys out.\n\n01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.000\nHe turned into a crazy demon and then he got smote by the party and then the police came up and they didn't buy.\n\n01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nThey weren't, like, happy about the fact that you guys had killed their mayor.\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:24.000\nAnd so you guys booked it from the police and then you guys didn't know what to do for, like, a long time.\n\n01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:32.000\nAnd you went and talked to a lady named, I think, Charles, who was bathing in the swamp and bothered her a while.\n\n01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:38.000\nAnd then you left and then you ran into a fire elemental and Quark raped the fire elemental.\n\n01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000\nThat doesn't sound like Quark.\n\n01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000\nBut the thing is, fire elementals are made out of fire.\n\n01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nSo Quark's dick melted off.\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000\nAnd...\n\n01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000\nHe had it coming.\n\n01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000\nHe really did.\n\n01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000\nYou live fast, die young man.\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nOut your dick off in a fire demon.\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nIf you cast down the heat.\n\n01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000\nKeep your dick out of the fire elemental.\n\n01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000\nThen it turned out there was a secret magical shard of power.\n\n01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000\nIt was like a Plot McGuffin and it was back in town.\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nAnd it turned out that the Frost Giant, he stole it and Admiral Darkstar went after that guy, the Frost Giant.\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nAnd so you guys were like, let's go over there.\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000\nAnd you were like, I don't know where to go.\n\n01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000\nSo you met up with a little boy named Lil Baskins.\n\n01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:35.000\nAnd he turned out to be, you know, not just a little boy, but like a little boy ghost.\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000\nBut despite being a ghost, he was a pretty cool guy.\n\n01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000\nSo he took you guys through the ghost way.\n\n01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:48.000\nAnd then you came out in a forest and ran into some gnolls who were trying to come up with an ambush.\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000\nBut they were too slow.\n\n01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nAnd so they were going to fight.\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000\nIt seemed like they were going to fight.\n\n01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000\nAnd then it turns out that they just wanted that blood book that Sharpie had.\n\n01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000\nAnd they offered to buy it.\n\n01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000\nAnd then Sharpie acquiesced.\n\n01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000\nAnd then he just sold the book.\n\n01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000\nPeople say, Pot is bad for your memory.\n\n01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000\nAnd you're disproving that.\n\n01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nYeah, I disprove all stereotypes about things I'm into.\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000\nIt's nice.\n\n01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:22.000\nIt says the bearded role player in the Super Adventure Brothers shirt.\n\n01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000\nThat's Harmontown. Thanks for coming, everybody.\n\n01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000\nThank you very much.\n\n01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000\nHave a happy holiday.\n\n01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000\nWe'll see you in the new year.\n\n01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000\nCamille, John Roy, Erin McGathy, Harmon.\n\n01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000\nHarmon McGathey.\n\n01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000\nSeek Donnelly.\n\n01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000\nScoota.\n\n01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000\nThank you for coming up.\n\n01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:48.000\nAnd as always, Adam Goldberg, the eternal, the perennial Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000\nDan Harmon, everybody.\n\n01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000\nThank you very much. Good night.\n\n01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000\nSpencer.\n\n01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:22.000\nSpencer, of course.\n","cpu_time":["0.001s"],"str_size":[171692]}
