00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
Music

00:11.200 --> 00:15.000
Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.500
Music

00:22.500 --> 00:26.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.wn.

00:26.000 --> 00:38.000
Music

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I think we can owe that warmness to our warm-up guy.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Was that Kevin? Did Kevin come out?

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
It feels like a real TV show. I thought there was someone juggling out there.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Is there an actual proper TV warm-up guy?

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Kevin Day, for those of you who are probably on the Reddit, maybe know that Kevin Day has arrived along with our ambition to...

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
This is all a hobby, all this shit. I'm just a rich, fat asshole that's just like...

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm not trying to accomplish anything other than just seeing what the hell we can accomplish,

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
but Kevin Day is like the Alfred to my Batman, the microchip to my Punisher.

01:12.000 --> 01:23.000
I love that he came out and did warm-up. It's a really triumphant Asperger's story.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm starting to think he might not have Asperger's.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
There are so many cameras. I want cameras on how many cameras we have.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
We have these racks of cameras, like velcroed to pillars and things here in this pretty unfilmable site.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
There's Chris back there, who's a genius, who's like, here's my goal.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I haven't really been on the record about this. What are you doing, Dan Harmon?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
What are you doing? Is the podcast going to change you doing anything? No.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
If all you do is listen to the podcast and when you cut your character on the way to work, you're doing fine.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
You can always do that. Who cares? Who gives a shit?

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
It costs me nothing to do to talk and it costs you nothing to listen.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
Your camera's license is showing on camera right now.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
We're filming your personal details right now.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
See, that's Kevin. He's a hacker. He thinks like that.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
He's Alfred. He's like, Mr. Wayne, you should know that Deadshot has the ability to holographically simulate your next move.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Why would you be thinking about that? Because if Kevin were working for the dark side, we'd all be dead.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
I was just told tonight's the last show where I get to use music of my choosing.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
We have to go to non-licensed music from now on.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
That is one thing that I will admit is...

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, show is over, everybody.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
I think that is the one thing. That is a price we will pay.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Can we just do it until someone tells us to stop?

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Remember, there was a show on Channel 101 called House of Cosby's where I did a voice-on.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Justin O'Reilly made it. And then we got a call from Cosby's people.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
I was like, stop doing that. But we got five or six House of Cosby's out before that happened.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And then we just stopped doing House of Cosby's.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Stop doing that.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm busy with the women and the drugs.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Come to my cabin to discuss creative endeavors.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay. Well, whatever. Hey, let's not...

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
It's not too soon for that shit.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Some things, it's supposed to be too soon.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Sorry.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
So anyways, I didn't really get a ratchet. What you're watching is, I don't know, I'm like the Howard Hughes of Narcissism.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Howard Hughes was the Howard Hughes of Narcissism.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm just seeing what we can do. I guarantee you one thing, you'll never...

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Anything that you haven't, that you've never paid for it, you're never going to start paying for it.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm not going to suddenly tell you that cost a quarter. I don't think.

04:06.000 --> 04:16.000
What I am going to do experimentally, because my fantasy as a Minecraft player is about autonomy, efficiency.

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
I want to create a solar-powered, like, biodome of a video podcast where all these guys, like Chris back there,

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
Dustin, our producer, Kevin, and people who help us, if they could draw salaries off of all of the energy that they put into the show,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
if people were on a subscription basis, which seems to be the model that kind of works,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
if people are willing to pay for things that they want, if they want to go the extra mile,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
they're making a donation at the same time as they're buying the product, they're subscribing to it.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm going with the porn model, because the truth is...

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
What's her name?

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
For 20 years, you know, rich white men have been trying to figure out how to monetize the internet,

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
but almost as soon as it started, a class of very independently-minded, like, poor women immediately figured out.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
You'd think that they were being exploited every time you see, like, that there's a lot of exploitation of pornography,

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
and I'm sure there is, but there's also a lot of very impressive, like, there's a lot of entrepreneurship

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
and, like, independent, like, people that know how to sell themselves can do so very well on the internet, and that's what you can do.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
I was thinking, let's take a page from their playbook, like, if you love me so much that you can't get enough,

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
if you want my dirty panties, like, that's what you got to pay for.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
If you want to just see something, you can probably get it illegally.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Give me a, for instance, there, like, what do you mean?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
There's no, for instance.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
What's your dirty panties version of the other?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
No, the dirty panties is the video feeds.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah, that's the dirty panties.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
It's what you can see.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah. All right.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
It's bad to start a show talking about the show.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
It's like trying to fuel a lawnmower on lawnmower.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Liquid.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Instead of gasoline.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It shouldn't do that.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
The lawnmower won't start.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
We should have started with my new segment,

06:15.000 --> 06:26.000
Questions About Grocery Stores.

06:26.000 --> 06:38.000
Uh, how much, how much do you, it's starting off great.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I love this segment.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I really love this segment.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Cyberbullied.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Don't abuse this camera with camera tapes.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
Now they can see that I'm a human being.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm a victim.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Also, we know your driver's license info.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, and that was going to happen no matter, yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That's a good point, I guess.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
But I'm, is that on the outside of your phone?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
What's happening there?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, it's, yeah, it's, I bend it over backwards.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
All right.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Okay.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I'll tell you one thing.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
As a Sony employee, this is the least of my fucking worries.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Considering the news considers it juicy that Joel McHale got a discount on a TV.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
You don't know what I'm talking about.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
But I'm telling you like sooner or later, like, boy, oh boy, I'm good at emails.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And I've been working for Sony for six years.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
And the shit you know is juicy.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
I am good at emails.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Read a couple for us.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Get fired again, man.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Remember how exciting it was when you got fired last time?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
We went on a tour and made a movie.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
It was great.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
So anyways, what was the segment?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Grocery store questions.

07:58.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
All that music goes away.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
It's next fucking time.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm going to do as many musical things in the show as I possibly can.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Until Bill Cosby himself calls me up and says, don't do it.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It felt like Big Red was back.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Oh, I miss Big Red.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Where did he go?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
He died in a shone.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
He's exploded.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Is that right?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Oh, sorry.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
It's always too soon for Adam Goldberg.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
Adam Goldberg is so jealous of the most loved person to ever come up on stage.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
It's like, I guess the Hamburglar probably hates grimace.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
It goes home at night, just stabs his grimace eyes.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
No, not Christmas questions.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
That's our next segment.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Grocery store questions.

09:02.000 --> 09:11.000
How much do you think one costs?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
A grocery store?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
If you wanted to buy a grocery store, filled with stuff.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Filled with stuff?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Employees?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
The whole truck?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Delivery?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Employees, I don't know.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
You're saying if you want to buy one, outright.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
I guess let's keep the fact that it's like a business.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Let's just go with all of the things in a grocery store minus the things in back.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I think you'd get one for $350,000.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I think that takes it away.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
That seems very conservative to me.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
$50,000 and $1.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Adam, shut the fuck up.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
And obviously, you're saying that all of the Skittles, all of the marshmallows, all the

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
frying pans, all the pantyhose, they all add up to $350,000.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You're just saying all the stuff out of the shelves.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
The furniture too, like the cash registers and all the apparatus, or just the items that

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
you could buy in there.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm just saying all the shit on the shelves in the public area.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Let's start the bidding.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
What do you guys think?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
$125,000.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
$125,000.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
$2,000,000.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
$2,000,000.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
No, that's too much.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
You think all the food in a supermarket costs $2,000,000?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I haven't even actually thought of my own guess, but I guess $2,000,000.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
It does sound high, but I actually, I was like, now we're talking.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay, let's high-ball it at $2,000,000.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Let's say that's the number.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Let's call it $2,000,000.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
What do you mean?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Let's say that's the number.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
This is part of your premise as to how much does it cost.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Oh, no, no, no.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, okay.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Well...

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm sorry.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
What was the name of this segment again?

10:38.000 --> 10:56.000
It's grocery store questions.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Our show is eating itself.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I was wondering, I was in a grocery store recently, which is a rarity for me since I was 35,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
and I found out that you can escape that life.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
By having an assistant or what?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, a girlfriend or...

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Okay.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Combinations thereof.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Okay.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Different services, websites, whatever I can do to stay out of the place.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
So you rarely walk physically into a supermarket?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I try not to.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Bad place for bad people.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
But before that, before 35, I spent a lot of time in them.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
It's a common location.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
I always, I find myself wondering, for instance, like what would happen if centipedes attacked

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
like giant centipedes?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Like centipedes the size of Dobermans.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Attacked a grocery store.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Like where would you hide, like I think about that stuff.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I would write a script about that.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I would set it in a grocery store and I would feel comfortable doing that because I've spent

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
a lot of time.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I've logged in my grocery store hours.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Where would you hide from Doberman-sized centipedes inside a Trader Joe's?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I would...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, I would...

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I'm assuming that they're coming in like the front door.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Okay.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
So first there would be this like period of like, Jesus Christ, what's happening?

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Someone's screaming and everyone flocks to the screaming.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And then you see that there's like a CG monster.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Are these Doberman-sized centipedes out to kill people?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yes.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Okay, they're after people.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Yeah, they're monsters.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
This is a movie.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
And so there's like a CG centipede like killing, I don't know, Susan Sarandon or whatever.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
It's like a cameo who's like the first to die.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
You got her so you could get funding.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
And so she's getting eaten and then there's going to be a guy who's like the most heroic

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
but the second to die because he grabs like a egg beater and goes like, what the fuck?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
What the fuck?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And then he's like a really...

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Who do you cast?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Who's your guy for this?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That's Chris Pratt for sure.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
Because again, he's a cameo and he's like, listen, we'll drag your body out and set it

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
on fire in the first act and just come by for a day of shooting.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I'd really appreciate it.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
But like somebody like charges the thing with an egg beater and it's like the big beefy

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
guy that you thought was the hero because of course this is an ironic age and you have

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
to remove that guy.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
It's like the post-survivor world of it's not the alpha male you were counting on.

13:14.000 --> 13:23.000
It's the, you know, it's the whoever the new, who's that IBM PC kid, John Long, Long,

13:23.000 --> 13:33.000
John, Justin Long, I'm sure he's 53 now but whoever the new him is, assuming someone from

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Yo Gabba Gabba, I don't know, what do you, what do you people watch?

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
Some Pokemon with like, he's like, I'm only at the grocery store because I have asthma.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh, I have to fight the centipedes?

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I know all about them.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Who the hell invited this goddamn centipede expert?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
To our grocery store.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
Also, who keeps inviting people to our grocery store?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Also, what's my statement?

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I've been a meat salesman for 35 goddamn years.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
This is my Keith David impression.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
This is a good cast so far.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
He works at, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the pivot.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
He's the, he's the black guy in the monster movie.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
What am I, why am I, why am I mincing words?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
He's Keith David and he works the butcher section and he's like, God damn it.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
What are these goddamn centipedes going on?

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
And then, and then when the kid, the kid starts going like, he's like, actually that species wouldn't

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
technically be called a centipede if they're, they can see heat but not color or something.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
And then Keith David's the one that goes like, God damn it, am I taking orders from my boss

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
or this goddamn nerd over here?

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
But then he like, he's the guy that, all I know is that this kid said three things

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
and they all turned out to be right.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
And everything you're saying, and then every time the kid said something like, a centipede's

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
follow, there's a thermographic entity.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Wait a minute, are you telling me these goddamn things can see heat?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
And that's his job.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Translate for the streets.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
All right, where was that?

15:11.000 --> 15:22.000
My question about grocery stores is, we're moving way too slow.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
I got a list of shit.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
My question about grocery stores is how, the reason I want to know how much they cost

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
is because I want to buy one because I want to know how easy is it to push over the shelves.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
The whole thing?

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah, because you always think of it when you walk in, like you think that you're in a room

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
and that like part of the room is that there's these aisles, but those are just things they put up.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
The reality of a grocery store is it's a big empty warehouse and they just put up these like shitty,

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
I just wonder like if you, I want to like run up and like, I want to push.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
Like how hard would you have to push to knock over a whole grocery store?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
A grocery store.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It's 150 pounds.

16:12.000 --> 16:21.000
I feel like I understand a library, like I feel like I know when I look at a library shelf

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
like what I would have to push to make it happen.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
And I don't even, but I don't even, but also it's like, let's see if that feels profane, lady.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
I think if you went at the bread aisle, that would be the lightest one because bread is like very airy.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
You kind of take on the frozen foods.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I don't think it has a lot to do with the content.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
I don't know if those things are anchored to the ground or if they just like, yeah, did anyone work in a grocery store here?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Did you work in a grocery store?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
You worked at a super target?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
What's a super target?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
In the Midwest, there are a few.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Please welcome our first guest, Super Target, when playing.

16:59.000 --> 17:08.000
What's your name?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
It's Scoota.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Scoota?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Yeah.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Okay.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Someone said fake.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Is it an acronym?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Self-contained underwater.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
My last name.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Target employee.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, so it's my last name.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
My first name's Matt, but I'm from a place that had like too many mats.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
So it's easier to go by my last name.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Was it Scoota, like you have an accent when you say Scooter?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It's S-K-U-T-A.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
S-K-U-T-A.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Scoota.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Scoota.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
And then the T is usually pronounced with a B for some reason.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Scoota.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Alright.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Scoota.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Scoota.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Super Target.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Talk.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Tell us about it.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
So they're not out here for some reason, but there's several different types of targets.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
There is the normal target.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
This is a, if Liam Neeson did this speech, it would be terrifying.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
There's something called a P-Fresh target, and those are the ones that are out here mostly.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
P-Fresh?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Is that like some horrible cynical attempt with the urban demographic?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I think, I think, I think.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
No, the P stands for produce.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
So it's like, it's a slightly bigger target that has a produce section.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
A relatively big grocery section, and then a super target has a full grocery section,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
including like a butcher, a deli.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
A candlestick maker.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
So they're just bigger.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Wow.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Super target.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Alright, so you worked on a super target.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
You've worked around these shelving units that grocery stores and things have.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
So you've, are they fixed to the floor?

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
The only ones that are kind of fixed to the floor is like the frozen sections, like you

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
know, they do have a lot of like electrical stuff that they are nailed down.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
All the other shelves are just really bottom heavy, because we do like a seasonal time.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
We're getting real information about something.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
So it's called life hacking.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
I love our, we would be the best trivia team if we all went to a bar and played bar.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
See, they put heavy shit on the bottom.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
It's not just that.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
An empty shelf is incredibly bottom heavy.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh, okay.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah, when they do like, they do like the called planograms, that's the way that you

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
get a sheet.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Planograms.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And that is how you're supposed to set up the shelf.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Like what goes on the bottom, what goes in the middle, what goes on the top.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Who decides that?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
There are people who, that is their job.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
At Target?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Or how much does Big Snicker?

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
So Big Snicker has like a lot of say in it.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
Like there are like certain parts of the store where it's like, we really want it this way.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
And then there are certain things we're like, well, you know, flexibility here.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
And then as things like sell out, like in the store, we can't have empty shelves.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
So people have to go around and then decide how we're going to flex out the shelves.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Is that what they call it?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah, sort of flexing.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Trying to make you feel like you're working for Patrick Swayze.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah, no.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Okay, no.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Sorry, I won't say this one again.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
You know we're going to super target.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
This is a fucking bank heist.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Let's flex out.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
No, okay.

20:05.000 --> 20:12.000
And an insane thing about Target is like the, I think like the slogan is like, expect more pay less.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
But the corporate slogan is the greatest company ever.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
So, like, so not, no, no, we agree.

20:22.000 --> 20:34.000
You'd see, but if you go like in the back room or if you go like in the break room, there are these posters on the wall, like, like 1984, where it's Target's headquarters in like Minnesota, Milwaukee, somewhere, somewhere up north.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
And it just has like a giant animated Target logo and then in big bold letters.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Or I think it might be the best company ever.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
So the best company ever.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
And it's okay.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
I've got himself couldn't destroy Target.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I defy you, Lord.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
I've never been blown away by it, but I guess, I guess it's the best company ever.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
All I know about Target is once in a while, for some sad reason, you have to go to Target.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
You have to go get a thing.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
God damn it, I need a trash can for my kitchen.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
I got to go to fucking Target.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
And then it's the most depressing afternoon of your life.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
It's the worst.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
It's not super.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
I want to say about Target, though, when I was, how old are you, Scoota?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
You look like you can ask.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
23.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I was going to say 23.

21:18.000 --> 21:29.000
Like around that age, when I was getting my first steps into like, oh, I have an apartment or whatever, like I have a property.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I need a plunger.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I need a dish rack.

21:33.000 --> 21:41.000
And it's Target, at least in Wisconsin, it was like, that is the synagogue you go to, you know, achieve manhood.

21:41.000 --> 21:53.000
A very late manhood in an infantilized empire where you're like picking your dish rack and you're like, oh, there's eight kinds of brush that I thought just grew out of my mom.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
And then I now realize I need, because I was like, there's shit everywhere.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Oh, mom, used a brush.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
There's a brush I let Target.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
It's kind of fun.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
Like Target is sort of a religious, it's like a little cove in the woods.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
For me, I'm sure there's other stories that accomplish that fact.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
How long did you work at Target, Scoota?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
So I worked there from like 2008 to 2012.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And did you climb the ranks?

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm hoping there's names for your job description that are very hilarious.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Kind of, yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So I started as a cashier.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Right.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And then that is genuinely the worst job ever.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Really?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
So at least I thought it was.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
You have to deal, so you're kind of dealing with people kind of constantly.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And there are main, you know, people like to make the jokes.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And those get annoying very quickly.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
Like if you're just a little bit too slow scanning something, the person will go, oh, I guess it's free.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
And you just want, yeah, you really wanted to just kind of throw it in the bag.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yep, it is.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Now you're just dealing with it.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
Do you like it's all free and you're going to do it?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, so I was having like, so I was kind of dealing with kind of those same jokes over and over again.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
It became incredibly frustrating.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
So anything ever needed to be done in the store, like we need someone to take out the trash.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I was like, I will do it.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So they're like, oh, this guy really, he's really trying to work hard.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
So not just not talking to people.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Just to get away from people.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Just to get away from the check lanes.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I didn't like that kind of the repetition there.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
And so I ended up, I did, I volunteered to be trained on the cart pusher in the parking lot.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
So I pushed, so then I went and did that and then I did a guest service.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
She's like Charlie Sheen in platoon.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Like you were a cashier and then you're like, can I go and, can I go push carts?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
So another really bizarre thing.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Was Keith David out there?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Keith David.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Why are you pushing carts?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Sniffing that cross, man.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I'll push you down by the river.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
We got ourselves a goddamn hero.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
We got here as a crusader.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Oh yeah.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Okay.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
Like another thing we think the new speak though is like, you can't, if you're heard by one

23:51.000 --> 23:57.000
of your higher ups, your team leads, calling a customer, or sorry, a guest, a customer

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
you'll get a talking to.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
A guest.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
It's like, they're guests.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
You have to call them guests.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
And when is carousel?

24:03.000 --> 24:11.000
17%, 17% as we all slowly die.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
The irony is it's a Logan's run joke about how when you're so old, you have to die.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
All right.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Well, Scoota, I got a full plate tonight.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
You're lovely.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I think we could have done a two hour target show.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
You're charismatic.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
You're full of energy.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
You make everyone pumped with target steam.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Let's have a hand for Scoota.

24:32.000 --> 24:46.000
They're a very fresh faced, like a Boy Scout energy.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I liked Scoota.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And Target didn't crush his soul.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
It seems like that's it.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
That's either nice or it's either uplifting or horrible.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
I worked at a trader, Joe's briefly, when I was 17 and it was the worst.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
All right.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm going to go down to the checklist and we're going to start triaging because there's

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
things that will just...

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Did we answer your question about knocking things over in the supermarket?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
No.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Well, yeah, they're bottom heavy.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
It kind of makes more sense.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Scoota, if you, me, and Dan ran with all of our might towards, let's call it the bread

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
aisle.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
If we went right at the center of it, at the highest center of gravity and we just tried

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
to knock it over, could three people knock it over?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
I don't think so.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I think you could dent one of the shelves and the shelves are also renewable.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
So I think those would take the project.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Right.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm going to take the knock over a full thing and start a domino effect down the thing.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Right.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I think it would be hard to do it because, like I said, it's bottom heavy, but the bottom

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
shelf is like, you know, it's like six feet.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
So you can't, your arms aren't long enough to do it.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I think they thought about this.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Did you hear that?

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Did you hear that, America?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
The ownership class has thought about it.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Have you?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Your move.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
But don't name me and the, I don't get to, okay.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
All right.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Here's it.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Here's it.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
All right.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I was really compelled to talk about Lena Dunham tonight.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
I can sum it up.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Just leave her alone.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Fuck you if you're like trying to burn her at the stake.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Okay.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Moving on.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
You can Google that.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
Our friend, Linahan was here last week and I noticed him tweeting about something about

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Ms. Dunham and then I went down a rabbit hole Googling.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
What's he talking about?

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
She's undergoing what I would describe as a Salem level of like witch hunt.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
And I guess that's a hot topic, but, and I don't imagine we have a lot of people in

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
the audience going like, oh no, you don't have all the facts.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
I want to really be, I think it's more of a right wing, left wing thing, which I also

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
don't give a fuck about, but it's like, there are moments in this culture and our new

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
hashtaggy, the social justice like awareness of each other and everything's evolving.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
There are moments when there are things that you could do that are brave and there are

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
things that you can do that are, that are not brave and you don't always have to do

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
brave things, but I would urge people to knock over the bread.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
To run everything that you're about to do or say through a little one item checklist,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
which is, is this, do I risk anything by saying this or doing this?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Because if you don't, then it's not brave.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Are you making a gesture at me or are you rubbing your, okay.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm like, I'm like, I, I, it's like, no, no, wait.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
The new president just got elected.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
He's a misogynist.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
You've got to cut it, cut it, cut it.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Cut the segment, cut the segment.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
I mean, just, just, just Google it.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
I think it's a fact.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
I think what's happening to her is fascinating.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
She is a creative.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
She shares things.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
She expresses things.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
She explores things.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
There are people who don't like young women with power.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm not me.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm not trying to get a jump on a bandwagon of that.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
I think it's actually, there are times when it's actually difficult to be a feminist.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
There are times when it's difficult to be progressive when, and I think that she is

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
being ganged up on right now.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
It took me a very long time to get to the bottom of what was going on.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
There was a lot of shit on the surface that, that, that threatens to suffocate.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Like what is actually, what, what the deal is.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
I urge you to Google it and, and explore it because I think it's edifying.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I think it's very interesting.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
And I won't, I won't bother with any more time with that because there's probably a

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
million podcasts that talk about it and you can, you can do your own exploring.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
But I, I ultimately, it's like, what do we do?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I just, I just want to know what is it?

28:43.000 --> 28:49.000
I, I, I, I, why is it that when these things come up, why, what is it in us?

28:49.000 --> 28:56.000
What is it in our national psyche where we, when we hear about, for instance, the

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
topic of sexual assault or rape, that we, that we, we, that what, what muscle is it

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
in us that flexes where we have to figure out if it's right or wrong or

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
provable or all these things.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Like what are we doing?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It's a question that needs to be asked.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
It doesn't have to come down to some battlefield where you're for or against

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
anything.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
What, what is important as is, whether these, like, like all of these, you know,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
the last week when we talked, we were talking about police brutality and all

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
these things.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
The questions that we emerge with are the important things to ask.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
What is the role of police?

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
And I think, like, like, what is, what is the point when somebody talks about

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
sexual assault, talks about rape, whether they're joking about it, whether

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
they're exploring it in a memoir, whether they're, I don't know, there's probably

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
eight other ways you could, you could, you could dance around that, that hot fire.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
What, is there a responsibility?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Are we supposed to, are we policing it?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
And what is our, what is our role?

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Why is it that we respond in certain ways to certain people?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Just let's ask ourselves that.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
I, I, I spent the day going down a rabbit hole.

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
I, as, as our friend Graham said in his tweet, I think that if you can judge

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
people by who, who their enemies are, I think, you know, Lena Dunham is, well,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I can't remember how he put it.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
She's, she's, she's Christ.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
I don't know.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
That's not what he said.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
But she's, she's, she's, she's being ganged up on it.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
It's, it's pretty fucked up.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
All right.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Christmas questions.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
No, we can put that off till after New Year's.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Sniffers.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I don't like people who sniff things.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Okay.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Give, give me a, for instance, on that one.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
I just don't like sniffers.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Like, like, I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not, I'm not going to judge them.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
People walk into a shop and sniff something?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Or are they, are they, like, what do you mean?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
What, we better bring out, I guess.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Like, no, no, not until you've explained sniffers to me.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
There's people who sniff things.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
There's people, there are people in the audience.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I would love to talk to a sniffer.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I dated a sniffer once.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
I need to know what you're talking about, like on a day to day.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Sniff, they sniff things.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Even though they know they're going to smell bad.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Like, they sniff, they pick up a piece of shit off of them.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
They're like, ugh, ugh.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And it's like, what are you doing?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Don't, why are you, why did you do that?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Why did you sniff that?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It's like a thing you found in a mailbox.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm doing a camera take.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Ugh.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Let's bring out, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
We're not done with sniffers.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Why, who's sniffing what?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Why are people sniffing things?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Like, like.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
I don't know.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I tell you about someone that goes into a bakery and goes, this muffin.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
I want this muffin or that muffin.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Sniff a muffin.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Sniff it.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Your experience there is defined by margins.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
It's either going to be a bad smelling muffin.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Who is sniffing what wrong?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I don't understand that.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
There are people who obsessively sniff everything they're about to eat.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
They sniff, they sniff like shit that they find.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Like, they go like, what is this thing on the side of the napkin dispenser?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Like, it's like brown.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
I love it like, I was like, why are you sniffing it?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
What?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Who did this?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
There's got to be a sniffer in this audience.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Does anybody, does this resonate at all?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
There's a guy that's kind of like that.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm telling you, I think it's like some kind of tick.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
That you have to sniff things.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
You got to sniff it.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Even something that you know is going to smell like something bad probably.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
It's too time consuming.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
A guy that worked at Target.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
I'll fucking, I want to talk about sniffing for the rest of my life.

32:20.000 --> 32:26.000
Let's talk about sniffing with, my compulsion is to bring up both guests at once so that

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
we can.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Let's do it.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Let's get that guy out.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Kumail Nanjiani and John Roy.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
If you sit too close to me, then it means you're gay.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Oh, well fuck then.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
All right.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Let's do it.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I'm with you on sniffers.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Anti-sniffing.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
You've met sniffers, right?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Yeah.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
I don't know whether before or against his stance.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
I haven't fully explained what a sniffer.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
I don't even like when people are choosing muffins and then they sniff it.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Don't take some of that.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Where are their loose muffins?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Like Starbucks, they have them behind the counter.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
You can't just look at them and smell it.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
I've been there when they're like, can I see that muffin and people hand them the muffin

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
from behind the counter.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
They smell it and they're like, no, I want a different one.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
They'll hand it to you?

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah, they'll do anything.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
I don't like sniffers.

33:29.000 --> 33:35.000
I've known people that will take off their shoe and they'll look at the bottom of it

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
and there'll be some gum or something on it and they'll sniff it.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Yeah.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
That's the term, it's bug trawlers, not just sniffers, but people who smell something nasty

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
can feel GTRO, TTE.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
I kind of want to not talk at all for the rest of the show.

33:52.000 --> 33:59.000
Sit in silence for an hour and all go home.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
That would be an amazing thing to do for his birthday.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
You finally had the last word.

34:06.000 --> 34:13.000
Just wait, yeah, and give Adam the gift of showing him what would happen if everyone

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
just listened and it would be like time enough at last when the glasses break, you know?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, exactly.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
It's just like, oh, everyone, and then you slowly walk up and you'd be like, and another

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
thing about this, you were saying this other thing earlier and everyone would just keep

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
nodding and listening.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Blog trawlers?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Blog trawlers.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Blog trawlers.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
I always felt like, if you know how when you were at a party and a couple of people are

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
talking and then someone yells out something from across the room and it kind of kills

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
the conversation.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
That's not happening here.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
We do have a more open format here.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
And it's Adam Goldberg.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
That's his role.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah, I mean, that's his role.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
And our role is to be annoyed by it.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
John Roy, what do you think of Adam Goldberg?

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
I don't really know what the issues are.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I have a late comer to this.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't know anything about the man that didn't tell you the truth.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
All right, you guys want something to talk about?

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
Can I say something, one thing real quick about Target?

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
I was at, this was a Brooklyn Target and this to me encompasses Target and Brooklyn.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
Emily was walking around and she had a pen in her hand and this guy yelled at her.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
He was like, why you got a pen in your hand?

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
You're not at work.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
That's Target.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
That's Target.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Target.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Thank you.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
A pause break.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
One man applause break for Target.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
That's my audience.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
It's one person.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Was that you, Adam?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
God damn it.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm starting to see the issues I think now.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
I think I'm getting caught up to speed.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, buddy.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I'm with you on the Lena Dunham thing.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I don't ever talk about it more, but it really angers me.

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
I think she's so talented and so good and it is so gross.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
The methodology is the disgusting part.

36:22.000 --> 36:29.000
It's beyond whether or not, the attempt to make it an issue about whether something is or isn't or is right or is wrong.

36:29.000 --> 36:37.000
The methodology that people try to use when they attack people is very telling and it's very disgusting.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
It just grosses me out.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
It really sums it up to say, wow, you really, she's really an important person.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
She really fucking is forcing weird ooze to come out of the ground on all sides all around.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
Who had any idea that this was still needed to be resolved?

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
This idea that you can't as a, well, we're talking about it now.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
She's going to be making awesome stuff for the next 50 years.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
My parents love girls.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
They're always telling me to watch it.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Is it good?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Is it that I really like it?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Yes, it's good.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
She's a good writer.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
I would not want to get in a writing contest with her and she's 28.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And I'm a genius.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
And I'm old.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
I would say that about very few people.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
I was intimidating because she makes choices that would not be instinctive for me to make,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
which is what an important writer does.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
I feel that way about Woody Allen.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
I feel that way about the writers that I really respect.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I watch a Coen Brothers movie when I watch it.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
She's a good writer and that I would easily,

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
before I would even touch all of this ridiculousness and this political fucking socio-psychological bullshit,

37:47.000 --> 37:54.000
I will definitely easily in a court of law prove to you that she's a good writer or your money back.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
And that is why I guess the elitist side of me is a little invoked when people gang up on her,

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
particularly for things, because if you were a writer with a stutter,

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
if you were a writer with a limp,

38:10.000 --> 38:17.000
the things that made it harder for you to wake up in the morning,

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
even though it would fuel your work and make it important to other people,

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
it wouldn't also be the thing that people could throw at you.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
But for women writers in this modern world, it's like they're half the population

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
and it's not a disability to be a woman and yet it gets thrown at you.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
It's like you can make people angry, this is becoming very clear to me,

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
and three years ago I wouldn't be having this conversation,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I wouldn't be feeling the way that I feel about this,

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
but it's just like everything is coming to the surface.

38:50.000 --> 38:57.000
You can just make people angry just by being a woman, you really can, it's fucking true.

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
And you can especially do it by doing that plus doing something like writing a television show.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
I was reading this interview for the CEO of Yahoo, I forget her name,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I think it's Melissa Meir.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
And the interviewer described in great detail what she was wearing,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
like that would never happen to a dude.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
All that stuff really, it's so insidious and you don't even think of it,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
but every time there's an interview with a woman,

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
it's about what kind of shoes she was wearing before talking about how she thinks, you know.

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
I was on Fox News on one of these shows and the piggy host of the show

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
made this comment about one of the female Fox personalities

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
that she wasn't showing as much skin as she normally does.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Me and Andrew W.K. was the other guys, we looked at each other like Jesus.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I thought you were going to say Andrew Dice Clay.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
No, he is more appropriate for their network.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
So I looked at it and I go, that's fucking weird, right?

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I would a creepy joke, but it wasn't a joke.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
She came back later, changed with more cleavage showing

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
because it was a serious order that she was given by the host.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
That laugh was laughing at something other than her misfortune.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
That's amazing.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
All right, so done with that.

40:12.000 --> 40:18.000
Seriously, what I'm saying is Google the shit and spend 30 minutes

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
because it's kind of a study in history that's happening around you right now.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Because I honestly, as a 41-year-old person with my full faculties

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
and my ability to Google stuff, I went from hearing some shit

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
to figuring out what the truth was.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
It took me an inordinately long time.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
And the truth is like, I mean, we just,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
we'd have to do a whole podcast to talk about it,

40:41.000 --> 40:47.000
but the bottom line is that there's aggression toward people,

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
that people want, that needs to be addressed.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
It's not science, it's not argument, it's not debate.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
This isn't like an ancient Rome platform where it's like,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
well, is this logical or is it a thing?

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
It's not true. You hate. You don't like something.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
You're angry.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
And I think that I have felt that too.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And I think I can understand it,

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
but I think that it's like you have to look at moments of opportunity

41:18.000 --> 41:26.000
to reverse or at least let go of shit that is inexplicably driving you.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
Because before you know it, you're passionate about something

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
and it doesn't make any sense that you're passionate about it.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
You're yelling at somebody and you're using your full IQ

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
and all of your academic research to wave a book in your hand

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
and yell at somebody about logic and flawed argument and all this stuff,

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
but it doesn't matter anything you're saying.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
The whole reason why you went down that road with your book and with your IQ

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
has to do with some weird moment with your mom and your kitchen.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
It's just come down to that, which is kind of exhilarating.

41:59.000 --> 42:07.000
And the aplomb with which she handles this fucking like a 28-year-old.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
When I was 28, fuck, dude, I was like, why don't you like my band? Fuck you.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
I couldn't even imagine being responsible for any kind of responsible opinions.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Yeah, I would have fled.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
I leaked a Chevy Chase voicemail and some Fletch fans called me an asshole

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
and I almost killed myself.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
I definitely almost left the country.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.000
I was a 40-year-old white man that had never had any problems in his life.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Fletch is a pretty good movie.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
It's great, it's great, it's great.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
The underhills?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
It's great, but I didn't do anything in front of his wife and kids.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
His kids are 50.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
All right.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
There is children, Dan.

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
They were babies 49 years ago.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Sniffers, Gotham, I got sold on Gotham.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
We don't have to talk about that.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
That's like the nerd equivalent of Lena Dunham conversation.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Somebody sold me on Gotham.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Did you have a run-in with a sniffer recently that brings this up?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
I sniffed some milk coming out of the fridge and I thought,

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
isn't it a drag that we have to sniff milk?

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Because isn't sniffing a debasing, horrible experience where you're sniffing?

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
Yeah, but if you drink the shit milk, you want to have sniffing.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
That's what I'm saying.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I mean, fuck it, I gotta do this, I'm gonna do it.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
That made me think of people who choose, or maybe don't choose, maybe it's a compulsion.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
They live in a world of sniffing.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
They sniff shit, they don't have to sniff.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
That's what I thought of it.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Milk, you have to sniff.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
If you go down the road of having milk in your fridge too long, you gotta sniff the milk.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
You gotta sniff milk kids.

43:38.000 --> 43:45.000
But even if milk kids, Google Lena Dunham, learn about misogyny and start sniffing milk.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And stop sniffing everything else.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
Even if it's good, milk smells horrible.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
That's true.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
It's always organic, you always know it's from an animal.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
What other animal are there grown-ups still drinking milk?

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
Let alone another fucking species milk.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
None, it's just us.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
We modified a gene to still drink milk after infancy.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
We're crazy people.

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
Here's a continuation of my Unsung Heroes segment, which I started with Lena Dunham.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Unsung Heroes!

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
What was that?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Lena Dunham's pretty sung as a hero, she's fine.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
What song was that?

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
It's You Drive Me Eight by the Dickies.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Oh, right.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
What's your favorite song of theirs, John?

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
Oh, probably Sniffer.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
I think that's on their second EP.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Bog Stompers or whatever that word was.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Bog Trotter?

44:48.000 --> 44:55.000
I think Bog Trotter opened for Jethro Tull on the 72 Tour, I think.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Hey, you guys, what happened to Russell Brandt?

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
What happened to him, Dan?

44:59.000 --> 45:05.000
I retweeted a thing that he said about how when he was poor and he complained about the class system,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
people called him, what, I can't remember what he said.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
And then he had a quote that somebody tweeted to me,

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
because probably because it reminded them as a Harmontown fan of things that I kind of express,

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
because I'm a privileged, I've cheated the system, I live at the top.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
I'm one percenter, but I got a guy that mows my lawn.

45:28.000 --> 45:36.000
And so months back when I was ranting a lot about capitalism, remember that episode?

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
Sometimes the response is like, fuck you, why don't you give all your money away then?

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
And I was like, that's fucking horse shit.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
How's that a response to any system?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
If you didn't like communism when you were in the party,

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
give your power to some other dude, that's pretty convenient response to criticizing a system.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Why don't you go fuck off?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
How does that solve anything?

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
Somebody sent me a quote that he had somewhere that I immediately retweeted,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
because I was like, oh yeah, exactly.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And I can't remember it exactly.

46:09.000 --> 46:17.000
It was like, when I was poor and I talked about class, people called me a hater.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
Bitter, a hater.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
They told me it was taking too much hater aid.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
When I was poor and I talked about class, they called me a hater.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
When I was rich and I talked about class, they called me a hypocrite.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
A hypocrite, right?

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
And it's like, I'm getting the feeling nobody wants to talk about class.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
And I retweeted it, and you know, I have 250,000 followers.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
They're all pretty, what?

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Yeah, no, that's okay, thank you.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
So this isn't even a sample size from the ocean of humanity.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
This is a sample from my Twitter followers.

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
Overwhelmingly, just 10 or 20 people just kind of just responding back to go,

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
I think maybe it's possible they don't want to hear from fucking Russell Brand.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I get it.

47:06.000 --> 47:14.000
The weird thing is, I spent all of the time up until his disappearance from the earth,

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
which is what my question is about, going, why is he popular?

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
I like getting him to the Greek. I think it's a funny movie.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Is that even wrong? It's a good movie.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
It's got a really nice Hollywood mainstream structure.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
Where did he go? Is he now blacklisted?

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
He wrote a book.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
He had a few movies in a row that didn't do well here, and I think he went back.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
So it wasn't because he became...

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
It wasn't because he became...

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
That's what happened. That's what I'm terrified of.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
Just like, sorry, didn't work out.

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
I met him once. It was at a dinner with him, and he was incredibly charming.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
He was very smart and very funny and very nice.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
He's very eloquent.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
But also, his shirt had buttons on it, but he wasn't using any of them.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
It was completely unbuttoned.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Like a Robert Plant-ish sort of thing?

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
Yeah, but it was like, maybe the button that was so low, it was below his belt,

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
it didn't even need to be buttoned, because he was more or less shirtless the whole time.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
And when he talked to me and he talked to women, like he was just very...

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
He'd write a book and he'd say,

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
chest to chest, nipple to nipple with Russell Brandt.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
And he makes you feel very wanted.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I think for me, that's what's for sale.

48:32.000 --> 48:39.000
He kind of makes you feel like you're about to get maybe made out with by a next heroin user.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
It's very exciting.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
Our built-in spring-loaded mechanism by which anyone who lives a privileged lifestyle,

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
like an actor who happens to be a celebrity, who should be so thankful for the lifestyle

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
they've been granted by the government-slash-people-slash-people magazine-slash-government magazine,

48:56.000 --> 49:07.000
there are instincts to clamp down on their necks until they're dead the minute they talk about anything other than red carpets

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
and what they're wearing.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
You're supposed to have been bought off.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I thought we had to shut up.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
You're famous, all right? Why don't you shut the fuck up?

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, I get like, stick to your jokes so many times on Twitter.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
If I say anything that's like some sort of opinion of political or anything.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I think it's so many times.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
I think it's fine.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
If Bruce Willis got on Twitter and was like,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
hey, you know, six million, it's a pretty high number.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
You know, I think it's fine to say to him,

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
you're in fucking diehard, why are you a revisionist?

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
Oh, got it.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
That number has been 9-11, by the way, huh?

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Whenever you think of six million?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Yeah, you can't be like, yeah.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Certain numbers are ruined.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Thanks a lot.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Yeah, way to go, Germany.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
You ruin the number of six million for everybody.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
So if you were going to get paid six million, could you just pay me 5,990,000?

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
I just feel more comfortable, I think, with that number on the chat.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
It's like the 13th floor of a hotel.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Yeah, we just stop using it at all.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
Just eliminate it.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
It's fine.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
As a consumer, you have the right to say,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I enjoy Liam Neeson fighting wolves.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
I do not enjoy Liam Neeson's opinion about breast cancer.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
You have a right to buy anything you want.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
But you don't have a right to tell them to shut up.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Well, you do have a right to tell them to shut up.

50:29.000 --> 50:37.000
But what I am saying is, our instinct to do so collectively is,

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
I'm telling you, when you do that, whose side are you on?

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
You are on the side of all, I just keep saying,

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
when you tell someone to shut up,

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
when you tell someone that they should be less ambitious,

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
when you tell someone that they should be less ignorant.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
Ignorance, a hugely important thing in all life.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
It is the thing that happens before knowing things.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
It's different from intolerance.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
Ignorance, when you meet someone who just doesn't know something yet,

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
the way you're going to find out that they don't know it yet

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
is through their big fucking flappy mouth.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
When we discourage that, which is what kittens are doing

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
when they're attacking a paper ball on the floor,

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
you don't tell the kitten, that's not a dog, knock it off.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
You can't eat that. Get in your kitten hole.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
Be a more efficient kitten.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
We love experimentation and play.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
It is vital to us as a species.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
When we discourage it, can we not just realize

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
that when you're saying something to someone,

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
if it's not something that Snickers would disagree with?

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Big Snickers.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Big Snickers.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
You can still say it,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
because maybe Snickers isn't wrong about everything,

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
but are you a hero?

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
What do you think Liam Neeson's stance on breast cancer is, Dan?

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Controversially enough?

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
It doesn't matter.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
No, it does, Liam.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I know he has a horrible controversial PSA.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
It doesn't matter if you have breast cancer.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
It doesn't matter if it's the number one killer of women.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
Wolves matter.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
He's going somewhere as a conceit with that.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
He doesn't just stop there. It doesn't matter.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Cancerous breasts don't have cubs.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
They can't kill you with their teeth.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
Do you think that Liam Neeson was into wolves before that movie,

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
or the movie was made around him?

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
I think he called him.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I think he saw it was being made.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
I think it was starring Tom Green or something.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
It was going to go a whole different way with wacky wolves.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Judging from how that movie goes, I think it was a comedy.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
It was like Rob Schneider can't get a break.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
When Rob Schneider beats these four wolves,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
he's got a wolf.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I think the wolves probably talked in a lot of the seats.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
Like, hey, Rob, you know we're going to kill you in act two.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
No.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
And then it's like, I have Liam Neeson on line one.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
What?

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
I'm very passionate about the movie you're making.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
The wolf movie?

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
The Rob Schneider movie?

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
I spent time with my daughter at the Botanical Gardens.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Go on.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
How did wolves tie into the Botanical Gardens?

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
The Botanical Gardens are the one type of garden wolves shouldn't be in.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Exactly.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
And the last thing that would remind you of the snow.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
I also like that the people making the movie are calling it that wolves movie.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
So dismissive.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
And that they're ready to drop Schneider and the comedic tone in a fucking one phone call.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
They can't eat without plates.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Yeah.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
All right.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
So Rob Schneider and...

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Can Rob Schneider talk about his opinions?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Sure, everybody can.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Everybody can.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
And we do a podcast and all we do is mouth off about our stupid opinions about everything.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
So like, we can't really say anything.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
But I think it is really dumb to expect celebrities to have,

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
for their opinions, to wave anything at all.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
Once in a while there will be a celebrity who is thoughtful and intelligent

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and will say something that actually means something.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
But who gives a fuck what Kevin Bacon thinks?

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
That shouldn't matter on the face of, at face value.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
It's crazy.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
Yeah, Charles Barkley said something about how he was like,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
racial profiling isn't bad for cops.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
And it's like, who the fuck cares what Charles Barkley thinks about?

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
Well, also you can't be profiled if you're more famous than the type that you look.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Like, oh, it's Charles Barkley.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I know exactly who that is.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Yeah, he looks like Charles Barkley.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Yeah, he's like, I'm a black man and everyone's nice to me.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
The first thought is in black man.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
It's, oh, Charles Barkley, the famous NBA star.

54:54.000 --> 54:59.000
I've seen him more than I've seen any black man here on TV.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
I met Charles Barkley in Portland after doing a show on time.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
And we were all going to get the bar closed down.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
And he just started telling me stories about being best friends with Michael Jordan.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
And it was like the coolest night.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
He was just like, he's fucking hilarious.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
How did Jordan come off?

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Jordan comes off like a guy that, you know, like a nice guy gambling problem.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Yeah, okay.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And so it's just like, he's like Jeff.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
He's like Jeff.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
When you met Michael Jordan.

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
No, I met Charles Barkley who talked about being best friends with Michael Jordan.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Charles Barkley tells stories about being friends with Michael Jordan,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
which is the Michael Jordan stories.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
Everybody is, yeah, even his name dropped.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
And so that's, yeah, exactly.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
He could tell a story about just himself and it would be name dropped.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
But then no ring club drops the ring club.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
I mean, like that's the only long crowd buddy.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
They don't know about rings.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Oh, they don't.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Some basketball.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
These five blonde women came in the bar and they were all local news anchors.

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
Like they're all the women that worked in the local news channel in Portland, apparently.

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
And he's like, he's like, Jeff, apparently we were best friends now.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
I was sitting next to him and he's like, we got to go to another bar after this.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
I go, there's a bar right on the corner that's open.

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
A little after this, he's like, you realize you and I have to fuck some of these women.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I'm like, aren't you married?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
He's like, yeah.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
I'm Charles Barkley married.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
You know, I'm tall.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
He's a little tall.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
He's twice as tall.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
He's a big, he's a big fucker.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
He's huge.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I could get inside him like a costume.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Like a tauntaun.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Exactly.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
I got to cut open Charles Barkley to get all inside him.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I thought Charles Barkley is so bad.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
On the outside.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
So I go, okay, this is bar.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
I invite these girls to this bar.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I go, it's just like, we can walk there.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
It's like two blocks away.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
He's like, Jeff, Jeff, we're not walking anywhere, baby.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I got the van.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
And sure enough, a fucking A-team, a fucking mystery machine, fucking full on.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
Windowless, white van.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
And glamorizing John Wayne Gacy.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
Man, I got the wagon, man.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
We're going to take these teenage boys home and show them the rope trick.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
He's a welder.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I got the crawl space, man.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
We don't have to deal with this.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
I got the crawl space, baby.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
You know you and I have to eat some of these children.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.000
We are hip-deep in human lampshade right now.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
Not fucking a full on A-team black van.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
That with a sliding door, like an old school fucking like,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
like a Fort O'Connor line pulled up with like a,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
maybe I'm mythologizing.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
I think it had a heart.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Well, I'd love to see like security footage of this,

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
and it's not Charles Barkley.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
It's just some dude.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
It's Jeff and a broom.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
He was just Barkley profiling a broom.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Yeah, exactly.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Exactly.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
He sounded just like him, you guys.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
Yeah, the five newscasters are just like three cats.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Look, he was certainly a large black man.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
He was a large black man.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It might as well have been Charles Barkley.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
What is the team of the six blonde newscaster women?

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
Maybe you just gave a random dude courage enough to fuck these women

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
because he thought he was Charles Barkley for a second.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Look, whether it was Charles Barkley or not,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I got Charles Barkley laid that night.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Because all he wanted was a wingman.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
So like, you know, Drew Carey's there.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
We're all hanging out.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
The only reason that he was there.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Where did you go?

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
Like playing at Hollywood in the dream of the people who founded it?

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
Like, where was this place?

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
There was a colorized John Wayne.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
Get on some of this pussy.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
The Star Wars band with the big heads.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
Gene Kelly dances.

58:56.000 --> 59:04.000
We're going to fuck some of these pilgrims.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Russell Brand not there.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
He dropped off the face of the earth.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
There's no more.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
It was a goucho grill in Portland, Oregon.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
And that's the end.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
But so we get this.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
I was like, we can walk.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
They're like, no, we're not walking anywhere, baby.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
I got the van.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
And he puts his arm around me in a very like dominating fashion,

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
like headlocks me.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
He's like, you're rolling with me tonight, Jeff.

59:24.000 --> 59:31.000
Like training day.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
So we get to the bar.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
I go, Sir Charles, can I get you a drink?

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
He's like, give me like a triple vodka cranberry.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Something awesome.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Like he ordered a triple because he's huge.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
And so I go to the bar.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
He goes and meets these girls and instantly leaves with them.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
He's gone.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
He goes up there.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
No, we're there for a minute.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
And then we're up there hanging out.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
And I go up to go to the bathroom.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
He's like, Jeff, baby, baby, you're not leaving, baby.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
You're not leaving.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
You're not leaving.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
I go, I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Charles Barkley.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
I'll be right back.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And then I came back.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And when I came back, he was gone.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
He was gone.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
He took all the girls and left.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
The Charles Barkley pickup line book is like, hey, I'm Charles Barkley.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Yeah.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And that's the book.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Like once you say that, like.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Well, he got me in a van.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I didn't even say shit.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Like, I guess like.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Like, yeah.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I do like the idea of him like the about going back to his race stuff.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Like thinking that his like experiences.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Like, oh, things are much easier for black people.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
As soon as I joined the Phoenix.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
If it came, everything is equal.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's his advice to be able to just join the suns and.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I don't know.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
You have to be Charles Barkley because he's kind of adorable and he's funny.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Jason Kidd is seems like an asshole.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
He was in the suns too.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
No one likes that guy.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Well, he also had some spies to the abuse stuff.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You know, he's got stuff.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
It's still sports talk, even if there's child abuse involved.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
You're still talking about sports.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Sorry.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Deal breaker.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
All right.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I want to, I want to, I want to go into our heartbreaker segment.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Is that more dickies?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It's still dickies.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
So it's just the same thing, but we advanced.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Do you want different music?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Because we have.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
No, that's good.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
That's good.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
We have to use up my music before we have to change everything.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
This is a heartbreaker that I want to do our old friend, our friend of the show.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Dick Donnelly, who I tweeted.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
He was, he was here one night.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
He had a massive eruption of bullshit in his brain.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
What was this?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I think that's the medical term.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
It was, he didn't, it wasn't an aneurysm.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We'll let him, we'll let him describe it for a second.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
But actually, I think if I just bottomed through the explanation.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Bontrotters.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I, he, he, and he, like, he came back.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Now I'm stuttering while I'm describing it.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
He came back into the green room and his stutter was like, like, because it had hit his verbal

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
center.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And I was, I thought about bringing him up that night, but I'm telling you, it was just

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
like too, it was like, it's too frustrating for him to talk.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
We've been tracking this guy's adventures since, since we met him.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And, and then was that night.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And I tweeted like, oh my God, he's all, this thing happened and he's, he's pretty fucked

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
up.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But he's, he's here tonight and he's, he's, he's going to, going to see his mom for Christmas

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
as a seeker you hear.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Can you, can you come up?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I wanted to touch base with you and send you off for the holidays because so many people

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
were so concerned about you when I tweeted that stuff because it was a tragedy.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Well, but you talk now, you sound better.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Thank you.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I want to say thanks to everyone.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm now nervous, but everyone who wrote based off your tweet and said nice things to me.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I don't, I didn't know I had such an impact on people.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
It was a, it was an eye-opener for me.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I think I knew that when we talked about the Kickstarter and saw everyone fund it in a day.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And that was the first time it really clicked with me, but then to see a lot of people respond

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
on Reddit and, and, and on Twitter and write me personal messages.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It just, I just want to say being a Armenian has been like the best thing ever.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And you guys are all really awesome people.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Yeah.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
There's like a crazy thing that you said to me in the green room because the first time we met you,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
the first conversation we had with you on stage, we talked about the tragedy,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
which I remember like Erin was like crying because like, like she heard it for the first time on stage.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That you're, when you had your, to catch you up, Iron Man 3, the seek, seek for whatever reason,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
he's a medical phenomenon, has had multiple aneurysms and has survived them,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
but has no guarantee that he won't continue to have them and has gone through experimental treatment

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
at the hands of these people.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And then there was an episode where Seek said, said, said to us that, that he told these people

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
who had been experimentally treating his aneurysms, which had had some results,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000
but that ultimately there was a point where you said, for better or for worse, I am ending this chapter.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm going forward into a world without this particular treatment where they put these coils in stuff like that.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And then you went off and we were like, okay, Godspeed, what's going to happen now?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Because as you said, like as you were off the treatment, like your memories were starting to happen

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and your visual centers were starting to light up.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
This tragedy that happened to you recently was actually one of these coils blue.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah, no, one of the coils, which is rare that this would happen, slid out

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
and punctured another piece of my brain.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:09.000
And it was a Sunday night and I remember waking up screaming and was taken to the ER

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and they weren't my normal doctor.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
So they did a CT scan at MRI, they didn't find anything.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
But I knew something was wrong, so I kept screaming about pain.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And then I left to go do a comic book signing in Arizona while in pain.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The show must go on.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah, pretty much, because they kept telling me nothing was wrong.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And sometimes I have things that are psychological.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So I'll go, okay, maybe this is one of those things, I'm not in pain.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
And then I came back the next day from Arizona and couldn't talk, almost at all.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And then I felt trapped because that happened to me when the first aneurysm ruptured.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And I've had nine scents and luckily none ruptured.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So the coil slid out of the ninth one and it punctured a piece of my brain

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and my brain bled for five days until I went back to the doctor

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and saw my doctor a second time and they found the problem.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But at that point, it was too late, the damage was done.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
The bleeding stopped on its own, luckily, because it wasn't a lot,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000
but just enough to break a levy or something.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But the good news is that when you came out of the green room that night

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:50.000
to do an impression of it, you couldn't say a single word without eight stutters.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It was frustrating for me.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It must be being trapped in a coffin.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yeah, to me it was awful.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I feel weird complaining about it because when I go to the hospital to deal with these things,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I meet people who are way worse.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And I'm part of aneurysm groups where people are way worse.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So I try to let that keep me grounded of how much I complain about it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
But you look, I mean, listening to you has so much perspective.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
We take so much for granted.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I was complaining about people telling me on Twitter to stick to my jokes.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That's fine though.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
That's all real fun.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I don't know if this is the worst problem anyone's ever had.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That was me.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Yeah.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I don't think that that's the key to life.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I don't think that the key to life is all of us figuring out

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
that we should be using a metric by which every day we wake up in bed

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
if we don't have every problem that everyone has.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I'm not saying that what I'm saying is having perspective for me is it really helps.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Yeah, it's very important.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And you get, like, you see the big picture and just because, you know,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
people are starving in Africa doesn't mean you can't get pissed about being stuck in a traffic jam.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I'm not saying that.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Especially if a starving African child cuts you off.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Oh, yeah.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Which I forgot to talk about.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That is number one on my list of shit.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yeah, I'm like, why are you starving? Just sell the car.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It's a fucking hummer.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But I think for, obviously, we all have problems and relative to us,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
those are big problems, but to hear you talk about some of the issues you've had

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
and then to hear you say that you don't think those issues are as major as what someone else has,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
like, that's very inspiring.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And it's just good to have perspective.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Sorry.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
See, are your memories still the same?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Are you making memories again or no?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm going to see my mom and this will, I haven't seen her in a couple of years.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
This is the good news that I want to talk about.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Okay, go.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
But I own this. I own this.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
This is all from Dan.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
My mom, we kind of grew apart when I didn't have any memories of her.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So she didn't know how to handle that, like, you know, and I don't blame her.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And you literally had no, like, no old memories, no childhood memories, nothing?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:29.000
No, I mean, I don't, I didn't get visual, you know, so I could kind of know that she was my mom,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
but I felt it.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
But you don't conjure up any visual attachment?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
No, no, but now I can.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Really?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And I mean, I know what NT looks like and Adam Goldberg looks like.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Hey, there's pros and cons to everything.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I only know what he sounds like.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Oh, wait, oh, I know you now.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Okay, all right, no, all right.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Shut the fuck up.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Goldberg had, like, an achievement unlocked thing.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
He gets the green lightsaber now.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Easy shot, easy shot.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So my mom, my mom, she just, she's, we, you know, I'm a big Superman fan, big Star Wars fan.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So my mom is, we had this connection recently where she said, I said, mom, I remember you and I used to drive her,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000
like, whenever she had extra money on a, we grew up poor, like, we're both still poor, my mom and I.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And she was like, do you remember driving around looking for Star Wars figures, like, to different toy stores

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
and, you know, trying to find, like, the R2-D2 that, like, was the rare figure in the set,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
or the slave-layer, you know, variant or whatever.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
And so we recently had been buying Star Wars figures together, like me on the east,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000
they're here west coast and her on the east coast, and it kind of rebuilt this, like, connection with us.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And so she'll send me pictures of the stuff she's buying, which are waiting for me when I go home,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
and I've been Instagramming them, like, look at the toy my mom found me,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
and it kind of gave my Instagram a purpose, besides, like, pictures of my dog.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000
So it's, so it's been, it's been kind of nice, and so now we, I have almost every memory of her, I think.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It's been coming back to you, you said, like, you, you're, and I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I don't know if this should be a celebrated, like, Reese Witherspoon seeing things in color in Pleasantville.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You are in a sleepless state, you can't sleep right now, your brain is exploding with, that's a bad idiom.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Your mind is exploding with, you can't tell the difference between dreams and memories right now.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Yeah, because it's so overwhelming, like, I, like my neighbor who, like, is a really good friend of mine,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and she, I can now close my eyes and I know, and I can see what she looks like.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
She's not even in the room.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Whereas before someone had to describe an apple, and you would like,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
and we can't even comprehend it, because we're, we're trying to figure out what that even meant before,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
where you were like learning to draw because you were an artist, lost your visual memory,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and you had to like, you couldn't see that.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Now you can't not see things, now you close your eyes and you see things.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And it's, it's pretty horrifying.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Because, because I've been remembering things that aren't good things either, you know, like, I, I'm, I mean, I never thought I,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I don't know, I never thought I was a good person, like I grew up pretty broken, abusive dad, you know, like a poor,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000
ran away from home, got into drugs, I was a narc, like, I mean, I've done like really crazy things.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Wow.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
And you were a narc?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Yeah.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
In Atlanta.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
This is turning into memento.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
One memory is going to come back.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Not the money!

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Like, like, it's buried in Central Park!

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Oh wait, I was undercover!

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That's who that guy is!

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Oh my God, he's been following people for a year!

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Um, yeah, so I, but I remember when you, when you forget your life, it's easy to reset and be a good person.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Because I feel like deep down we all want to be good people.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And so it was easy for me, but now it's a, I, I am like, I, people don't, you know, like, I don't go out as much anymore.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I stay recluse in my apartment because I'm afraid because I start remembering all these things and I'm like, well,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000
that guy ever come back, you know, or now that he, now that I know, or am I smart enough now, I've done enough good now,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I've given more than I've taken, like, did I, am I okay, am I in the clear, you know?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
So I, so I've been struggling a lot lately and it's brought me in and out of depression and brought me, you know,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
a lot of places emotionally I couldn't go before because I had emotional problems.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000
So now, like, as far as, you know, knowing when to be sad and when the right time to be sad, I had issues with that.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Now I know when to cry, I know when to be upset.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And so to know that and to know, like, the good and bad things you've done in your life and to know that there are people out there

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
that have kept, like, those things, like, private, you know, like, I just, like, it's like a lot to digest.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So, um...

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Do you think that people should always be transparent about every scrap of darkness inside of them,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000
or do you think it's important for us to hold on to the things, protect them, guard them, have shameful things that way?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
I mean, I don't, I don't know.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It's, that's a good question.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I think it's, it gets case by case.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I think, I think, like, for me, I probably won't share some of those things,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:06.000
but I will try to make amends with someone who I think I've wronged on a personal level and secretly with them,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and just hope that's enough.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And, and I will, you know, I mean, yeah, it's, it's, I think it's just case by case.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Me, I've lived these past five years, you know, I'll be, I'll be 33 in May next year.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
So it'll be my, it's essentially my fifth birthday.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And out of this new life, and I, I want to keep going with this new life.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I want to look at the mistakes I've made, and I think that's everyone, everyone who's made a mistake.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
You look at it, you dissect it.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Every morning you wake up.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You have this new chance.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000
It's kind of like, not to crassly like force that weld to all the stuff that we were talking about with the online culture.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But it's like, you do have an opportunity every morning to wake up to kind of change.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You could, you could just go, you know what, I may, I may not be reacting with, like, regular shit.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But I thought, I thought my, what I thought was my neutral gear actually is like a weird gear that was like handed to me by somebody above me or my past.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And actually there is a true neutral and you can just achieve it.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:21.000
That's a, I don't, well, I'm not a doctor, but I doubt that you'll be overtaken in your wildest dreams that would happen.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I think we would love to have evil seek back.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You come back and tell us how women shouldn't vote.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I remember now.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Superman.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
This is for faggots.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I think we would, the crazy thing is those seriously, like there would be a huge lesson too.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Because we could, we could, I think, I think all of the women and faggots in this audience could like watch you bound out like the Hulk and go, I love that guy.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I'm glad he's back.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I'm glad he didn't.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I think it's a cool opportunity in a way.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I mean, obviously you want to be able to have all your memories back.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:12.000
But to be able to say this, I'm like, I don't, like, I get to choose right now whether I am a good person or I, or do I dwell on the bad things that I did.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And that's, we should all wake up tomorrow morning and say, fuck all the bad shit I did.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Let's just start being good from here forward.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And like, and absolutely just hit control, alternate delete and reset everything.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Yeah.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And walk forward and don't feel ashamed of all the things that you've done.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I mean, certainly you want to go back and make amends for wrongs you've done people.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Sure.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
But I think you'd find that that's probably a very small part of you.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Well, and you'll also find that people are forgiving.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I learned that, you know, pretty recently.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And I think, I think, I wake up every morning with the question of like, like, because I, like I said, I'm part of aneurysm groups.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I meet other people, I go to hospitals and, and, and was at one point part of like a monthly group that we met.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
And I see that I'm, I'm doing much better than a lot of people and other people are doing better than me too.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000
But so I wake up every day going, what, what can I do that they can't that, but should be done?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You know, like, what can I do for them to help spread a message or help, you know, do something good, light a fire under somebody who needs inspiration?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
You know, like, how can I give?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And I think if we wake up every day with that, I think, I mean, I think then we will stop giving a shit about people.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Like, what does, you know, Kevin Costner think about this?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Or, you know, who cares what Christian Bale is thinks about the new Batman?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Like, who gives a shit that's not news?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Like, here's a new Batman.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
What do you do?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
There's a new Batman every five years.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I'll be Batman in five years.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Also, the fact that you just spoke for a couple of minutes without stuttering a single time in a while and just recently you couldn't talk.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It's amazing.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And that's the miracle of our podcast.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And you at home, if you're watching, we need your money.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Unless you want to seek on other people to continue to suffer, sign the back of your social security check and mail it into Harmontown.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I have a question.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Sorry, go ahead.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
No, go ahead, please.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I was going to ask you how, I don't know how brains work.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
How is your, how are your memories coming back?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It's interesting that it was in there.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It wasn't that it was gone.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It just, you couldn't access it.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Do you know how it's all coming back?

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Well, I mean, stuff heals over time, especially the mind.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And so sometimes it's, it's not like one set spot where everything is in your brain.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
It's different for everyone.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:52.000
It's, I, that's why I think like, I don't know, I admit this is, I don't want to get too out there with this, but I, I, I look at a very good blend of the supernatural and the scientific.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.000
You know, like I feel like I'm surrounded by that a lot because I feel like I've dodged more bullets than I would have.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
If I was a God in charge, I would have given me.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So just to be clear, would you mean like when the tissue is damaged,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
the memories that that tissue was responsible for go offline?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
But when the tissue heals, then those memories like reappear in the hard drive?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
No, not in every case.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But in some cases, mine, it seems where it was damaged.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
It was just the link going to memories was the damage part.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So now when things kind of rewire and rewire around the damage, things start coming together.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It's not a real thing. It's these ideas are just stored somewhere in this lump of toothpaste we have in our heads.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:45.000
That's some of the, I mean, I'm not allowed to talk about most of it, but some of the research stuff I've been part of is, is that kind of stuff.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
It's asking a big way.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Is it Spoilers?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Is Will Smith doing the research?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Hey, Spoilers!

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
There's research that's gonna come out for the four years.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
They're giving him standards powers, man. You can't talk about that shit.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
If anyone's allowed to talk about anything.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Yeah, fuck them.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I sign a lot of documents.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
But you can just say you didn't remember that, and they'll have to buy it.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Are they gonna sue you?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You have the best excuse for anything.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Oh yeah, you can be like, that was evil seeks not bad.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Yeah.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I want to get my wife and my Dungeon Master out here pretty quickly.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
But Seek, what is there anything else you want to say before you go out for the holidays?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Yeah, I mean, I know my boss would love me to plug something, but instead I'd rather everyone here just do something nice for somebody for the holidays.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Give to Feral Audio if you can donate.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Give to Brainiers and Foundation, or the Joe Necro Foundation.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Give it to the Brainiers and yourism.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Okay, Feral, thank you.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Give it to something that really needs it.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
But just do something selfless. That's all I ask.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Dustin's giving you the finger right now.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Well, people have brain problems, Dustin.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I'm joking, he wasn't doing that. I'm sure he agrees with you.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Now he is.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I'm sure he agrees with you.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Thank you for having me.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Merry Christmas. Happy holidays.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Tell your mom we said hi.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Let's bring out Erin McGathy and Spencer Crittenden.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Yay!

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Jeff, your hair smells fabulous.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
You smell like a million bucks.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Thank you.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
You smell delicious.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Wait, are you guys sniffing each other?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You lousy bump trawlers.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
She's a sniffer.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I'm a subject of Bog Trotters.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
A Bog Trotter is an antiquated derogatory term for Irish people.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Well, as a man of Irish descent, we do sniff a lot of shit.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Ireland, send your comments to Ultra Burg on Reddit.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It's time for the segment.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Is he high or angry?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Wait, what segment?

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I just don't know. Wait for the theme song.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Hi. Hi.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Are you high or mad?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I'm both. Let me tell you guys something.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Then that's shit weave.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
When he's both, that's a fucking podcast goal.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
This is all, I'm just putting it on for the audience.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
It's not marijuana. It's not.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
But, you know, Target, I'm pretty sure.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Wait, is it a gateway? What?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Are you co-baiting?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Is there a gateway?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
There is a gateway. Have you gone through it?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
No, what?

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Just trying to, you know, Russell Brand, he's not off the map.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
He hasn't fallen off the map at all.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:11.000
He's become a lot, a lot, very politicized, and he has his own YouTube TV show where it's like the O'Reilly Factor,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
but with Russell Brand.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That sounds like falling off the map.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
That's so weird. Doesn't Charlie Sheen have that?

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Yeah, exactly. Tom Green has that.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
He's making the real grassroots.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Isn't there a Nambla channel on YouTube?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Yeah.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
He's making a huge comeback. I resent that very much.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
What are you mad about?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
He just hit a thousand subscribers on his channel.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Wait till the Namblates hear about this.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
The Namblates?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yeah, yeah, me and the Namblates.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
All right, sorry, we're derailing you. What are you?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
What's on your mind, Spencer?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Nothing's on my mind. Just you guys are hating on Russell Brand just because he's trying to make a political difference.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
No, I said he was sexy and didn't button his shirt.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
He said the movie was good.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Yeah, I said nothing bad about him either.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
He's not falling off. He's not falling off, Russell.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I know. I know.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Me and Russ. Rusty.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
He's saying he's falling off. I was on his side.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I call him Rusty.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Rusty Rockets.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I was suspicious that he was being targeted and punished by...

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Lena Dunham?

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
You know, her dog...

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
You don't listen in the back.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Lena Dunham's dog bites people.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
He's not okay.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
It's not okay.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
He's getting his memories back one at a time, but just from 20 minutes ago, so it's not...

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Well, yeah, I have to catch up. Russell Brand target.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
You know those aisles, those shelves?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
In California, they bolt him down because of earthquakes.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And this guy can kill your character at any time?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Yeah.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
What character? We're already dead.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
They bolt him down because of earthquakes. How do you know that?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Well, I mean, they bolted the ones at borders down.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And those are the same concept, you know, shelves with product on them.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Did you work?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
It's a building code thing.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Did you work at borders?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
We knew all about...

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Yeah, you know, bookshelves are just borders.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You've got a real...

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
With books on them.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Professor, do you... I don't know.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Who's Andy Rooney?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Who's Andy Rooney?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Who's this Andy Rooney I keep hearing about?

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Seems like every time I turn on a podcast that has someone over 30 on it, they're referencing Andy Rooney.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Is that a gene salad?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I take exception at a reference I don't understand.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I'd like people to reference things I do understand.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That's with soap.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
How small does it have to get?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Andy Rooney was a guy at 60 Minutes who would basically do...

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
One of the most brilliant pieces I ever saw in Spy Magazine existed is they created a column that was a...

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
On one side it was Andy Rooney comments, and on the other side it was Jerry Seinfeld bits.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
And you had to figure out who was who.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And it was tough.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Well Rooney just would do the premises, but there wouldn't be any jokes after that.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
It would just be like, what's the deal? And then he would just keep saying that in different ways.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
You'd be surprised though...

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Did he get some good lines?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
No, no, I'm saying you'd be surprised at how little bit you let Jerry Seinfeld get away with.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I think the point of that column wasn't look how funny Andy Rooney is.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Or is it...

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:45.000
It's not like after Seinfeld asks the question where's the sock in the dryer, he lands the fucking...

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
He doesn't put on a Darth Vader mask and do a thing where I found the sock.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
He asks the question and that's what Andy really does.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Where'd the sock go? Where's it go?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Who wears sweaters?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
The end.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Did you guys know that you can measure the passage of time by how many of Dan's buttons are unbuttoned?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Oh, you're Russell Branding!

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
You're Russell Branding!

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
You're Branding, bro!

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I'm splitting like a...

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
You're three down to Russell.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I'm like a tamale.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Dan, did you unbutton those or did your kknave. prehensile?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
How did that happen?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I assume that they were kind of...

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I assume that I'm fat.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
That's not how buttons work.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
They'll pop off before they'll just unbutton themselves.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I think they will before they pop off they'll unbutton.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
You think so?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Yeah, that's the... I think.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Alright, restart the podge.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
They're not on Mythbusters.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
What do buttons really do?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Get them open again.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Try your hardest.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Do it!

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
You can do it!

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
By the way, that is doing things I didn't think it could do.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
That...

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Oh my god!

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Holy shit!

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I want to open it and there's another Dan face on it.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000
This is a really good commercial for subscribing to the video feed.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Oh yeah, if you're listening right now,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
you're listening later than this is happening

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and you didn't get to see what I just did.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Let's play some...

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I've been away for a very long time.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Can we play some little D&D, please?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I don't know.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Apparently, I found out terrible things happened to my character.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Oh yeah, so many.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
What are we doing?

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
D&D, Spencer, hold on.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It's a game where you roll dice and we portray characters.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Oh great, can you teach us all how to play?

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Whoa!

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Fuck, Spencer, hey!

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
How's it feel, Jeff?

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
It's fucking... wow.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
You missed a lot, Jeff.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
You missed a lot.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Don't be angry with me, man.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I grew three more testicles.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
For a total of nine.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Well, while Spencer's setting up,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
can I briefly also say something about Target?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Yeah.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Yes.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Thank you.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I don't know what I would have done if you would have said no.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You may speak, woman.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Tell us about leaving to Dunham.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Well, one day I took my vagina into Target.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
A couple years ago, I was at the Target on Sunset in Hollywood

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
and I was walking around and I was wearing a red shirt.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And I don't know if this is still the policy,

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
but I think the employees can just wear any old red shirt

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
as long as it doesn't have anything on it.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Is that correct?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Store-to-store.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Store-to-store.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Oh, cool.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Store-to-store.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Interesting.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So you're saying at a PFresh, you could have meant...

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Hey, this really is the best company ever.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You mean I could wear a red shirt of any kind,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
no matter where I go?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
So I was walking around.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I was in the automotive section and I was in a hurry

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
trying to find something and this guy walked up to me

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
and he was like, hey, hey, hey.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Can you tell me where the blah-blah-blah is?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
And I said, oh, I'm so sorry.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I don't work here.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And he's like, okay, can you tell me where the blah-blah-blah is?

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I was asking.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And it was so...

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It was bewildering and I found...

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I walked with him and found it with him.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And the entire time I was waiting for him to say something,

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
and he knew I wasn't...

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
He knew I didn't work there.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I was sure to leave and say,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I'm going to go continue my shopping.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
That is really weird.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
That guy was that unwilling to say in the moment,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
oh, sorry.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Well, if you ask someone individually for help,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
they'll do it if you're in need,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
which is so strange in a store

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
where there are people that are paid to do that exact thing.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Do you think it's like I'm just maybe flirting with you possibly?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
I don't want this transaction to be over.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I don't think you flirt by going,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
okay, so you can do it anyway.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I don't think that's...

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Maybe Charles Barkley can get away with that,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
but I don't think...

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Charles, you haven't read the game?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
It turns a woman on like a light.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
He was negating her.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Yeah, it was a long neg.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
You're not resulting in a purchasing name.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Spencer, why are you so mad right now, man?

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I hate to see you like this.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
You guys are talking a lot of shit about Target.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
They make a fine product.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Spencer, do you get high before the show or during the show?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
No.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
When you're backstage, are you getting high while we're out here?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
That would be illegal.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
All permutations, you'd suggest it just then.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I think we have our answers.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
You have a prescription.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
You can get high anywhere you want.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
What?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
You have a prescription, don't you?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
No, that stuff's illegal, man.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
The feds, I'm not doing it.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Federally, okay.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I have a prescription.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Come get me.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
No, you don't.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Hey, he doesn't.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
In case you're wondering.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
It expired two years ago.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I'm so lazy that the feds would find nothing.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Are you high on your picture, on your card,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
because I've seen it before and you look super high.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
No, I'm just that happy to be getting a pot card.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Every pot card picture is like, ehhh.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I don't think I have it in my wallet,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
but I'm so proud of it because I've always said,

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
when I looked at the photo, I was like,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
this is like a billboard for a Jason Sudeikis's movie

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
about getting a pot card.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Pot card.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Jason Sudeikis's.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
It's kind of like prescription because I'm in the photo,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I'm like.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I didn't get a card.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I just got a sheet that said with the doctor and everything.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
You pay extra for the card, which I was happy to do.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I have never, in my life, there's so many memories I have.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
One is of Sikh's mother.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And I also like, I...

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Wait, was that the most highbrow yo mama,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I fucked yo mama job?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
One is of Sikh's mother.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I have a memory of your mother.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
With a multiple aneurysm survivor,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
you don't have to fuck him.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
You can just say, I remember your mama.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Too soon?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
No, you gotta get him in.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Oh fuck it.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
The, damn it, you guys.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Walking to my car after,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
like with a bag, a pharmacy bag with marijuana in it,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
with a receipt stapled to it that said visa.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I bought it with a credit card.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Pot, because I'm Sikh and I need medicine.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And capitalism and democracy.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
What is your main element, Dan, that necessitates the pot?

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I think they led me into nausea?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Oh, do they like lead you?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I like walk you down the path.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
There's three doorways that you have to step through.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I have answered the pot riddle,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
or the pot will not be granted.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I think ultimately it came down to...

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Spencer, can you give me pot dungeon master?

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Wait, what?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Pot dungeon master.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
What are you...

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I'm not sure if I'm doing it,

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
or if I just don't get what your premise is.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Spencer, how high are you?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
You just said pot dungeon master, like that means anything.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I'm walking into a pot store,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
and you're describing me walking into the dispensary.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Oh, okay.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
You're walking into a pot store.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
There's magazines.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
You gotta sign in.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Spencer, things have changed since I saw you last night.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Yeah, man.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
It's these testicles.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Prescriptions, you know,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
maybe Dan doesn't want to talk to them about this,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
but you got a prescription.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Yeah, I know.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I have a giggling deficiency.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Is what it came down to.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Dan recently got a prescription.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I guess you don't want to... sorry.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Oh, you mean my... yeah, no.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
I don't think I want to... yeah.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
It's perfectly legal.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
You recently diagnosed with ADD.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
You have ADD. We've known this.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Wait, is that...

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
You got diagnosed with ADD?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Was it you in a waiting room with, like, all eight-year-olds?

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Yes.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And you?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Did you, like, vision during a test,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
or, like, how did they know?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
It took surprisingly little time to get diagnosed.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I feel like I had to answer three questions.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Is this about scoring Adderall? Is that the point?

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Well, let's just say I went to Yelp's top psychiatrist

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
so that season six could get done.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
It was harder for me to get a pop license.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
It's news to your wife.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
What's that?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So this is news.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
It's a medicine.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Wait, you haven't shared this with your betrothed?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Was it beloved?

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
We're a past it.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I'm a little ashamed of it and just wanted to take it.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
You mean... it's a medicine.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
People do this all the time,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
and it's signed off on by doctors everywhere

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
and politicians.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Everyone loves it.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
It's, you know, overdoses are one of the leading causes

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
of preventable death in America,

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
and everyone's just smiling about it.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I don't...

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
There's nothing to be ashamed of except America.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
It is...

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I think we have the title of our episode.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Yeah, I went in and I...

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Yeah, I'm sorry, Dan.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I thought this is just, you know...

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Yeah.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
It's...

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Cool, is Dan dating anyone, or is there...

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Well, I mean, Dan.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
He's got a role for that, I think, you see.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Yeah.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
I was gonna tell you eventually.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Yeah.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I didn't think...

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
What do you mean, yeah, sarcastic?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
No, no, yeah.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I don't know.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
No, no, no, I feel weird.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
No, it's fine.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
It's fine.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Are you upset that he's been, like, not sharing the...

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Maybe that's part of it.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I don't know.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
No, no, no.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I'm not upset you're not sharing it.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It seems like a secret the way it came out,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
but it's fine.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
You know, I also...

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Here's some other things.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I've been getting a lot of CAT scans

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
about the things wrong with my chest,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
my enlarged lymph nodes and my sarcoidosis.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Yeah, and then you get a...

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
It's fine.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
He goes to the doctor.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I just want you to be safe.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I just want you to be safe.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I'm not sharing...

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Dan hasn't been sleeping a lot lately,

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
because he's working on community...

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
He's filled with Adderall.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
You can't sleep on that, yeah?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Well, he has to stay up, because he's working late,

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
and I'm a little concerned about his health.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
How much do you sleep a night, Dan?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Three.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Hours?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
On a scale of one to ten, I don't know.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Three.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Three.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Three.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Three balls.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I'm doing fine.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
By the way, I found out...

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
He's fine.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
What this isn't.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
It went away.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Which guy?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
You're healed.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
You're cured.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Oh, thank you.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I can smell it.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I don't think so.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
So that, it turns out, is tracheal stenosis,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
which I think is just a heartening of the cartilage

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
and the trachea.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
There's enlarged lymph nodes in my trachea

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
that I have to get biopsied,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
because they have to rule out sarcoidosis,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
which is only fatal five percent of the time.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
All right.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Now you're all caught up.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
They have to, like...

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
They've got to put a thing down my throat

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
and grab some cells,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and then diagnose or not diagnose sarcoidosis.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
If they diagnose it,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
then it's a simple, like, it's 95 percent chance I'll live.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Yeah.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
According to Dungeon Master terms.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Like, you roll two dice and then...

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Yeah, that's like five rolls.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Yeah.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Spencer, roll Danza.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I would have to get a critical hit by God to die.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
No, we're good.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
We're good.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Wait.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Maybe.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
God autocrates.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
God will one-shot you.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
He autocrates.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
There's no...

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
You don't have to wait for the 20 if you're God.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
They have to really...

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
God doesn't play dice, man.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I have...

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I have it in large lymph nodes,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
which are battling something,

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
that they have to find out what they're battling.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
You know what they say?

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
You have a 5 percent chance of surviving.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Of dying, sorry.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
But also, in the meantime,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I did pop by a doctor who I did tell

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I have trouble reading books.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
You do.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
And...

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I see him at work.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
That's just because you're late.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Did you go to the doctor with him?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Were you like his, like, hype man?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Yes, he did.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Yeah.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
He's my chauffeur.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I don't have a car.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Are you for a job?

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I can't tell.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I'm for it.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I think that he needs it more than a lot of people I've seen

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
get at or all and give it to me before.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
But you're saying that people...

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Not for Dan for my personal use in the past.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Sorry.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I wasn't clear.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Can you just say that it causes death,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
that people are ODing on it?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
And American shame?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Prescription drugs kill more people than any other drug.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Any illegal drug.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Right.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
All of it.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And it's everyone's fine with it.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Everyone's fine with people prescribing drugs all the time.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
So you're being sarcastic when you say it's good

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
that he's doing this?

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
No, I'm saying he needs it more than other people

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
that are using it, you know, to kill themselves.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And he's using it responsibly.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Because he's making something while he's going.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
No, because a lot of people who have focus problems

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
and do work, you know, creative work, work that requires

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
a lot of hours who have serious ADD,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
oftentimes take medicine to treat that ADD.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I don't...

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Why is this so controversial?

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I don't get it.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
On what use, Spencer?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I understand.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
You're saying in this case these drugs are good.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Overall, pharmaceuticals.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Big, overprescribed problem in America.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Yeah, and it's a problem that a lot of people

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
actually hurt themselves with,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
whereas Dan feels guilty about this responsible usage.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Because I'm taking advantage of a drug dealing nation.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Because they actually need the drug.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Yeah.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Well, I agree with you.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
But everyone would agree that one hour a night

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
asleep, no hours, three hours sometimes,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
is really unhealthy.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
That's not...

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Yeah, well, that's not...

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
That is the case in, like, spurts,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
with or without Adderall.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
That's a fact.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Like, that just happens.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
That's workaholism.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
That's something that there is no drug for.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Except therapy.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Except money.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Yeah.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Yeah.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I mean, you know, I didn't want to...

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I wanted to bring it up on my own time.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I was excited about it.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Because also, I don't want to be like a...

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I don't want to be like a whistleblower.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Because it was kind of fascinating.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Like, I got a prescription for Adderall.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And it took about 20 minutes.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And I answered three questions.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
And then the doctor said,

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
you definitely have ADD.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Which I don't think doctors are supposed to say

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
about anything ever.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Wait, what are the questions they ask you?

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
What's this like?

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I'm genuinely curious.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I feel like I'm kind of like...

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
They give you like a little cat laser

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
and you're like, we're out in the room.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And if you look at it once,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
then you get the prescription.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
They were questions that I answered honestly.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I don't think that they're the questions

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
you need to triangulate ADD as a diagnosis.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I don't think, you know...

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
What do you think about Russell Brand?

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
What do you think about Lady Dunham?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Okay, good.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Yeah, now here you go.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I described my situation and why I was there.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I said, honestly, I felt like honestly,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
people had given me Adderall in the past

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
and I had taken it and had a speedy effect

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
and kept me up.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And that recently,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
it actually had more of a focusing effect.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I'm actually able to get work done

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
instead of not wanting to get work done.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
And then I'm actually also nicer to Aaron.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I find myself kind of like...

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
If I take 10 milligrams,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I will actually kind of...

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I don't know.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I'm a little more respectful to her.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Which I'm embarrassed about it

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
because it's a pharmaceutical.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I'm genuinely embarrassed about it.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
People take drugs and it helps them.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I honestly don't think it's anything to do with drugs.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I don't think that this guy is qualified to say...

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
No, but you are.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That's not your responsibility.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
It seems like you've used this drug before

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
and it helped you in a good effect.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
People are depressed and they take drugs

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
and then it makes them better.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
It's over-prescribed but in a lot of cases.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I don't want to think that my personality is based on...

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
But it's not.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I don't like that idea.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
It's not like these drugs you're taking are changing your personality.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Is it better than that dirty street

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Adderall you were getting but until now?

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
It's all the same.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I mean, I do.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
It's just making your brain better at being yourself.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
There's better be a fucking good season of Community Man.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
It's gonna be great.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
It fucking hurts.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
It's like scraping metal against concrete.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
But Aaron said that I...

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I guess I always say that?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Yes.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I feel really bummed about that one time you texted me.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I was really, really upset about that.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Wait.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
When you texted me...

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I don't know if we should talk about that.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Wait, what did I...

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000
No, no, no.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
You texted me about Community.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
What did I say?

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
What did I say?

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Well, I don't know for...

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Just say it.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
You were like,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I'm gonna come and do something about that.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Oh.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
And then I couldn't do it.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
And I was really bummed out that I couldn't do it.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Second choice.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
You texted me after Kumail.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Wait, is he gonna be on Community?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
No.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
That's the other Adam Goldberg.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:47.000
My rule with him is that you have to land one bit from the audience.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
That's why he keeps trying.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Smash this grasshopper from my hands.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
If you can hook one ring around the pole.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Yeah, a bunch of monkeys just wrote a Shakespeare play before you landed the line.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I am zero for 116.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
117.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I actually got through that.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
You know what bums me out is that we got...

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I'm back.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
We got the whole fucking cast here.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
And we're over time.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
We can't play D&D now.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I know.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
We started so late, though, technically.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Well, I mean, even starting that late, we're still pretty much.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
No, yeah.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Why don't we just...

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
No, that's dumb.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
No, no, no.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000
I was gonna say, why don't we just explain to Jeff what happened?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Fill me in what I've missed and we'll be ready to go for next time.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I would like to hear.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I also haven't been around.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I have a pitch.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Yes.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I want to use my power to make the audience applaud at something so that Spencer is compelled to it.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I think what would be amazing is if Spencer did whatever he wanted to do tonight, but

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
then the next time we see him in the new year, he has learned and is ready to start a Shadowrun

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
campaign.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
What is that?

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
You see, it didn't pull.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Okay.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
You're hearing mostly Adam Goldberg.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
It's a cyberpunk thing from the 80s.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Is that what...

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Hey, it was from the 80s, but now it's from the 40s.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It's like a William Gibson...

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
It's like a Genesis game.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
It's like Blade Runner.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Yeah.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Yeah, but there's elves and dwarves and shit, too.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000
It's set in a world where magic has returned to an apocalyptically technotopic world.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
It was called the NGE.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
There was an acronym for it.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
It was like the big awakening.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
It's a role-playing game like D&D.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
It's like D&D, but with guns and lasers and racism.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Well, I guess it's like...

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
It's like D&D.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Sold.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
All the...

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Do you have that as a stat?

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Racism 15 or like...

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
You got to roll for your racism.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Ah, fuck, I'm a big...

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
I'm plus 15 versus Asians.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Oh, yeah, I guess different races.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
You're more powerful.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I'm sorry.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Does that mean...

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Like, what are you trying to pull off when you need a higher racism?

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Do you need to say something...

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Racist country or something?

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Maybe they would give you more gold or...

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:23.000
You make Thanksgiving more uncomfortable for other people.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Yeah.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
All right.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
It's a great game.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I'm still learning how to play, so it'll be embarrassing for me.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Did Shadowrun start as that video game?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I only know it from the video game.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
No.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
It was around paper first.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
It was around in like early 80s, and it was like...

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
They were like, cool things like comlink cell phones and like...

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000
You know, pocket computer cell phones again.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Small flashlights.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Is there always a fake internet?

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Yeah.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Small flashlights.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
That was a huge component of Shadowrun.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Yes.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Healthy generators, cell phones.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Cat picture storage.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Yeah.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Yeah.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Lena Dunham buggers.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Buggers?

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I don't know.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
It's a bok trotter, I think.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
I'm sure she's feeling very bugged right now.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Spencer, do you want music where you recap for me what happened to catch me up to date?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
What's going on?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Me?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
No.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I don't know what happened.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
What's the last thing you remember?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Oh, God.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I...

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Nothing.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Okay.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Well, that's probably saved.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I mean, shoot.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I mean, at some point, we were in a toilet.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I know that.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's been a long time.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
There was a bucket.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
We were going back and forth in a bucket.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
We were doing portal jumping through a bucket.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
That was when I was around.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Bill Mardigans and there was that.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
You went to Stony...

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
What was the book?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Rose Book.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Rose Book.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
You went to Rose Book.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Right.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Because there was intrigue happening in Rose Book with Father Tinder.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000
He turned out to be a kind of unsavory sort of figure and you were snooping around in his juice.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
All right.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
We were snooping?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
You were, yeah.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Someone attacked him and killed him.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.500
It turned out it was him.

01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.000
It was just a big trick to lure you guys out.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.000
He turned into a crazy demon and then he got smote by the party and then the police came up and they didn't buy.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
They weren't, like, happy about the fact that you guys had killed their mayor.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:24.000
And so you guys booked it from the police and then you guys didn't know what to do for, like, a long time.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:32.000
And you went and talked to a lady named, I think, Charles, who was bathing in the swamp and bothered her a while.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And then you left and then you ran into a fire elemental and Quark raped the fire elemental.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
That doesn't sound like Quark.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
But the thing is, fire elementals are made out of fire.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000
So Quark's dick melted off.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
And...

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
He had it coming.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
He really did.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
You live fast, die young man.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Out your dick off in a fire demon.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
If you cast down the heat.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Keep your dick out of the fire elemental.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Then it turned out there was a secret magical shard of power.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
It was like a Plot McGuffin and it was back in town.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And it turned out that the Frost Giant, he stole it and Admiral Darkstar went after that guy, the Frost Giant.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And so you guys were like, let's go over there.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
And you were like, I don't know where to go.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
So you met up with a little boy named Lil Baskins.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And he turned out to be, you know, not just a little boy, but like a little boy ghost.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
But despite being a ghost, he was a pretty cool guy.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
So he took you guys through the ghost way.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And then you came out in a forest and ran into some gnolls who were trying to come up with an ambush.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
But they were too slow.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And so they were going to fight.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
It seemed like they were going to fight.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And then it turns out that they just wanted that blood book that Sharpie had.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And they offered to buy it.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
And then Sharpie acquiesced.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And then he just sold the book.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
People say, Pot is bad for your memory.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
And you're disproving that.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Yeah, I disprove all stereotypes about things I'm into.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
It's nice.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:22.000
It says the bearded role player in the Super Adventure Brothers shirt.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
That's Harmontown. Thanks for coming, everybody.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Thank you very much.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Have a happy holiday.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
We'll see you in the new year.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Camille, John Roy, Erin McGathy, Harmon.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Harmon McGathey.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Seek Donnelly.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Scoota.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Thank you for coming up.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:48.000
And as always, Adam Goldberg, the eternal, the perennial Adam Goldberg.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Thank you very much. Good night.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Spencer.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Spencer, of course.
