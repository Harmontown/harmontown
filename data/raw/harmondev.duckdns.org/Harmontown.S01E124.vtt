Maybe I should use this one. Should I use this one?\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:54.000\nThe wireless one? Thank you.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:58.000\nDo I have to tap it or swipe it?\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:02.000\nIs it like a Google microphone?\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:06.000\nBoy, what a fuck up of a starter show.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:10.000\nThe auxiliary cable wasn't in. Thank you Houston, Texas!\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nDan, guess what the first word said\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:22.000\nwhen the moon was?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:26.000\nProbably Houston, right?\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:34.000\nEven the people on the moon got the city right.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:38.000\nThat guy shouting out from the audience\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:42.000\nis referring to a fact that could have otherwise been lost\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nto the ages.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nI'm so intelligent, sir.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nThe Woodward and Bernstein of the fucking Houston show\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:58.000\nthat during the Q&A that preceded the show\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nhaving driven three hours from Austin to Houston\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nthoroughly enamored with every city in Texas as I always am.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:10.000\nParticularly ones with Alamo Draft Houses.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nI referred to Houston as Austin.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:18.000\nIt was the equivalent of an 80's sex comedy.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:22.000\nI just called out a different lover's name.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nI love you both. I love Houston even more.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\nThere's a lady in the front\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:34.000\nthat cannot or she is compelled to remind us that we are in Katie.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\nWe are technically in Katie.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nI imagine it's like, I'm from Brown Deer, Wisconsin.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nI'm sure Katie is like, it's a suburb of Houston, right?\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:50.000\nNo one wants to feel like they're in Katie.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nClearly, Katie was...\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:58.000\nWhoever capable of calling this area something other than Houston was a giant asshole\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nthat was either dodging taxes\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.000\nor exploiting workers.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nI don't know what the history is, but no one's going to call this place Katie.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nI swear to God, I promise we're in Houston.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.000\nAnd sometimes Austin, if you get me drunk enough.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.000\nAlright, Houston, Texas. Some trivia about Houston, Texas. Aaron?\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:26.000\nYes. The typewriter was invented here.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.000\nDid you know that?\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nBy Neil Armstrong?\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nHe got off of the rocket ship and he was like,\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nHouston, we need a device.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.000\nI can use to write a letter to tell you we don't have a problem.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nThe moon looks great. I can't wait to get back to Houston.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nGuest Comptroller Erin McGathy, everybody.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.000\nWes Anderson is from Houston, which I found very surprising.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:06.000\nLance Hendrickson? Wes Anderson.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nI thought I was all excited.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nLance Hendrickson, holy shit. That's awesome.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nAlright, fine.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:22.000\nHe's not here, is he?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nYeah, he's in this podium. He's in an adorable pink\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nhand-drawn diorama.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nIs it twee? It's very twee.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:38.000\nAlright, you cool? You look very nice tonight.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:42.000\nThank you.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:46.000\nWe'll edit all this out. People are listening.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nI just started cutting the carrots for my salad. Hurry up. Do your show.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nNow it's a segment called Shadow Puppet Theater.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.000\nFor those of you listening, there's an amazing Shadow Puppet.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\nFacts about Houston.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:06.000\nIt's on the Houston River, which runs from\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nDallas to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:14.000\nHouston was a port city founded by travelers who\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nwere selling pelts and spices to\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:22.000\nthe Houstonina Indians of\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:26.000\nTexas. This is reading like the shittiest fifth grade book report\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:30.000\nright now. Alright, Dan, I know that you prepared this\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nright before class, but go ahead. What would become Houston, Texas,\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nbegan as a cowboy hat store\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nnext to a cattle trough where you could\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:46.000\nslake your livestock's thirst or fit it with a custom hat.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:50.000\nAs soon after that, the local barber\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nmoved in. Back then, a lot of people don't know this, barbers were also\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nthe police and dentists.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nThere was a famous shootout here at the Houston Corral\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:06.000\nbetween a cow that didn't get his hat fitted properly\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\nand a dentist that thought he was in charge of\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nthe law.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:18.000\nI was just curious were the barbers\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:22.000\nand the dentists, were they carrying instruments\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\ntrue to their profession or did they have guns like cops?\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:30.000\nA typical Houston dentist in 1900, which was when the city\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nwas founded, would have\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.000\nas a deputy or sheriff, they would have a gun\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:42.000\nwhere a six gun on their hip and a big hat made next door.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nBut as a dentist, they would have the dental tools as well\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nand there's a lot of famous stories. Billy the Kid\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nhe's famous for shooting 59 people\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\n47 of those are Houston dentists\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nand it's not because he was quicker on the draw, it's because they forgot\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\nthey were on the clock and they drew like a pick instead of a gun.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nIt's a simple mistake. They were actually better cowboys than Billy the Kid\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:14.000\nhe wasn't that big a deal, he just spent a lot of time in Houston\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nshooting innocent dentists. Innocent, talented\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nwonderful law abiding, quicker on the draw dentist who made a simple fuck\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nup and paid for it with their lives and were reduced to footnotes\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nin the history of some asshole who preyed on dentists.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nHouston exists in the shadows of egomaniacs,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\ntyrants, liars, politicians, vampires\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nthey sit here, they weather the storm, Houston that's why\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:46.000\nthe first mayor of Houston, Richard Dawson\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:50.000\ncalled Houston the city\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:54.000\non the verge. That's what it's called\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:58.000\nand you can see it on its license plates. Houston has its own license plates\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:02.000\nit's the only city in Texas to have its own license plates\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nas of 1983.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:10.000\nI heard that you know about the infamous\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nHouston underground, the society under the city\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:18.000\ncan you tell us about that? Houston is famous for\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nhaving a city underneath itself called Houston\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nbecause it gets really hot here in the summer\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:30.000\nand if you need to get your hair cut you could die just walking\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:34.000\nfrom your house to get your hair cut. So they have adopted the practice\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:38.000\nthat moles and ants before them have adopted of staying underground\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nto stay cool. It's no big deal. Don't shame them\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:46.000\nfor it, they're an underground people.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:50.000\nIt's controversial because they're taking up a lot of the city's resources.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.000\nWell the controversy is actually that they cheat\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:58.000\na lot of Houston is actually in\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:02.000\nArizona. Yeah I've heard that.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:06.000\nBecause they do this weird measuring thing where you can only\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:10.000\ntechnically if you're measuring property you have to do it above ground\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nand so they cheat and actually Houston is\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:18.000\n30,000 miles in diameter and a lot of it exists\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:22.000\nunder Las Vegas and Phoenix\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nand they use it as a tax dodge and\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:30.000\nit's a big problem but it's sensitive and you can hear these people\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nyou can hear, I think you can hear their silence and their murmuring\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nit's because they're sensitive about it. They know\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nthey know that Houston is guilty of this but\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nat the same time they profit from it. Totally. I heard that all the\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:50.000\nhighways in Houston were built by Beyonce's dad?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:54.000\nThat's correct. Heinrich Knowles\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:58.000\nthe third. He was a\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:02.000\nformer Nazi sympathizer turned\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:06.000\n1940's Houston engineer. He was\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:10.000\nat the forefront of the automotive revolution. He designed a lot of\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nwhat we call today's highway system. He started in Houston. It was a sort of a\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:18.000\nguinea pig city. Yes, yes, yes. Again you're shaming them and they don't deserve it.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nThey're a good city. They've done a lot of good for a lot of people and you're bringing up the terrible things\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nthat they're mole people who were founded by a Nazi.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:30.000\nBecause obviously Houston is infamous for\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:34.000\ndanger and mystery and intrigue. I have so many questions\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nand because I know that you know so much about it.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:42.000\nThe typewriter was invented here. It's like focus on the positive.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nThis is the first city to ever elect a three legged\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\ngovernor. It was the first city to elect\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:54.000\na governor. They\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nrose above the tyranny. There used to be a rule that if you were a city you couldn't\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:02.000\nelect a governor. They used to tell you you have to elect a mayor.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:06.000\nIt's fucking horse shit. Houston broke that wall\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\ndown. Houston said no, we want a governor. And he's going to have three legs.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:14.000\nIt's all lost to history. Now you look it up and it just says some\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:18.000\ncrap about mission control. It's just garbage.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:22.000\nIt's a bunch of big NASA politics. Yeah, as\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nsomebody who's planning on going to the moon, I mean you're kind of\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.000\nthis is a really important city. This is our\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:34.000\nthe United States elevator to the moon. I'm not using it.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:38.000\nWe're not going to start. I mean it's too\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:42.000\nyeah. Have you heard about the, you said moon elevator.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:46.000\nYou guys know about the elevator\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:50.000\nprinciple? Like somebody was telling me about this one.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nThis sounds like breaking news.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:58.000\nDo you have a sound cue?\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:02.000\nNo.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:06.000\nThis sounds like breaking news.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nAlright, yeah.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:22.000\nYeah, there's, I'm going to get this very wrong, but\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:26.000\nthere's\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:30.000\nthere's this principle that rocketeers I think\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nthey're called in space engineers are like talking about where it's\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:38.000\nactually might be actually practical scientifically\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:42.000\nrather than launching things to and from the moon\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nto that we should build a space elevator. Because\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:50.000\nthe physics work out that once the gravity is a problem when you're\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:54.000\nbuilding like towers and shit, but if you commit and actually build\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:58.000\na tower tall enough it gets out into space and then of course\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:02.000\nthe opposite effect is happening out in space and it's like you can actually\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:06.000\njust make this like metal noodle connecting the earth to the moon\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:10.000\nor maybe just the earth maybe not to the moon because I think that would bend and break it.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:14.000\nI don't think you should connect anything between the earth and the moon.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:18.000\nBut like to build like a space elevator that takes you out into space\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nrather than a rocket that you would just I mean you know and hey let me tell\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nyou I hope nobody farts in that thing because that's a\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.000\nthat's all that's all that's a 27 minute ride minimum.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:34.000\nThis has been moon news.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nDustin could I have it so I can just play the\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\ncue whenever I need to play. I have several cues that I'm\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:46.000\nvery proud of and can you tell me can you hint to\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:50.000\nme the kinds of things that you have music for so I can bend the show.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:54.000\nI think you'll tell me not to do it. No.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:58.000\nCan I get a drink? Can I get a tequila?\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:02.000\nJesus. Here we go.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:06.000\nThis has been moon news.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nWhat do you want scoops? You want a vodka?\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:14.000\nNo I want tequila because I quit vodka.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:18.000\nOh your health kick. Okay give her tequila.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nI want to\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:26.000\nI want to meet one friend from\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:30.000\nHouston. Just a random person.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nThere's people who are calling. There's random Randy here?\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:42.000\nWell I can't no I see Minecraft disqualifies you immediately. People would kill themselves\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:46.000\nif I started talking about Minecraft.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.000\nThere's a teacher.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:54.000\nWhat's that? Asian guy. That goes a long way.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:58.000\nPhysicist I heard.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:02.000\nCommunity college.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:06.000\nDoes anyone have a full glass of tequila?\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:10.000\nSomeone's working on that for you don't worry about that. Just got married.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:14.000\nLet's get the guy who just got married. Okay who's the guy that just got married?\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:18.000\nIs that Tom Gray?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:22.000\nTom Gray come on down.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:26.000\nTom Gray is wearing a\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:30.000\ntasteful heather sweater. He is walking with confidence\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:34.000\nbut not with arrogance.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:38.000\nSomeone called out that's not random. Good point. I know his name for some reason.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nTom here's the thing. Your wife is the best\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nwife in the world. She tried to put the fix in. Here grab any\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:50.000\nmic that you want. She talked to me while you were taking your shit\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:54.000\nand said make me the best wife in the world. Bring my\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:58.000\nloving husband that I'm married to for a week up on stage somehow.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nI was prepared to do that. What she didn't know is that you would be like bring me up!\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nShe probably knew that. Well she's a good wife.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:10.000\nGive her those points in spite of your\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:14.000\nzeal. It's been seven days. So when you're married for a week\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:18.000\nwhat's it like? It's been good.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:22.000\nWe've been together a very long time so I was\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:26.000\ncurious to see if anything would change and nothing seems to have changed.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:30.000\nHow long have you been together?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:34.000\nHow long? I don't want to get it wrong.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:38.000\nEight years she says. She's got this. She's wrong actually. It's longer.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:42.000\nSo we've known each other since middle school. They did in high school.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:46.000\nSomeone in the audience was horrified.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nDid you guys go to prom together?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:54.000\nSomebody reacted to you saying you met your wife in middle school as if\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:58.000\nyou said you got bit by a brown recluse.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:02.000\nAnd lost your leg. Yeah that wasn't good.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:06.000\nNo she wouldn't go to prom with me actually. She didn't want to go to prom.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:10.000\nWe were one of those couples that said we're not going to go to prom.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:14.000\nDo you still feel good about that decision?\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nI've gone back and forth. That's a weird question for me to ask.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nAm I allowed to pry Tom since we have you up here? It's a personal show.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:26.000\nTell me if you don't bully her.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nYou don't have to answer anything you don't want to answer but I'm going to ask whatever I want to ask.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nIf you met your wife, I think the reason that guy said Jesus Christ\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:38.000\nis because when you met the woman that you ended up marrying\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nyou were so young that she might have been the eighth woman you met.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:46.000\nSo the question is\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:50.000\nhow much field playing did you do before you\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:54.000\ncommitted to your fantasy football?\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:58.000\nI know less about football than you do.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nYou couldn't tell from my metaphor. Trust me that metaphor sucked.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:06.000\nI think that's it.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nI'm from a very small town in Wisconsin.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:14.000\nThere's at least two couples I could name that were\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:18.000\ncouples when we were in high school and at my 20 year reunion we're all 40.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:22.000\nTwo of them are still\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:26.000\nmarried couples and they have kids that are old enough\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:30.000\nto be here at the show. I think the question on everyone's mind\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:34.000\nis what are we doing? What are any of us doing? If it's possible for you to meet\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:38.000\nthe love of your life when you're a child, does that\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:42.000\nmean that everyone's full of shit? Or does that mean\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nthat the people in question are really lucky? What is the truth? There's seven\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:50.000\nbillion of us on this earth. Are we really\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.000\nkeys and tumblers? Why is the divorce rate\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:58.000\nnow like a million percent whereas in\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:02.000\ncaveman times it was zero percent? Is it just because we were brutal\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\npeople and made marriage? I'm laying a lot of shit on you.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:10.000\nLet me bring it back to your area.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nIf I was Howard Stern the way I would pose my question is how many\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:18.000\npeople have you had sex with?\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:22.000\nI actually preferred your first question. Howard Stern question.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:26.000\nThe answer to that question would be one. Your wife\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:30.000\nlost your virginity to her and you guys like, I mean that's a beautiful thing.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\nI think that's a system that works.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:38.000\nWe'll see.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:42.000\nThere's a group of children\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:46.000\noutside that agree. They're happy about it. They're playing hopscotch\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:50.000\nand they're high-fiving you on your almost Mormon-like\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nlife.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nYou guys met in junior high. You met when\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nit was actually illegal for either of you to\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:06.000\ndo anything sexually. You grew into sexual adults.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:10.000\nYou did it with each other. You took a vow\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:14.000\nto only do it with each other forever. Now you are one week into\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:18.000\nthat and you're saying nothing's changed.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nWhat do you think? What do you think the odds are?\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.000\nSociety says 70% chance of divorce.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:30.000\nIs that another Howard Stern question?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:34.000\nI actually don't know a question.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.000\nI think it's just people are fascinated with this stuff because we want to know, are we allowed to be\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:42.000\nromantic? Are we allowed to be pie-eyed?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:46.000\nAre we allowed to not be cynical? Because sometimes\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:50.000\nthat could be the biggest mistake you ever make. I always think\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:54.000\nwhen we watch romantic comedies, we actually poison ourselves\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:58.000\nbecause then we take that into our relationships and relationships can actually be so much more\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:02.000\nromantic if we actually allow ourselves to be human and not like these characters that are played by\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nMatthew McConaughey and Meg Ryan and whatnot. We're watching\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\n90-minute little stories about how romance is this and romance\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:14.000\nis that when marriage is a completely different thing. On one hand, naivete\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:18.000\ncan be one of the worst things in the world and on the other hand, it's truly a\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:22.000\nresource that we've squandered in this country. We don't have it anymore.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nThe idea that, oh, I just love you, fuck it. Let's just be together forever.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:30.000\nI don't have a question for you. I think that people in the audience want to know\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:34.000\nas they want to know from Neil Armstrong what's it like to land on the moon.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nThey want to know from somebody who hasn't fucked anybody other than their wife.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nHow are you going to do that?\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:46.000\nIt sounds like Dan's panicking.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:50.000\nWe get married in a few weeks. We get married in three weeks. He's like, what do you do?\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:54.000\nWhat if he's the wrong tumbler and then you're like, oh god, kill myself and then\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:58.000\nyou're doing all these shows, you have a documentary about you and I was like, how do you tell your parents?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:02.000\nI'm 41.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:06.000\nAaron and I, we don't have that.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:10.000\nI am\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:14.000\nsettling down with Aaron at the perfect time. I have met the love of my\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:18.000\nlife and I also coincidentally,\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nI suffer no illusion that I would ever even be\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\nthinking about what would life bring me\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nif I didn't do this, but you seem like a young strapping man\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:34.000\nhere in the prime of your life. My god,\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:38.000\nI bet your dick could cut glass.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:42.000\nI just always felt like I would be a really bad single person.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:46.000\nOh god, yeah.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:50.000\nCan you relate to that?\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:54.000\nIt just seems like the alternative is always worse.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:58.000\nAh, romance.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:02.000\nBoy.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:06.000\nYou're so right about romantic comedies and we've talked about this before.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:10.000\nRomantic comedies peddle this idea that's not real\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:14.000\nthat partners are looking for apartments\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:18.000\nbut those apartments are already furnished, so you go into an apartment\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:22.000\nand you're like, ah, I could live here and then you're like, ah, I don't know, I don't like these\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:26.000\nmirrors on the wall. I'm not into this, but I think the way that relationships really\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:30.000\nwork is that you go into a space that's unfurnished\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:34.000\nand the furnishing is the relationship that you build together.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:38.000\nSo you walk into a space and you're now like, ah, I don't like it, but it has to be a space\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:42.000\nlike in the part of town that you like, in the city that\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:46.000\nyou like, I'm going to keep on going with this metaphor.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:50.000\nYes, this apartment I could build, I could live here and then together\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:54.000\nyou furnish it, but romantic comedies\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:58.000\nthere's this idea that you're living in the apartment and then you look across the way\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:02.000\ninto another apartment and you're like, oh my god, no, that's where I'm supposed to live.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:06.000\nBut no, you don't just get all that. That's not what a relationship is.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:10.000\nGrass is always greener. Is that what you're saying?\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:14.000\nNot necessarily. Yes, romantic comedies. That's\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:18.000\ncertainly an idea in romantic comedies, but it's just like any valuable\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:22.000\nrelationship. The important stuff I think is stuff that you build together\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:26.000\nand the stuff that's most romantic for me with me and Dan\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:30.000\nis when we have like a breakthrough\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:34.000\ntogether as a couple. The most romantic thing is when we work\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:38.000\nthrough something. That really means something.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:42.000\nRomcom's like any other movie treat romantic relationships like any\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nrelationship they do, but we don't notice as much between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:50.000\nas we do between the couple in\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:54.000\nSleepless in Seattle. The characters in movies have to be\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:58.000\ndimensionalized. They have to be complete as individuals and then\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:02.000\nthey have to kind of match up perfectly and then they have to walk away\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:06.000\nat the end of Casablanca saying, I think this is the start of a beautiful\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:10.000\nfriendship and you have to go, oh my god, I love that guy. I also love that guy.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:14.000\nThey're going to make a perfect couple. This is going to be great. That's how we approach\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:18.000\nromance in Romcom's when the truth is a relationship is actually\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:22.000\na very codependent thing where you're like, you have a\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:26.000\nif your relationship is going to have life, you're going to be creating a new\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:30.000\nthing. Who cares?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:34.000\nAnnie Hall is so genius because it captures this romance\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:38.000\nand there's this great romance, but it ends. There's romance\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:42.000\nand then there are relationships and both should intertwine,\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:46.000\nbut not every romance should be a relationship.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:50.000\nYou can stay in an apartment for a night\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:54.000\nlike an Airbnb, but you don't\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:58.000\nrent it. Do you fight with your wife\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:02.000\nTom? You've been married. Do you\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:06.000\nyell? Do you go like, shut the fuck up!\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:10.000\nYou're a terrible person. Are you explaining what yelling is?\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:14.000\nI want to know what the definition of yelling is because I'm always\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:18.000\ncurious about that too. How ugly does it get? Is there a cap that other couples\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:22.000\nhave? It's probably about the same as any average couple.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:26.000\nIt's like the Kinsey thing.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:30.000\nWe don't know what average couples\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:34.000\ndo. There's no like, we don't\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:38.000\npeople say like, oh yeah, I had a fight with my girlfriend last night. We don't really know what that means.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:42.000\nWe have lines that we draw. It's like,\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\ndid you touch her? No, okay. No, no, I don't do that.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:50.000\nIt's like, how mean do you get when you fight with your lover?\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:54.000\nI say terrible things. I get so mad\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:58.000\nand I say awful things and then we\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:02.000\nwe're going to couples therapy now and I'm finding out\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:06.000\nI don't have to say those things. That's not standing between me and\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:10.000\nhappiness. I'm just being, and I\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:14.000\napologize to my dad if he's still listening, but I am just being my dad in those moments.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nI'm possessed by some ghost.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:22.000\nYou didn't buy toothpaste. Why am I having a reaction to that?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:26.000\nIt's an actual thing. The toothpaste fight.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:30.000\nI don't know how you would answer this question honestly, but I'm just\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:34.000\nreally curious how a nice fellow like you, your\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:38.000\nshirt looks like a nicely pressed picnic blanket.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:42.000\nYour pants are clean.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:46.000\nI bet if I sniffed you, I wouldn't vomit. Your shoes look\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:50.000\nnice. Your wife came up to me. Your hair is\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:54.000\ncut. Your face is smooth. You're a nice young\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:58.000\nman. You're very nice looking. Your wife is\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:02.000\nvery nice. You guys look nice together. You've been married a week.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:06.000\nShe came up. You were in the bathroom. She's like, I want to be a good wife to my husband.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:10.000\nI want you to make him happy. You guys are adorable. It's like\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:14.000\nParks and Rec obnoxious.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:18.000\nI want to know who the fights are. Does Parks and Rec at night\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:22.000\nget community? Does it go like, fuck you.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:26.000\nI don't know how you can answer that because you're such a nice\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:30.000\nguy. You validate our relationship.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:34.000\nFirst of all, on the clothing and the way she looks and everything, we're 25.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:38.000\nWe've had 15 weddings to go to this year. We literally came\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:42.000\nfrom a wedding to come here. That's why I'm dressed like this. We drove from a wedding\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:46.000\nto this. I'm hoping it's our last wedding of this year.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:50.000\n25. Well, maybe it's different in Texas.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:54.000\nIf you're 25, your wedding attendance just\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:58.000\nstarted. It's going to double every year for the next 10 years.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:02.000\nBy the time you're 35, you're going to have a wedding. That means by\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:06.000\nmy calculations, you're going to be at three weddings a day.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:10.000\nBecause it doesn't even really kick in until your friends\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:14.000\nare 30. As for the fighting, I guess\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:18.000\nwe actually went to different colleges and did long distance for four years.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.000\nA lot of my fighting\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:26.000\nmemories, I guess, would be over the phone. I feel like that was where\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:30.000\nour fighting got the ugliest. We don't fight a lot. We really don't.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:34.000\nI always feel like I hated arguing on the phone. I really don't even like talking\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:38.000\non the phone, which is not good for a long distance relationship.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:42.000\nThat's the only way you can really communicate or the Skype and things like that.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:46.000\nI hated, because she's the type that when we argue on the phone, she'll\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:50.000\nhang up. Then I call her back and she won't pick up. Then I'll call her back and she won't\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:54.000\npick up. That was always messy. When you first brought that up, that's the\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:58.000\nfirst thing I think about is I hate any kind of argument over the phone.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:02.000\nIs she hanging up because\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:06.000\nyou're getting overheated? Or is she hanging up because she's like... Yeah, usually I'm being an asshole\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:10.000\nor something like that. She'll just get the little DDD from the iPhone.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:14.000\nOh, there she goes.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:18.000\nYou guys sound tame.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:22.000\nI just feel like I don't throw the phone at her or anything like that.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:26.000\nI don't throw anything at Aaron. I just feel like a Marvel character.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:30.000\nThis is the way I talk to him sometimes.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:34.000\nIf you guys found that\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:38.000\nany kind of arguing or anything, since you've gotten engaged in\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:42.000\nsort of wedding planning, I noticed that the closer we got to the\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:46.000\nwedding, I expected it to get more...\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:50.000\nIt's actually different. I expected it to get more stressful, but we actually got\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:54.000\nmore and more excited about it.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:58.000\nYou're a mutant.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:02.000\nOkay, sorry. No, we both self-destructed.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:06.000\nI air everything about Aaron that\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:10.000\ndrives me nuts and everything about me that drives her nuts. We\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:14.000\ndoubled down because we're coming up with a wedding. We're both unconsciously\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:18.000\ngoing like, we're gonna marry each other, better get used to this!\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:22.000\nJust continue your...\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:26.000\nDon't act like it's\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:30.000\nmy fault that music doesn't match what's going on.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:34.000\nShe placed random...\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:38.000\nYou were being Southern.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:42.000\nNo, I was not being Southern.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:46.000\nBut we also, I don't know,\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:50.000\nI guess we're just all little people.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:54.000\nWhen you get married to somebody, all of their faults\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:58.000\nbecome magnified in a way because you're like, oh, I...\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:02.000\nI think it's...\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:06.000\nI also feel like this sounds like somebody who's justifying craziness, but\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:10.000\nI do feel like it's because\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:14.000\nI take marriage incredibly seriously. I have absolutely\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:18.000\nno intention of ever getting divorced if I get married because I feel\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:22.000\nlike my parents' generation was kind of a little fast and loose\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:26.000\nwith the vows. Otherwise, we wouldn't be in the situation we're in\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:30.000\nwhere everyone you know is raised by single parent families.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:34.000\nI also think it's a bad thing to stay in a marriage for your kids\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:38.000\nif that's literally the only reason you're doing it, then fucking divorce\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:44.000\neach other. Your kids will thank you later.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:50.000\nBut I don't want to half-ass this thing.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:54.000\nI don't like doing things twice. I'm very lazy.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:58.000\nSo when I get married, I want to stay married for a really\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:02.000\nlong time. And for that reason, I think it's like, I don't know,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:06.000\nall of a sudden you're coming home and every little\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:10.000\nconversation has this giant weight behind it.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:14.000\nAnd wouldn't you know it, planning a wedding, as you may know,\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:18.000\nseems to involve a couple of activities\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:22.000\nand things. Do you have decisions? Yeah.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:26.000\nIf there's anything wrong with the relationship, the weight will find it.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:30.000\nI found an out where we're going to couples therapy and I'm like, Aaron\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:34.000\nis just doing everything with the wedding. I'm cheating.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:38.000\nI just feel like I'm cheating. Aaron's doing everything with the wedding.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:42.000\nI tell her that I'm the first groom that's ever planned 50%\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:46.000\nof the wedding, but I'm lying too. It's maybe 15%.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:50.000\nYeah, I don't know. I don't care about weddings.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:54.000\nI think they're dumb. I think ours will be good then.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:58.000\nAlright, well let's thank Tom Gray for coming up and talking to us about\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:02.000\nI hope that you guys\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:06.000\nI hope the next time we talk to you\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:10.000\nmaybe we'll talk to, the next time we talk to them\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:14.000\nthey'll have a little gray baby. Oh no, you're shaking your head.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:18.000\nThey're too good. They're not going to bring a child into this\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:22.000\nworld. I'm just fixated on the\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:26.000\nwords gray baby together.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:30.000\nHe shook his head in a way that meant to me either like\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:34.000\nwhat's that? Five years. Oh, you're just going to wait five years?\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:38.000\nOh, okay. The way he shook his\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:42.000\nand then he said seven. The way he shook his head made me think you guys were about to have your first\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:46.000\nbiggest fight tonight. I would be like\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:50.000\nwe'll see you have a baby anyway. Nope, and then he sat down and I was like oh man, we finally found a way\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:54.000\nto make them like us. They're going to fight hard tonight.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:58.000\nWhy did you shake your head so hard? Are you excited about the wedding?\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:02.000\nI'm very excited about the wedding. Alright, cool.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:06.000\nThat is a\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:10.000\ngood segue to\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:14.000\nMcGathey Game Corner.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:18.000\nI put together\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:22.000\na theme song for Game Corner on the drive from Austin\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:26.000\nto Houston. So here goes.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:30.000\nWhat do we get\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:34.000\ngameplay?\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:38.000\nWhat do we get\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:42.000\nto do?\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:46.000\nWhat do we get to do?\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:50.000\nWhat do we get to do?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:54.000\nMcGathey Game Corner.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:58.000\nWas that\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:02.000\na lot of that in the song? Were those farts?\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:06.000\nThose were farts. Those were farts by our very own\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:10.000\nDustin Marshall, everybody.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:14.000\nThose were the farts\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:18.000\nthat I was trying to do in the car. I was trying to record farts into the\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:22.000\nlaptop and Dan was like oh come on, let me and took the laptop\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:26.000\nand his farts were so gross. I feel like your feelings were a little hurt because I was like your farts\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:30.000\nare so disgusting. What are they supposed to be?\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:34.000\nAnd what were those by the way? It was like wicked game.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:38.000\nIt didn't sound like farts.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:42.000\nSo we're going to play a game called Who Are You Marrying?\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:50.000\nAnd for this game, I did a little work\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:54.000\nbefore the show. I reached out on Twitter. I wanted to\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:58.000\nfind a fellow redhead female.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:02.000\nSo can I please bring to the stage Caroline? Caroline!\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:06.000\nCaroline, come on down!\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:10.000\nYou want to see if I can literally tell the difference between you and\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:14.000\njust visually?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:18.000\nYou just want to test my face blindness? I know she's the one sitting in the chair.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:22.000\nThank you Caroline. If you wouldn't mind sitting in the chair.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:26.000\nThank you so much.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:30.000\nSo Caroline and I answered the same set of questions\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:34.000\nand what I'm going to do is I'm going to present the question\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:38.000\nand I'll give two answers and you'll have to choose which one is\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:42.000\nmy answer. But we need someone to play against you.\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:46.000\nAnd for funsies, is there any man out here\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:50.000\nwho thinks they know me pretty well?\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:54.000\nWho could compete with Dan at knowing questions?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:58.000\nYeah? Okay, I saw your hand first.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:02.000\nCome on down there. You just maximized the chance that this podcast recording will be used\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:06.000\nin a future criminal trial.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:10.000\nAndrew everybody! Welcome Andrew!\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:14.000\nIs there any man in the audience who thinks they know more about me than my fiancé?\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:18.000\nAll right.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:22.000\nOkay, so...\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:26.000\nI didn't catch your name, what was it? Andrew. This is Andrew.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:30.000\nI'm the teacher. No matter what happens, you're\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:34.000\nnot calling off the wedding at this point. I say\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:38.000\nlet's be organic about this and just see.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:42.000\nAnd I'm divorced so I'm good with marriage. I don't want that anymore.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:46.000\nYou're safe. Just in case I know more.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:50.000\nI'm so sorry. Oh, here we go. Got a pen.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:54.000\nCaroline, if you could position yourself in a\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:58.000\nway where Dan can look at both of us a little bit.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:02.000\nThat's a weird way to phrase that.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:06.000\nThis is the way we're going to play.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:10.000\nWe're going to play it.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:14.000\nIf you answer correctly, you'll hear this.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:18.000\nAnd if you answer incorrectly, you'll hear this.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:22.000\nYou heard these noises already? We're familiar with them. We like them. Like they're a family.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:26.000\nAll right, here we go.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:30.000\nHere's the first question.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:34.000\nMy favorite meal of all time is\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:38.000\nA. Sun-dried tomato bagel with veggie cream cheese topped with tomatoes\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:42.000\nor B. Buffalo mac and cheese with a crisp\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:46.000\nbeer and a side of spicy pickles or bourbon.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:50.000\nI'll go with the\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:54.000\nSun-dried bagel affair. Andrew?\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:58.000\nI'm going to go with B. Mine was Sun-dried\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:02.000\nbagel. Good job, Dan.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:06.000\nCaroline, can you grab that microphone?\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:10.000\nCaroline, how are you doing? Hi, I'm excellent. How are you doing?\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:14.000\nI'm doing great. What do you do, Caroline?\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:18.000\nI am a leasing consultant in property management.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:22.000\nIt's as interesting as it sounds.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:26.000\nHere we go.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:30.000\nCaroline and her husband were the first in line.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:34.000\nThey came from Bat Rouge, which I always thought was a fictional place.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:38.000\nReally? I thought that C.S. Lewis made up of Bat Rouge.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:42.000\nIt's funny, he did actually. It was named after the fact.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:46.000\nIt's sort of like Hobbit Town or whatever over in New Zealand.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:50.000\nBat Rouge, I guarantee.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:54.000\nThe big easy.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:58.000\nI know, but Bat Rouge is sometimes referred to as the slightly smaller easy.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:02.000\nHere we go.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.000\nHere we go. Question number two.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:10.000\nMy childhood best friend and I used to play a game called\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:14.000\nA, the Dolly Parton game.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:18.000\nWe would wear our mother's sweaters, stuff them with water balloons to make boobs,\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:22.000\nand then we would take turns motorboating each other.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:26.000\nOr B, we would basically make up ongoing soap opera-like stories\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:30.000\nand a lot of those stories focused on relationships and romantic entanglements.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:34.000\nAnd Sassy Kids Sidekicks, who are basically us.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:38.000\nI think it has to be B, because I know A was mine and probably Dan's as well.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nDan, which one is me?\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:46.000\nI think you're the Dolly Parton.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:50.000\nThat is correct. Andrew, it's not looking good for you.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:54.000\nI'm not doing so well.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:58.000\nBut you have to understand that I'm playing a different game. If I get one of these wrong.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:02.000\nYou're fucked. It's two years of suffering.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:06.000\nCan I get another little bit of tequila? Thank you.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:10.000\nAlright. I don't know if you guys feel this way on the stage,\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:14.000\nand this is not cool of me to really talk about the lighting, but the way the\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:18.000\nlighting is, I feel like I'm hiding in a closet with one bulb swinging back and forth.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:22.000\nIt's mildly terrifying up here.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:26.000\nI don't know how you guys...\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:30.000\nAt this stage, I think it's our job to suck it up.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:34.000\nYou are totally right. For them.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:38.000\nThe lights being here to illuminate us so that they can see us.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:42.000\nNo, I know. I'm less complaining about the light. I feel self-conscious because I feel kind of like weird.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:46.000\nYou're doing a great job, Erin.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:50.000\nThank you, Andrew. Jeff who?\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:54.000\nSorry? Jeff who?\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:58.000\nNext question.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:02.000\nDan, you get to answer this first. My mother's maiden name is\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:06.000\nA. Hartley B. Dunkel.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:10.000\nYou better know this.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:14.000\nA. Hartley B. Dunkel.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:18.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:22.000\nMy mother is dead.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:26.000\nI get...\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:30.000\nI mean, it doesn't even matter at this point if I get it right,\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:34.000\nbecause I already revealed that I...\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:38.000\ndon't know. So it's a matter of\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:42.000\nwhether I guess right, and I don't know. That would be kind of an empty victory.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:46.000\nBecause I could flip a coin. I think it's Dunkel.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:50.000\nAlright, Andrew? Yeah, I'm going to agree with Dan. It is Dunkel.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:54.000\nIt is Dunkel.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:58.000\nAlright, Dan has three points. Andrew has one point. Andrew, you get to go\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:02.000\nfirst in this round. Next question. When I was a kid, I was afraid that\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:06.000\nA, my dead grandfather could see everything I could see,\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:10.000\nso I'd close my eyes when I got out of the bathtub so he couldn't see me naked.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:14.000\nOr B, I was afraid that I\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:18.000\nwould be separated from my family and would wander the streets forever, or that members of my\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:22.000\nfamily would be lost forever. Sometimes Mnucho was involved.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:26.000\nI'm going to guess B.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:30.000\nAlright, Dan? I think...\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:34.000\nOh, shit. I think that... I don't remember you\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:38.000\never talking about either of these things, so I'm trying to figure out which one sounds\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:42.000\nmore like you.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:46.000\nI think that because you're inherently narcissistic, the answer\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:50.000\nis the non-empathy-related one,\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:54.000\nand the grandfather one involves thinking about other people,\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:58.000\nso I think that it's B.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:02.000\nNo, I was afraid that Pinkney McGathey could see through my eyes,\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:06.000\nand so I would close my eyes when I was using the bathroom\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:10.000\nor getting out of the bathtub or changing my clothes.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:14.000\nAlright, well maybe you became narcissistic later in life.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:18.000\nHappy from Houston and worked for NASA. Fun fact.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:22.000\nAnd who developed a little-known technology for NASA,\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:26.000\nin which you could see through your living grandchild's eyes.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:30.000\nIt was actually a legitimate fear.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:34.000\nAlright, next question. My first CD was\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:38.000\nA, they might be Giants, Flood,\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:42.000\nor B, Glenn Miller Orchestra,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:46.000\nI believe Dan is going first.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:50.000\nI think your first CD was\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:54.000\nyour first CD that you bought with your money?\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:58.000\nNo, just the first CD in your possession.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:02.000\nAh-ha, so Glenn Miller.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:06.000\nAndrew? Yeah, Glenn Miller, definitely.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:10.000\nThat is correct!\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:14.000\nCaroline is much cooler than me!\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:18.000\nThat was her second CD. Oh, that was your second CD?\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:22.000\nOh, really? You're talking to the microphone. Sorry.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:26.000\nThat was her second CD. That's interesting.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:30.000\nMe and the same girl that used to play the Dolly Parton game would play this game called M&M\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:34.000\nwhere we would listen to the dances and pretend we got married, and then would\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:38.000\ntake our hands and put them over our mouths and pretend to make out, and then we would have a baby.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:42.000\nHuh! Why don't more...\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:46.000\nAre there any gay men in the audience that are...\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:50.000\nNo? That's a little remarkable.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:54.000\nBecause I'm wondering if... Every girl I've ever talked to,\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:58.000\nthey're developmental years, it's like this incredible...\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:02.000\nDid you not do anything like that? I've always assumed that men, boys kind of\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:06.000\ndid similar things. I had a best friend, I had a lot...\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:10.000\nNo, guys have... We don't do that. But you guys like pee together and stuff?\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:14.000\nWe pee together and we show each other our wieners.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:18.000\nYeah, you'd like that trough in elementary school, and one guy stands on the end and you try to shoot it\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:22.000\nacross and hit the guy standing over there. With your pee?\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:26.000\nWith your dick if you're blessed.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nI mean, you'll hear the craziest shit. People will go, oh, summer camp,\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:34.000\nwe would do this, we would all jerk off in a bucket.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:38.000\nIt gets a little weird, but it's all kind of penis based\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:42.000\nand the penis is a lightsaber and we would...\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:46.000\nBut girls, they just like, oh, almost\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:50.000\neveryone I've ever talked to in their early years, there's these\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:54.000\nstories where they just like, oh, this is how you socialize, you go through this stage\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:58.000\nwhere with another girl, you practice being\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:02.000\nboys and girls together. Like, well, I was Fonzie.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:06.000\nI don't think it's every girl. I know for me it felt like...\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:10.000\nNo, I don't want anyone listening to feel weird if it didn't happen.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:14.000\nFor me and my friend, it really felt like an extension of playing house,\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:18.000\nwhich girls do like to play. We like to play a lot of house.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:22.000\nBut with each other,\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:26.000\nwhen I was a kid, when I was like\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:30.000\n9 or 10, I think, me and my best friend\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:34.000\nwe started playing\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:38.000\npizza boy.\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:42.000\nIf it had an accurate title, it would have been called pillow humping.\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:46.000\nBecause the game was\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:50.000\nhe and I would pretend to be pizza delivery guys.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:54.000\nWe would ring the doorbell of my home\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:58.000\nand pretend that girls answered.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:02.000\nWe would walk into a living room, which we would pretend had two\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:06.000\ninvisible girls in it, and we were delivering pizza.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:10.000\nAnd then we would make small talk, and we would sit down\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:14.000\neach with one of these large couch pillows.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:18.000\nSo we're 10 years old, so there's like these 70 sofa pillows that are like\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:22.000\nas big as us. And we would put our arms around them\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:26.000\nand practice talking to them and be like, yeah, so what's your name?\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:30.000\nAnd he's doing the same thing in the same room.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:34.000\nWe're talking to pillows. And then we would start making out with the pillows.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:38.000\nAnd then me and my friend, I know it's the same thing\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:42.000\nexcept the only thing different is that men have this kind of inherent\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:46.000\nhomophobia where we don't practice on each other.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:50.000\nI think there's like a really specific line there, and I don't know if it's nature or nurture that\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:54.000\ndraws that line. I'm sure it's nurture because we're all human.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:58.000\nBut it's just so funny when I really think about it.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:02.000\nBecause when I hear that from girls, I'm like, oh, yeah, we would come over and she'd be Pinky Tuscadero, and I'd be Fonzie.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:06.000\nAnd then we'd go, oh, so you guys were just making out, but it was like a game.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:10.000\nBut now I'm really thinking about it. Oh, yeah, me and my 10-year-old friend\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:14.000\nhumping pillows next to each other, high-fiving\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:18.000\nlike celebrating how straight and awesome we are.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:22.000\nHumping pillows. And then we would go climb a tree\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:26.000\nand talk about, I actually remember...\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:30.000\nDid you have a name? Definitely, definitely.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:34.000\nThat was part of the whole thing. They had names like, oh, mine's Stacy and mine's Ashley.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:38.000\nI remember going and climbing a tree with my best friend\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:42.000\nand I have an emotional memory,\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:46.000\na deep emotional bookmark of climbing\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:50.000\na tree with my friend after doing one of these sessions.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:54.000\nAnd sitting in the bow\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:58.000\nof a willow tree in Milwaukee in the summer breeze\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:02.000\nand...\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:06.000\nThat's not commentary.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:10.000\nWell, it's not anything. It's a random\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:14.000\nsound. And me going\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:18.000\nlike, this is a lull in the conversation\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:22.000\nand I go, yeah, I'm thinking about\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:26.000\nproposing to Stacy.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:30.000\nAnd just silence from my friend.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:34.000\nAnd I remember just like, I don't think we ever did it again after that.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:38.000\nBecause I think that's the line that got drawn between the people that\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:42.000\nend up at Renfaires and the people that end up, you know, at Verizon.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:46.000\nI think that I was like, yeah,\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:50.000\nI will, yes, what is the difference between any of this?\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:54.000\nThis is a real person. I'm going to...\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:58.000\nIt's the same. Little girls aren't socialized to not touch each other.\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:02.000\nIt doesn't make you gay, bro.\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:06.000\nWhen we were doing it,\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:10.000\nwhen we were play acting these things, it wasn't ever romantic. There was never a moment\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:14.000\nwhere it even occurred to us, oh, girls, do\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:18.000\nthis together. This could be a sexual thing. If someone was to walk in,\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:22.000\nit would look like it would, you know.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:26.000\nWe also took turns. We did that. We played out this long\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:30.000\nstory about these two young women. Because we always talked about\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:34.000\nhow we wanted to go to college together and then we would have an apartment.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:38.000\nAnd so we play acted this episodic thing where we were two young, cool women\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:42.000\nin the city and we both had boyfriends. But we had to pretend to be each other's boyfriends.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:46.000\nAnd so whenever I would be like, I want to go to...we got to name\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:50.000\nour boyfriends. My boyfriend's name was David, I think.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:54.000\nOh, no, your name's Dan. Sorry.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:58.000\nI had a moment where I was like, oh!\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:02.000\nI wish I could just play frogs croaking or something\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:06.000\nrandom. Dan, I played the banjo because\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:10.000\nit felt like an outside thing. You're in the tree.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:14.000\nIt's a random sound. It was banjo. It couldn't have been more disparate.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:18.000\nWill you forgive me for playing the banjo? I'll forgive you, but I won't stop shaming you.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:22.000\nI conditioned people. That's what I do.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:26.000\nI punish them when they do things wrong and then they stop.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:30.000\nI'm a behaviorist. I have a question. How old was the pillow humping\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:34.000\nthing? Like, just that. Because I'm a guy, so I had something like that and I'm just...\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:38.000\nWait, what do you mean how old was it? I was like 10 or 11.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:42.000\nSame thing like 10.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:46.000\nI just realized I'm a little bit more normal, hopefully.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:50.000\nBut here's the weird thing about the pillow humping. That memory, with me and\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:54.000\nmy friend, both humping pillows next to each other,\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:58.000\nlooking at each other humping pillows and being like, yeah, it feels good, right, bro?\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:02.000\nAs part of some kind of play-acting thing, like playing house\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:06.000\nand playing the role of men who are doing it to women as pizza delivery\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:10.000\nguys, that... I also don't... I don't think it was\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:14.000\nas sexual... I don't think it was sexual. I think we were pre-puberty\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:18.000\nand we were doing this thing that there was enjoyment, there was social\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:22.000\nlike, endorphins or dopamine or spiking,\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:26.000\nbut there was no arousal because I... and the reason I know that is because\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:30.000\na couple years later, something incredible\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:34.000\nhappened and it was very private and I wouldn't have shared it with\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:38.000\nanybody. And I also wonder if that's nature versus nurture when\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:42.000\na little boy discovers\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:46.000\nphysical, groin area\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:50.000\npleasure, like if it's nurture or nature that the\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:54.000\nlittle boy immediately goes, this is a secret.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:58.000\nI am Howard Hughes. I have invented something that no one else\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:02.000\ncan know about. I am dedicating the next 16 hours a day for the next\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:06.000\n35 years to this, because I was like watching Mork and Mindy\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:10.000\nand... hopefully just Mindy. I was just a\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:14.000\nlatchkey, hopefully, because otherwise gay bro. Right. Who wants to fuck Mork?\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:18.000\nFucking Nan, no, man.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:22.000\nI was like laying on my stomach watching Mork and Mindy, looking at\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:26.000\nPam Dabber, high five, and\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:30.000\nwas like moving my... slowly my pelvis is moving.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:38.000\nMusic\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:42.000\nBut if you were looking at Mork, it would have been okay.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:46.000\nNice.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:50.000\nThat's an amazing meta moment. The guy saying too soon said\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:54.000\nit too soon.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:58.000\nAnd I just remember like moving and moving,\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:02.000\nwatching Pam Dabber and then\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:06.000\nthe movement... there's like a chain reaction, moving, moving, moving.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:10.000\nI'm going to keep moving. I'm going to keep moving. Pam Dabber, keep moving, keep moving.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:14.000\nAnd then the unthinkable,\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:18.000\nthe unexperienced, the most incredible thing that had ever happened to me\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:22.000\nin my life happening, which didn't involve at the time not to get too clinical\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:26.000\ndid not involve any liquid, because my body was\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:30.000\njust getting to that. It was like at that point.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:34.000\nAll it was was just this shudder and like...\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:38.000\nThe last thing on my mind was my friends.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:42.000\nI wanted to... like a sick cat. I wanted to go into a cave\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:46.000\nand just do this by myself forever.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:50.000\nSix times a day.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:54.000\nMy point being that that's when the real shit started.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:58.000\nThat's basically who I am now, is that kid. The kid who was playing\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:02.000\npizza guy and just miming coitus\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:06.000\nnext to his best friend in the living room. It's weird. It's like\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:10.000\nit wasn't... it was sexual pantomime, but it wasn't sexual.\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:14.000\nSo I guess guys and girls not that different.\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:18.000\nIt's just that there is that weird... I think there's a social... is it socialization though?\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:22.000\nThat makes two boys not in those moments\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:26.000\nreach out and or use each other. Like why wouldn't\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:30.000\nwe? And do some boys do that and yeah\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:34.000\nall kinds of questions. I guess you guys aren't the ones to ask.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:38.000\nWe should have a child psychologist come up here maybe.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:42.000\nMaybe it's sort of like okay so\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:46.000\nthere's this whole theory like if you give kids less toys they're more imaginative and creative.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:50.000\nRight? And they like make their own toys and do their own crap.\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:54.000\nWell guys kind of have a prop, if you will, like from early on.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:58.000\nWe don't. So we've got to come up with more shit, right?\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:02.000\nThat's an amazing theory.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:06.000\nBut I also think that all of us are weird because like you guys aren't\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:10.000\nthese girl stories, you're not taking off your pants.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:14.000\nI've been a nanny and I've worked with many\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:18.000\nmany boys who do do the same thing and act out the same stuff\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:22.000\nand are physical with each other. With each other? With other boys?\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:26.000\nKissing each other? Well I mean my friend never kissed. We put our hands over\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:30.000\nour mouths and pretended to kiss. But I've walked in on little boys acting out\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:34.000\nlike prepubescent boys just acting out these\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:38.000\nscenarios in the same way that girls are acting them out. It's like a three year old little girl\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:42.000\ncarrying around a baby doll. She's not actually wanting to have a baby\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:46.000\nat three years old. You walked in on little boys\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:50.000\nand it gets specific so that this pad cast can really switch into high gear.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:54.000\nBut also because I mean it's important distinction. What do you mean?\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:58.000\nYou've walked into them doing what? Because we're drawing a very fine line here.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:02.000\nI humped a pillow next to my friend but girls\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:06.000\nI'm saying like it's a fine distinction.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:10.000\nWhen I was a nanny there was a time when I walked in on\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:14.000\ntwo friends. They would be nine\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:18.000\nyears old acting out a doctor nurse scenario\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:22.000\nwhich on paper would be a very\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:26.000\nsexy thing. Like walked in on a like is this your\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:30.000\nbutt? Oh look at that. And what probably had\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:34.000\nhappened. What was the answer?\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:38.000\nKeep searching. Is this your butt?\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:42.000\nYes\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:46.000\nYes that's my butt.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:50.000\nWe tend to ask that question later in life too.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:54.000\nIf a doctor asked me is this your butt I would definitely\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:58.000\nwalk out and ask for a refund. You should stop\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000\ngoing to a nine year old doctor. If you can't tell me\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nI know it's not your specialization but\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nIn the same way that me and my friend acted out this like apartment scenario\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nI think they had seen like a movie where there's like a sexy nurse\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000\ndoctor situation or something where they were acting it out and trying to\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nfigure it out but it was like\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nit could have been a thing.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nRight because you were saying one kid was naked and the other\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nkid was examining him? I don't remember exactly.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nThey were in some phase of undress. There was something happening and when I\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nopened the door they were definitely ashamed about what was going on but it clearly was\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nreally innocent and they weren't trying to make their bodies feel good\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nor anything. That's kind of interesting isn't it? The book of Genesis and so many origin stories\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nlike self-awareness and where it intersects with\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nprimal childhood sexual awareness, the Freudian impulse\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nand all this stuff where it's all about this idea that\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nwe were born innocent but we\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nhave some kind of our awareness of ourselves and who we are\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nis simultaneous with this possibility\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nof punishment, the shame.\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nThe idea that we mythologize like\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nwe have these gods that are like parents that they do the\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nexact same thing. They come into a bedroom and they catch us being people\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nand they say and then we immediately not before\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nthat person's eyeballs touch us but\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nbefore that we're innocent. We're playing\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000\ndoctor. We're just having fun. We're following our bliss\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nand then it's this moment when these adult eyeballs\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nsee us and even before the adult reacts we go\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000\noh I'm a horrible creature. What am I doing?\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nThis must look terrible to you. I can't explain this. This isn't\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nwhat it looks like. I think that's really fascinating because\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nhumans are inherently infantile as primates.\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nWe retain infantile characteristics into adulthood which is why we survived\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nand so we're essentially like puppies or kittens or baby chimps\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nlike our whole lives and we have these mythologies\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nbecause we're neurotic and we have these mythologies\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nwhere we have these parents from the clouds that walk into our bedrooms and go\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nwhat are you doing? And we all tell each other at 40 years\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nold we go like well you know we're pieces of shit. What are you doing?\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nWell we should pass a law against this and of course it's all behind\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nus like these little kids playing doctor. It's like oh we all know\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nour little wieners and our little cracks or filthy\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nlittle pieces of shit like horrible things that exude toxicity\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nand that touching them makes us bad people in one way or another and that basically underneath\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nour clothes we're terrible gross slimy little organisms\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nthat are horrible for thinking about ourselves and each other.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nWe all agree on that right? So now let's get down to this Senate hearing.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nWe've got neck ties on and we're talking about balancing budgets\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nand how are you going to do this and protect each other from that but it's like we're just little babies\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nthat just want to look at each other's little no-nos.\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nWe've got four points and Andrew has two.\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nAlright I believe this is...\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nLike this whole time the whole audience was like fuck where are they going to get back to that game?\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nJesus Christ it's like the Dukes of Hazard just jumped over the ramp.\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nHow are they going to land?\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nAlright that was my joke. Alright so we're going to go\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nfrom now on I'm just going to ask each of you individual questions.\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nI'm not going to have each of you answer the question.\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nSo Dan this is your question. Here we go.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nMy ultimate dream vacation would be going on a cattle drive with my closest\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nfriends where we heard cattle on horseback and sit around a campfire\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nevery night and share secrets or\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nI would really love to just randomly explore different\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000\ncountries on a whim. Maybe I'd start with Morocco.\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nYou're the cattle drive.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nYay!\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nAlright.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nHere we go. The applause has become\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nlike it's just like water dripping out of a bad\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nshower head.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nOkay. Here we go.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nNext question. My favorite color is a yellow\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nall sunshine all of the time or B red more specifically\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nin orangish red like persimmon. The red the orangish red.\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nYellow. That is correct Andrew.\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nAndrew? Andrew's correct? Yeah.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nOh whoops. So that was for me.\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nYeah it is persimmon. Alright. Next question.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nMy least favorite mode of transportation is\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000\na driving. I love my car but other cars scare me\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nor B a cruise ship. This is Dan's\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nquestion. Cruise ship.\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nThat is correct.\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nGood job. Alright. Andrew\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nIf I was reincarnated as a building\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nI would be A\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000\na brown brick pottery studio with cherry wood floors and stained glass windows\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nor B an\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000\namazing 100 year old observatory on a hilltop.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nWell you put amazing in the second one so I would have to think\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nit would be the one that's amazing. Nope\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nCaroline is amazing.\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nGood job. Alright.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nSo here we're at\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000\n5 points and 5 points\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nI\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nloved the conversation about the kids psychology. I thought that was great.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nThere's 30 questions left.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nI want to do one more question\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nabout how I choose to die if I got to choose\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nhow I died. And this is for both of you.\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nA bravely pilot a spaceship filled with\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nevil people into the sun. They celebrate\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nthat every day, that every year, they celebrate that day\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nevery year with festive cakes and amazing parties and all of my favorite music\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nOh and I pilot that spaceship into the sun when I'm ancient and ready to go\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nanyway. Or B, I get drunk on Prosecco and Aperol\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nand fall asleep in a vat of marshmallow fluff. When I sleep\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nwhile I sleep I sink deeper into the fluff and eventually suffocate\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nin my sleep.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nI think you want to drive evil people into the sun and\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nbe celebrated with cake. Yeah, that's the way to go.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nNo, I want to get drunk and pass out.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nI kind of admire the other person\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nbut I'm glad we learn something every day. That's good.\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nThank you, that was the game.\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nYay!\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nYay!\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nI'm having an out of body\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nexperience. She's leaving. Caroline everybody.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nThank you Caroline, thank you Andrew.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nAlright. You guys were awesome. Let's bring Spencer to the stage!\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nSpencer, get up here!\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nOh god!\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nOh shit!\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nOh fuck!\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nLeaping like a gazelle to the stage.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nWe did it! We did it!\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nAnd we're doing it! You know what I hate you guys?\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nI hate when I cough like this and people\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nbless me like I'm sneezing. It's the worst fucking thing\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000\non the planet. I can't elaborate how much I hated.\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nIt doesn't make sense, it's someone being thoughtful about me\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nand it pisses me off.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nBecause you're worried that because your cough is being misinterpreted as a sneeze\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nthat maybe there's something medically wrong with you? No, worry has literally nothing to do with it.\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nWell what pisses you off about it? They're wrong.\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nI'm not sneezing. You fucking idiot.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nBut you strike me as a person who probably already has fundamental problems\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nwith the whole sneezing bless you gazuntite thing because that's not logical at all.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nSo I'd rather no one said anything. And now when you're doing it in the wrong situation\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nwhat the fuck man?\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nIt's not okay, it's terrible. Did that just happen\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nright before you came on stage? No, it happens every fucking day of my life.\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nThere's a poetic irony there because it's like if you sneeze and someone\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nsays bless you, what's your reaction? Do you think fuck you?\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nNow I have to respond? Thank you for saying something at me that I didn't ask\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nfuck off. It's like now I have to play a politician\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nand be like oh yes, that's what you're supposed to do. Good job\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nIan. I once sneezed in my 20s. I sneezed\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nand my girlfriend's sister said\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nbless you. You were like never again. No, no, no.\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nWe went about our business and then five seconds later she went, you're\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nwelcome. And I was like wait a minute, what?\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nWhat kind of endless chain of fucking rules\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nare we engaged in? It's very hard for her to say bless you.\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nShe wanted, yeah, it's like I didn't know those were one of the rules.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nYou know what else is weird and uncomfortable? When you check into a hotel\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nand you go into the bathroom to take a nice, you know, hotel dump\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nand you spy something on the door\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nthat is a small stain. Now I mean I don't need a clean hotel\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nroom, trust me. It could be as stained as possible. But this stain\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nwas right out about waist level. Like if one was standing\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nup in front of the toilet facing the door, perhaps a\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nmale. I'm saying it was semen. There was semen\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000\non the door of my hotel room. Not in Houston. You guys are great. In Austin this\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nhappened. But no one's ever going to\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nmistake your stains for Austin stains.\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nI may sometimes call you the Rock City, but if I'm looking\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nat a cum stain, I know I'm in Austin.\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nYeah, I mean I don't really have anything we're going to go with that because\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nI just let it slide. I want to be clear on this though, because you're in your bathroom\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nyou're saying at waist height, if you're facing the door\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nare you saying someone stood up from the toilet and jerked off at the door?\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nYeah, to shoot onto the door. Why would anyone ever do that? Why would anyone\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000\ninvite themselves over to Dustin Marshall's house as a friend\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nand do that to his closet door? Because that's\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nsomething that apparently people do. It's not cool, but it happens. Wait, are you saying that people\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000\ncome on Dustin's door? Yeah, every day. I make a killing.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nWait, what? I charge people.\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nDustin is shrugging like you're making all of this up.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nWell, I am. I don't charge people to come on his closet door. Dustin,\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000\ncan you come over for a second? Yes. Dustin Marshall everybody.\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nThis involves come\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nand also you help us. Dustin Marshall.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nHi.\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000\nWe've turned into Howard Stern now because you're like Baba Booey. I am the Baba Booey. I want to be Fred\n\n01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nbut I'm Baba Booey. So Dustin, your friends come over and instead\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nof bringing a bottle of wine, they come on your closet door.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nSo Spencer told me this story. It was kind of amazing that first you were in a hotel room\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nand you switched. Yeah, because it was a non-smoking room\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nthat smelled like cigarettes and I thought that if I stayed, they'd charge me 500 bucks.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nAnd so you asked to go to a different room and then upon the\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nroom you went in, you noticed just a jizz stain on the back of the door. And I should clarify, it wasn't\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000\njust a stain. It was like the desiccated crust.\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nAll that was remaining after all fluids have evaporated\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nout of it, just like a cobweb. Something\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nyou recognized has come. Oh no, I mean I had to taste it before I was\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nsure. That's when I knew.\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nWait, so okay. Alright, so\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nhe told me this story and I used to be in a band when I was like 15 and\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nall the guys in my band were a little bit older than me and we never hung out at my house. So they're like,\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nwhy don't we hang out at your house? And I was like, okay, so they came over and I was like\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nlooking a frozen pizza upstairs. For them. For them. Because you're such a good host. I checked\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nmy America online, I was kind of taking my time and they were all downstairs like\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nhanging out and then I went downstairs, they ate the pizza\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nand they were all like later and they all coasted. That means left.\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nThey're left. For those of you who aren't ninja\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nturtles. Or\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nbackground actors in a\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nhoneycomb commercial, they left.\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nAlright, they left.\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nSorry, let me clarify. If you haven't recently been\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nrollerblading in a sunny delight commercial,\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nwhat happened is they left. They left the premises.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nBut they ate the pizza and then they left\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nand then my phone rang at my house and I answered it\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nand they were just all on speakerphone laughing and they were like\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nlook in your closet. I had this weird like walking closet and then\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000\non the back of the door, I was upstairs for maybe 15 minutes. There's three guys.\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nThey took turns jacking off in my closet and then\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nejaculating on the back of my door. So there was\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nvisibly through all this different semen on the back of my door.\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nAll these different semen. No, no. It was all these different\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nthings. It wasn't like it was the top.\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nThis is why little boys need to pretend this stuff when they're kids.\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nHow is it the first time I'm on this show? This is what it is.\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nIs there more to the story? Because if you're done with that story\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000\nI need you to tell a different story. Tell us about in New York with the cops.\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nNo, wait, come on, hold on.\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000\nThe cops jizzed on his closet. Everyone just heard this story about three guys\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nthat came over to your house and came on your door. They were my best friends and then\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nthey were like Schrabbing me in the worst way.\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nThey literally came into his house. They rapidly like unwocked out of the\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000\nroom. You guys like Velveeta, I'll go get some slices. Don't coast.\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nAnd you left. Don't coast.\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nAnd they all must have exchanged a look like are you thinking\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nwhat I'm thinking? No. And none of them went, what?\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nThere was not one among them that was like, guys, guys, guys.\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000\nWhat have we become? I feel like they must have come\n\n01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nto his house with the underdog. They had to have a meeting. It was pre-planned.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nIt was pre-planned. Go over to the commercial's house.\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000\nWhen you said come to his house, I thought you meant they came to the idea of Dustin's\n\n01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nhouse while they're jerking off in order to come.\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nWell, it was a walk-in closet. I mean, come on.\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nThe stone, the cement.\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nLook at this. The island or the kitchen.\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nGot the through, the feng shui.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nBut it was non-sexual. It was just aggressive.\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nIt was vandalism. It was vandalism in the worst way.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nBut at some point it had to be sexual for them. They had to come thinking about something.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nNot when you think they must have been coming, thinking about was each other.\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nHow great friends they were. Yeah, it's a little\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nbromophobic. I mean, at that age, you just poke your dick and it starts\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nspurtin'. I mean, you don't have to think about sexual things.\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nYou're 15. And knowing is half the battle.\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nIf you're listening,\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000\njust poke it and it'll do the rest.\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nI am aware of that, but I would always still, I had to think about\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nlike Shira or, you know, Penny\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nfrom Inspector Gadget. I was her age.\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nSo it was okay.\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nIt was always something I was thinking about while I was\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000\njust wanting your friends are like, let's do it.\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nThey must have had some phrase for it too. They had to have shorthand.\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nLet's cream pie his closet, bro.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nThis must have been like the seventh person they've done this to. Let's narnia dust it.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nYeah, it was specifically.\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nThat's it. God. Let's narnia junk.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nI'm done.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nYou guys don't know. Our entire travel is\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nmade up of razzing me. I was going to say\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nDan and I love Dan and I love making fun of Dustin.\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nMaybe they just were like us and they just had so much joy.\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nI would never come on anything that Dustin, anyone\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000\never owned. I would never do that as a way of asserting my\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000\nego. I would never go, hey, I came on something. What I would\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000\ndo is, you know, it came on everything in my home.\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nThe same guy, we would hang out at his house all the time\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nand then he had a couch and then he had cable TV\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nso he could like order movies and stuff. So there was an area of his couch\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nthat was like three feet in diameter that was just like brown and black and then\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nwe were like, what's wrong with your carpet? He's like, oh, that's where I jerk off.\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nHe would lean against his couch with his arm up and then he would come all over his floor\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nfor years and it was just a diameter.\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nHe never cleaned it up. So this is the person we're talking about.\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nDude, I'm from Wisconsin. I feel like you grew up in the\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000\none character in Grand Theft Auto 5, the guy from the\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nInland Empire. Like, what's that guy? Like, yeah.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nThat sounds like, I mean, here's the\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000\ntruth. As a teenage boy, like\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nI came a lot and I did\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nit.\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nI do think that teenage boys, like\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nI think you think that you're the only one coming that\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nmuch and I do think you license yourself to be like, well, this is my...\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000\nWe do all kinds of weird stuff because nobody's telling us. There is no\n\n01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nclass where the gym teacher says, guys, you're going to come everywhere\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000\nall the time. Use a Kleenex. What would that class be called?\n\n01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nSex Ed, but it's not. It's always your gym teacher\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000\ngoing, hey, you're going to go through some changes. My nipples got hard.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000\nFuck off. Here's a film from the 60s.\n\n01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nIt's called Little Boy, Little Man.\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000\nAnd it would just be like a diagram of your balls filling\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nup with com and you'd be like, yeah, no shit Sherlock. I know.\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nAnd then you'd go home and deal with it. I dealt with it\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nagainst the door of my bedroom. It was supposed to be like\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000\npunk rock. We're in a punk rock band, so it was supposed to be\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nlike a punk rock thing, I guess, but they were gross.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nI don't hang out with any of them anymore. I hang out with you guys. They jizzed on everyone's\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000\ncloset doors. It became a huge thing for a while.\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nWe got to the bottom. Your friends were\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nfull of com and they felt like it was a way to express themselves.\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nI want to hear the New York City thing though. Which one?\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nWith the cops. The cop in my car?\n\n01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000\nOh, I was in New York City.\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nCan I just play a very appropriate music bed very low underneath the story?\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nShe doesn't have a great record for this.\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nIt may just be like a flight of the bumblebee.\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nThat'd be good. Or maybe it will be great\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nand Dan will look at me and be like teammate?\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nI will. Definitely. I will be very excited.\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nYou have to control the volume though.\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nOkay, so I was in New York for Harmontown and then\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nI kind of got dropped off and I was kind of left to my own device and I was there for like a day and a half.\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nAnd then I was like, oh man, everybody in New York is really\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000\ncool and collected and stylish and nice. Like in LA\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nI just hear people bitching out loud and yelling at people all the time.\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000\nAnd then I got an Uber and I was going to a bar\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nand then, wait, what is this? Breaking Bad. Oh, cool.\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nAnd then I was going to a bar and my Uber driver, I was in an\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nSUV and we were stuck in traffic and then he wanted to take a right turn\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nand there was a New York City cop just standing in the middle of it.\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nAnd my Uber driver was like, yo, he's like, this guy lives right here, can I just go?\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nFuck you. The cop is. The cop starts into the windows down and he's like, this guy lives right here\n\n01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nand he's like, fuck you, show me your license. Show me your license. You live here and he was\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nin the car grabbing at me. He was like, show me your license. Show me your\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nlicense. Show me your fucking license. And then it was like, I just sat there\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nfrozen and I was like not showing my license. And then the Uber driver\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000\ndrove away and he goes, I'm so sick of this. The NYPD\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nwhenever they're doing something crooked they just shut down the street. Whenever there's something they don't want you to see\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nthey'll just shut down streets. That's the story I told Spencer.\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nI think it's an amazing story that needed to be podcast.\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nOkay. But, and then like next 24\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nhours I was hanging out with a Harmontown fan and there was a\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nhomeless guy on the bench and he was like calling her a cunt and a whore and stuff. So I was like, oh,\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nokay, I got a dose of the New York City thing. You were saying\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nwhere's the cop when you need him? But yeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nSpencer is, all right, why do you use the C word for this lovely lady?\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nSpencer is, you know, very active in the\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nawareness of police brutality. Spencer hates cops.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nNo, we all did. I thought I did. Spencer. I think I hate\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000\ncops less than I portray to be honest. I just, their crimes need\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nto be publicized. Yeah, I think that\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nprobably you and I would both agree that there's probably, I don't know, there's a good chance\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nif there's 200 people in the theater, one of them might be a cop. And he's probably a good\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000\ncop by the numbers. Might be a really great guy. I might like hang out and\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000\ntalk and be a human being and actually be a wonderful person. I\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nbet like cops by default do wonderful things all the time. Yeah, one of my best friends\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nis a cop.\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nBut there, I mean, I think that the general\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nway in which we approach the policing of humanity\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nis flawed. Yeah, it could be better. And it is expressed in individual\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nmoments through a random person who has been given either too\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nmuch or too little power in some situation and is expressing his grief\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nwith that in a really inappropriate way. The\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nsystem is broken, definitely. I personally don't like\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nthe idea that insurance is somehow involved in\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nlaw. I have a big problem with the incredibly intricate\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nweird braiding of capitalism and government. I think it's\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nweird that we have these papers called insurance in our glove\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nboxes. And if you don't have them, you're not allowed to drive and a guy with a gun\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000\ncould pull you over and tap on your window and ask to see proof\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nthat you're sponsored by a corporation to drive in case you collide\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nwith another corporate sponsored individual. And I don't like the fact that\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nwhen we have a problem with this stuff, everyone defaults to these human\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nissues and says, well, have you ever been hit by a person that doesn't\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nhave insurance? Because it really sucks. My brother's spine got all fucked up\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nand the other driver didn't have insurance. And it's fucked up. Like, no, that's\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nnot proof that we need to exist in a flawed system. That's just you saying\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nit sucks that a system sucks. And that united\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nflight shit when you go, oh, yeah, everyone\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000\noverbooks their flights because they're all fucked up. And then people are tweeting at me like, oh,\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nall airlines overbook their flights because of no shows.\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nWe criminalize the human population. We constantly\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nlook at each other as the problem. How could we be the problem?\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nWe're the fucking end and beginning of it all. We invented\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nsystems so that we could be who we are. How could we ever be the problem? Why are we\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nconstantly looking at each other and saying, hey, yeah, you know why they have to do\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nthat? Because some people come on your door.\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nYou know, it's for door comers. They have to do that. It's like\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nif a hotel, if we went into a hotel and there was like, you couldn't get into the\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nbathroom without unzipping a zipper or calling\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nfor permission to go pee, you might as well live in it. And it's like,\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000\noh, why do we have to do that? And they go, you know about door comers?\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nSpencer had somebody come on his door. No, we don't live in that.\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nSpencer had to go into a bathroom and he had to look at come on his bathroom door and it's like, oh,\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nit's something that happened to him. Anyone can\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000\npretend, anyone can bring up some weird scenario. It's like, oh no, humans are the\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000\ncriminals. Humans are the bad people. Humans are the things you need to defend against.\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nAre you kidding me? Systems are the things you need to defend against. Those things will fuck you\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nover. Those things aren't human, therefore cannot fail. They will only\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nget better at being systems. People are only good\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nat being people. They will only ever get weaker and weaker as their systems get more and\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nmore successful. You have to guard against systems. You have to be skeptical of them.\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nYou have to look at politicians and say, you're probably full of shit. I don't\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000\ncare how much you impressed me. You're always probably full of shit.\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nIf you represent anything, you must be full of shit. I will assume\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nthat first and you can impress me later. And yet we don't do\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nthat in our comment sections and all this stuff. We always blame each other.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nWe're always so angry at each other for being poor and being fallible\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nand being human. We get so mad. We go like, you know these fuck faces and fucking\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nassholes and we're talking about our neighbors. We're talking about each other.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nIt drives me nuts. It makes me want to punch you all in the face because you're all assholes.\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nWell, I think you're taught\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nto hate your neighbor. Your neighbor makes too much noise. You call the cops. Your neighbor's\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000\ntree grows over your yard. You call the cops. And by the way, the cops never show up. The tree\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nsituation never gets rectified. But you get conditioned that that's what you're supposed to do. You're\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nsupposed to tell on your neighbor to the teacher. You're not supposed to go work it out with them.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nYou're supposed to call this number. The number never fucking solves anything. It doesn't solve anything.\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nBut that's the only thing you're supposed to do. Because if you got along with your neighbors,\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nlike if you policed your own block and you saw cops doing\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nshit. That's called anarchy. That's called terrorism. That's not allowed.\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nThat's not government. That doesn't work. If your block\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nhad its own identity, if you were the 1700 block of Fifth Street\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nand nothing came between your neighbors and the outside\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nworld, that's called fucking sovereignty. That's called\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nself-actualization of a community. That's what gang members get right. Because they take over\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nblocks and cops won't go there. Cops won't go there. We're advocating\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000\neverything that will get us arrested.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nWe should all just let our neighbors coast where they want to coast.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nThat's why this great city of Austin is so great. Houston.\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nOh shit.\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nI have a scientific question for the three of you.\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nJust in time. The come on the door.\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nYou saw the come on the door. I don't\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nejaculate. You don't. I don't. And I don't know\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nif I would. It's not something that would stick out to me in the same way that when you learn a new\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nword, you hear it all the time. Do you see\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000\ncome on things all the time? Or am I going to start seeing come on things?\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nI think we all come on things at an early age and so it's easy to\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nrecognize when you're coming on things all the time. But I mean like at the hotel\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nroom, are you like oh cool, come. Or like on the stage? Or like I mean it's in everywhere\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nand like where does it stop? Well you know the whole black light thing\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nlike when you run a black light over a hotel room, you can spot semen and it's like\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nan epidemic. It's a Spencer situation. It was just there.\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nI'm wondering if I see it and I think it's like a plaster of Paris or something.\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nI think you know when you see it. I don't know.\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nYou can mistake it for a few things like I don't know like old clear\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nshower gel or maybe\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nan overly viscous spittle. I know that I have\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nbeen in bathrooms and hotels before and been like they really should control their\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000\ncome.\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nI think Justin said it exactly\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nright. Did you say it? You have\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000\na vague memory from your little kid and you're coming 900 times a day.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nThat's when you're coming inappropriately.\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nAnd you come in weird places so you actually do remember\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nwhat it looks like when it sucks. Like it sucks come from 500 feet away.\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nBut I think as you get older you come less and less\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nand you also come in more appropriate places.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nYou'd have to go to like\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nwell now I'm going to get into a\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nweird. Say it. Say it. No I was going to go down a road\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nof like where would you see 12 year olds come. I don't know.\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nThrough your own eyes. I don't know.\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nThis is what happens when you bring me on stage. We're talking about 12 year old\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nJustin. Will you stay up here\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nand play D&D with us? Wow this is crazy.\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nThis is insane.\n\n01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nLet me check the recorder.

I think it'll be great.\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nYou guys are right. It'll be fine.\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nYou saw one of the animatics at the convention and you liked it.\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nYou guys will be fine.

I'm Ryan too.\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000\nRyan too. He's an android from the Crab Nebula.\n\n01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000\nWhat's on your mind?

You followed your heart.\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nIs there something that you did that we cannot do?\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000\nI like the metaphor about building the space together.\n\n01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000\nThat's what you've got to do. Thinking about it as a third entity, as our couples therapist said,\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nyou got you and you got the other person. Those are individuals.\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nThey can be fucked up. They're whatever.\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nThat's like a bank or a company. It's an LLC.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000\nYou invest in it.\n\n01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000\nIt's a little Kroger's that you go to.\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000\nThat's what we're working on. Do you have two divorces?\n\n01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000\nDo you ever think, oh man, one of those. I really fucked up.\n\n01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000\nDo you think, oh good, I'm glad both of those marriages are over?\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nYou only have those two choices.\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000\nHow old are you? 38.\n\n01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nWhat was with the first divorce where you're like, I'm going to get married again?\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nThe first, the second marriage was the one that I thought was going to be\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nthe real one, the inventory.\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000\nThe first one was I was a little young.\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000\nThe second was like, oh, I think I know what I'm doing now.\n\n01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000\nNow I'm getting married at full control.\n\n01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nWait, what?

How long did it take to officially...\n\n01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000\nNo, each divorce. My parents divorced for nine years.\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000\nPretty quick, about six months.\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nI just want to recap.

It could be looked at as the secret to a happy marriage\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000\nor the secret to perpetual divorce.\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000\nIt could be that just trying again is the problem.\n\n01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000\nI've been divorced seven times.\n\n01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000\nYou keep getting married.\n\n01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nI'm trying to quote my own show.\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000\nA couple more rows here.\n\n01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000\nI think this is working out really well.\n\n01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000\nI'm Grant. I'm talking to my buddy that I grew up with, Casey Rupp.\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000\nHe specifically told me not to name drop.\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nWe've been talking about how cool it is that Dustin's up on stage.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nI want to apologize for name dropping him.\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000\nGood to see you, man.\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000\nHe works at Starburns. He's an amazing guy.\n\n01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000\nHe's a Harmontown feral fanatic.\n\n01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000\nHey, Dan, I just had my one year anniversary at Starburns.\n\n01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000\nThank you so much for allotting me a job.\n\n01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000\nBack to the community. Not in any actual philanthropic way that would benefit sick people.\n\n01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nWhy is Casey not flown out here?\n\n01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000\nCasey's human garbage. What are you talking about?\n\n01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000\nWhy is Casey not flown out here?\n\n01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000\nWhy is the doorman at Trump Tower not flown out for Donald Trump's birthday?\n\n01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000\nDonald's got a birthday to focus on.\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nWhat's up?\n\n01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000\nThis guy, an opportunity to rethink. It seems like Spence is really good at spotting cum.\n\n01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:40.000\nThis guy used his access to the microphone to do a pretty good callback.\n\n01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000\nHe just wants to warn you, Spencer.\n\n01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000\nHe wants to warn the guy that gave you his dice.\n\n01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000\nIf there is cum on the dice, sorry to the teenager who's apparently traumatized by allotuckup.com.\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.000\nIt's somehow mysteriously worked his way into a cum conversation warehouse.\n\n01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000\nWe'll see. We'll find out.\n\n01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000\nSpencer's going to open the dice and we'll see what's on him. Hello.\n\n01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000\nHi.

Did you have your hand up or am I like accosting you?\n\n01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000\nI had it up.\n\n01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nIs there anything pushing on your frontal lobe that you want to cum out of your mouth?\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000\nToo soon to say the word cum.\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000\nUs ladies don't do that.\n\n01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000\nWe don't cum.\n\n01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.000\nIs there anything that you wanted to share?\n\n01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000\nOh gosh.\n\n01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000\nHey, Dan, you missed two down here just so you know.\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000\nI'm coming back that way.\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nI got one more. I got a couple of stragglers.\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000\nI don't understand. She had her hand up and then I'll be confused about that for the next three years.\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nHello.\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000\nHello. I'm Adam.\n\n01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nI'm just sitting here.\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000\nAnother one of these.\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000\nI got my arms really tired but not because I was jacking off like the teenager over there.\n\n01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000\nWhat in the world?\n\n01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nThat's why people aren't as tired.\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000\nThe preamble is your arms tired.\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000\nNow the microphone's in your face. That's a new condition.\n\n01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nHow are you going to deal with that?\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000\nI don't know. See what happened was I had something planned and then I forgot what it was while I was waiting.\n\n01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nNice.\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000\nMegathe, you're all right.\n\n01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000\nSound bites are...\n\n01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000\nI'm back on board.\n\n01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000\nI'm coming back down.\n\n01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nWe got a couple stragglers.\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000\nThat was nice. I like that. I was able to ease my social anxiety.\n\n01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nI also like that the way this cinema is designed, I can be like Donahue.\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000\nDonahue was a talk show host.\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000\nWhat's happening with you?\n\n01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nHi.\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nFirst of all, I don't remember what I was going to ask.\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nHe was going to ask something and he says he has a joke in his face.\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nPlease speak in the microphone.\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nI'm forgetting.\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000\nAll right.\n\n01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nShe's shriveling up into her friend's armpit.\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nWhat's on your mind?\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:40.000\nI had two friends who really wanted to be here tonight but unlike teenagers, they couldn't come.\n\n01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nHe had a bit.\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nHe's been waiting 20 minutes for that.\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nYou know what I think might have happened there?\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000\nEveryone raised their hand and cast a wide net.\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000\nYou told people to keep their hands up but you didn't say why and then you just started doing stuff to them.\n\n01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.000\nDon't you think it's implied that if you have your hand up, the microphone is going to be in your face\n\n01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nand you're going to be accountable to the public?\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nAfter the 14th person.\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nDon't you think if the 16th person is like, hey, how do you tell a three-legged pollock from an octopus?\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nEveryone's like, how?\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000\nAnd they're like, I forgot.\n\n01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000\nDon't you think they deserve to be booed?\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nMaybe.\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nNo, not booed.\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nNobody should be bullied but what are you going to do?\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000\nHello.\n\n01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000\nCan you reveal anything about the next Ricksy Minutes episode?\n\n01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000\nThe next Ricksy Minutes episode.\n\n01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:38.000\nThe format of the episode is that Justin goes in the VO booth and makes up crazy shit\n\n01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nand then he thinks to try to make sense around it.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000\nWhat can I reveal about the next one?\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000\nNot much. They're watching TV again so there's...\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000\nI can't really reveal anything about it.\n\n01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000\nSo let's enter the best part of the show.\n\n01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000\nLet's place in Dungeons & Dragons!\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nNow there's some...\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nSorry, sweetie. What?\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nNothing. I was going to do the same thing you were going to do.\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nWe were in San Francisco and then we were in Austin and those podcasts haven't even aired yet.\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nSo even though on one hand you guys have to actually listen to the narration,\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nwhich Spencer always luxuriously provides, the good news is, as you probably know,\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000\nwe move about five feet per podcast episode.\n\n01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000\nSo there's not that much catching up to do.\n\n01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.000\nBut yeah, just in case you're basing it on the last podcast episode you listened to, we've done two since.\n\n01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000\nThat's all. That's what you're going to say, right?\n\n01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000\nDustin, why don't you play Quark?\n\n01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000\nWell, I have the sheets. Just pass them out top to bottom style.\n\n01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000\nI think that makes him Quark.\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000\nI'd like to play Dignity, my character.\n\n01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nI'd love you to play Dignity.\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000\nI forgot. What's your name, sir?\n\n01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000\nNick. Nick is playing Christopher. There you go.\n\n01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000\nAnd Aaron, do you have music?\n\n01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nI do. I do have music.\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000\nCool. Thank you.\n\n01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000\nThere you go. Quark and Dignity, my betrothed.\n\n01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000\nAll right.\n\n01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000\nWhen we last met, our heroes had found themselves in a mausoleum.\n\n01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000\nStriking out from Rosebook, the party was on the road to Farnheim, the frozen city,\n\n01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000\nto confront Admiral Darkstar once again.\n\n01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000\nBurning with passion, but devoid of directionality.\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000\nOur gang ran into a child known as Lil Baskins,\n\n01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000\na scrappy and industrious chap who offered to guide the party through the wilderness\n\n01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000\nand lead them to Farnheim.\n\n01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000\nQuark traded his greatsword for the boy's stick,\n\n01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000\nwhich turned out to be a magical weapon.\n\n01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000\nLil Baskins warned of highwaymen and took a detour through a graveyard.\n\n01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nTheir dignity tried to get to know the boy,\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000\nwho was suspiciously uncomfortable with discussing his life,\n\n01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000\nleading the gang to suspect he may be a ghost.\n\n01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nConfronting the boy, he revealed his ghastly past,\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000\nand after an emotional bonding experience,\n\n01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000\ndecided to trust the little ghost,\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000\neven as he led them into a dank crypt.\n\n01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000\nBut where were they going?\n\n01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000\nWas Lil Baskins really trustworthy?\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000\nAnd how would going into an underground mausoleum\n\n01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000\nget them into the Northern Highlands?\n\n01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nFind out next on an all-new Harmontown!\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nI mean, I...\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nOne of the most frustrating things about doing this three-city tour\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nwithout it being podcasts is I really want to tweet about\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nhow much I love Lil Baskins.\n\n01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000\nSuch a great, fun character's name to say.\n\n01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000\nLil Baskins.\n\n01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nIt's great, right?\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000\nYeah, so it's like this little newsy kid that we met in a town,\n\n01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nand it turned out he's a ghost, right?\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nBut you guys were pretty cool with him.\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000\nYeah.\n\n01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nHe's a ghost, yeah.\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000\nHe's going to guide us.\n\n01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nYeah, and so now we're going into a mausoleum.\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000\nThat's what's happening.\n\n01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000\nYou already explained it.\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000\nYou're in an overstocked graveyard.\n\n01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000\nYou see gray tombstones stabbing out of the sickly green grass?\n\n01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000\nLet me give you that guy's dice.\n\n01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000\nSorry.\n\n01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000\nYeah, I'll need that.\n\n01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000\nLook for comb.\n\n01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nAs well as you see the sun burning through the misty gray cloud cover.\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000\nA large mausoleum stands sentry over the legions of gravestones in the yard.\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000\nIt's heavy stone doors, completely ajar.\n\n01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000\nCold darkness lies inside.\n\n01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nLil Baskins.\n\n01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000\nIs this a shortcut you take to the great beyond?\n\n01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.000\nYeah, we have to go through here so we avoid all those highway men that I warned us about earlier.\n\n01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000\nWe trust you, Lil Baskins.\n\n01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000\nThanks, man.\n\n01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000\nLil Baskins, when you were alive, did you come a lot?\n\n01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nNo, I was, wait, what does that mean?\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000\nWhat age is Lil Baskins, like, permanently?\n\n01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000\nHe looks about 12.\n\n01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000\nOkay.\n\n01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000\nSharpie, as a paladin, I'm going to ask you to keep your distance from Lil Baskins.\n\n01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000\nNo, I shouldn't be talking to him about this.\n\n01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000\nNo, we don't need to discuss it.\n\n01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000\nWe can talk about it later.\n\n01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000\nI think you should just keep your distance.\n\n01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nI'll just go behind the door.\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000\nAll right, so we're walking through the...\n\n01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000\nI mean, you were outside of a mausoleum.\n\n01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000\nI follow Lil Baskins.\n\n01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000\nI follow as well.\n\n01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000\nAll right.\n\n01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000\nWhat about the rest of us?\n\n01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nYeah, I'm going to follow.\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000\nJust making sure.\n\n01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000\nI'm going to, just for safety.\n\n01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000\nEverybody's walking through the door?\n\n01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000\nYeah.\n\n01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000\nI'm going to stand outside the door and just kind of keep watch, but I'm not going to enter the room.\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000\nNice.\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000\nCool.\n\n01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nYeah, you don't have to coast if you don't want to.\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000\nI'm going to draw my sword.\n\n01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000\nI'm just going to have my sword at us while we're walking through the...\n\n01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000\nIs that what a neutral milk hotel would do?\n\n01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nIs that what you do?\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000\nAll right, so you enter the mausoleum.\n\n01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:24.000\nInside you see, amid the darkness, several statuettes, each about a foot high bordering an ornate brick pathway that leads to a large five foot sculpture of a robed female holding a wide shallow dish as if an offering.\n\n01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000\nWorst mausoleum ever.\n\n01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000\nThat's supposed to just be little rooms with dead people.\n\n01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000\nI inspect the statue and see if I can read anything.\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nThere's no inscription, but the woman looks to be maybe 20 years old.\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000\nShe's a statue.\n\n01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000\nYes.\n\n01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000\nSorry.\n\n01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000\nI look inside the gold dish that she's holding.\n\n01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000\nThere's nothing.\n\n01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000\nAlso, it's not gold.\n\n01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000\nI don't know where you got that.\n\n01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000\nI thought I heard you.\n\n01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000\nI don't remember something.\n\n01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000\nOkay.\n\n01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000\nLittle Baskins, who is this woman with this empty non-gold bowl?\n\n01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000\nThere's no inscriptions anywhere on this mausoleum.\n\n01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:09.000\nWell, Baskins, do you just pass through the mausoleum or do you don't know what it's for?\n\n01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000\nWell, I mean, we're using it as a passageway.\n\n01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000\nThat's more important than who is buried here to me right now.\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000\nSo usually you just keep walking.\n\n01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000\nYou don't usually stop and look at this shit?\n\n01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000\nWell, I did.\n\n01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000\nBut like I said, there's no inscriptions anywhere.\n\n01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000\nYou can't really learn anything.\n\n01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nThere's just pictures.\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nThe fact that we're stopped here right now instead of just continuing moving, it's only because we have curiosity.\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000\nIt's not because you wanted to stop.\n\n01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000\nOh, well, no.\n\n01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000\nWe got to close all the doors before we can proceed.\n\n01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000\nWhich doors?\n\n01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000\nThe doors to the outside of the mausoleum.\n\n01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000\nOh, our hipster friend is still waiting outside.\n\n01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000\nI stroll in.\n\n01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000\nReally cool.\n\n01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000\nAnd then I lean against the wall and I light a cigarette.\n\n01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000\nYeah, Quark loves cigarettes.\n\n01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000\nShe knows.\n\n01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000\nOr he.\n\n01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000\nOkay.\n\n01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000\nSo just clarification, I'm looking at these gained items.\n\n01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000\nYeah.\n\n01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000\nRobot baby plus power unit.\n\n01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000\nYeah.\n\n01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000\nThe power unit is inside the baby.\n\n01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000\nIt's powering him.\n\n01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000\nOkay.\n\n01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000\nSo it's like, you know, life force, I guess.\n\n01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000\nYeah.\n\n01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000\nLike it's batteries.\n\n01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000\nOkay.\n\n01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000\nLike it's power unit.\n\n01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000\nAnd the gold dish is to sort of put it in there.\n\n01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000\nIt sure is.\n\n01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000\nIt's not gold though.\n\n01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000\nIt's.\n\n01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000\nI know.\n\n01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000\nI know.\n\n01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000\nI know.\n\n01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000\nSome projected goldness out of this dish.\n\n01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000\nWell, maybe it should have been gold.\n\n01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000\nBut I am looking at the, the woman has in this,\n\n01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000\nit's a statue of a woman and she's holding this ball.\n\n01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000\nI just, I'm curious.\n\n01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000\nI'm looking with my, I know I'm only a wizard,\n\n01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:49.000\nbut I'm kind of looking just with a layman's eye at the statue,\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000\nparticularly the relationship of the dish to the woman's hands.\n\n01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000\nLike, I'm, you know, I'm obviously like looking at this like wondering is,\n\n01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000\nis this a situation where you put something in the dish and something happens?\n\n01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000\nThere doesn't seem to be any kind of joints or seams.\n\n01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000\nSo unless it might be magical, you know, but unless it's magical,\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000\nit doesn't seem like it moves.\n\n01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000\nHow many carrots is the dish?\n\n01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000\nOh, I was, I was thinking carrot was like a unit measurement of length or something.\n\n01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000\nGold, it was a gold.\n\n01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000\nCan I, can I, against the wall, I'm kind of like sneaking around the room\n\n01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:31.000\nexamining for any items or, or inscriptions or anything at all that would have a clue.\n\n01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000\nThere's no inscriptions.\n\n01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000\nI said that, but you do find a small key.\n\n01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000\nIt's rusted and made of iron.\n\n01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000\nPut that shit in the bowl.\n\n01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000\nDrop it in the bowl.\n\n01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000\nAll right, I pick it up and I drop on the bowl and I walk away and I lead against the wall\n\n01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000\nand I smoke a cigarette.\n\n01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000\nThat sounds like a t-shirt they would sell at Spencer's GIFs.\n\n01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000\nPut that shit in the bowl.\n\n01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000\nAll right.\n\n01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000\nYou do those things and you're smoking, but nothing seems to be happening.\n\n01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000\nLittle Baskins is like, we need to close the doors.\n\n01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000\nAll right.\n\n01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000\nGentlemen, I am closing the doors.\n\n01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000\nBut be careful, because once the doors are closed, we'll be in pitch darkness\n\n01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000\nand you can't light any lights.\n\n01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000\nWhy is that little Baskins?\n\n01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000\nBecause the ghost way doesn't appreciate that sort of thing.\n\n01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000\nThe ghost way?\n\n01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000\nYes.\n\n01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000\nWay, W-A-Y or W-H-E-Y?\n\n01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000\nThe ghost way, the way.\n\n01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000\nSorry.\n\n01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000\nIs that like a...\n\n01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000\nThe ghost page hates this.\n\n01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000\nIs that like a pass or like a code?\n\n01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000\nNo, it's...\n\n01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nThe ghost way, go the ghost way.\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000\nAnd it's more of like a path.\n\n01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000\nOkay.\n\n01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000\nA ghost take occasionally.\n\n01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000\nI mean, it's a physical path.\n\n01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nCan I try sense motive on little Baskins?\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000\nHe seems to be caring for your well-being, is his motive.\n\n01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000\nHe seems like a cool kid.\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000\nAll right.\n\n01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000\nWell, I respect your culture.\n\n01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.000\nAnd the culture of the undead, so gentlemen, let's keep our torches unlit.\n\n01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000\nAnd anything else you have that lights up, let's not light it.\n\n01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000\nI'm going to close these doors.\n\n01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000\nHow many doors are there?\n\n01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000\nThere's just the two.\n\n01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000\nOkay.\n\n01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000\nAll right.\n\n01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000\nBecause I can't get past the significance of this bowl,\n\n01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.000\nI'm just going to sit in it while the door is closed.\n\n01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000\nYou feel a rusty key under your butt.\n\n01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000\nIf Dan had a dollar.\n\n01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000\nI have trap sense.\n\n01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000\nAre you going to do some street art?\n\n01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000\nI have trap sense plus two.\n\n01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000\nI just want to detect any traps in the doors or the bowl with the key in it.\n\n01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000\nYou look around for traps, but you don't find anything.\n\n01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nOkay.\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000\nWe're clear, guys.\n\n01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000\nHave you tried parkour?\n\n01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nHave you seen my shoes?\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000\nOf course I have.\n\n01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000\nAll right.\n\n01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000\nLive show.\n\n01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000\nYou want someone to gram you while the lights go out?\n\n01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000\nNo, it was the whole thing.\n\n01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.000\nWhat hashtag do you want to use for the lights going out?\n\n01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000\nLights off, Graham.\n\n01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000\nOkay.\n\n01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000\nHashtag, thanks, Obama.\n\n01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000\nThanks, Obama.\n\n01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000\nSo you're sitting in the bowl still?\n\n01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000\nYeah, I am sitting in the bowl.\n\n01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000\nCool.\n\n01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000\nDignity closes the doors and after they close.\n\n01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000\nWhy are you quacking?\n\n01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000\nWhat?\n\n01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000\nNo, that was the doors closing.\n\n01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000\nFlap, flap.\n\n01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000\nToo close.\n\n01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000\nTwo doors.\n\n01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000\nI figured out what the bowl is.\n\n01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000\nOh, God.\n\n01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000\nI didn't.\n\n01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000\nOkay.\n\n01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000\nYou got to eat that mic, though, if you're going to have like passing thoughts.\n\n01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000\nEat it.\n\n01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000\nCloser.\n\n01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000\nLike this.\n\n01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000\nCloser?\n\n01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000\nNo, I almost kiss it.\n\n01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000\nYou love that mic.\n\n01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000\nI mean, not, yeah.\n\n01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000\nWhatever.\n\n01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000\nYou're doing great.\n\n01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000\nYou're doing great next.\n\n01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000\nIt's like an ice cream cone that you can't eat.\n\n01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000\nNo, I was thinking like once the doors close, maybe it lights up or something.\n\n01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000\nMaybe.\n\n01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000\nMaybe.\n\n01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000\nBut you wish.\n\n01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000\nYeah.\n\n01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000\nOnce the doors close, we're in pitch black.\n\n01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000\nYeah.\n\n01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000\nIf the lights came on, why would that even be a thing as a Dungeon Master that you would\n\n01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000\nwrite?\n\n01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.800\nOf course that's not going to happen.\n\n01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.300\nThis is convenience.\n\n01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:32.000\nThe doors close and a light comes on.\n\n01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000\nOh, good.\n\n01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000\nI read a book.\n\n01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000\nYou've made a book.\n\n01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:41.080\nAnd can you describe a scenario where you can't eat an ice cream cone that you're holding\n\n01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:42.320\nin your hand?\n\n01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.800\nBut you still need to keep it close to you.\n\n01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:45.800\nYeah, but you have to keep it close to your face.\n\n01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.800\nYou want to keep it close.\n\n01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.800\nI'm using here.\n\n01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:51.200\nI'm saying to him, like, like, don't be afraid of the mic.\n\n01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.200\nYeah.\n\n01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:54.100\nI just want to think of it like an ice cream cone.\n\n01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:55.100\nOf course you can't eat it.\n\n01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:56.800\nI don't want him to lick it the whole time.\n\n01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:57.800\nNo one wants to do that.\n\n01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:01.560\nI'm just saying, like, hold it as close as you would if it was made of ice cream.\n\n02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:03.800\nThat way you'll always have it close enough.\n\n02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:04.800\nOkay.\n\n02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:07.800\nBecause he's a very witty, he's saying a lot of fun things.\n\n02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:08.800\nI wasn't my question.\n\n02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:09.800\nAre we in the game right now?\n\n02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:10.800\nSorry?\n\n02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.800\nAre we in the game?\n\n02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:12.800\nWe're still in the game.\n\n02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:13.800\nAll right.\n\n02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.800\nSo the doors, the doors have closed.\n\n02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:19.740\nDan's sitting on a, on a key inside a bowl.\n\n02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:22.800\nYou hear the grinding stone of something moving.\n\n02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:30.000\nDan, you feel under your butt movement as, as you feel yourself slide perhaps laterally\n\n02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.800\nto the left or some other direction.\n\n02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.800\nNice.\n\n02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:38.800\nDoes, does my low light vision work in this scenario?\n\n02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:39.800\nNo.\n\n02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:40.800\nIf you, does anyone have dark vision?\n\n02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:41.800\nI light a torch.\n\n02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:42.800\nNo.\n\n02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:43.800\nNo, don't wait, wait.\n\n02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:44.800\nAre you serious?\n\n02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:45.800\nWhy?\n\n02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:46.800\nWhy?\n\n02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:47.800\nWhat happened?\n\n02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:48.800\nBecause the ghost way doesn't work.\n\n02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.800\nYou're disrespecting their culture.\n\n02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:50.800\nThe ghost way?\n\n02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.800\nWhy?\n\n02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.800\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:55.800\nNo, come on.\n\n02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:56.800\nWe trusted the kid.\n\n02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:57.800\nOkay.\n\n02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:04.800\nI, I, I hold it up and then I put it out and I lean against the wall with my leg up.\n\n02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:05.800\nOkay.\n\n02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.800\nSo you light the torch.\n\n02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:07.800\nNo, he never did.\n\n02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.800\nNo, no, I never did.\n\n02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:09.800\nI, I go to do it.\n\n02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.800\nOh, you took it out and they give me a look and then I, I know, but I still.\n\n02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:14.800\nI mean, is that cheating?\n\n02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.800\nCause he said that he let the torch.\n\n02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:16.800\nNo.\n\n02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.360\nWell, I just thought he, I thought his second thing was after lighting the torch, I put\n\n02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.360\nit out.\n\n02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:22.360\nHe didn't do anything.\n\n02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:23.360\nAll right.\n\n02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.360\nIf you say so.\n\n02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.360\nHe's not even.\n\n02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.360\nHe's doing great.\n\n02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.360\nEverybody clap for Dustin.\n\n02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:33.680\nDon't, don't encourage him.\n\n02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:34.680\nI'm depressed.\n\n02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.680\nThat's sad.\n\n02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.680\nIt's good.\n\n02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.680\nIt's good.\n\n02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:38.680\nApplause.\n\n02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:39.680\nOkay.\n\n02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:40.680\nThank you.\n\n02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:41.680\nAll right.\n\n02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:42.680\nSo, so Sharpie is, is moving to the left.\n\n02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:43.680\nWe hear a grinding noise.\n\n02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.680\nYep.\n\n02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.640\nI call out, I'm sitting in the bowl and I'm moving to the left.\n\n02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:49.640\nYeah.\n\n02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:50.640\nThat's the doorway.\n\n02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:51.640\nIt's opening up.\n\n02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.640\nAll right.\n\n02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:58.200\nI, I move, I move towards where I know the statue is and I, and I grab onto Sharpie's\n\n02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:59.200\nfoot.\n\n02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.200\nAll right.\n\n02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.200\nYou do that.\n\n02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.200\nSomething's touching my foot.\n\n02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.200\nIt's me.\n\n02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.200\nOkay.\n\n02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:07.000\nSo, uh, we're just going to want to go down these stairs here.\n\n02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.200\nIf you want to get off of that statue.\n\n02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.200\nCan we see them?\n\n02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.200\nNo.\n\n02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.200\nYou can't see anything.\n\n02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.200\nYou're in pitch darkness.\n\n02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:15.200\nDo we have to hold each other?\n\n02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:16.200\nWell, you might want to figure that out.\n\n02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200\nYeah.\n\n02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.000\nBecause otherwise who knows what'll happen.\n\n02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000\nAll right.\n\n02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.840\nI take out, I take out my, uh, my rope, I tie it around my waist and I, and I pass it to\n\n02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.840\nSharpie.\n\n02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:28.840\nAll right.\n\n02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.840\nLet's, let's pass this, uh, through the group.\n\n02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.080\nWell, Baskins, are you corporeal?\n\n02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.840\nUm, not very.\n\n02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.520\nI mean, I can't occasionally, but no, I do have low light vision.\n\n02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:39.520\nYeah.\n\n02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.520\nBut it's not, it's, it's too dark for low light.\n\n02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.520\nGod damn it.\n\n02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.520\nNo light.\n\n02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:44.520\nWait.\n\n02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.520\nWhat do you make that sound again?\n\n02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:46.520\nWhat?\n\n02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:47.520\nYou made the sound again.\n\n02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.520\nIt was an accident.\n\n02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:49.520\nIt was a noise.\n\n02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.520\nA chastise.\n\n02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:51.520\nA chastise.\n\n02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.520\nAll right.\n\n02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:55.280\nSo are we, are we down?\n\n02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.920\nChristopher, what do you, what do you, how are you feeling?\n\n02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:00.440\nUm, trying to figure out how to get through.\n\n02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.800\nI think the cloak thing would be a good idea, but climbing downstairs with a person in front\n\n02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:07.440\nfalls, everybody falls.\n\n02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.440\nRight.\n\n02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:11.520\nSo I think you just described Bitcoin.\n\n02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:12.520\nYeah.\n\n02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:16.200\nOr one of the problems of Bitcoin.\n\n02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:17.200\nOne of them.\n\n02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:22.720\nOne of the other ones, I don't know why I didn't say I'm kidding.\n\n02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:25.880\nDan Harmon collapses Bitcoin with a joke.\n\n02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:31.280\nUm, I, well, yeah, little Baskins, uh, I think what we're going to have to have you do because\n\n02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:38.200\nyou're an audio only presence is you're going to have to keep going, uh, little Baskins,\n\n02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:42.440\nlike, like you're saying, you're going to have to keep saying something so we can follow\n\n02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:43.440\nyou.\n\n02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:44.440\nYeah.\n\n02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.440\nOkay.\n\n02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:51.800\nSo that's what I was going to say for making it sound like I wasn't thinking it up myself.\n\n02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:53.520\nI appreciate that.\n\n02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.960\nI thought it was really clever if I would have just came up with Marco on the spot.\n\n02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:57.960\nI'm sorry.\n\n02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:58.960\nJesus.\n\n02:03:58.960 --> 02:03:59.960\nFollow me.\n\n02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:00.960\nWhat?\n\n02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:01.960\nFollow me.\n\n02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:02.960\nNo, I'm Marco.\n\n02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:03.960\nWhat?\n\n02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:04.960\nWhy would you follow?\n\n02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:08.680\nLittle Baskins, these are, are these, are these not standards stairs?\n\n02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:14.720\nUh, they're just stairs, but I feel confident that I can walk down the stairs.\n\n02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.400\nIn total darkness.\n\n02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:18.400\nYeah.\n\n02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:23.280\nI, I, I am, uh, I walk pretty well.\n\n02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.280\nI think.\n\n02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:25.280\nAll right.\n\n02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.280\nWell, just charge ahead.\n\n02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.880\nYou walk down the stairs successfully.\n\n02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:29.880\nBam.\n\n02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:30.880\nWow.\n\n02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:34.640\nAnd what are the rest of you guys do?\n\n02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:38.160\nWell, in a meta sense, I'm getting a drink.\n\n02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:44.000\nI'll creep down behind her like, like crouching, but I'm, I'm pretty scared of the dark.\n\n02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.240\nYeah, you are.\n\n02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:46.240\nThat happens.\n\n02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.240\nYou're downstairs too.\n\n02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240\nAre you guys tied together or not?\n\n02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.240\nUh, I wanted to do the rope thing.\n\n02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.200\nI, I, I think the rope thing is a good idea.\n\n02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.520\nWho was doing the rope thing?\n\n02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:54.680\nUm, I, I was.\n\n02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:55.680\nOkay.\n\n02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:57.720\nWell, then I guess that means I followed you down the stairs.\n\n02:04:57.720 --> 02:04:58.720\nAll right.\n\n02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.000\nI grabbed hold of the rope in the middle part.\n\n02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000\nYeah.\n\n02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000\nI'm going to grab the end.\n\n02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000\nOkay.\n\n02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.480\nYou're down the stairs.\n\n02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:09.400\nI have the key still clenched in my buttocks.\n\n02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.080\nThat will come up.\n\n02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.240\nSo a little Baskins is down there and he's like, Hey, just, you know, follow the sound\n\n02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.240\nof my voice.\n\n02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:21.880\nOh, also just be aware that this path that we're on is only about 10 feet wide and there's\n\n02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:22.880\nno railings.\n\n02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:24.880\nAnd I think it's bottomless.\n\n02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:25.880\nWhat you think?\n\n02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:26.880\nYeah.\n\n02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:27.880\nI thought you'd, you've been down this way before.\n\n02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:28.880\nYeah.\n\n02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:29.880\nBut I usually don't fall off.\n\n02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:31.880\nWhat, at what point is it bottomless?\n\n02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:36.320\nThere's an end of the stairs and it's a bottomless or, or it's an endless stairwell.\n\n02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:40.200\nNo, it goes to a, it goes to a regular path.\n\n02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.840\nDoes the little Baskins have any, any temperature?\n\n02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:46.840\nLike do I, when you're close to him, do you feel cold or anything?\n\n02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:49.880\nUh, does he smell like spirits?\n\n02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:50.880\nNot as far as you know.\n\n02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:51.880\nNo.\n\n02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:56.680\nEverything that everyone has said for the last five minutes is what she said.\n\n02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:59.320\nI just wanted to point that out.\n\n02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:00.320\nAll right.\n\n02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.320\nMarco.\n\n02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.320\nPolo.\n\n02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:03.320\nPolo.\n\n02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.320\nPolo.\n\n02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:05.320\nMarco.\n\n02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:06.320\nPolo.\n\n02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.320\nPolo.\n\n02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:08.320\nHow do we know this?\n\n02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:09.320\nEveryone.\n\n02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:10.320\nYeah.\n\n02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:13.240\nYou feel the ground shift under your feet and give way.\n\n02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:14.240\nAh.\n\n02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.240\nYeah.\n\n02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:17.240\nGround shifting.\n\n02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:23.520\nDignity and Chris de Burghh failed to dive out of the way, although quark and sharpie managed\n\n02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:26.960\nto avoid, avoid their fate.\n\n02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:37.440\nYou guys fall 30 feet down and hit the ground.\n\n02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.880\nGetting 13 damage apiece.\n\n02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:40.880\nUgh.\n\n02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:41.880\nUgh.\n\n02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.880\nAre you guys okay?\n\n02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.440\nWere we still tied together?\n\n02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.440\nNo.\n\n02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:46.680\nWhat I heard was that you're holding on.\n\n02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.680\nI was holding on.\n\n02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:49.160\nI have rope burns in my hand.\n\n02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:50.160\nYeah.\n\n02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:53.160\nBut are you guys okay?\n\n02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.160\nUh, I'm not sure.\n\n02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:55.640\nLet me check my hit points.\n\n02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:56.640\nYeah.\n\n02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:57.640\nI'm okay.\n\n02:06:57.640 --> 02:06:58.640\nI'm all right.\n\n02:06:58.640 --> 02:06:59.640\nI think we found the bottom.\n\n02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:02.560\nAre you, uh, are you, are you, are you safe up there?\n\n02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:05.160\nWhat are, what do you, what do you see?\n\n02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.160\nWe don't see anything.\n\n02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.160\nIt's pitch dark.\n\n02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.160\nIt's pitch dark.\n\n02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:13.320\nBut, but we heard a very modern, uh, critical error of some kind.\n\n02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:17.640\nIt was a, uh, a small passing of gas.\n\n02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:22.040\nIt's kind of what that sounds like.\n\n02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.360\nAre you guys coming?\n\n02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:28.840\nUm, not sure.\n\n02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:29.840\nLittle bastion.\n\n02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:30.840\nWhere did our friends go?\n\n02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:31.840\nCan you go down?\n\n02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:32.840\nIt's little bastions.\n\n02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.640\nWait, what's it called?\n\n02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.640\nBastions.\n\n02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:36.640\nBastions.\n\n02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.120\nIt's a little bastion store.\n\n02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:39.120\nBut not.\n\n02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:40.120\nWhy don't you do what you wish?\n\n02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.600\nUm, okay.\n\n02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:42.600\nLittle bastions.\n\n02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:45.560\nCan you go down there and, and investigate for us?\n\n02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:46.560\nThey fell down a pit.\n\n02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:47.560\nI mean, I can see.\n\n02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:48.560\nFine.\n\n02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:49.560\nYeah.\n\n02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.560\nWhat do you see down there?\n\n02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.560\nOh, they didn't fall off that pit.\n\n02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.920\nThis is a, this is a different pit.\n\n02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:54.840\nThis is a much better pit to fall down.\n\n02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.040\nSo it's not bottomless.\n\n02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.040\nIt's like a small pit.\n\n02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.040\nNo.\n\n02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:59.040\nThis one definitely is about 30 feet deep.\n\n02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:00.040\nIt looks like.\n\n02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:01.040\nOkay.\n\n02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.040\nWell, is the rope still down there?\n\n02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.560\nCan we just pull them up?\n\n02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:04.560\nYeah.\n\n02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:05.560\nThey're tied to a rope.\n\n02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:06.560\nYeah.\n\n02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:09.840\nOr, or, or, uh, you operating on the assumption that they're just holding the rope.\n\n02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:10.840\nRight.\n\n02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:11.840\nI tied it around my arm.\n\n02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:12.840\nYou can still have the rope.\n\n02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:13.840\nDo you have the rope down there?\n\n02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.840\nYeah.\n\n02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:15.840\nI have the rope.\n\n02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:16.840\nOkay.\n\n02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:17.840\nWe're going to pull up the rope.\n\n02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.720\nI have a 12 strength.\n\n02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:22.200\nSo it should be no problem.\n\n02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:23.840\nBut what, what's down in the hole?\n\n02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.080\nLike do we want to proceed down?\n\n02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:27.600\nWhat's down in the hole, you guys?\n\n02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:30.720\nI, uh, I, I feel around.\n\n02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:35.160\nYou feel small, uh, smooth walls and nothing else.\n\n02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:42.200\nIs this pit what lay ahead of us as if the path that we were on suddenly had a pit in\n\n02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.520\nit and we just didn't fall in and they did.\n\n02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.520\nNo.\n\n02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:48.320\nIt was a pit trap at where in the floor gives way and becomes a pit.\n\n02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.320\nAll right.\n\n02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.320\nLet's get the, get the other one.\n\n02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.160\nGo ahead and pull me out of the golden hole, made a gold.\n\n02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.160\nYou do that.\n\n02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:57.160\nYou're pulled out.\n\n02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.160\nWe're pulling you up.\n\n02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:01.720\nYou're, you're, you're successfully pulled out.\n\n02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:04.440\nThat's what she said.\n\n02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.840\nOh, Lil Baskin's like, I forgot.\n\n02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:07.840\nThere's traps around here.\n\n02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.160\nI don't set them off.\n\n02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:10.160\nOkay.\n\n02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:11.160\nYou're doing great.\n\n02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.560\nYou're, um, a ghost baby that can see you're leaving four people that can't see.\n\n02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:17.560\nYeah.\n\n02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:20.440\nAnd you're being very flippant and vague about everything.\n\n02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.440\nUm, I said, I forgot.\n\n02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:24.440\nI mean, when you're a ghost, you don't set off traps.\n\n02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:27.440\nIf I have a trap sense, can I do it in the dark?\n\n02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:28.880\nYou can try, but it'll be worse.\n\n02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:32.040\nUm, so we've moved past the hole in the floor, right?\n\n02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:33.040\nNo.\n\n02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:34.040\nYou're on the one side of the hole.\n\n02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:35.040\nOkay.\n\n02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.120\nSo we need to get across this, but it's in pitch dark.\n\n02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:42.840\nSo can we throw, we tie the rope to something and throw it across and then just, I guess,\n\n02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:43.840\nclimb across.\n\n02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.040\nYou could do all sorts of things.\n\n02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:47.760\nLil Baskin's, can you float?\n\n02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.760\nYeah.\n\n02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:49.760\nCan you carry a rope?\n\n02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.760\nNo.\n\n02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:59.160\nUh, we need to, yeah, well, Lil Baskin's, can you describe, we want you to understand\n\n02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.280\nthat as non ghost babies, we cannot see anything.\n\n02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:03.280\nI know.\n\n02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:06.440\nSo we need to anchor this rope so we can get across.\n\n02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.680\nCan you tell us, be our eyes for us, tell us, are there structures over there to which\n\n02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:11.920\nwe can anchor this rope?\n\n02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:17.900\nIf we could hit it with a, with a grapple or some, there aren't, uh, it's only eight\n\n02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:18.900\nfeet wide.\n\n02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:20.400\nYou could probably jump it.\n\n02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:21.400\nAll right.\n\n02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:24.920\nI, I, uh, I still have the rope tied to my waist.\n\n02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.680\nI, uh, I, I rev up.\n\n02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.320\nI run towards the hole.\n\n02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.640\nThis is a terrible.\n\n02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.440\nI try to jump over the hole.\n\n02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.440\nTerrible idea.\n\n02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:35.440\nYou've fallen the hole.\n\n02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.440\nLet's see.\n\n02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.840\nYou start, you start to go down and you guys notice the rope, it's, you know, doing that\n\n02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.920\nthing that rope does when someone's falling down something.\n\n02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:42.920\nYeah.\n\n02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:43.920\nIt goes tout and starts pulling.\n\n02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:46.440\nI, I, I, yeah, I pull it and we, all right.\n\n02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:47.440\nYou pull her to safety.\n\n02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.440\nOkay.\n\n02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.440\nAll right.\n\n02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.440\nLet's, let's, let's communicate.\n\n02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:51.440\nOkay.\n\n02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.440\nFunny thing.\n\n02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:53.440\nUm, I've been looking at this sheet.\n\n02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:55.440\nWould goggles at night work?\n\n02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:56.440\nYeah.\n\n02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:57.440\nAll right.\n\n02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:02.440\nThank you everybody for coming to Harmon's house.\n\n02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:03.440\nWhat?\n\n02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:10.440\nOh, thank you so much to Nick, Justin Marshall, our producer, Spencer, Clinton, and Dan Harmon.\n\n02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:15.440\nThank you so much everybody.\n\n02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:21.440\nAnd thank you Caroline and Tom Gray.\n\n02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:23.440\nThank you.\n\n02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:25.440\nYes.\n\n02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:32.440\nUh, we'll be out there, I'll, I'll be out there at any rate if, uh, yeah, for pictures.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.001s"],"str_size":[175853]}
