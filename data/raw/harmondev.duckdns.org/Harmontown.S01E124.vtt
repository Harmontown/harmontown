00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Terrell Audio.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello Houston!

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Parment Town is now in session.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Please welcome to the stage your Mayor of Houston

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
and our guests.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Now in session, please welcome to the stage your Mayor of Houston

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
and of Parment Town, Dan Harmon!

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you Houston. Maybe I should use this one. Should I use this one?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
The wireless one? Thank you.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Do I have to tap it or swipe it?

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Is it like a Google microphone?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Boy, what a fuck up of a starter show.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
The auxiliary cable wasn't in. Thank you Houston, Texas!

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Dan, guess what the first word said

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
when the moon was?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Probably Houston, right?

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Even the people on the moon got the city right.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
That guy shouting out from the audience

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
is referring to a fact that could have otherwise been lost

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
to the ages.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm so intelligent, sir.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
The Woodward and Bernstein of the fucking Houston show

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
that during the Q&A that preceded the show

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
having driven three hours from Austin to Houston

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
thoroughly enamored with every city in Texas as I always am.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Particularly ones with Alamo Draft Houses.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I referred to Houston as Austin.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
It was the equivalent of an 80's sex comedy.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I just called out a different lover's name.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
I love you both. I love Houston even more.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
There's a lady in the front

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
that cannot or she is compelled to remind us that we are in Katie.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
We are technically in Katie.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
I imagine it's like, I'm from Brown Deer, Wisconsin.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm sure Katie is like, it's a suburb of Houston, right?

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
No one wants to feel like they're in Katie.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Clearly, Katie was...

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Whoever capable of calling this area something other than Houston was a giant asshole

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
that was either dodging taxes

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
or exploiting workers.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I don't know what the history is, but no one's going to call this place Katie.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
I swear to God, I promise we're in Houston.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
And sometimes Austin, if you get me drunk enough.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Alright, Houston, Texas. Some trivia about Houston, Texas. Aaron?

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Yes. The typewriter was invented here.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Did you know that?

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
By Neil Armstrong?

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
He got off of the rocket ship and he was like,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Houston, we need a device.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I can use to write a letter to tell you we don't have a problem.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
The moon looks great. I can't wait to get back to Houston.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Guest Comptroller Erin McGathy, everybody.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Wes Anderson is from Houston, which I found very surprising.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Lance Hendrickson? Wes Anderson.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I thought I was all excited.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Lance Hendrickson, holy shit. That's awesome.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Alright, fine.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
He's not here, is he?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, he's in this podium. He's in an adorable pink

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
hand-drawn diorama.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Is it twee? It's very twee.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Alright, you cool? You look very nice tonight.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Thank you.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
We'll edit all this out. People are listening.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I just started cutting the carrots for my salad. Hurry up. Do your show.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Now it's a segment called Shadow Puppet Theater.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
For those of you listening, there's an amazing Shadow Puppet.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Facts about Houston.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
It's on the Houston River, which runs from

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Dallas to the Gulf of Mexico.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Houston was a port city founded by travelers who

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
were selling pelts and spices to

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
the Houstonina Indians of

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Texas. This is reading like the shittiest fifth grade book report

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
right now. Alright, Dan, I know that you prepared this

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
right before class, but go ahead. What would become Houston, Texas,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
began as a cowboy hat store

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
next to a cattle trough where you could

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
slake your livestock's thirst or fit it with a custom hat.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
As soon after that, the local barber

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
moved in. Back then, a lot of people don't know this, barbers were also

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
the police and dentists.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
There was a famous shootout here at the Houston Corral

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
between a cow that didn't get his hat fitted properly

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
and a dentist that thought he was in charge of

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
the law.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
I was just curious were the barbers

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
and the dentists, were they carrying instruments

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
true to their profession or did they have guns like cops?

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
A typical Houston dentist in 1900, which was when the city

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
was founded, would have

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
as a deputy or sheriff, they would have a gun

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
where a six gun on their hip and a big hat made next door.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
But as a dentist, they would have the dental tools as well

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
and there's a lot of famous stories. Billy the Kid

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
he's famous for shooting 59 people

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
47 of those are Houston dentists

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
and it's not because he was quicker on the draw, it's because they forgot

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
they were on the clock and they drew like a pick instead of a gun.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
It's a simple mistake. They were actually better cowboys than Billy the Kid

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
he wasn't that big a deal, he just spent a lot of time in Houston

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
shooting innocent dentists. Innocent, talented

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
wonderful law abiding, quicker on the draw dentist who made a simple fuck

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
up and paid for it with their lives and were reduced to footnotes

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
in the history of some asshole who preyed on dentists.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Houston exists in the shadows of egomaniacs,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
tyrants, liars, politicians, vampires

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
they sit here, they weather the storm, Houston that's why

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
the first mayor of Houston, Richard Dawson

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
called Houston the city

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
on the verge. That's what it's called

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
and you can see it on its license plates. Houston has its own license plates

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
it's the only city in Texas to have its own license plates

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
as of 1983.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I heard that you know about the infamous

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Houston underground, the society under the city

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
can you tell us about that? Houston is famous for

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
having a city underneath itself called Houston

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
because it gets really hot here in the summer

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
and if you need to get your hair cut you could die just walking

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
from your house to get your hair cut. So they have adopted the practice

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
that moles and ants before them have adopted of staying underground

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
to stay cool. It's no big deal. Don't shame them

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
for it, they're an underground people.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
It's controversial because they're taking up a lot of the city's resources.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Well the controversy is actually that they cheat

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
a lot of Houston is actually in

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Arizona. Yeah I've heard that.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Because they do this weird measuring thing where you can only

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
technically if you're measuring property you have to do it above ground

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
and so they cheat and actually Houston is

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
30,000 miles in diameter and a lot of it exists

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
under Las Vegas and Phoenix

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
and they use it as a tax dodge and

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
it's a big problem but it's sensitive and you can hear these people

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
you can hear, I think you can hear their silence and their murmuring

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
it's because they're sensitive about it. They know

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
they know that Houston is guilty of this but

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
at the same time they profit from it. Totally. I heard that all the

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
highways in Houston were built by Beyonce's dad?

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
That's correct. Heinrich Knowles

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
the third. He was a

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
former Nazi sympathizer turned

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
1940's Houston engineer. He was

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
at the forefront of the automotive revolution. He designed a lot of

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
what we call today's highway system. He started in Houston. It was a sort of a

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
guinea pig city. Yes, yes, yes. Again you're shaming them and they don't deserve it.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
They're a good city. They've done a lot of good for a lot of people and you're bringing up the terrible things

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
that they're mole people who were founded by a Nazi.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Because obviously Houston is infamous for

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
danger and mystery and intrigue. I have so many questions

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
and because I know that you know so much about it.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
The typewriter was invented here. It's like focus on the positive.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
This is the first city to ever elect a three legged

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
governor. It was the first city to elect

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
a governor. They

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
rose above the tyranny. There used to be a rule that if you were a city you couldn't

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
elect a governor. They used to tell you you have to elect a mayor.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
It's fucking horse shit. Houston broke that wall

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
down. Houston said no, we want a governor. And he's going to have three legs.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
It's all lost to history. Now you look it up and it just says some

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
crap about mission control. It's just garbage.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
It's a bunch of big NASA politics. Yeah, as

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
somebody who's planning on going to the moon, I mean you're kind of

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
this is a really important city. This is our

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
the United States elevator to the moon. I'm not using it.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
We're not going to start. I mean it's too

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
yeah. Have you heard about the, you said moon elevator.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
You guys know about the elevator

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
principle? Like somebody was telling me about this one.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
This sounds like breaking news.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Do you have a sound cue?

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
No.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
This sounds like breaking news.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Alright, yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, there's, I'm going to get this very wrong, but

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
there's

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
there's this principle that rocketeers I think

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
they're called in space engineers are like talking about where it's

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
actually might be actually practical scientifically

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
rather than launching things to and from the moon

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
to that we should build a space elevator. Because

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
the physics work out that once the gravity is a problem when you're

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
building like towers and shit, but if you commit and actually build

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
a tower tall enough it gets out into space and then of course

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
the opposite effect is happening out in space and it's like you can actually

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
just make this like metal noodle connecting the earth to the moon

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
or maybe just the earth maybe not to the moon because I think that would bend and break it.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
I don't think you should connect anything between the earth and the moon.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
But like to build like a space elevator that takes you out into space

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
rather than a rocket that you would just I mean you know and hey let me tell

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
you I hope nobody farts in that thing because that's a

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
that's all that's all that's a 27 minute ride minimum.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
This has been moon news.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Dustin could I have it so I can just play the

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
cue whenever I need to play. I have several cues that I'm

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
very proud of and can you tell me can you hint to

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
me the kinds of things that you have music for so I can bend the show.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
I think you'll tell me not to do it. No.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Can I get a drink? Can I get a tequila?

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Jesus. Here we go.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
This has been moon news.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
What do you want scoops? You want a vodka?

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
No I want tequila because I quit vodka.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Oh your health kick. Okay give her tequila.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
I want to

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I want to meet one friend from

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
Houston. Just a random person.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
There's people who are calling. There's random Randy here?

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Well I can't no I see Minecraft disqualifies you immediately. People would kill themselves

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
if I started talking about Minecraft.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
There's a teacher.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
What's that? Asian guy. That goes a long way.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
Physicist I heard.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
Community college.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Does anyone have a full glass of tequila?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Someone's working on that for you don't worry about that. Just got married.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Let's get the guy who just got married. Okay who's the guy that just got married?

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Is that Tom Gray?

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
Tom Gray come on down.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Tom Gray is wearing a

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
tasteful heather sweater. He is walking with confidence

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
but not with arrogance.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Someone called out that's not random. Good point. I know his name for some reason.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Tom here's the thing. Your wife is the best

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
wife in the world. She tried to put the fix in. Here grab any

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
mic that you want. She talked to me while you were taking your shit

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
and said make me the best wife in the world. Bring my

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
loving husband that I'm married to for a week up on stage somehow.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I was prepared to do that. What she didn't know is that you would be like bring me up!

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
She probably knew that. Well she's a good wife.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Give her those points in spite of your

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
zeal. It's been seven days. So when you're married for a week

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
what's it like? It's been good.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
We've been together a very long time so I was

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
curious to see if anything would change and nothing seems to have changed.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
How long have you been together?

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
How long? I don't want to get it wrong.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Eight years she says. She's got this. She's wrong actually. It's longer.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
So we've known each other since middle school. They did in high school.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
Someone in the audience was horrified.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Did you guys go to prom together?

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
Somebody reacted to you saying you met your wife in middle school as if

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
you said you got bit by a brown recluse.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
And lost your leg. Yeah that wasn't good.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
No she wouldn't go to prom with me actually. She didn't want to go to prom.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
We were one of those couples that said we're not going to go to prom.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Do you still feel good about that decision?

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
I've gone back and forth. That's a weird question for me to ask.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Am I allowed to pry Tom since we have you up here? It's a personal show.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Tell me if you don't bully her.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
You don't have to answer anything you don't want to answer but I'm going to ask whatever I want to ask.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
If you met your wife, I think the reason that guy said Jesus Christ

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
is because when you met the woman that you ended up marrying

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
you were so young that she might have been the eighth woman you met.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
So the question is

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
how much field playing did you do before you

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
committed to your fantasy football?

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
I know less about football than you do.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
You couldn't tell from my metaphor. Trust me that metaphor sucked.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
I think that's it.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
I'm from a very small town in Wisconsin.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
There's at least two couples I could name that were

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
couples when we were in high school and at my 20 year reunion we're all 40.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Two of them are still

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
married couples and they have kids that are old enough

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
to be here at the show. I think the question on everyone's mind

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
is what are we doing? What are any of us doing? If it's possible for you to meet

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
the love of your life when you're a child, does that

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
mean that everyone's full of shit? Or does that mean

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
that the people in question are really lucky? What is the truth? There's seven

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
billion of us on this earth. Are we really

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
keys and tumblers? Why is the divorce rate

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
now like a million percent whereas in

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
caveman times it was zero percent? Is it just because we were brutal

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
people and made marriage? I'm laying a lot of shit on you.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Let me bring it back to your area.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
If I was Howard Stern the way I would pose my question is how many

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
people have you had sex with?

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
I actually preferred your first question. Howard Stern question.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
The answer to that question would be one. Your wife

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
lost your virginity to her and you guys like, I mean that's a beautiful thing.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
I think that's a system that works.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
We'll see.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
There's a group of children

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
outside that agree. They're happy about it. They're playing hopscotch

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
and they're high-fiving you on your almost Mormon-like

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
life.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
You guys met in junior high. You met when

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
it was actually illegal for either of you to

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
do anything sexually. You grew into sexual adults.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
You did it with each other. You took a vow

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
to only do it with each other forever. Now you are one week into

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
that and you're saying nothing's changed.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
What do you think? What do you think the odds are?

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Society says 70% chance of divorce.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Is that another Howard Stern question?

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
I actually don't know a question.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
I think it's just people are fascinated with this stuff because we want to know, are we allowed to be

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
romantic? Are we allowed to be pie-eyed?

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Are we allowed to not be cynical? Because sometimes

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
that could be the biggest mistake you ever make. I always think

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
when we watch romantic comedies, we actually poison ourselves

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
because then we take that into our relationships and relationships can actually be so much more

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
romantic if we actually allow ourselves to be human and not like these characters that are played by

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Matthew McConaughey and Meg Ryan and whatnot. We're watching

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
90-minute little stories about how romance is this and romance

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
is that when marriage is a completely different thing. On one hand, naivete

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
can be one of the worst things in the world and on the other hand, it's truly a

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
resource that we've squandered in this country. We don't have it anymore.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
The idea that, oh, I just love you, fuck it. Let's just be together forever.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
I don't have a question for you. I think that people in the audience want to know

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
as they want to know from Neil Armstrong what's it like to land on the moon.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
They want to know from somebody who hasn't fucked anybody other than their wife.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
How are you going to do that?

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
It sounds like Dan's panicking.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
We get married in a few weeks. We get married in three weeks. He's like, what do you do?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
What if he's the wrong tumbler and then you're like, oh god, kill myself and then

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
you're doing all these shows, you have a documentary about you and I was like, how do you tell your parents?

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
I'm 41.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Aaron and I, we don't have that.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
I am

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
settling down with Aaron at the perfect time. I have met the love of my

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
life and I also coincidentally,

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
I suffer no illusion that I would ever even be

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
thinking about what would life bring me

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
if I didn't do this, but you seem like a young strapping man

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
here in the prime of your life. My god,

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
I bet your dick could cut glass.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
I just always felt like I would be a really bad single person.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Oh god, yeah.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Can you relate to that?

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
It just seems like the alternative is always worse.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Ah, romance.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Boy.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
You're so right about romantic comedies and we've talked about this before.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
Romantic comedies peddle this idea that's not real

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
that partners are looking for apartments

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
but those apartments are already furnished, so you go into an apartment

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
and you're like, ah, I could live here and then you're like, ah, I don't know, I don't like these

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
mirrors on the wall. I'm not into this, but I think the way that relationships really

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
work is that you go into a space that's unfurnished

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
and the furnishing is the relationship that you build together.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
So you walk into a space and you're now like, ah, I don't like it, but it has to be a space

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
like in the part of town that you like, in the city that

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
you like, I'm going to keep on going with this metaphor.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Yes, this apartment I could build, I could live here and then together

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
you furnish it, but romantic comedies

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
there's this idea that you're living in the apartment and then you look across the way

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
into another apartment and you're like, oh my god, no, that's where I'm supposed to live.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
But no, you don't just get all that. That's not what a relationship is.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
Grass is always greener. Is that what you're saying?

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Not necessarily. Yes, romantic comedies. That's

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
certainly an idea in romantic comedies, but it's just like any valuable

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
relationship. The important stuff I think is stuff that you build together

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
and the stuff that's most romantic for me with me and Dan

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
is when we have like a breakthrough

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
together as a couple. The most romantic thing is when we work

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
through something. That really means something.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Romcom's like any other movie treat romantic relationships like any

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
relationship they do, but we don't notice as much between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
as we do between the couple in

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
Sleepless in Seattle. The characters in movies have to be

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
dimensionalized. They have to be complete as individuals and then

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
they have to kind of match up perfectly and then they have to walk away

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
at the end of Casablanca saying, I think this is the start of a beautiful

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
friendship and you have to go, oh my god, I love that guy. I also love that guy.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
They're going to make a perfect couple. This is going to be great. That's how we approach

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
romance in Romcom's when the truth is a relationship is actually

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
a very codependent thing where you're like, you have a

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
if your relationship is going to have life, you're going to be creating a new

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
thing. Who cares?

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
Annie Hall is so genius because it captures this romance

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
and there's this great romance, but it ends. There's romance

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
and then there are relationships and both should intertwine,

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
but not every romance should be a relationship.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
You can stay in an apartment for a night

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
like an Airbnb, but you don't

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
rent it. Do you fight with your wife

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
Tom? You've been married. Do you

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
yell? Do you go like, shut the fuck up!

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
You're a terrible person. Are you explaining what yelling is?

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
I want to know what the definition of yelling is because I'm always

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
curious about that too. How ugly does it get? Is there a cap that other couples

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
have? It's probably about the same as any average couple.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
It's like the Kinsey thing.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
We don't know what average couples

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
do. There's no like, we don't

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
people say like, oh yeah, I had a fight with my girlfriend last night. We don't really know what that means.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
We have lines that we draw. It's like,

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
did you touch her? No, okay. No, no, I don't do that.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
It's like, how mean do you get when you fight with your lover?

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
I say terrible things. I get so mad

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
and I say awful things and then we

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
we're going to couples therapy now and I'm finding out

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
I don't have to say those things. That's not standing between me and

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
happiness. I'm just being, and I

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
apologize to my dad if he's still listening, but I am just being my dad in those moments.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
I'm possessed by some ghost.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
You didn't buy toothpaste. Why am I having a reaction to that?

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
It's an actual thing. The toothpaste fight.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
I don't know how you would answer this question honestly, but I'm just

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
really curious how a nice fellow like you, your

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
shirt looks like a nicely pressed picnic blanket.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
Your pants are clean.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
I bet if I sniffed you, I wouldn't vomit. Your shoes look

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
nice. Your wife came up to me. Your hair is

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
cut. Your face is smooth. You're a nice young

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
man. You're very nice looking. Your wife is

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
very nice. You guys look nice together. You've been married a week.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
She came up. You were in the bathroom. She's like, I want to be a good wife to my husband.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
I want you to make him happy. You guys are adorable. It's like

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Parks and Rec obnoxious.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
I want to know who the fights are. Does Parks and Rec at night

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
get community? Does it go like, fuck you.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
I don't know how you can answer that because you're such a nice

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
guy. You validate our relationship.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
First of all, on the clothing and the way she looks and everything, we're 25.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
We've had 15 weddings to go to this year. We literally came

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
from a wedding to come here. That's why I'm dressed like this. We drove from a wedding

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
to this. I'm hoping it's our last wedding of this year.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
25. Well, maybe it's different in Texas.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
If you're 25, your wedding attendance just

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
started. It's going to double every year for the next 10 years.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
By the time you're 35, you're going to have a wedding. That means by

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
my calculations, you're going to be at three weddings a day.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
Because it doesn't even really kick in until your friends

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
are 30. As for the fighting, I guess

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
we actually went to different colleges and did long distance for four years.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
A lot of my fighting

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
memories, I guess, would be over the phone. I feel like that was where

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
our fighting got the ugliest. We don't fight a lot. We really don't.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
I always feel like I hated arguing on the phone. I really don't even like talking

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
on the phone, which is not good for a long distance relationship.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
That's the only way you can really communicate or the Skype and things like that.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
I hated, because she's the type that when we argue on the phone, she'll

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
hang up. Then I call her back and she won't pick up. Then I'll call her back and she won't

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
pick up. That was always messy. When you first brought that up, that's the

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
first thing I think about is I hate any kind of argument over the phone.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
Is she hanging up because

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
you're getting overheated? Or is she hanging up because she's like... Yeah, usually I'm being an asshole

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
or something like that. She'll just get the little DDD from the iPhone.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Oh, there she goes.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
You guys sound tame.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
I just feel like I don't throw the phone at her or anything like that.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
I don't throw anything at Aaron. I just feel like a Marvel character.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
This is the way I talk to him sometimes.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
If you guys found that

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
any kind of arguing or anything, since you've gotten engaged in

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
sort of wedding planning, I noticed that the closer we got to the

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
wedding, I expected it to get more...

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
It's actually different. I expected it to get more stressful, but we actually got

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
more and more excited about it.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
You're a mutant.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
Okay, sorry. No, we both self-destructed.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
I air everything about Aaron that

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
drives me nuts and everything about me that drives her nuts. We

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
doubled down because we're coming up with a wedding. We're both unconsciously

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
going like, we're gonna marry each other, better get used to this!

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Just continue your...

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
Don't act like it's

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
my fault that music doesn't match what's going on.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
She placed random...

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
You were being Southern.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
No, I was not being Southern.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
But we also, I don't know,

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
I guess we're just all little people.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
When you get married to somebody, all of their faults

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
become magnified in a way because you're like, oh, I...

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
I think it's...

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
I also feel like this sounds like somebody who's justifying craziness, but

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
I do feel like it's because

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
I take marriage incredibly seriously. I have absolutely

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
no intention of ever getting divorced if I get married because I feel

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
like my parents' generation was kind of a little fast and loose

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
with the vows. Otherwise, we wouldn't be in the situation we're in

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
where everyone you know is raised by single parent families.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
I also think it's a bad thing to stay in a marriage for your kids

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
if that's literally the only reason you're doing it, then fucking divorce

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
each other. Your kids will thank you later.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
But I don't want to half-ass this thing.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
I don't like doing things twice. I'm very lazy.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
So when I get married, I want to stay married for a really

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
long time. And for that reason, I think it's like, I don't know,

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
all of a sudden you're coming home and every little

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
conversation has this giant weight behind it.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
And wouldn't you know it, planning a wedding, as you may know,

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
seems to involve a couple of activities

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
and things. Do you have decisions? Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
If there's anything wrong with the relationship, the weight will find it.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
I found an out where we're going to couples therapy and I'm like, Aaron

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
is just doing everything with the wedding. I'm cheating.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
I just feel like I'm cheating. Aaron's doing everything with the wedding.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
I tell her that I'm the first groom that's ever planned 50%

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
of the wedding, but I'm lying too. It's maybe 15%.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't care about weddings.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
I think they're dumb. I think ours will be good then.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Alright, well let's thank Tom Gray for coming up and talking to us about

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
I hope that you guys

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
I hope the next time we talk to you

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
maybe we'll talk to, the next time we talk to them

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
they'll have a little gray baby. Oh no, you're shaking your head.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
They're too good. They're not going to bring a child into this

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
world. I'm just fixated on the

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
words gray baby together.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
He shook his head in a way that meant to me either like

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
what's that? Five years. Oh, you're just going to wait five years?

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
Oh, okay. The way he shook his

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
and then he said seven. The way he shook his head made me think you guys were about to have your first

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
biggest fight tonight. I would be like

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
we'll see you have a baby anyway. Nope, and then he sat down and I was like oh man, we finally found a way

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
to make them like us. They're going to fight hard tonight.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
Why did you shake your head so hard? Are you excited about the wedding?

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
I'm very excited about the wedding. Alright, cool.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
That is a

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
good segue to

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
McGathey Game Corner.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
I put together

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
a theme song for Game Corner on the drive from Austin

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
to Houston. So here goes.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
What do we get

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
gameplay?

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
What do we get

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
to do?

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
What do we get to do?

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
What do we get to do?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
McGathey Game Corner.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Was that

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
a lot of that in the song? Were those farts?

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
Those were farts. Those were farts by our very own

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
Dustin Marshall, everybody.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
Those were the farts

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
that I was trying to do in the car. I was trying to record farts into the

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
laptop and Dan was like oh come on, let me and took the laptop

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
and his farts were so gross. I feel like your feelings were a little hurt because I was like your farts

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
are so disgusting. What are they supposed to be?

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
And what were those by the way? It was like wicked game.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
It didn't sound like farts.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
So we're going to play a game called Who Are You Marrying?

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
And for this game, I did a little work

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
before the show. I reached out on Twitter. I wanted to

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
find a fellow redhead female.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
So can I please bring to the stage Caroline? Caroline!

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Caroline, come on down!

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
You want to see if I can literally tell the difference between you and

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
just visually?

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
You just want to test my face blindness? I know she's the one sitting in the chair.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Thank you Caroline. If you wouldn't mind sitting in the chair.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Thank you so much.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
So Caroline and I answered the same set of questions

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to present the question

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
and I'll give two answers and you'll have to choose which one is

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
my answer. But we need someone to play against you.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
And for funsies, is there any man out here

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
who thinks they know me pretty well?

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Who could compete with Dan at knowing questions?

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah? Okay, I saw your hand first.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
Come on down there. You just maximized the chance that this podcast recording will be used

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
in a future criminal trial.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
Andrew everybody! Welcome Andrew!

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
Is there any man in the audience who thinks they know more about me than my fiancé?

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
All right.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
Okay, so...

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
I didn't catch your name, what was it? Andrew. This is Andrew.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
I'm the teacher. No matter what happens, you're

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
not calling off the wedding at this point. I say

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
let's be organic about this and just see.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
And I'm divorced so I'm good with marriage. I don't want that anymore.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
You're safe. Just in case I know more.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
I'm so sorry. Oh, here we go. Got a pen.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
Caroline, if you could position yourself in a

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
way where Dan can look at both of us a little bit.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
That's a weird way to phrase that.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
This is the way we're going to play.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
We're going to play it.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
If you answer correctly, you'll hear this.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
And if you answer incorrectly, you'll hear this.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
You heard these noises already? We're familiar with them. We like them. Like they're a family.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
All right, here we go.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Here's the first question.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
My favorite meal of all time is

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
A. Sun-dried tomato bagel with veggie cream cheese topped with tomatoes

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
or B. Buffalo mac and cheese with a crisp

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
beer and a side of spicy pickles or bourbon.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
I'll go with the

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Sun-dried bagel affair. Andrew?

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
I'm going to go with B. Mine was Sun-dried

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
bagel. Good job, Dan.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
Caroline, can you grab that microphone?

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Caroline, how are you doing? Hi, I'm excellent. How are you doing?

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
I'm doing great. What do you do, Caroline?

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
I am a leasing consultant in property management.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
It's as interesting as it sounds.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Here we go.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Caroline and her husband were the first in line.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
They came from Bat Rouge, which I always thought was a fictional place.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
Really? I thought that C.S. Lewis made up of Bat Rouge.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
It's funny, he did actually. It was named after the fact.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
It's sort of like Hobbit Town or whatever over in New Zealand.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Bat Rouge, I guarantee.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
The big easy.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
I know, but Bat Rouge is sometimes referred to as the slightly smaller easy.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
Here we go.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
Here we go. Question number two.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
My childhood best friend and I used to play a game called

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
A, the Dolly Parton game.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
We would wear our mother's sweaters, stuff them with water balloons to make boobs,

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
and then we would take turns motorboating each other.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Or B, we would basically make up ongoing soap opera-like stories

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
and a lot of those stories focused on relationships and romantic entanglements.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
And Sassy Kids Sidekicks, who are basically us.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
I think it has to be B, because I know A was mine and probably Dan's as well.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Dan, which one is me?

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
I think you're the Dolly Parton.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
That is correct. Andrew, it's not looking good for you.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
I'm not doing so well.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
But you have to understand that I'm playing a different game. If I get one of these wrong.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
You're fucked. It's two years of suffering.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
Can I get another little bit of tequila? Thank you.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Alright. I don't know if you guys feel this way on the stage,

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
and this is not cool of me to really talk about the lighting, but the way the

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
lighting is, I feel like I'm hiding in a closet with one bulb swinging back and forth.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
It's mildly terrifying up here.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
I don't know how you guys...

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
At this stage, I think it's our job to suck it up.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
You are totally right. For them.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
The lights being here to illuminate us so that they can see us.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
No, I know. I'm less complaining about the light. I feel self-conscious because I feel kind of like weird.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
You're doing a great job, Erin.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
Thank you, Andrew. Jeff who?

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
Sorry? Jeff who?

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
Next question.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
Dan, you get to answer this first. My mother's maiden name is

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
A. Hartley B. Dunkel.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
You better know this.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
A. Hartley B. Dunkel.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Oh, fuck.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
My mother is dead.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
I get...

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
I mean, it doesn't even matter at this point if I get it right,

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
because I already revealed that I...

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
don't know. So it's a matter of

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
whether I guess right, and I don't know. That would be kind of an empty victory.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
Because I could flip a coin. I think it's Dunkel.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
Alright, Andrew? Yeah, I'm going to agree with Dan. It is Dunkel.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
It is Dunkel.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Alright, Dan has three points. Andrew has one point. Andrew, you get to go

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
first in this round. Next question. When I was a kid, I was afraid that

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
A, my dead grandfather could see everything I could see,

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
so I'd close my eyes when I got out of the bathtub so he couldn't see me naked.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
Or B, I was afraid that I

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
would be separated from my family and would wander the streets forever, or that members of my

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
family would be lost forever. Sometimes Mnucho was involved.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
I'm going to guess B.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
Alright, Dan? I think...

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
Oh, shit. I think that... I don't remember you

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
ever talking about either of these things, so I'm trying to figure out which one sounds

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
more like you.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
I think that because you're inherently narcissistic, the answer

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
is the non-empathy-related one,

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
and the grandfather one involves thinking about other people,

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
so I think that it's B.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
No, I was afraid that Pinkney McGathey could see through my eyes,

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
and so I would close my eyes when I was using the bathroom

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
or getting out of the bathtub or changing my clothes.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Alright, well maybe you became narcissistic later in life.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Happy from Houston and worked for NASA. Fun fact.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
And who developed a little-known technology for NASA,

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
in which you could see through your living grandchild's eyes.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
It was actually a legitimate fear.

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
Alright, next question. My first CD was

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
A, they might be Giants, Flood,

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
or B, Glenn Miller Orchestra,

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
I believe Dan is going first.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
I think your first CD was

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
your first CD that you bought with your money?

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
No, just the first CD in your possession.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
Ah-ha, so Glenn Miller.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
Andrew? Yeah, Glenn Miller, definitely.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
That is correct!

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Caroline is much cooler than me!

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
That was her second CD. Oh, that was your second CD?

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Oh, really? You're talking to the microphone. Sorry.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
That was her second CD. That's interesting.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
Me and the same girl that used to play the Dolly Parton game would play this game called M&M

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
where we would listen to the dances and pretend we got married, and then would

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
take our hands and put them over our mouths and pretend to make out, and then we would have a baby.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Huh! Why don't more...

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Are there any gay men in the audience that are...

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
No? That's a little remarkable.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
Because I'm wondering if... Every girl I've ever talked to,

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
they're developmental years, it's like this incredible...

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
Did you not do anything like that? I've always assumed that men, boys kind of

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
did similar things. I had a best friend, I had a lot...

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
No, guys have... We don't do that. But you guys like pee together and stuff?

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
We pee together and we show each other our wieners.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Yeah, you'd like that trough in elementary school, and one guy stands on the end and you try to shoot it

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
across and hit the guy standing over there. With your pee?

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
With your dick if you're blessed.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
I mean, you'll hear the craziest shit. People will go, oh, summer camp,

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
we would do this, we would all jerk off in a bucket.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
It gets a little weird, but it's all kind of penis based

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
and the penis is a lightsaber and we would...

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
But girls, they just like, oh, almost

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
everyone I've ever talked to in their early years, there's these

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
stories where they just like, oh, this is how you socialize, you go through this stage

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
where with another girl, you practice being

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
boys and girls together. Like, well, I was Fonzie.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
I don't think it's every girl. I know for me it felt like...

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
No, I don't want anyone listening to feel weird if it didn't happen.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
For me and my friend, it really felt like an extension of playing house,

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
which girls do like to play. We like to play a lot of house.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
But with each other,

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
when I was a kid, when I was like

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
9 or 10, I think, me and my best friend

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
we started playing

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
pizza boy.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
If it had an accurate title, it would have been called pillow humping.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Because the game was

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
he and I would pretend to be pizza delivery guys.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
We would ring the doorbell of my home

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
and pretend that girls answered.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
We would walk into a living room, which we would pretend had two

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
invisible girls in it, and we were delivering pizza.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
And then we would make small talk, and we would sit down

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
each with one of these large couch pillows.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
So we're 10 years old, so there's like these 70 sofa pillows that are like

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
as big as us. And we would put our arms around them

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
and practice talking to them and be like, yeah, so what's your name?

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
And he's doing the same thing in the same room.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
We're talking to pillows. And then we would start making out with the pillows.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
And then me and my friend, I know it's the same thing

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
except the only thing different is that men have this kind of inherent

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
homophobia where we don't practice on each other.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
I think there's like a really specific line there, and I don't know if it's nature or nurture that

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
draws that line. I'm sure it's nurture because we're all human.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
But it's just so funny when I really think about it.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Because when I hear that from girls, I'm like, oh, yeah, we would come over and she'd be Pinky Tuscadero, and I'd be Fonzie.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
And then we'd go, oh, so you guys were just making out, but it was like a game.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
But now I'm really thinking about it. Oh, yeah, me and my 10-year-old friend

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
humping pillows next to each other, high-fiving

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
like celebrating how straight and awesome we are.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
Humping pillows. And then we would go climb a tree

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
and talk about, I actually remember...

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
Did you have a name? Definitely, definitely.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
That was part of the whole thing. They had names like, oh, mine's Stacy and mine's Ashley.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
I remember going and climbing a tree with my best friend

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
and I have an emotional memory,

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
a deep emotional bookmark of climbing

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
a tree with my friend after doing one of these sessions.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
And sitting in the bow

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
of a willow tree in Milwaukee in the summer breeze

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
and...

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
That's not commentary.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
Well, it's not anything. It's a random

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
sound. And me going

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
like, this is a lull in the conversation

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
and I go, yeah, I'm thinking about

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
proposing to Stacy.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
And just silence from my friend.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
And I remember just like, I don't think we ever did it again after that.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
Because I think that's the line that got drawn between the people that

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
end up at Renfaires and the people that end up, you know, at Verizon.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
I think that I was like, yeah,

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
I will, yes, what is the difference between any of this?

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
This is a real person. I'm going to...

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
It's the same. Little girls aren't socialized to not touch each other.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
It doesn't make you gay, bro.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
When we were doing it,

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
when we were play acting these things, it wasn't ever romantic. There was never a moment

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
where it even occurred to us, oh, girls, do

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
this together. This could be a sexual thing. If someone was to walk in,

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
it would look like it would, you know.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
We also took turns. We did that. We played out this long

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
story about these two young women. Because we always talked about

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
how we wanted to go to college together and then we would have an apartment.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
And so we play acted this episodic thing where we were two young, cool women

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
in the city and we both had boyfriends. But we had to pretend to be each other's boyfriends.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
And so whenever I would be like, I want to go to...we got to name

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
our boyfriends. My boyfriend's name was David, I think.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
Oh, no, your name's Dan. Sorry.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
I had a moment where I was like, oh!

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
I wish I could just play frogs croaking or something

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
random. Dan, I played the banjo because

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
it felt like an outside thing. You're in the tree.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
It's a random sound. It was banjo. It couldn't have been more disparate.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
Will you forgive me for playing the banjo? I'll forgive you, but I won't stop shaming you.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
I conditioned people. That's what I do.

53:22.000 --> 53:26.000
I punish them when they do things wrong and then they stop.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm a behaviorist. I have a question. How old was the pillow humping

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
thing? Like, just that. Because I'm a guy, so I had something like that and I'm just...

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
Wait, what do you mean how old was it? I was like 10 or 11.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Same thing like 10.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
I just realized I'm a little bit more normal, hopefully.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
But here's the weird thing about the pillow humping. That memory, with me and

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
my friend, both humping pillows next to each other,

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
looking at each other humping pillows and being like, yeah, it feels good, right, bro?

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
As part of some kind of play-acting thing, like playing house

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
and playing the role of men who are doing it to women as pizza delivery

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
guys, that... I also don't... I don't think it was

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
as sexual... I don't think it was sexual. I think we were pre-puberty

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
and we were doing this thing that there was enjoyment, there was social

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
like, endorphins or dopamine or spiking,

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
but there was no arousal because I... and the reason I know that is because

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
a couple years later, something incredible

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
happened and it was very private and I wouldn't have shared it with

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
anybody. And I also wonder if that's nature versus nurture when

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
a little boy discovers

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
physical, groin area

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
pleasure, like if it's nurture or nature that the

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
little boy immediately goes, this is a secret.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
I am Howard Hughes. I have invented something that no one else

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
can know about. I am dedicating the next 16 hours a day for the next

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
35 years to this, because I was like watching Mork and Mindy

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
and... hopefully just Mindy. I was just a

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
latchkey, hopefully, because otherwise gay bro. Right. Who wants to fuck Mork?

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
Fucking Nan, no, man.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
I was like laying on my stomach watching Mork and Mindy, looking at

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
Pam Dabber, high five, and

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
was like moving my... slowly my pelvis is moving.

55:30.000 --> 55:38.000
Music

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
But if you were looking at Mork, it would have been okay.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
Nice.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
That's an amazing meta moment. The guy saying too soon said

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
it too soon.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
And I just remember like moving and moving,

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
watching Pam Dabber and then

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
the movement... there's like a chain reaction, moving, moving, moving.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
I'm going to keep moving. I'm going to keep moving. Pam Dabber, keep moving, keep moving.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
And then the unthinkable,

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
the unexperienced, the most incredible thing that had ever happened to me

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
in my life happening, which didn't involve at the time not to get too clinical

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
did not involve any liquid, because my body was

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
just getting to that. It was like at that point.

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
All it was was just this shudder and like...

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
The last thing on my mind was my friends.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
I wanted to... like a sick cat. I wanted to go into a cave

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
and just do this by myself forever.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Six times a day.

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
My point being that that's when the real shit started.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
That's basically who I am now, is that kid. The kid who was playing

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
pizza guy and just miming coitus

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
next to his best friend in the living room. It's weird. It's like

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
it wasn't... it was sexual pantomime, but it wasn't sexual.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
So I guess guys and girls not that different.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
It's just that there is that weird... I think there's a social... is it socialization though?

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
That makes two boys not in those moments

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
reach out and or use each other. Like why wouldn't

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
we? And do some boys do that and yeah

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
all kinds of questions. I guess you guys aren't the ones to ask.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
We should have a child psychologist come up here maybe.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Maybe it's sort of like okay so

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
there's this whole theory like if you give kids less toys they're more imaginative and creative.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
Right? And they like make their own toys and do their own crap.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
Well guys kind of have a prop, if you will, like from early on.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
We don't. So we've got to come up with more shit, right?

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
That's an amazing theory.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
But I also think that all of us are weird because like you guys aren't

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
these girl stories, you're not taking off your pants.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
I've been a nanny and I've worked with many

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
many boys who do do the same thing and act out the same stuff

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
and are physical with each other. With each other? With other boys?

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
Kissing each other? Well I mean my friend never kissed. We put our hands over

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
our mouths and pretended to kiss. But I've walked in on little boys acting out

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
like prepubescent boys just acting out these

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
scenarios in the same way that girls are acting them out. It's like a three year old little girl

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
carrying around a baby doll. She's not actually wanting to have a baby

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
at three years old. You walked in on little boys

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
and it gets specific so that this pad cast can really switch into high gear.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
But also because I mean it's important distinction. What do you mean?

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
You've walked into them doing what? Because we're drawing a very fine line here.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
I humped a pillow next to my friend but girls

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
I'm saying like it's a fine distinction.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
When I was a nanny there was a time when I walked in on

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
two friends. They would be nine

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
years old acting out a doctor nurse scenario

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
which on paper would be a very

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
sexy thing. Like walked in on a like is this your

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
butt? Oh look at that. And what probably had

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
happened. What was the answer?

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
Keep searching. Is this your butt?

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
Yes

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
Yes that's my butt.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
We tend to ask that question later in life too.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
If a doctor asked me is this your butt I would definitely

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
walk out and ask for a refund. You should stop

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
going to a nine year old doctor. If you can't tell me

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I know it's not your specialization but

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
In the same way that me and my friend acted out this like apartment scenario

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I think they had seen like a movie where there's like a sexy nurse

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
doctor situation or something where they were acting it out and trying to

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
figure it out but it was like

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
it could have been a thing.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Right because you were saying one kid was naked and the other

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
kid was examining him? I don't remember exactly.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
They were in some phase of undress. There was something happening and when I

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
opened the door they were definitely ashamed about what was going on but it clearly was

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
really innocent and they weren't trying to make their bodies feel good

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
or anything. That's kind of interesting isn't it? The book of Genesis and so many origin stories

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
like self-awareness and where it intersects with

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
primal childhood sexual awareness, the Freudian impulse

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and all this stuff where it's all about this idea that

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
we were born innocent but we

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
have some kind of our awareness of ourselves and who we are

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
is simultaneous with this possibility

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
of punishment, the shame.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
The idea that we mythologize like

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
we have these gods that are like parents that they do the

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
exact same thing. They come into a bedroom and they catch us being people

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
and they say and then we immediately not before

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
that person's eyeballs touch us but

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
before that we're innocent. We're playing

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
doctor. We're just having fun. We're following our bliss

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and then it's this moment when these adult eyeballs

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
see us and even before the adult reacts we go

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
oh I'm a horrible creature. What am I doing?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
This must look terrible to you. I can't explain this. This isn't

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
what it looks like. I think that's really fascinating because

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
humans are inherently infantile as primates.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
We retain infantile characteristics into adulthood which is why we survived

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and so we're essentially like puppies or kittens or baby chimps

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
like our whole lives and we have these mythologies

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
because we're neurotic and we have these mythologies

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
where we have these parents from the clouds that walk into our bedrooms and go

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
what are you doing? And we all tell each other at 40 years

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
old we go like well you know we're pieces of shit. What are you doing?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Well we should pass a law against this and of course it's all behind

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
us like these little kids playing doctor. It's like oh we all know

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
our little wieners and our little cracks or filthy

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
little pieces of shit like horrible things that exude toxicity

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and that touching them makes us bad people in one way or another and that basically underneath

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
our clothes we're terrible gross slimy little organisms

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
that are horrible for thinking about ourselves and each other.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
We all agree on that right? So now let's get down to this Senate hearing.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
We've got neck ties on and we're talking about balancing budgets

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and how are you going to do this and protect each other from that but it's like we're just little babies

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
that just want to look at each other's little no-nos.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
We've got four points and Andrew has two.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Alright I believe this is...

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Like this whole time the whole audience was like fuck where are they going to get back to that game?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Jesus Christ it's like the Dukes of Hazard just jumped over the ramp.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
How are they going to land?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Alright that was my joke. Alright so we're going to go

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
from now on I'm just going to ask each of you individual questions.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm not going to have each of you answer the question.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So Dan this is your question. Here we go.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
My ultimate dream vacation would be going on a cattle drive with my closest

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
friends where we heard cattle on horseback and sit around a campfire

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
every night and share secrets or

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I would really love to just randomly explore different

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
countries on a whim. Maybe I'd start with Morocco.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
You're the cattle drive.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Yay!

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Alright.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Here we go. The applause has become

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
like it's just like water dripping out of a bad

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
shower head.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Okay. Here we go.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Next question. My favorite color is a yellow

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
all sunshine all of the time or B red more specifically

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
in orangish red like persimmon. The red the orangish red.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yellow. That is correct Andrew.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Andrew? Andrew's correct? Yeah.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Oh whoops. So that was for me.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Yeah it is persimmon. Alright. Next question.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
My least favorite mode of transportation is

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
a driving. I love my car but other cars scare me

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
or B a cruise ship. This is Dan's

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
question. Cruise ship.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
That is correct.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Good job. Alright. Andrew

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
If I was reincarnated as a building

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I would be A

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
a brown brick pottery studio with cherry wood floors and stained glass windows

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
or B an

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
amazing 100 year old observatory on a hilltop.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Well you put amazing in the second one so I would have to think

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
it would be the one that's amazing. Nope

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Caroline is amazing.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Good job. Alright.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So here we're at

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
5 points and 5 points

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
loved the conversation about the kids psychology. I thought that was great.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
There's 30 questions left.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I want to do one more question

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
about how I choose to die if I got to choose

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
how I died. And this is for both of you.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
A bravely pilot a spaceship filled with

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
evil people into the sun. They celebrate

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
that every day, that every year, they celebrate that day

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
every year with festive cakes and amazing parties and all of my favorite music

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Oh and I pilot that spaceship into the sun when I'm ancient and ready to go

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
anyway. Or B, I get drunk on Prosecco and Aperol

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
and fall asleep in a vat of marshmallow fluff. When I sleep

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
while I sleep I sink deeper into the fluff and eventually suffocate

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
in my sleep.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I think you want to drive evil people into the sun and

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
be celebrated with cake. Yeah, that's the way to go.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
No, I want to get drunk and pass out.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I kind of admire the other person

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
but I'm glad we learn something every day. That's good.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Thank you, that was the game.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Yay!

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Yay!

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I'm having an out of body

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
experience. She's leaving. Caroline everybody.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Thank you Caroline, thank you Andrew.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Alright. You guys were awesome. Let's bring Spencer to the stage!

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Spencer, get up here!

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Oh god!

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Oh shit!

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Oh fuck!

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Leaping like a gazelle to the stage.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
We did it! We did it!

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And we're doing it! You know what I hate you guys?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I hate when I cough like this and people

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
bless me like I'm sneezing. It's the worst fucking thing

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
on the planet. I can't elaborate how much I hated.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It doesn't make sense, it's someone being thoughtful about me

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
and it pisses me off.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Because you're worried that because your cough is being misinterpreted as a sneeze

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
that maybe there's something medically wrong with you? No, worry has literally nothing to do with it.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Well what pisses you off about it? They're wrong.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'm not sneezing. You fucking idiot.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
But you strike me as a person who probably already has fundamental problems

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
with the whole sneezing bless you gazuntite thing because that's not logical at all.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So I'd rather no one said anything. And now when you're doing it in the wrong situation

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
what the fuck man?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It's not okay, it's terrible. Did that just happen

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
right before you came on stage? No, it happens every fucking day of my life.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
There's a poetic irony there because it's like if you sneeze and someone

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
says bless you, what's your reaction? Do you think fuck you?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Now I have to respond? Thank you for saying something at me that I didn't ask

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
fuck off. It's like now I have to play a politician

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
and be like oh yes, that's what you're supposed to do. Good job

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Ian. I once sneezed in my 20s. I sneezed

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and my girlfriend's sister said

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
bless you. You were like never again. No, no, no.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
We went about our business and then five seconds later she went, you're

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
welcome. And I was like wait a minute, what?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
What kind of endless chain of fucking rules

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
are we engaged in? It's very hard for her to say bless you.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
She wanted, yeah, it's like I didn't know those were one of the rules.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You know what else is weird and uncomfortable? When you check into a hotel

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
and you go into the bathroom to take a nice, you know, hotel dump

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and you spy something on the door

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
that is a small stain. Now I mean I don't need a clean hotel

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
room, trust me. It could be as stained as possible. But this stain

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
was right out about waist level. Like if one was standing

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
up in front of the toilet facing the door, perhaps a

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
male. I'm saying it was semen. There was semen

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
on the door of my hotel room. Not in Houston. You guys are great. In Austin this

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
happened. But no one's ever going to

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
mistake your stains for Austin stains.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I may sometimes call you the Rock City, but if I'm looking

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
at a cum stain, I know I'm in Austin.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yeah, I mean I don't really have anything we're going to go with that because

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I just let it slide. I want to be clear on this though, because you're in your bathroom

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
you're saying at waist height, if you're facing the door

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
are you saying someone stood up from the toilet and jerked off at the door?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Yeah, to shoot onto the door. Why would anyone ever do that? Why would anyone

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
invite themselves over to Dustin Marshall's house as a friend

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and do that to his closet door? Because that's

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
something that apparently people do. It's not cool, but it happens. Wait, are you saying that people

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
come on Dustin's door? Yeah, every day. I make a killing.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Wait, what? I charge people.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Dustin is shrugging like you're making all of this up.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Well, I am. I don't charge people to come on his closet door. Dustin,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
can you come over for a second? Yes. Dustin Marshall everybody.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
This involves come

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and also you help us. Dustin Marshall.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Hi.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
We've turned into Howard Stern now because you're like Baba Booey. I am the Baba Booey. I want to be Fred

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
but I'm Baba Booey. So Dustin, your friends come over and instead

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
of bringing a bottle of wine, they come on your closet door.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
So Spencer told me this story. It was kind of amazing that first you were in a hotel room

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and you switched. Yeah, because it was a non-smoking room

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
that smelled like cigarettes and I thought that if I stayed, they'd charge me 500 bucks.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
And so you asked to go to a different room and then upon the

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
room you went in, you noticed just a jizz stain on the back of the door. And I should clarify, it wasn't

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
just a stain. It was like the desiccated crust.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
All that was remaining after all fluids have evaporated

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
out of it, just like a cobweb. Something

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
you recognized has come. Oh no, I mean I had to taste it before I was

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
sure. That's when I knew.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Wait, so okay. Alright, so

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
he told me this story and I used to be in a band when I was like 15 and

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
all the guys in my band were a little bit older than me and we never hung out at my house. So they're like,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
why don't we hang out at your house? And I was like, okay, so they came over and I was like

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
looking a frozen pizza upstairs. For them. For them. Because you're such a good host. I checked

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
my America online, I was kind of taking my time and they were all downstairs like

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
hanging out and then I went downstairs, they ate the pizza

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
and they were all like later and they all coasted. That means left.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
They're left. For those of you who aren't ninja

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
turtles. Or

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
background actors in a

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
honeycomb commercial, they left.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Alright, they left.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Sorry, let me clarify. If you haven't recently been

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
rollerblading in a sunny delight commercial,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
what happened is they left. They left the premises.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But they ate the pizza and then they left

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
and then my phone rang at my house and I answered it

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and they were just all on speakerphone laughing and they were like

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
look in your closet. I had this weird like walking closet and then

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
on the back of the door, I was upstairs for maybe 15 minutes. There's three guys.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
They took turns jacking off in my closet and then

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
ejaculating on the back of my door. So there was

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
visibly through all this different semen on the back of my door.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
All these different semen. No, no. It was all these different

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
things. It wasn't like it was the top.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
This is why little boys need to pretend this stuff when they're kids.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
How is it the first time I'm on this show? This is what it is.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Is there more to the story? Because if you're done with that story

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I need you to tell a different story. Tell us about in New York with the cops.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
No, wait, come on, hold on.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
The cops jizzed on his closet. Everyone just heard this story about three guys

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
that came over to your house and came on your door. They were my best friends and then

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
they were like Schrabbing me in the worst way.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
They literally came into his house. They rapidly like unwocked out of the

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
room. You guys like Velveeta, I'll go get some slices. Don't coast.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And you left. Don't coast.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And they all must have exchanged a look like are you thinking

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
what I'm thinking? No. And none of them went, what?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
There was not one among them that was like, guys, guys, guys.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
What have we become? I feel like they must have come

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
to his house with the underdog. They had to have a meeting. It was pre-planned.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It was pre-planned. Go over to the commercial's house.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
When you said come to his house, I thought you meant they came to the idea of Dustin's

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
house while they're jerking off in order to come.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Well, it was a walk-in closet. I mean, come on.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
The stone, the cement.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Look at this. The island or the kitchen.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Got the through, the feng shui.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
But it was non-sexual. It was just aggressive.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
It was vandalism. It was vandalism in the worst way.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
But at some point it had to be sexual for them. They had to come thinking about something.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Not when you think they must have been coming, thinking about was each other.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
How great friends they were. Yeah, it's a little

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
bromophobic. I mean, at that age, you just poke your dick and it starts

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
spurtin'. I mean, you don't have to think about sexual things.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You're 15. And knowing is half the battle.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
If you're listening,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
just poke it and it'll do the rest.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I am aware of that, but I would always still, I had to think about

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
like Shira or, you know, Penny

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
from Inspector Gadget. I was her age.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So it was okay.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It was always something I was thinking about while I was

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
just wanting your friends are like, let's do it.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
They must have had some phrase for it too. They had to have shorthand.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Let's cream pie his closet, bro.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
This must have been like the seventh person they've done this to. Let's narnia dust it.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Yeah, it was specifically.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That's it. God. Let's narnia junk.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I'm done.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
You guys don't know. Our entire travel is

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
made up of razzing me. I was going to say

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Dan and I love Dan and I love making fun of Dustin.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Maybe they just were like us and they just had so much joy.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I would never come on anything that Dustin, anyone

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
ever owned. I would never do that as a way of asserting my

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
ego. I would never go, hey, I came on something. What I would

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
do is, you know, it came on everything in my home.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
The same guy, we would hang out at his house all the time

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
and then he had a couch and then he had cable TV

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
so he could like order movies and stuff. So there was an area of his couch

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
that was like three feet in diameter that was just like brown and black and then

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
we were like, what's wrong with your carpet? He's like, oh, that's where I jerk off.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
He would lean against his couch with his arm up and then he would come all over his floor

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
for years and it was just a diameter.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
He never cleaned it up. So this is the person we're talking about.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Dude, I'm from Wisconsin. I feel like you grew up in the

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
one character in Grand Theft Auto 5, the guy from the

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Inland Empire. Like, what's that guy? Like, yeah.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
That sounds like, I mean, here's the

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
truth. As a teenage boy, like

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I came a lot and I did

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
it.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I do think that teenage boys, like

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I think you think that you're the only one coming that

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
much and I do think you license yourself to be like, well, this is my...

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
We do all kinds of weird stuff because nobody's telling us. There is no

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
class where the gym teacher says, guys, you're going to come everywhere

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
all the time. Use a Kleenex. What would that class be called?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Sex Ed, but it's not. It's always your gym teacher

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
going, hey, you're going to go through some changes. My nipples got hard.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Fuck off. Here's a film from the 60s.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
It's called Little Boy, Little Man.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And it would just be like a diagram of your balls filling

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
up with com and you'd be like, yeah, no shit Sherlock. I know.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And then you'd go home and deal with it. I dealt with it

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
against the door of my bedroom. It was supposed to be like

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
punk rock. We're in a punk rock band, so it was supposed to be

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
like a punk rock thing, I guess, but they were gross.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I don't hang out with any of them anymore. I hang out with you guys. They jizzed on everyone's

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
closet doors. It became a huge thing for a while.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
We got to the bottom. Your friends were

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
full of com and they felt like it was a way to express themselves.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I want to hear the New York City thing though. Which one?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
With the cops. The cop in my car?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Oh, I was in New York City.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Can I just play a very appropriate music bed very low underneath the story?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
She doesn't have a great record for this.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
It may just be like a flight of the bumblebee.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
That'd be good. Or maybe it will be great

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and Dan will look at me and be like teammate?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I will. Definitely. I will be very excited.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You have to control the volume though.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Okay, so I was in New York for Harmontown and then

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I kind of got dropped off and I was kind of left to my own device and I was there for like a day and a half.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And then I was like, oh man, everybody in New York is really

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
cool and collected and stylish and nice. Like in LA

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I just hear people bitching out loud and yelling at people all the time.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And then I got an Uber and I was going to a bar

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
and then, wait, what is this? Breaking Bad. Oh, cool.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And then I was going to a bar and my Uber driver, I was in an

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
SUV and we were stuck in traffic and then he wanted to take a right turn

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
and there was a New York City cop just standing in the middle of it.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And my Uber driver was like, yo, he's like, this guy lives right here, can I just go?

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Fuck you. The cop is. The cop starts into the windows down and he's like, this guy lives right here

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
and he's like, fuck you, show me your license. Show me your license. You live here and he was

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
in the car grabbing at me. He was like, show me your license. Show me your

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
license. Show me your fucking license. And then it was like, I just sat there

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
frozen and I was like not showing my license. And then the Uber driver

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
drove away and he goes, I'm so sick of this. The NYPD

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
whenever they're doing something crooked they just shut down the street. Whenever there's something they don't want you to see

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
they'll just shut down streets. That's the story I told Spencer.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I think it's an amazing story that needed to be podcast.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Okay. But, and then like next 24

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
hours I was hanging out with a Harmontown fan and there was a

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
homeless guy on the bench and he was like calling her a cunt and a whore and stuff. So I was like, oh,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
okay, I got a dose of the New York City thing. You were saying

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
where's the cop when you need him? But yeah, yeah.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Spencer is, all right, why do you use the C word for this lovely lady?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Spencer is, you know, very active in the

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
awareness of police brutality. Spencer hates cops.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
No, we all did. I thought I did. Spencer. I think I hate

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
cops less than I portray to be honest. I just, their crimes need

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
to be publicized. Yeah, I think that

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
probably you and I would both agree that there's probably, I don't know, there's a good chance

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
if there's 200 people in the theater, one of them might be a cop. And he's probably a good

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
cop by the numbers. Might be a really great guy. I might like hang out and

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
talk and be a human being and actually be a wonderful person. I

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
bet like cops by default do wonderful things all the time. Yeah, one of my best friends

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
is a cop.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
But there, I mean, I think that the general

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
way in which we approach the policing of humanity

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
is flawed. Yeah, it could be better. And it is expressed in individual

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
moments through a random person who has been given either too

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
much or too little power in some situation and is expressing his grief

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
with that in a really inappropriate way. The

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
system is broken, definitely. I personally don't like

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
the idea that insurance is somehow involved in

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
law. I have a big problem with the incredibly intricate

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
weird braiding of capitalism and government. I think it's

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
weird that we have these papers called insurance in our glove

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
boxes. And if you don't have them, you're not allowed to drive and a guy with a gun

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
could pull you over and tap on your window and ask to see proof

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
that you're sponsored by a corporation to drive in case you collide

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
with another corporate sponsored individual. And I don't like the fact that

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
when we have a problem with this stuff, everyone defaults to these human

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
issues and says, well, have you ever been hit by a person that doesn't

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
have insurance? Because it really sucks. My brother's spine got all fucked up

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
and the other driver didn't have insurance. And it's fucked up. Like, no, that's

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
not proof that we need to exist in a flawed system. That's just you saying

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
it sucks that a system sucks. And that united

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
flight shit when you go, oh, yeah, everyone

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
overbooks their flights because they're all fucked up. And then people are tweeting at me like, oh,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
all airlines overbook their flights because of no shows.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
We criminalize the human population. We constantly

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
look at each other as the problem. How could we be the problem?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
We're the fucking end and beginning of it all. We invented

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
systems so that we could be who we are. How could we ever be the problem? Why are we

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
constantly looking at each other and saying, hey, yeah, you know why they have to do

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
that? Because some people come on your door.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
You know, it's for door comers. They have to do that. It's like

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
if a hotel, if we went into a hotel and there was like, you couldn't get into the

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
bathroom without unzipping a zipper or calling

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
for permission to go pee, you might as well live in it. And it's like,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
oh, why do we have to do that? And they go, you know about door comers?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Spencer had somebody come on his door. No, we don't live in that.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Spencer had to go into a bathroom and he had to look at come on his bathroom door and it's like, oh,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
it's something that happened to him. Anyone can

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
pretend, anyone can bring up some weird scenario. It's like, oh no, humans are the

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
criminals. Humans are the bad people. Humans are the things you need to defend against.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Are you kidding me? Systems are the things you need to defend against. Those things will fuck you

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
over. Those things aren't human, therefore cannot fail. They will only

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
get better at being systems. People are only good

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
at being people. They will only ever get weaker and weaker as their systems get more and

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
more successful. You have to guard against systems. You have to be skeptical of them.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
You have to look at politicians and say, you're probably full of shit. I don't

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
care how much you impressed me. You're always probably full of shit.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
If you represent anything, you must be full of shit. I will assume

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
that first and you can impress me later. And yet we don't do

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
that in our comment sections and all this stuff. We always blame each other.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
We're always so angry at each other for being poor and being fallible

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
and being human. We get so mad. We go like, you know these fuck faces and fucking

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
assholes and we're talking about our neighbors. We're talking about each other.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
It drives me nuts. It makes me want to punch you all in the face because you're all assholes.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Well, I think you're taught

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
to hate your neighbor. Your neighbor makes too much noise. You call the cops. Your neighbor's

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
tree grows over your yard. You call the cops. And by the way, the cops never show up. The tree

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
situation never gets rectified. But you get conditioned that that's what you're supposed to do. You're

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
supposed to tell on your neighbor to the teacher. You're not supposed to go work it out with them.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
You're supposed to call this number. The number never fucking solves anything. It doesn't solve anything.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
But that's the only thing you're supposed to do. Because if you got along with your neighbors,

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
like if you policed your own block and you saw cops doing

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
shit. That's called anarchy. That's called terrorism. That's not allowed.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That's not government. That doesn't work. If your block

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
had its own identity, if you were the 1700 block of Fifth Street

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
and nothing came between your neighbors and the outside

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
world, that's called fucking sovereignty. That's called

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
self-actualization of a community. That's what gang members get right. Because they take over

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
blocks and cops won't go there. Cops won't go there. We're advocating

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
everything that will get us arrested.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
We should all just let our neighbors coast where they want to coast.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
That's why this great city of Austin is so great. Houston.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Oh shit.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I have a scientific question for the three of you.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Just in time. The come on the door.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
You saw the come on the door. I don't

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
ejaculate. You don't. I don't. And I don't know

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
if I would. It's not something that would stick out to me in the same way that when you learn a new

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
word, you hear it all the time. Do you see

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
come on things all the time? Or am I going to start seeing come on things?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I think we all come on things at an early age and so it's easy to

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
recognize when you're coming on things all the time. But I mean like at the hotel

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
room, are you like oh cool, come. Or like on the stage? Or like I mean it's in everywhere

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
and like where does it stop? Well you know the whole black light thing

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
like when you run a black light over a hotel room, you can spot semen and it's like

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
an epidemic. It's a Spencer situation. It was just there.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
I'm wondering if I see it and I think it's like a plaster of Paris or something.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I think you know when you see it. I don't know.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
You can mistake it for a few things like I don't know like old clear

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
shower gel or maybe

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
an overly viscous spittle. I know that I have

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
been in bathrooms and hotels before and been like they really should control their

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
come.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I think Justin said it exactly

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
right. Did you say it? You have

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
a vague memory from your little kid and you're coming 900 times a day.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
That's when you're coming inappropriately.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And you come in weird places so you actually do remember

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
what it looks like when it sucks. Like it sucks come from 500 feet away.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
But I think as you get older you come less and less

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
and you also come in more appropriate places.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You'd have to go to like

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
well now I'm going to get into a

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
weird. Say it. Say it. No I was going to go down a road

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
of like where would you see 12 year olds come. I don't know.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Through your own eyes. I don't know.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
This is what happens when you bring me on stage. We're talking about 12 year old

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Justin. Will you stay up here

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
and play D&D with us? Wow this is crazy.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000
This is insane.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Let me check the recorder. One second.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
We need one more person to play D&D.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
What's the category? Do we

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
pick someone randomly? This is my worst nightmare.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
There are some people

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I don't know. Pick someone randomly.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
It's hard to pick people randomly and I feel like a weird Baptist revival.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I hate choosing

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
because you're not choosing other people and I don't know what criteria to use.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Spencer how would you choose if you were to choose?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I'm closing my eyes and I'm feeling the audience.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Who's behind this hand?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Oh shit it's that guy. That guy.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I'm sorry everybody. I'm really sorry.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
He ripped off that bandage.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
What is your name?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Nick. Nick everybody.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
We're going to do a thing really quick though. Good job Nick. Everyone that had your

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
hand raised, raise your hand again. What's your name?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
What's your deal? Nothing. Awesome. How do you know when you're finished?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Hello sir what's your name? Luis. What's the best thing about you?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I have depression and I do improv. You have depression and you do improv?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I was preparing for a different question.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I didn't mean to go around and put everybody on the spot. I just wanted to touch

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
everybody's soul. Just say anything.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Just do it Luis. Holy shit he really does do improv.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Hello what's your name? Jessica. Jessica anything you want to say?

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I miss home. You miss home? You're from California?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
What part of California? Orange County. Orange County.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
This is fine. You're fine in Houston. What's your name?

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I'm Seth. Hi Seth. Hi. I'm also from Milwaukee.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Oh from Milwaukee? Okay. Shorewood. You're better off in Houston.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Okay. This is easy. I'm Tim. My parents got divorced today.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Your parents got divorced today? Well broke the news. My mom broke the

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
news to my dad. My dad is an asshole. Oh Jesus.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Well good for your mom. But you're still pretty young.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
How old are you? 23. I'm going to pay for my car because

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
it's under my dad's insurance and I don't want to talk to him.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
How much do you have left to pay on it? It's five grand

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
five grand? Jesus Christ. Can't you just leave it on the street somewhere

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
and what's going to happen? But then you can't get another car. Alright. Tough times for

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
what's his name? Alright. Dad's a cheating asshole.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
What's up with you? I'm Michael and I want to see if Spencer used my dice for D&D.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Oh this guy wants you to use his dice for D&D. I'll do it. Yeah.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Alright. Your name's Michael. Alright. Speaking of coming on doors.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Michael's dice. If you print Michael's dice on the right

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
font, that could win an Oscar as a screenplay. Michael's dice.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
If Michael's terminally ill, that could be a fantastic.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Denzel Washington is the uncle that comes up with a cure.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Michael's dice. And the winner is

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Toby Smith for Michael's dice. What's your name? Isaiah's.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Isaiah's. It's like just a plural of a regular name.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
That's correct. Your parents are like, your dad was like, should we name him Isaiah?

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And your mom's like, not important enough. He's like, how about Isaiah's?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
That's exactly what happened. Alright. What's going on with you?

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
You got the pulpit? Well, my friend Matt couldn't

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
show up, so I just want to say hi to Matt. He had to go to work. I told him to skip work.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Matt, you fucking suck. He was hoping

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
somebody would say something like that. Where's Matt work?

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000
He works at Kroger. Kroger? Yes. Yeah.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000
They sound like they're an evil corporation. They are.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
They sell groceries and stuff. Oh, Kroger.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Leonard gets his groceries there on community.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
But he calls it Kroger's because he's a little

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
he liked that Leonard food reviews.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Come on, you're a big fan of community.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Leonard likes this. Remember the Leonard food review?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I'm really proud of it. Come on. It's fantastic.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
What's happening with you? I'm a

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
teenager and I think I'm the only teenager here for some reason.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
And your conversation is very uncomfortable.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Your come conversation is very uncomfortable.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Our come conversation made this teenager uncomfortable.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Like you're not coming right now.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
It's for obvious reasons and we don't feel sorry for you.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
It's only uncomfortable because you're living the dream.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
For the rest of us, it's just nostalgia.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
No, sorry, kid.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I'm sure if you sued the show for warping your brain,

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
my lawyers first evidence would be everything on the Internet.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Hello. I'm Ryan.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
This is a weird conversation.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Anything you want, I've just got the mic in your face.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I just want to say I really like Rick and Morty.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Me too.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Season two is coming soon.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
What do you hope I didn't do wrong?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I'm really nervous I fucked up the second season.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I know I nailed the first season obviously.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I'm really worried about the second season.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I'm always worried about everything. I think it'll be great.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
You guys are right. It'll be fine.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
You saw one of the animatics at the convention and you liked it.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
You guys will be fine. What's happening over here?

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
We just give me Justin Roiland's phone number.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000
No, you can't have Justin Roiland's phone number.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Because I would cut it on my profits.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Did someone tap me on the back?

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
You were comforting me.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Dan for the podcast listeners is walking through every single aisle.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Probably about 20 aisles coming in the crowd.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000
It's easy to do at the Alamo Draft House because they have these nice, beautiful, luxuriant aisles.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
What's happening here? I'm Ryan too.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Ryan too. He's an android from the Crab Nebula.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
What's on your mind? Good luck on your marriage.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I've been divorced twice.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Is there a person who's made...

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
We don't want to call it a mistake. You followed your heart.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Is there something that you did that we cannot do?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I like the metaphor about building the space together.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
That's what you've got to do. Thinking about it as a third entity, as our couples therapist said,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
you got you and you got the other person. Those are individuals.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
They can be fucked up. They're whatever.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
That's like a bank or a company. It's an LLC.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
You invest in it.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
It's a little Kroger's that you go to.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
That's what we're working on. Do you have two divorces?

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Do you ever think, oh man, one of those. I really fucked up.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Do you think, oh good, I'm glad both of those marriages are over?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
You only have those two choices.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
How old are you? 38.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000
What was with the first divorce where you're like, I'm going to get married again?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000
The first, the second marriage was the one that I thought was going to be

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
the real one, the inventory.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
The first one was I was a little young.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
The second was like, oh, I think I know what I'm doing now.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Now I'm getting married at full control.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Wait, what? A woman?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Do the two of them couple together?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Do you have any wisdom as a 38-year-old twice divorcee?

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Don't get married.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I think you were about to say.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I have no wisdom.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Try again.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000
How long were your divorces? How long did it take to officially...

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
No, each divorce. My parents divorced for nine years.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Pretty quick, about six months.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I just want to recap. The guy who's been married twice

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
says you just got to try again.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
That's his secret. It could be looked at as the secret to a happy marriage

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
or the secret to perpetual divorce.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
It could be that just trying again is the problem.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I've been divorced seven times.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I don't know what it is.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
You keep getting married.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I'm trying to quote my own show.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
A couple more rows here.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I think this is working out really well.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm Grant. I'm talking to my buddy that I grew up with, Casey Rupp.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
He specifically told me not to name drop.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
We've been talking about how cool it is that Dustin's up on stage.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
I want to apologize for name dropping him.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Good to see you, man.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
He works at Starburns. He's an amazing guy.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
He's a Harmontown feral fanatic.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Hey, Dan, I just had my one year anniversary at Starburns.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Thank you so much for allotting me a job.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Back to the community. Not in any actual philanthropic way that would benefit sick people.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Why is Casey not flown out here?

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Casey's human garbage. What are you talking about?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Why is Casey not flown out here?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Why is the doorman at Trump Tower not flown out for Donald Trump's birthday?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Donald's got a birthday to focus on.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
What's up?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
This guy, an opportunity to rethink. It seems like Spence is really good at spotting cum.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:40.000
This guy used his access to the microphone to do a pretty good callback.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000
He just wants to warn you, Spencer.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
He wants to warn the guy that gave you his dice.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000
If there is cum on the dice, sorry to the teenager who's apparently traumatized by allotuckup.com.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.000
It's somehow mysteriously worked his way into a cum conversation warehouse.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
We'll see. We'll find out.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Spencer's going to open the dice and we'll see what's on him. Hello.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Hi. What's on your mind?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Just being here. Did you have your hand up or am I like accosting you?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I had it up.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Is there anything pushing on your frontal lobe that you want to cum out of your mouth?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Too soon to say the word cum.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Us ladies don't do that.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
We don't cum.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Is there anything that you wanted to share?

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Oh gosh.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Hey, Dan, you missed two down here just so you know.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I'm coming back that way.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I got one more. I got a couple of stragglers.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I don't understand. She had her hand up and then I'll be confused about that for the next three years.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Hello.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Hello. I'm Adam.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
What's going on?

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I'm just sitting here.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Another one of these.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I got my arms really tired but not because I was jacking off like the teenager over there.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
What in the world?

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
That's why people aren't as tired.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000
The preamble is your arms tired.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Now the microphone's in your face. That's a new condition.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
How are you going to deal with that?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I don't know. See what happened was I had something planned and then I forgot what it was while I was waiting.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Nice.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Megathe, you're all right.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Sound bites are...

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I'm back on board.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I'm coming back down.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
We got a couple stragglers.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
That was nice. I like that. I was able to ease my social anxiety.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I also like that the way this cinema is designed, I can be like Donahue.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Donahue was a talk show host.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
What's happening with you?

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Hi.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.000
First of all, I don't remember what I was going to ask.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
He was going to ask something and he says he has a joke in his face.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Please speak in the microphone.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I'm forgetting.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
All right.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
She's shriveling up into her friend's armpit.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
What's on your mind?

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I had two friends who really wanted to be here tonight but unlike teenagers, they couldn't come.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
He had a bit.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
He's been waiting 20 minutes for that.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
You know what I think might have happened there?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Everyone raised their hand and cast a wide net.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
You told people to keep their hands up but you didn't say why and then you just started doing stuff to them.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Don't you think it's implied that if you have your hand up, the microphone is going to be in your face

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
and you're going to be accountable to the public?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
After the 14th person.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Don't you think if the 16th person is like, hey, how do you tell a three-legged pollock from an octopus?

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Everyone's like, how?

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And they're like, I forgot.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Don't you think they deserve to be booed?

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Maybe.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
No, not booed.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Nobody should be bullied but what are you going to do?

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Hello.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Can you reveal anything about the next Ricksy Minutes episode?

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
The next Ricksy Minutes episode.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:38.000
The format of the episode is that Justin goes in the VO booth and makes up crazy shit

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and then he thinks to try to make sense around it.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000
What can I reveal about the next one?

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Not much. They're watching TV again so there's...

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I can't really reveal anything about it.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
So let's enter the best part of the show.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Let's place in Dungeons & Dragons!

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Now there's some...

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Sorry, sweetie. What?

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Nothing. I was going to do the same thing you were going to do.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
We were in San Francisco and then we were in Austin and those podcasts haven't even aired yet.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:18.000
So even though on one hand you guys have to actually listen to the narration,

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.000
which Spencer always luxuriously provides, the good news is, as you probably know,

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000
we move about five feet per podcast episode.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
So there's not that much catching up to do.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.000
But yeah, just in case you're basing it on the last podcast episode you listened to, we've done two since.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
That's all. That's what you're going to say, right?

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Dustin, why don't you play Quark?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Well, I have the sheets. Just pass them out top to bottom style.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Okay, cool.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I think that makes him Quark.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I'd like to play Dignity, my character.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I'd love you to play Dignity.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Thank you, Spencer.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
I forgot. What's your name, sir?

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Nick. Nick is playing Christopher. There you go.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
And Aaron, do you have music?

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I do. I do have music.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Cool. Thank you.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
There you go. Quark and Dignity, my betrothed.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Oh, shit.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
All right.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
When we last met, our heroes had found themselves in a mausoleum.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Striking out from Rosebook, the party was on the road to Farnheim, the frozen city,

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
to confront Admiral Darkstar once again.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Burning with passion, but devoid of directionality.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Our gang ran into a child known as Lil Baskins,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
a scrappy and industrious chap who offered to guide the party through the wilderness

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and lead them to Farnheim.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Quark traded his greatsword for the boy's stick,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
which turned out to be a magical weapon.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Lil Baskins warned of highwaymen and took a detour through a graveyard.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Their dignity tried to get to know the boy,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
who was suspiciously uncomfortable with discussing his life,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
leading the gang to suspect he may be a ghost.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Confronting the boy, he revealed his ghastly past,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
and after an emotional bonding experience,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
decided to trust the little ghost,

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
even as he led them into a dank crypt.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
But where were they going?

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Was Lil Baskins really trustworthy?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
And how would going into an underground mausoleum

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
get them into the Northern Highlands?

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Find out next on an all-new Harmontown!

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I mean, I...

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
One of the most frustrating things about doing this three-city tour

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
without it being podcasts is I really want to tweet about

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
how much I love Lil Baskins.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Such a great, fun character's name to say.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Lil Baskins.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
It's great, right?

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Yeah, so it's like this little newsy kid that we met in a town,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
and it turned out he's a ghost, right?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
But you guys were pretty cool with him.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Yeah.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
He's a ghost, yeah.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
He's going to guide us.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Yeah, and so now we're going into a mausoleum.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Yeah, okay.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
That's what's happening.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
You already explained it.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
You're in an overstocked graveyard.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
You see gray tombstones stabbing out of the sickly green grass?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Let me give you that guy's dice.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Sorry.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Yeah, I'll need that.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Look for comb.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000
As well as you see the sun burning through the misty gray cloud cover.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
A large mausoleum stands sentry over the legions of gravestones in the yard.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
It's heavy stone doors, completely ajar.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Cold darkness lies inside.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Lil Baskins.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Is this a shortcut you take to the great beyond?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Yeah, we have to go through here so we avoid all those highway men that I warned us about earlier.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
We trust you, Lil Baskins.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Thanks, man.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Lil Baskins, when you were alive, did you come a lot?

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
No, I was, wait, what does that mean?

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Oh, sorry.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
What age is Lil Baskins, like, permanently?

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
He looks about 12.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Okay.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Sharpie, as a paladin, I'm going to ask you to keep your distance from Lil Baskins.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
No, I shouldn't be talking to him about this.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
No, we don't need to discuss it.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
We can talk about it later.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I think you should just keep your distance.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I'll just go behind the door.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
All right, so we're walking through the...

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I mean, you were outside of a mausoleum.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I follow Lil Baskins.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I follow as well.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
All right.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
What about the rest of us?

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Yeah, I'm going to follow.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Just making sure.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I'm going to, just for safety.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Everybody's walking through the door?

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Yeah.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I'm going to stand outside the door and just kind of keep watch, but I'm not going to enter the room.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Nice.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Cool.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Yeah, you don't have to coast if you don't want to.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I'm going to draw my sword.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I'm just going to have my sword at us while we're walking through the...

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Is that what a neutral milk hotel would do?

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Is that what you do?

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
All right, so you enter the mausoleum.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Inside you see, amid the darkness, several statuettes, each about a foot high bordering an ornate brick pathway that leads to a large five foot sculpture of a robed female holding a wide shallow dish as if an offering.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Worst mausoleum ever.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
That's supposed to just be little rooms with dead people.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I inspect the statue and see if I can read anything.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
There's no inscription, but the woman looks to be maybe 20 years old.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
She's a statue.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Yes.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Sorry.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I look inside the gold dish that she's holding.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
There's nothing.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Also, it's not gold.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I don't know where you got that.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I thought I heard you.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I don't know.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I don't remember something.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Okay.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Little Baskins, who is this woman with this empty non-gold bowl?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I don't know.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
There's no inscriptions anywhere on this mausoleum.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Well, Baskins, do you just pass through the mausoleum or do you don't know what it's for?

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Well, I mean, we're using it as a passageway.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
That's more important than who is buried here to me right now.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
So usually you just keep walking.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
You don't usually stop and look at this shit?

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Well, I did.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
But like I said, there's no inscriptions anywhere.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
You can't really learn anything.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
There's just pictures.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
I don't know.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000
The fact that we're stopped here right now instead of just continuing moving, it's only because we have curiosity.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
It's not because you wanted to stop.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Oh, well, no.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
We got to close all the doors before we can proceed.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Which doors?

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
The doors to the outside of the mausoleum.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Oh, our hipster friend is still waiting outside.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I stroll in.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Really cool.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And then I lean against the wall and I light a cigarette.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Yeah, Quark loves cigarettes.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
She knows.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Or he.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Okay.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000
So just clarification, I'm looking at these gained items.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Yeah.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Robot baby plus power unit.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Yeah.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
The power unit is inside the baby.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
It's powering him.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Okay.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So it's like, you know, life force, I guess.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Yeah.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Like it's batteries.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Okay.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Like it's power unit.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
And the gold dish is to sort of put it in there.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
It sure is.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It's not gold though.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
It's.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
I know.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I know.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I know.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Don't worry about it.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Some projected goldness out of this dish.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Well, maybe it should have been gold.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
But I am looking at the, the woman has in this,

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
it's a statue of a woman and she's holding this ball.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I just, I'm curious.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I'm looking with my, I know I'm only a wizard,

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:49.000
but I'm kind of looking just with a layman's eye at the statue,

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
particularly the relationship of the dish to the woman's hands.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Like, I'm, you know, I'm obviously like looking at this like wondering is,

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
is this a situation where you put something in the dish and something happens?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
There doesn't seem to be any kind of joints or seams.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
So unless it might be magical, you know, but unless it's magical,

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
it doesn't seem like it moves.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
How many carrots is the dish?

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Oh, I was, I was thinking carrot was like a unit measurement of length or something.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Gold, it was a gold.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Can I, can I, against the wall, I'm kind of like sneaking around the room

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:31.000
examining for any items or, or inscriptions or anything at all that would have a clue.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
There's no inscriptions.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000
I said that, but you do find a small key.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
It's rusted and made of iron.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Put that shit in the bowl.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Drop it in the bowl.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000
All right, I pick it up and I drop on the bowl and I walk away and I lead against the wall

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
and I smoke a cigarette.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
That sounds like a t-shirt they would sell at Spencer's GIFs.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Put that shit in the bowl.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000
All right.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
You do those things and you're smoking, but nothing seems to be happening.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Little Baskins is like, we need to close the doors.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
All right.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Gentlemen, I am closing the doors.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
But be careful, because once the doors are closed, we'll be in pitch darkness

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
and you can't light any lights.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Why is that little Baskins?

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Because the ghost way doesn't appreciate that sort of thing.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000
The ghost way?

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Yes.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Way, W-A-Y or W-H-E-Y?

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
The ghost way, the way.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Sorry.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Is that like a...

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
The ghost page hates this.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Is that like a pass or like a code?

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
No, it's...

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
The ghost way, go the ghost way.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000
And it's more of like a path.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Okay.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
A ghost take occasionally.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I mean, it's a physical path.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Can I try sense motive on little Baskins?

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
He seems to be caring for your well-being, is his motive.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
He seems like a cool kid.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
All right.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Well, I respect your culture.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.000
And the culture of the undead, so gentlemen, let's keep our torches unlit.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And anything else you have that lights up, let's not light it.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I'm going to close these doors.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
How many doors are there?

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
There's just the two.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Okay.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
All right.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Because I can't get past the significance of this bowl,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I'm just going to sit in it while the door is closed.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
You feel a rusty key under your butt.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000
If Dan had a dollar.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I have trap sense.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Are you going to do some street art?

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
I have trap sense plus two.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I just want to detect any traps in the doors or the bowl with the key in it.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000
You look around for traps, but you don't find anything.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Okay.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
We're clear, guys.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Have you tried parkour?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Have you seen my shoes?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Of course I have.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
All right.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Live show.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
You want someone to gram you while the lights go out?

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
No, it was the whole thing.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
I'm sorry.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.000
What hashtag do you want to use for the lights going out?

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Lights off, Graham.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Okay.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Hashtag, thanks, Obama.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Thanks, Obama.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
So you're sitting in the bowl still?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Yeah, I am sitting in the bowl.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Cool.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Dignity closes the doors and after they close.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Why are you quacking?

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
What?

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
No, that was the doors closing.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Flap, flap.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Too close.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Two doors.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
I figured out what the bowl is.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Oh, no.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Oh, God.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I didn't.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Okay.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
You got to eat that mic, though, if you're going to have like passing thoughts.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Eat it.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Yeah.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Closer.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Like this.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Closer?

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Yeah.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000
No, I almost kiss it.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Oh, yeah.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000
You love that mic.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
I mean, not, yeah.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Whatever.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
You're doing great.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
You're doing great next.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
It's like an ice cream cone that you can't eat.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000
No, I was thinking like once the doors close, maybe it lights up or something.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Maybe.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Maybe.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
But you wish.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Yeah.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Once the doors close, we're in pitch black.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Yeah.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
If the lights came on, why would that even be a thing as a Dungeon Master that you would

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
write?

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.800
Of course that's not going to happen.

01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.300
This is convenience.

01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:32.000
The doors close and a light comes on.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Oh, good.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I read a book.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
You've made a book.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:41.080
And can you describe a scenario where you can't eat an ice cream cone that you're holding

01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:42.320
in your hand?

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.800
But you still need to keep it close to you.

01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:45.800
Yeah, but you have to keep it close to your face.

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.800
You want to keep it close.

01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.800
I'm using here.

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:51.200
I'm saying to him, like, like, don't be afraid of the mic.

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.200
Yeah.

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:54.100
I just want to think of it like an ice cream cone.

01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:55.100
Of course you can't eat it.

01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:56.800
I don't want him to lick it the whole time.

01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:57.800
No one wants to do that.

01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:01.560
I'm just saying, like, hold it as close as you would if it was made of ice cream.

02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:03.800
That way you'll always have it close enough.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:04.800
Okay.

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:07.800
Because he's a very witty, he's saying a lot of fun things.

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:08.800
I wasn't my question.

02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:09.800
Are we in the game right now?

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:10.800
Sorry?

02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.800
Are we in the game?

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:12.800
We're still in the game.

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:13.800
All right.

02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.800
So the doors, the doors have closed.

02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:19.740
Dan's sitting on a, on a key inside a bowl.

02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:22.800
You hear the grinding stone of something moving.

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:30.000
Dan, you feel under your butt movement as, as you feel yourself slide perhaps laterally

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.800
to the left or some other direction.

02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.800
Nice.

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:38.800
Does, does my low light vision work in this scenario?

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:39.800
No.

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:40.800
If you, does anyone have dark vision?

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:41.800
I light a torch.

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:42.800
No.

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:43.800
No, don't wait, wait.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:44.800
Are you serious?

02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:45.800
Why?

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:46.800
Why?

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:47.800
What happened?

02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:48.800
Because the ghost way doesn't work.

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.800
You're disrespecting their culture.

02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:50.800
The ghost way?

02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.800
Why?

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.800
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:55.800
No, come on.

02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:56.800
We trusted the kid.

02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:57.800
Okay.

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:04.800
I, I, I hold it up and then I put it out and I lean against the wall with my leg up.

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:05.800
Okay.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.800
So you light the torch.

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:07.800
No, he never did.

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.800
No, no, I never did.

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:09.800
I, I go to do it.

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.800
Oh, you took it out and they give me a look and then I, I know, but I still.

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:14.800
I mean, is that cheating?

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.800
Cause he said that he let the torch.

02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:16.800
No.

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.360
Well, I just thought he, I thought his second thing was after lighting the torch, I put

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.360
it out.

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:22.360
He didn't do anything.

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:23.360
All right.

02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.360
If you say so.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.360
He's not even.

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.360
He's doing great.

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.360
Everybody clap for Dustin.

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:33.680
Don't, don't encourage him.

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:34.680
I'm depressed.

02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.680
That's sad.

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.680
It's good.

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.680
It's good.

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:38.680
Applause.

02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:39.680
Okay.

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:40.680
Thank you.

02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:41.680
All right.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:42.680
So, so Sharpie is, is moving to the left.

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:43.680
We hear a grinding noise.

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.680
Yep.

02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.640
I call out, I'm sitting in the bowl and I'm moving to the left.

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:49.640
Yeah.

02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:50.640
That's the doorway.

02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:51.640
It's opening up.

02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.640
All right.

02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:58.200
I, I move, I move towards where I know the statue is and I, and I grab onto Sharpie's

02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:59.200
foot.

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.200
All right.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.200
You do that.

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.200
Something's touching my foot.

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.200
It's me.

02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.200
Okay.

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:07.000
So, uh, we're just going to want to go down these stairs here.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.200
If you want to get off of that statue.

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.200
Can we see them?

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.200
No.

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.200
You can't see anything.

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.200
You're in pitch darkness.

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:15.200
Do we have to hold each other?

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:16.200
Well, you might want to figure that out.

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200
Yeah.

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.000
Because otherwise who knows what'll happen.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
All right.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.840
I take out, I take out my, uh, my rope, I tie it around my waist and I, and I pass it to

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.840
Sharpie.

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:28.840
All right.

02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.840
Let's, let's pass this, uh, through the group.

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.080
Well, Baskins, are you corporeal?

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.840
Um, not very.

02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.520
I mean, I can't occasionally, but no, I do have low light vision.

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:39.520
Yeah.

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.520
But it's not, it's, it's too dark for low light.

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.520
God damn it.

02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.520
No light.

02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:44.520
Wait.

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.520
What do you make that sound again?

02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:46.520
What?

02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:47.520
You made the sound again.

02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.520
It was an accident.

02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:49.520
It was a noise.

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.520
A chastise.

02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:51.520
A chastise.

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.520
All right.

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:55.280
So are we, are we down?

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.920
Christopher, what do you, what do you, how are you feeling?

02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:00.440
Um, trying to figure out how to get through.

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.800
I think the cloak thing would be a good idea, but climbing downstairs with a person in front

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:07.440
falls, everybody falls.

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.440
Right.

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:11.520
So I think you just described Bitcoin.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:12.520
Yeah.

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:16.200
Or one of the problems of Bitcoin.

02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:17.200
One of them.

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:22.720
One of the other ones, I don't know why I didn't say I'm kidding.

02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:25.880
Dan Harmon collapses Bitcoin with a joke.

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:31.280
Um, I, well, yeah, little Baskins, uh, I think what we're going to have to have you do because

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:38.200
you're an audio only presence is you're going to have to keep going, uh, little Baskins,

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:42.440
like, like you're saying, you're going to have to keep saying something so we can follow

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:43.440
you.

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:44.440
Yeah.

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.440
Okay.

02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:51.800
So that's what I was going to say for making it sound like I wasn't thinking it up myself.

02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:53.520
I appreciate that.

02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.960
I thought it was really clever if I would have just came up with Marco on the spot.

02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:57.960
I'm sorry.

02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:58.960
Jesus.

02:03:58.960 --> 02:03:59.960
Follow me.

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:00.960
What?

02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:01.960
Follow me.

02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:02.960
No, I'm Marco.

02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:03.960
What?

02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:04.960
Why would you follow?

02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:08.680
Little Baskins, these are, are these, are these not standards stairs?

02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:14.720
Uh, they're just stairs, but I feel confident that I can walk down the stairs.

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.400
In total darkness.

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:18.400
Yeah.

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:23.280
I, I, I am, uh, I walk pretty well.

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.280
I think.

02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:25.280
All right.

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.280
Well, just charge ahead.

02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.880
You walk down the stairs successfully.

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:29.880
Bam.

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:30.880
Wow.

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:34.640
And what are the rest of you guys do?

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:38.160
Well, in a meta sense, I'm getting a drink.

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:44.000
I'll creep down behind her like, like crouching, but I'm, I'm pretty scared of the dark.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.240
Yeah, you are.

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:46.240
That happens.

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.240
You're downstairs too.

02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240
Are you guys tied together or not?

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.240
Uh, I wanted to do the rope thing.

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.200
I, I, I think the rope thing is a good idea.

02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.520
Who was doing the rope thing?

02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:54.680
Um, I, I was.

02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:55.680
Okay.

02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:57.720
Well, then I guess that means I followed you down the stairs.

02:04:57.720 --> 02:04:58.720
All right.

02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.000
I grabbed hold of the rope in the middle part.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Yeah.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
I'm going to grab the end.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Okay.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.480
You're down the stairs.

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:09.400
I have the key still clenched in my buttocks.

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.080
That will come up.

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.240
So a little Baskins is down there and he's like, Hey, just, you know, follow the sound

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.240
of my voice.

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:21.880
Oh, also just be aware that this path that we're on is only about 10 feet wide and there's

02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:22.880
no railings.

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:24.880
And I think it's bottomless.

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:25.880
What you think?

02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:26.880
Yeah.

02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:27.880
I thought you'd, you've been down this way before.

02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:28.880
Yeah.

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:29.880
But I usually don't fall off.

02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:31.880
What, at what point is it bottomless?

02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:36.320
There's an end of the stairs and it's a bottomless or, or it's an endless stairwell.

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:40.200
No, it goes to a, it goes to a regular path.

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.840
Does the little Baskins have any, any temperature?

02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:46.840
Like do I, when you're close to him, do you feel cold or anything?

02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:49.880
Uh, does he smell like spirits?

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:50.880
Not as far as you know.

02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:51.880
No.

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:56.680
Everything that everyone has said for the last five minutes is what she said.

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:59.320
I just wanted to point that out.

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:00.320
All right.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.320
Marco.

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.320
Polo.

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:03.320
Polo.

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.320
Polo.

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:05.320
Marco.

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:06.320
Polo.

02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.320
Polo.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:08.320
How do we know this?

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:09.320
Everyone.

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:10.320
Yeah.

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:13.240
You feel the ground shift under your feet and give way.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:14.240
Ah.

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.240
Yeah.

02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:17.240
Ground shifting.

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:23.520
Dignity and Chris de Burghh failed to dive out of the way, although quark and sharpie managed

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:26.960
to avoid, avoid their fate.

02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:37.440
You guys fall 30 feet down and hit the ground.

02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.880
Getting 13 damage apiece.

02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:40.880
Ugh.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:41.880
Ugh.

02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.880
Are you guys okay?

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.440
Were we still tied together?

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.440
No.

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:46.680
What I heard was that you're holding on.

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.680
I was holding on.

02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:49.160
I have rope burns in my hand.

02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:50.160
Yeah.

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:53.160
But are you guys okay?

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.160
Uh, I'm not sure.

02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:55.640
Let me check my hit points.

02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:56.640
Yeah.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:57.640
I'm okay.

02:06:57.640 --> 02:06:58.640
I'm all right.

02:06:58.640 --> 02:06:59.640
I think we found the bottom.

02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:02.560
Are you, uh, are you, are you, are you safe up there?

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:05.160
What are, what do you, what do you see?

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.160
We don't see anything.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.160
It's pitch dark.

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.160
It's pitch dark.

02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:13.320
But, but we heard a very modern, uh, critical error of some kind.

02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:17.640
It was a, uh, a small passing of gas.

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:22.040
It's kind of what that sounds like.

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.360
Are you guys coming?

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:28.840
Um, not sure.

02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:29.840
Little bastion.

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:30.840
Where did our friends go?

02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:31.840
Can you go down?

02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:32.840
It's little bastions.

02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.640
Wait, what's it called?

02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.640
Bastions.

02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:36.640
Bastions.

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.120
It's a little bastion store.

02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:39.120
But not.

02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:40.120
Why don't you do what you wish?

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.600
Um, okay.

02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:42.600
Little bastions.

02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:45.560
Can you go down there and, and investigate for us?

02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:46.560
They fell down a pit.

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:47.560
I mean, I can see.

02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:48.560
Fine.

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:49.560
Yeah.

02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.560
What do you see down there?

02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.560
Oh, they didn't fall off that pit.

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.920
This is a, this is a different pit.

02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:54.840
This is a much better pit to fall down.

02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.040
So it's not bottomless.

02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.040
It's like a small pit.

02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.040
No.

02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:59.040
This one definitely is about 30 feet deep.

02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:00.040
It looks like.

02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:01.040
Okay.

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.040
Well, is the rope still down there?

02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.560
Can we just pull them up?

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:04.560
Yeah.

02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:05.560
They're tied to a rope.

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:06.560
Yeah.

02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:09.840
Or, or, or, uh, you operating on the assumption that they're just holding the rope.

02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:10.840
Right.

02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:11.840
I tied it around my arm.

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:12.840
You can still have the rope.

02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:13.840
Do you have the rope down there?

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.840
Yeah.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:15.840
I have the rope.

02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:16.840
Okay.

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:17.840
We're going to pull up the rope.

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.720
I have a 12 strength.

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:22.200
So it should be no problem.

02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:23.840
But what, what's down in the hole?

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.080
Like do we want to proceed down?

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:27.600
What's down in the hole, you guys?

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:30.720
I, uh, I, I feel around.

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:35.160
You feel small, uh, smooth walls and nothing else.

02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:42.200
Is this pit what lay ahead of us as if the path that we were on suddenly had a pit in

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.520
it and we just didn't fall in and they did.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.520
No.

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:48.320
It was a pit trap at where in the floor gives way and becomes a pit.

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.320
All right.

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.320
Let's get the, get the other one.

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.160
Go ahead and pull me out of the golden hole, made a gold.

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.160
You do that.

02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:57.160
You're pulled out.

02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.160
We're pulling you up.

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:01.720
You're, you're, you're successfully pulled out.

02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:04.440
That's what she said.

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.840
Oh, Lil Baskin's like, I forgot.

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:07.840
There's traps around here.

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.160
I don't set them off.

02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:10.160
Okay.

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:11.160
You're doing great.

02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.560
You're, um, a ghost baby that can see you're leaving four people that can't see.

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:17.560
Yeah.

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:20.440
And you're being very flippant and vague about everything.

02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.440
Um, I said, I forgot.

02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:24.440
I mean, when you're a ghost, you don't set off traps.

02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:27.440
If I have a trap sense, can I do it in the dark?

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:28.880
You can try, but it'll be worse.

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:32.040
Um, so we've moved past the hole in the floor, right?

02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:33.040
No.

02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:34.040
You're on the one side of the hole.

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:35.040
Okay.

02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.120
So we need to get across this, but it's in pitch dark.

02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:42.840
So can we throw, we tie the rope to something and throw it across and then just, I guess,

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:43.840
climb across.

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.040
You could do all sorts of things.

02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:47.760
Lil Baskin's, can you float?

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.760
Yeah.

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:49.760
Can you carry a rope?

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.760
No.

02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:59.160
Uh, we need to, yeah, well, Lil Baskin's, can you describe, we want you to understand

02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.280
that as non ghost babies, we cannot see anything.

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:03.280
I know.

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:06.440
So we need to anchor this rope so we can get across.

02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.680
Can you tell us, be our eyes for us, tell us, are there structures over there to which

02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:11.920
we can anchor this rope?

02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:17.900
If we could hit it with a, with a grapple or some, there aren't, uh, it's only eight

02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:18.900
feet wide.

02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:20.400
You could probably jump it.

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:21.400
All right.

02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:24.920
I, I, uh, I still have the rope tied to my waist.

02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.680
I, uh, I, I rev up.

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.320
I run towards the hole.

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.640
This is a terrible.

02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.440
I try to jump over the hole.

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.440
Terrible idea.

02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:35.440
You've fallen the hole.

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.440
Let's see.

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.840
You start, you start to go down and you guys notice the rope, it's, you know, doing that

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.920
thing that rope does when someone's falling down something.

02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:42.920
Yeah.

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:43.920
It goes tout and starts pulling.

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:46.440
I, I, I, yeah, I pull it and we, all right.

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:47.440
You pull her to safety.

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.440
Okay.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.440
All right.

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.440
Let's, let's, let's communicate.

02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:51.440
Okay.

02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.440
Funny thing.

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:53.440
Um, I've been looking at this sheet.

02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:55.440
Would goggles at night work?

02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:56.440
Yeah.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:57.440
All right.

02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:02.440
Thank you everybody for coming to Harmon's house.

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:03.440
What?

02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:10.440
Oh, thank you so much to Nick, Justin Marshall, our producer, Spencer, Clinton, and Dan Harmon.

02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:15.440
Thank you so much everybody.

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:21.440
And thank you Caroline and Tom Gray.

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:23.440
Thank you.

02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:25.440
Yes.

02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:32.440
Uh, we'll be out there, I'll, I'll be out there at any rate if, uh, yeah, for pictures.
