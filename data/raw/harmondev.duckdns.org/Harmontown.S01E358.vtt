00:00.000 --> 00:26.480
["Harmontown"]

00:26.480 --> 00:28.680
You lucky sons of bitches.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.680
Harmontown is now in session.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.680
Let's get Rob Schrab out here right now.

00:33.680 --> 00:43.680
["Harmontown"]

00:43.680 --> 00:47.680
For good measure, what about a Spencer Crittenden?

00:47.680 --> 00:55.680
["Harmontown"]

00:55.680 --> 00:56.680
And just in case that's not enough,

00:56.680 --> 00:59.680
how about your mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon?

00:59.680 --> 01:06.680
["Harmontown"]

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Ra.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
Hip hop, turn it.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
What?

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
Hip, what?

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
Hip.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
Block.

01:12.680 --> 01:13.680
Hip.

01:13.680 --> 01:14.680
Tape.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.680
I got a rap that I'm going to do.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.680
Got a rap.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.680
Got a mic and a shoe.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.680
They had to turn your mic off

01:20.680 --> 01:22.680
because you're not using it right.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.680
Where you broke it?

01:23.680 --> 01:25.680
It's going to be off all night.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.680
What if we muted you?

01:26.680 --> 01:28.680
What if you had no voice?

01:28.680 --> 01:29.680
You motherfucker.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.680
Now you're going to appreciate your choice.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.680
Chief Leisure, bring your chairs out.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.680
Yeah.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.680
All right.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.680
Okay.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.680
Hip.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.680
Rap or need a rap?

01:39.680 --> 01:42.680
Yo, I had to set a mouse trap.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.680
I had a mouse called rhythm.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.680
Yo, your mama's pussy is swimming.

01:48.680 --> 01:49.680
Yeah.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.680
Hey.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.680
Thank you, mama's pussy section.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
Sorry to neglect you guys.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
The mama's section.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
All right.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.680
Come on.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.680
First of all, what's happened?

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
All right.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
Thank you.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
Thanks, everybody.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.680
How many Harmontowns are left?

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
Three.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
Three left.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
Four.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
Including this one.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
Yeah.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.680
Yay.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.680
What's happening with the...

02:13.680 --> 02:14.680
There's another chair.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
I don't know.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.680
I think somebody's doing a joke right now.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.680
We would have thought that we would have figured out seating before three shows left.

02:23.680 --> 02:27.680
Yeah, my local choir is going to be coming in and we're going to...

02:27.680 --> 02:30.680
I'm glad someone cares about stage picture.

02:30.680 --> 02:35.680
There was one thing that I wanted to share because we do sit up here and we go like,

02:35.680 --> 02:38.680
oh, I heard this, I heard that, and I didn't understand it or whatever.

02:38.680 --> 02:43.680
One of the guy, the guy that hosted my panel at the Norwegian Film Festival, he sent me

02:43.680 --> 02:48.680
a message about getting to the bottom of this whole poop van too thing.

02:48.680 --> 02:55.680
And if I go to my Instagram, he said, poop van too equals Port Vien too.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.680
Port Road number two.

02:57.680 --> 03:05.680
Norwegian kids TV show from the 80s about two adults living together with a fucked up giraffe.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.680
Port Vien too.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.680
We heard it as poop Vien too.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
Nope.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
No sex thing.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
It wasn't something weird.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.680
It was about two grownups and a giraffe for kids.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.680
How was your trip, Dan?

03:19.680 --> 03:20.680
You enjoyed?

03:20.680 --> 03:21.680
Loved it.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.680
Loved it.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.680
Loved you, Norway.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.680
Props to holding the line against Sweden.

03:28.680 --> 03:37.680
I didn't know those people were ever fighting, but the town we were in, it was 10 miles moved

03:37.680 --> 03:42.680
in one direction because the old town got burnt down by the Swedes during their fucking

03:42.680 --> 03:45.680
bitter struggle against the Swedes.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.680
You talk to a Norwegian and they're like, they tolerate the Swedes.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.680
And vice versa.

03:51.680 --> 03:56.680
It's centuries old, older than our country is at all.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.680
We don't have any opinion about the English.

03:58.680 --> 04:04.680
So how old does that make our country that you think in Europe, it's even older.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.680
Thanks, Dan.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.680
Don't we have a Swede in the house tonight?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.680
We have Sofia, right?

04:10.680 --> 04:11.680
Yeah.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.680
She burned down that town.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.680
I only have a handful of things to talk about.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.680
I think that was one of them.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.680
Another one is that it's church's birthday.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.680
Church's birthday.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.680
Get up here, church.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.680
Stand up.

04:28.680 --> 04:35.680
Happy church day to you, church.

04:35.680 --> 04:41.680
Happy church day to church.

04:41.680 --> 04:48.680
Happy church day to church.

04:48.680 --> 04:56.680
Happy church day to church.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.680
Yay.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.680
All of those.

05:01.680 --> 05:06.680
All of those photos you've been looking at.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.680
Come up on the stage.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.680
Join us, church.

05:10.680 --> 05:15.680
One of the 17 chairs.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.680
She's finding a slow way up.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.680
It's dark.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
Happy birthday to church, everybody.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.680
Happy birthday.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.680
Happy birthday to church.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.680
Take your pick.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.680
Take your pick.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.680
We thought Steve was just doing a weird joke, but really.

05:33.680 --> 05:38.680
No, we are going to have a choir.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.680
All those photos you've been seeing for how long, church,

05:41.680 --> 05:44.680
have you been taking those photos to put on our Instagram account?

05:44.680 --> 05:47.680
Three years.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.680
Jesus Christ.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.680
This is why a show has to be quit.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.680
Because before you know it, you're lost in cement.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.680
We have to keep fresh or else we die.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.680
I was fresh changing venues three times.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.680
Yeah.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.680
That was my favorite part.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.680
Remember that one guy who was like,

06:09.680 --> 06:11.680
oh, you're changing venues?

06:11.680 --> 06:13.680
Now you count down to your podcast ending.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.680
And we were like, fuck you, poser.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.680
Four shadowing.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.680
He was right.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.680
There's no way that he's around to feel joy.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.680
If he is around, he's a hypocrite.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.680
Because he was like, your podcast is good to end.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.680
And then he hung around for three years.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.680
So if you're listening.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.680
That was after Meltdown.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.680
Yeah.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.680
The only thing I wanted to talk about,

06:37.680 --> 06:44.680
I guess I was going to say before I bring our only guest out.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.680
And I put guest in quotes.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.680
Because honestly, what is a guest?

06:48.680 --> 06:50.680
Probably like multiple sets of quotes.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.680
Yeah.

06:51.680 --> 06:58.680
But I wanted to talk about the Pizookie at BJ's.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.680
Yeah.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.680
It's supposed to be.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.680
I don't know what.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.680
The idea is that it's a pizza cookie.

07:04.680 --> 07:05.680
Pizza.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
Pizza.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
Pizza.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.680
Pizza.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.680
Why don't we bring out former BJ's employee and semi guest,

07:11.680 --> 07:12.680
Nick Rutherford?

07:12.680 --> 07:14.680
Oh, shit.

07:14.680 --> 07:20.680
All your best friends are all your enemies.

07:20.680 --> 07:25.680
But I come down for good person.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.680
Brought his own chair.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.680
Up your trap.

07:31.680 --> 07:36.680
And let's bring out our real guest political analyst,

07:36.680 --> 07:37.680
Kaleigh.

07:37.680 --> 07:42.680
The one we wanted to be here.

07:42.680 --> 07:53.680
We get a bigger chair for Kaleigh, man.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.680
Who is that?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.680
I was singing that song that was the play on music.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.680
That's Kali Fontecchio, everybody.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
Kali, what?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.680
Kali right here.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.680
Hello, Kali.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.680
Kali, what's the song called?

08:04.680 --> 08:05.680
Wow.

08:05.680 --> 08:09.680
Take a Dive by Kali Kazoo.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.680
Sing it.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.680
Wow.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.680
Schrab, you didn't like it backstage when we found out it was

08:15.680 --> 08:18.680
church's birthday and we all sang happy church day to her.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.680
You didn't like it because you don't like, you just had a

08:20.680 --> 08:21.680
birthday.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.680
You don't like it when people sing happy birthday to you.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
No.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.680
You don't like it when people sing happy birthday to someone

08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
else in front of you.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.680
No.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.680
You just don't like the happy birthday song.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.680
Yes.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.680
You're just a villain.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.680
You're just a terrible villain.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.680
No.

08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
No.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
Okay, okay.

08:40.680 --> 08:43.680
Happy birthday to you.

08:43.680 --> 08:44.680
Happy birthday, by the way.

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
I don't like it.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.680
Happy birthday to you.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.680
Happy birthday to you.

08:50.680 --> 09:02.900
Happy Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab,...

09:02.900 --> 09:05.140
So you just don't like it?

09:05.140 --> 09:05.600
No.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.500
Wait, wait, wait.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.180
How's God to like?

09:09.180 --> 09:11.780
Nobody likes singing it, no one likes hearing it.

09:11.780 --> 09:13.620
Yeah, we all hate it.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.940
A happy birthday to you.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.980
Okay, well now I prove you right.

09:19.980 --> 09:23.180
Wait, wait, I'm the, I'm, wait, I'm the guest.

09:23.180 --> 09:24.020
All right.

09:26.180 --> 09:27.520
Remember I brought that chair up?

09:27.520 --> 09:31.520
Happy birthday to guest.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.500
All right, you worked at BJ's.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.060
Let's talk about the Pizookie.

09:36.060 --> 09:37.380
The Pizookie.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.060
It's a pizza cookie.

09:39.060 --> 09:39.900
Right.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.300
The word pizza and the word cookie combined

09:44.460 --> 09:46.100
into the word Pizookie.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.220
Pizookie.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.060
Pizookie.

09:48.060 --> 09:48.900
Pizookie.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.220
Pizookie.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.460
What is the, what is the question?

09:52.460 --> 09:53.300
Pizookie.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.620
It doesn't, I know I'm not buying it.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.140
I don't like it either.

09:57.140 --> 10:00.660
And also as you said in the lift.

10:00.660 --> 10:04.700
Well it's a, there's no difference between a pizza

10:04.700 --> 10:06.900
and a cookie, they're the same shape

10:06.900 --> 10:08.300
and they're cooked in the same oven.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.520
And pizzas don't have ice cream on them either.

10:12.620 --> 10:15.100
So you should have kept that bit in the lift

10:15.100 --> 10:16.220
for just you and I.

10:16.220 --> 10:18.540
But I thought it was so insightful.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.460
It's like they're all wrong about this.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.500
It's not a, they don't have a right to call

10:22.500 --> 10:24.740
that a hybrid between a pizza and a cookie

10:24.740 --> 10:26.100
or to pronounce it that way.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.760
There's, it's, they're all off base the entire time.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.600
Is it delicious?

10:29.600 --> 10:32.020
Yeah, but you gotta, you can't call it a Pizookie.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.860
I like the salted caramel one.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.660
You guys try that one?

10:35.660 --> 10:36.500
Oh boy.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.300
And the monkey bread, that one's not as great.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.340
It's not very moist.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.820
Hey, it's me.

10:41.820 --> 10:44.060
Pizza, Pizookie.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.300
It's mini Pizookie.

10:46.300 --> 10:51.300
I love myself and what I'm named.

10:53.940 --> 10:54.780
So, there you go.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.660
I know that someone does.

10:56.660 --> 10:59.580
You know what they really call pizza cookies?

10:59.580 --> 11:00.620
Cookie skillets.

11:02.100 --> 11:02.940
Cookie skillets.

11:02.940 --> 11:03.780
I like that one.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.740
I like that name.

11:04.740 --> 11:08.020
It makes sense because it's a cookie with a skillet.

11:08.020 --> 11:11.620
Someone, oh, it was our lift driver who pointed out,

11:11.620 --> 11:15.100
actually, if you worked backwards from what should be

11:15.100 --> 11:18.580
called a Pizookie, that should be a name for if you,

11:18.580 --> 11:22.420
when you're taking a poop and you pee during the poop.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.220
Because it's a piss dookie.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.180
Yeah.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.140
A Pizookie.

11:26.140 --> 11:26.980
Yeah.

11:26.980 --> 11:27.820
That makes sense.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.660
That tracks to me.

11:28.660 --> 11:29.500
I still stand by that.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.060
That was when you piss in a Suzuki.

11:32.980 --> 11:37.340
But you, yeah, I feel you player.

11:37.340 --> 11:42.340
But, I think that's a rarefied audience.

11:42.860 --> 11:46.220
I don't know if you need a portmanteau.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.460
Fucking dumb.

11:49.460 --> 11:54.100
Dude, I just took the biggest piss on my Suzuki.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.620
But versus like, dude, I was taking a shit

11:57.620 --> 11:59.540
and I peed during it.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.780
Happens to everyone.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.460
That should be just called taking a shit.

12:03.460 --> 12:04.900
But you took a Pizookie?

12:04.900 --> 12:05.980
Yeah.

12:05.980 --> 12:07.220
That should be called cookie skillets.

12:07.220 --> 12:12.220
Nick, did you make, were you in the kitchen or are you a server?

12:14.340 --> 12:16.260
Did you make the Pizookie?

12:16.260 --> 12:18.340
No, I was a server.

12:18.340 --> 12:23.300
I opened up the Westlake Village BJ's flagship.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.140
Thank you.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.620
Whoa.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.460
Restaurant.

12:26.460 --> 12:27.740
That was a classic location.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.940
I used to patronize that one.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.260
Yeah.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.100
Did you ever see Wayne Gretzky there?

12:33.100 --> 12:33.940
Oh, you were a restaurant.

12:33.940 --> 12:34.780
I don't think so.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.180
He never ate there.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.460
I just rolled down his window and go like,

12:38.460 --> 12:39.660
you're doing great.

12:39.660 --> 12:41.780
You know, your name sounds like,

12:41.780 --> 12:44.540
you serve a lot of food today.

12:44.540 --> 12:45.380
It's okay.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.220
It's okay.

12:46.220 --> 12:47.060
You just opened.

12:47.060 --> 12:47.900
You'll get better.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.740
Yeah.

12:48.740 --> 12:49.860
I feel attacked right now.

12:49.860 --> 12:50.700
Wait, what?

12:50.700 --> 12:54.300
No, that's dumb work play from a bunch of drunk people.

12:55.820 --> 12:58.340
Can you talk, because we were talking over our Pizookie

12:58.340 --> 13:01.740
about your job at the bank.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.580
Oh, yeah.

13:02.580 --> 13:03.860
I just thought that was kind of entertaining.

13:03.860 --> 13:04.700
Yeah.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.700
I mean, after I was a server at BJ's,

13:08.700 --> 13:12.580
I was a temp at Citibank.

13:12.580 --> 13:15.180
Let me hear my, where are my city peeps at?

13:15.180 --> 13:16.260
Whoa.

13:19.260 --> 13:20.820
Somebody hissed.

13:22.020 --> 13:22.860
Chase.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.260
Yeah, Chase.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.260
Yeah, that's a Chase bank.

13:26.260 --> 13:29.140
And I was a temp there when I first lived in New York

13:29.140 --> 13:32.900
and you can make a lot of money as a temp in New York.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.020
And I just really milked that place dry.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.060
It was right before they needed a huge bailout

13:39.060 --> 13:40.020
from the government.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.460
And you would go to work

13:42.460 --> 13:45.540
and then you would sleep on your desk for two hours.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.420
And then during lunch,

13:47.420 --> 13:49.860
you would go to the park and sleep on newspapers.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.260
Do you want to tell the story?

13:51.260 --> 13:53.980
Well, I kind of hating the highlights

13:53.980 --> 13:56.300
because I think it's such a funny image of like a kid

13:56.300 --> 13:58.140
in the play, playing the system.

13:58.140 --> 13:59.980
Because like you were sleeping on newspapers

13:59.980 --> 14:01.740
and then you'd come back to the office

14:01.740 --> 14:03.020
and type on a spreadsheet.

14:03.020 --> 14:05.340
And then they'd go, boy, look at this kid.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.340
Yeah, no, I mean, you hit all the highlights.

14:08.340 --> 14:10.780
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you don't have to waste any time.

14:10.780 --> 14:11.620
No.

14:11.620 --> 14:12.900
What's it like being 50, bro?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.980
It's not like half the age of a tortoise.

14:17.980 --> 14:18.820
What?

14:19.820 --> 14:20.660
What do you say?

14:20.660 --> 14:21.900
What's it like being 50?

14:21.900 --> 14:23.340
How's it, what's it, what's it like?

14:23.340 --> 14:24.660
I feel so good.

14:25.620 --> 14:28.620
Jeff, what was it like wherever you were?

14:28.620 --> 14:32.900
I was in Alaska, it was fucking cold.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.700
The show me saked, saked.

14:35.980 --> 14:40.100
It's the show me that you're freezing to death state.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.260
It's fucking cold.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.180
Hey, did you go to the blackbuster?

14:45.700 --> 14:47.060
Alaska.

14:48.540 --> 14:49.580
Oh, I thought you were.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.460
I didn't, I thought you were teeing up like a word play.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.300
I don't know.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.220
What's up, what's up?

14:58.220 --> 15:01.100
Hey, Dan, he's 50.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.740
What the fuck was that?

15:02.740 --> 15:04.780
I feel like I am, I don't know what's good.

15:04.780 --> 15:08.100
All right, was it day or night there?

15:08.100 --> 15:09.580
It was mostly night.

15:10.900 --> 15:15.900
The sun came up at 9.44, and then it came down at 9.46.

15:17.580 --> 15:20.020
The sun kind of just introduced itself

15:20.020 --> 15:23.220
over the horizon and said, I'm lazy.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.860
I feel like I would like that, but am I wrong?

15:25.860 --> 15:28.100
No, you're wrong because you wake up in the morning

15:28.100 --> 15:31.660
and you're like, it's 8.45 a.m.

15:31.660 --> 15:33.500
and it's pitch black outside.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.980
You want some feedback.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.540
You want to know that you're alive.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.260
You want a straight line.

15:39.260 --> 15:43.780
Like people were like, oh, I don't like the day.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.900
That's neurotypical shit.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.020
But you want it there so that you can play off of it.

15:49.020 --> 15:49.860
Yeah.

15:49.860 --> 15:51.860
You want to be like, ugh, the sun, fuck you.

15:51.860 --> 15:56.860
In the summer, the sun never sets, it's daylight all the time.

15:57.180 --> 16:00.500
But when you get into the fall, winter time, spring,

16:00.500 --> 16:03.020
it's just dusk at all times.

16:03.020 --> 16:06.460
It feels like in both cases, to me it sounds romantic,

16:06.460 --> 16:07.900
like I would want to experience it,

16:07.900 --> 16:11.460
but I'm assuming that it would be awful.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.260
When you wake up at like, it's 8.30 a.m.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.980
and it's black outside, like it's totally nighttime,

16:16.980 --> 16:20.700
you're like, okay, I want breakfast, but not in the dark.

16:20.700 --> 16:25.700
And you don't have any indication about any, even to defy it,

16:26.020 --> 16:28.180
like some definition of whether you're a loser

16:28.180 --> 16:30.260
or a winner or punk rock or.

16:30.260 --> 16:33.340
Like electricity, they have lights.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.900
But that doesn't feel the same.

16:35.900 --> 16:36.740
That's right.

16:36.740 --> 16:37.580
You can turn the lights on.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.420
There's electricity all the time,

16:38.420 --> 16:40.500
but your hotel room can turn lights on,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.820
but it feels like it's still 4 a.m.

16:42.820 --> 16:43.660
Right.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.020
It doesn't feel right.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.500
I think that would be bad.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.540
I'm going to go with bad.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.220
Well, I think Alaska would feel differently

16:50.220 --> 16:51.620
and we got Alaska here tonight.

16:51.620 --> 16:54.180
Let's give it up for Alaska.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.100
What?

16:56.100 --> 16:57.500
Oh, shit, we have a guest.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.740
Nick Rutherford, everybody.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.220
All right, well, let's get to the show.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.540
Let's, that's enough warm up.

17:03.540 --> 17:07.020
Yeah, yes, you wanted Alaska to come out.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.380
Yeah.

17:08.380 --> 17:09.220
I don't know.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.900
He's got a pedal that changes voices.

17:10.900 --> 17:11.740
I don't know.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.740
Yeah, I thought we were going to.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.820
Hey, I'll say this, Rob said, cause it's his birthday.

17:15.820 --> 17:18.020
He said, we should ask the audience to throw up

17:18.020 --> 17:19.900
any drugs they have on the stage.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.260
And he would do any drugs that were thrown up on the stage.

17:23.260 --> 17:23.980
Whoa.

17:28.620 --> 17:29.120
Advil.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.260
Just shut it out.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.220
Who's holding class A narcotics in the crowd right now?

17:36.220 --> 17:39.380
Instead of like going.

17:39.380 --> 17:41.900
Oh, Steve's got drugs.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.860
Thanks, Steve Levy.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.540
Instead of asking who like came the farthest,

17:46.540 --> 17:48.020
like who came from the farthest away,

17:48.020 --> 17:50.900
we should ask like who has the hardest drugs on them.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.380
Right.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.260
Who here is currently holding ice?

17:55.260 --> 17:56.260
Evan, Steve, Levy.

17:59.260 --> 18:03.260
I wanted to, I wanted to go to the random word generator

18:03.260 --> 18:06.540
that I discovered today, because you can just

18:06.540 --> 18:09.260
generate two random words.

18:09.260 --> 18:11.100
But I forgot there's no internet on the stage.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.780
What the fuck is this shit?

18:12.780 --> 18:14.780
What is this?

18:14.780 --> 18:15.380
What is it?

18:15.380 --> 18:16.260
It's a cup.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.180
You don't want to know that.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.260
All right, it's we got to get to the show.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.460
Yes, services.

18:21.460 --> 18:22.500
We got to do it.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.860
All right, so what's going around?

18:24.860 --> 18:27.100
Come on, quit screwing around.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.180
Let's quit screwing around.

18:28.180 --> 18:28.780
Let's do it.

18:28.780 --> 18:29.420
Come on.

18:29.420 --> 18:30.820
And here's the show.

18:30.820 --> 18:32.940
Come on, let's quit screwing around.

18:32.940 --> 18:33.940
Quit screwing around.

18:33.940 --> 18:34.980
Quit screwing around.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.860
Let's get Alaska up here.

18:37.860 --> 18:40.540
Everybody, everybody hear that Senator farted today?

18:40.540 --> 18:42.740
Oh, no.

18:42.740 --> 18:44.340
I didn't hear about that.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.220
No, I guess the senator farted.

18:47.220 --> 18:47.700
Moving on.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.260
Some people think it's a deep fake.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.500
Did the president have a heart problem?

18:58.500 --> 19:00.060
He went to the doctor.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.820
And then he was like, it's part of my.

19:01.820 --> 19:02.300
You can find it.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.860
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

19:06.860 --> 19:07.860
You can't get internet on the stage.

19:07.860 --> 19:10.300
That's what he was like.

19:10.300 --> 19:15.420
That's not how you get internet, making that noise.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.260
What were you looking at, people?

19:17.260 --> 19:19.300
What didn't you say I can find it?

19:19.300 --> 19:19.900
What?

19:19.900 --> 19:20.620
What did you say?

19:20.620 --> 19:21.500
No.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.140
What did you say?

19:22.140 --> 19:23.420
I forgot, honestly.

19:23.420 --> 19:27.580
OK, well, can you be accountable to stage time

19:27.580 --> 19:29.260
and your use of resources?

19:29.260 --> 19:31.700
Like you're occupying space and time on stage.

19:31.700 --> 19:36.700
So when you say things, everyone has to pay attention to you.

19:36.700 --> 19:41.140
So you can't just be like, he's free, ah, ah, bah, gah, gah.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.180
And then everyone's like, wait, what did you say?

19:43.180 --> 19:47.260
You can do all that, but then you can't be like, I don't know.

19:47.260 --> 19:48.700
Like that's a crime.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.460
That's a crime.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.780
Everything up until then, it's kind of like, well, none of us

19:53.780 --> 19:54.700
knew what we were doing.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.780
But then when you're just like, don't ask me.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.420
No, you're the only one we can ask.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.380
I don't know what you said.

20:01.380 --> 20:02.580
Like we're yes-anding you.

20:02.580 --> 20:05.100
We're bothering to steer our attention towards you

20:05.100 --> 20:06.660
and go like, what did you say?

20:06.660 --> 20:09.460
Maybe that will be the direction the podcast travels in.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.460
Maybe we can build something on that.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.460
I'll buy him time.

20:12.460 --> 20:14.460
And then you're like, I don't know.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.460
Six to one, half a dozen to the other.

20:16.460 --> 20:17.460
Like, OK, great.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.460
We're just going to drift.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.460
We're just going to fucking scatter through the cosmos.

20:20.460 --> 20:21.460
Yeah, I like it.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.460
Like everyone that came here tonight and stood in line

20:23.460 --> 20:26.460
is just doomed to fucking spin with no center of gravity.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.460
Yeah.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.460
We're all just twirling around each other and going like,

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
help, I'm dying.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.460
And then eventually two hours will be done.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.460
And we'll all go like, good night, folks.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.460
Some people will be like, good night.

20:37.460 --> 20:38.460
I came from Australia.

20:38.460 --> 20:39.460
Good night, everybody.

20:39.460 --> 20:40.460
All right.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.460
Good night to you.

20:41.460 --> 20:42.460
All right.

20:42.460 --> 20:43.460
Good night to you.

20:43.460 --> 20:44.460
All right.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.460
Good night, America.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.460
I'm Dan Harmon.

20:46.460 --> 20:53.460
And I wish every single one of you a happy, great night.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.460
Does it feel good when it happens to you?

20:55.460 --> 20:56.460
No.

20:56.460 --> 20:57.460
Does it?

20:57.460 --> 20:58.460
Uh-huh.

20:58.460 --> 20:59.460
Be made fun of.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.460
Does it feel good?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.460
There's no equivalence there.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.460
I didn't do that to you.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.460
I didn't do that to you.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.460
You were kind of nasty.

21:09.460 --> 21:13.460
I admit I put an R in my good night.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.460
I do cop to that.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.460
I apologize to it.

21:17.460 --> 21:20.460
He admits it.

21:20.460 --> 21:24.460
You haven't, you've never acknowledged your offense expressed

21:24.460 --> 21:26.460
remorse or committed to change.

21:26.460 --> 21:29.460
Those are the three ingredients of an apology.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.460
I'm not sorry for what I do, though.

21:32.460 --> 21:36.460
So you feel no remorse and you'll never commit to change.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.460
So you're the anti-harmon.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.460
Whoa.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.460
You're like, all right.

21:41.460 --> 21:42.460
Whoa.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.460
Man.

21:43.460 --> 21:44.460
All right.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.460
I have a new enemy as the audience.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.460
I don't like their reactions.

21:48.460 --> 21:49.460
All right.

21:49.460 --> 21:50.460
Let's get to the show.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.460
Yeah, let's get to the fucking show.

21:52.460 --> 21:53.460
Let's go to the show.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.460
Okay.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.460
So here we go.

21:55.460 --> 21:56.460
You've all heard.

21:56.460 --> 21:57.460
Here it comes.

21:57.460 --> 21:59.460
I guess you've all heard that.

21:59.460 --> 22:01.460
Yeah, put that anywhere.

22:01.460 --> 22:04.460
I'm going to go to the city hall.

22:04.460 --> 22:05.460
Capitol Hill.

22:05.460 --> 22:09.460
There's been a little bit of an issue going on with dangling

22:09.460 --> 22:12.460
chads.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.460
But I wonder what's happening over at Senator Kirschbaum's

22:16.460 --> 22:17.460
house.

22:17.460 --> 22:24.460
Probably flatulence.

22:24.460 --> 22:27.460
Here's a little sketch we did about it.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.460
Honey, where's my dangling chads?

22:30.460 --> 22:33.460
Right where you left them, sweetheart.

22:33.460 --> 22:43.460
But I asked for an omelet.

22:43.460 --> 22:44.460
Pause.

22:44.460 --> 22:53.460
New choice.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.460
Ding dong.

22:55.460 --> 22:59.460
I'll get it.

22:59.460 --> 23:03.460
Wait, the new choice was the door was over there.

23:03.460 --> 23:07.460
Oh, no, we closed the door.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.460
Hey, hey.

23:08.460 --> 23:10.460
He's eating your food.

23:10.460 --> 23:11.460
Hey.

23:11.460 --> 23:12.460
Oh, no.

23:12.460 --> 23:13.460
Hey, wait.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.460
He went into your house.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.460
Sir, what?

23:16.460 --> 23:17.460
Hey, what?

23:17.460 --> 23:18.460
That's my painting.

23:18.460 --> 23:22.460
You're turning every stove on.

23:22.460 --> 23:26.460
Don't take, you're combing your hair with everything.

23:26.460 --> 23:29.460
God, don't punch the wall.

23:29.460 --> 23:32.460
Oh, no, don't lock me in my own vestibule.

23:32.460 --> 23:34.460
Oh, no.

23:34.460 --> 23:35.460
No.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.460
New choice.

23:38.460 --> 23:44.460
No, that was a sketch about the bipartisan system.

23:44.460 --> 23:45.460
I got it.

23:45.460 --> 23:46.460
I get it.

23:46.460 --> 23:50.460
Hey, Dan, Rob, Jeff.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.460
I don't want to pimp you too much.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.460
Could you guys do one of your dead L.S. sketches?

23:54.460 --> 23:56.460
Do you know one that you could do,

23:56.460 --> 23:58.460
like you could recreate right now?

23:58.460 --> 24:00.460
You mean like the old drive-thru sketch?

24:00.460 --> 24:01.460
Sure.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.460
Oh, yeah.

24:02.460 --> 24:03.460
Oh, the drive-thru sketch?

24:03.460 --> 24:04.460
Yeah, yeah.

24:04.460 --> 24:05.460
Okay, can you do it?

24:05.460 --> 24:06.460
Sure, sure, of course.

24:06.460 --> 24:07.460
I mean, who can't?

24:07.460 --> 24:08.460
Do you want to enter music?

24:08.460 --> 24:11.460
Or do you want to do it alfresco?

24:11.460 --> 24:12.460
No, I know.

24:12.460 --> 24:15.460
I mean, it probably needs to be a little bit of a tee-up.

24:15.460 --> 24:17.460
I mean, you kids probably don't know.

24:17.460 --> 24:21.460
Sometimes when you go to drive-thru for fast food,

24:21.460 --> 24:28.460
it's a little difficult to understand the person at the speaker.

24:28.460 --> 24:40.460
Okay, I like where this is going.

24:40.460 --> 24:50.460
For $5 a month, you can know what Rob is fucking doing right now.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.460
Welcome to this restaurant.

24:52.460 --> 24:58.460
Can I take your order?

24:58.460 --> 25:05.460
Yes, I would like a pair of french fries.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
All right, that's two french fries.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.460
Is this going to be anything else?

25:09.460 --> 25:16.460
And also, I would like a pair of a...

25:16.460 --> 25:17.460
Perry A.

25:17.460 --> 25:24.460
One pair and a water.

25:24.460 --> 25:33.460
Please pull around.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.460
That'll be...

25:34.460 --> 25:43.460
I went too far.

25:43.460 --> 25:48.460
That'll be $11.95.

25:48.460 --> 26:07.460
$1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10.

26:07.460 --> 26:14.460
Okay.

26:14.460 --> 26:24.460
Sir, please don't tell me you're about to say what I think you're about to say.

26:24.460 --> 26:42.460
Oh, what he ate up...

26:42.460 --> 27:00.460
I'm trying to...

27:00.460 --> 27:29.460
He ran full of bricks.

27:29.460 --> 27:33.460
Oh, shit, he's done skis.

27:33.460 --> 27:35.460
Control.

27:35.460 --> 27:36.460
Yeah, what's up?

27:36.460 --> 27:38.460
I need ski support.

27:38.460 --> 27:39.460
Can't do it.

27:39.460 --> 27:40.460
What?

27:40.460 --> 27:41.460
I hope you said can do it.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.460
Can't do it.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.460
What about a snowboard?

27:45.460 --> 27:50.460
Pronto.

27:50.460 --> 28:00.460
Oh, shit.

28:00.460 --> 28:14.460
Credit.

28:14.460 --> 28:18.460
Missing you.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.460
Snow flying.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.460
What?

28:21.460 --> 28:22.460
Shit.

28:22.460 --> 28:23.460
What?

28:23.460 --> 28:24.460
No.

28:24.460 --> 28:25.460
My ripcord.

28:25.460 --> 28:26.460
Shit.

28:26.460 --> 28:27.460
Fuck.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.460
I can't.

28:28.460 --> 28:29.460
I'm floating.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.460
Wait a minute.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.460
So much weightlessness.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
This life isn't for me.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.460
I'm a minimum wage employee.

28:33.460 --> 28:38.460
I don't need to pursue criminals this much.

28:38.460 --> 28:48.460
Tarp.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.460
This is control.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.460
Yeah, Roger.

28:53.460 --> 28:54.460
This is Alpha-7.

28:54.460 --> 28:55.460
Suspect lost.

28:55.460 --> 28:56.460
All right.

28:56.460 --> 28:57.460
Nope.

28:57.460 --> 29:08.460
Just look to your left.

29:08.460 --> 29:17.460
Hey, you did a good race, man.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.460
Yeah, well, I'm out of a job thanks to you.

29:20.460 --> 29:23.460
Here's the dollar I owe you.

29:23.460 --> 29:26.460
Hey, one more thing you owe me.

29:26.460 --> 29:33.460
A partnership.

29:33.460 --> 29:52.460
Styles and Rigby will be back next summer in fast food furious.

29:52.460 --> 29:56.460
Who was the protagonist in that?

29:56.460 --> 30:02.460
I think me, but I write up to all my characters.

30:02.460 --> 30:07.460
If you can identify a villain in any of my work, I've done a bad job.

30:07.460 --> 30:08.460
Wow.

30:08.460 --> 30:17.460
It's like if you can identify the crust in a Domino's Pizza, you should get your money

30:17.460 --> 30:18.460
back.

30:18.460 --> 30:19.460
Because the whole thing should be pizza.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.460
You shouldn't be leaving any of it aside.

30:21.460 --> 30:22.460
Oh, this is crust.

30:22.460 --> 30:24.460
No, it's all pizza.

30:24.460 --> 30:25.460
Eat it.

30:25.460 --> 30:26.460
Eat it.

30:26.460 --> 30:30.460
Or we failed.

30:30.460 --> 30:32.460
You're fucking blowing my mind.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.460
Yeah, man.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.460
All right.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.460
Let's get on with the show.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.460
Yeah, quit.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.460
Let's do a countdown.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.460
Sorry.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.460
Quit screwing around and do the countdown.

30:41.460 --> 30:42.460
Let's do a countdown.

30:42.460 --> 30:43.460
A countdown.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.460
Do a countdown until the show starts.

30:45.460 --> 30:46.460
Okay.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.460
What's the countdown?

30:47.460 --> 30:51.460
That's the 10 biggest jokes.

30:51.460 --> 30:54.460
Top 10 funniest things.

30:54.460 --> 30:55.460
Yeah.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.460
All right.

30:57.460 --> 30:58.460
Let's start.

30:58.460 --> 30:59.460
Let's go backwards.

30:59.460 --> 31:00.460
Let's go from 10 to 1.

31:00.460 --> 31:01.460
Okay.

31:01.460 --> 31:06.460
Nick, top 10 funniest things starting from the bottom.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.460
Number 10.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.460
Yeah, no pressure.

31:08.460 --> 31:13.460
Number 10, dog tripping.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.460
Dog tripping.

31:14.460 --> 31:15.460
Number 10.

31:15.460 --> 31:18.460
Coming in at number nine, church leaving the stage.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.460
Whoa.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.460
Right.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.460
Church, where'd you go?

31:22.460 --> 31:25.460
That's fucking funny.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.460
She was brought up because it was her birthday.

31:27.460 --> 31:30.460
She's like, what am I, I'm hostage up here.

31:30.460 --> 31:31.460
That makes sense.

31:31.460 --> 31:32.460
I'm with you, man.

31:32.460 --> 31:36.460
Spencer, the number nine funniest thing.

31:36.460 --> 31:42.460
Number nine funniest thing, the Macarena.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.460
I think you're right.

31:44.460 --> 31:45.460
Pretty up there.

31:45.460 --> 31:46.460
At this time.

31:46.460 --> 31:47.460
Yeah, definitely.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.460
Who wants to take number eight?

31:48.460 --> 31:49.460
I'll take it.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.460
Rob.

31:50.460 --> 31:55.460
Rabbit television.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.460
He's right.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.460
He's right.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.460
Number seven funniest thing.

32:02.460 --> 32:13.460
Number seven funniest thing, a grape returning a shirt at Target.

32:13.460 --> 32:17.460
That's correct.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.460
That is it.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.460
Number six funniest thing.

32:22.460 --> 32:24.460
Did we skip seven?

32:24.460 --> 32:29.460
I would have thought a grape returning a shirt would have been number one, but no.

32:29.460 --> 32:30.460
That's not funny.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.460
It changes every time.

32:32.460 --> 32:34.460
Are we at number seven now or number six?

32:34.460 --> 32:36.460
I think we're at seven.

32:36.460 --> 32:37.460
Number seven.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.460
Seventh funniest thing.

32:39.460 --> 32:42.460
A lot of people are hissing the word six.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.460
Yeah, the grape returning a shirt was number seven.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.460
Okay.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.460
All right.

32:47.460 --> 32:48.460
So we're at six.

32:48.460 --> 32:49.460
We're on six.

32:49.460 --> 32:52.460
I personally didn't think it was that funny.

32:52.460 --> 32:55.460
I think that's fair.

32:55.460 --> 32:56.460
We're at number six.

32:56.460 --> 33:00.460
Number six is angry bus driver.

33:00.460 --> 33:06.460
And he's racist.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.460
I bet he thinks he's not funny at all.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.460
He probably thinks he's telling the truth.

33:10.460 --> 33:11.460
He's just living life.

33:11.460 --> 33:13.460
That's why it's what's funny about it.

33:13.460 --> 33:18.460
Just the angry bus driver who's a racist say his jokes over the like PA system.

33:18.460 --> 33:19.460
I don't know.

33:19.460 --> 33:22.460
We didn't have any questions about the other items.

33:22.460 --> 33:25.460
Can we get one of his racist bomo?

33:25.460 --> 33:28.460
I don't know.

33:28.460 --> 33:29.460
No.

33:29.460 --> 33:30.460
It's probably good.

33:30.460 --> 33:31.460
We're about halfway through the list.

33:31.460 --> 33:36.460
We should probably just show the racist bus driver movie.

33:36.460 --> 33:40.460
Oh, yeah.

33:40.460 --> 33:55.460
Keep it down back there, depending on your skin color.

33:55.460 --> 33:58.460
That's a certain amount of offensive to me.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.460
What?

33:59.460 --> 34:00.460
Who said that?

34:00.460 --> 34:03.460
And how light is your skin?

34:03.460 --> 34:04.460
Oh, it's just me.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.460
And this is my skin color.

34:06.460 --> 34:07.460
Let me see.

34:07.460 --> 34:08.460
Okay.

34:08.460 --> 34:11.460
So you could see how appropriate my conduct was or wasn't.

34:11.460 --> 34:14.460
Joel, don't make me come back there.

34:14.460 --> 34:18.460
Could I please get back into the bus, please?

34:18.460 --> 34:20.460
Why am I out on the...

34:20.460 --> 34:23.460
I can't tell.

34:23.460 --> 34:26.460
I can't tell.

34:26.460 --> 34:29.460
Please, let me get back into the bus.

34:29.460 --> 34:30.460
I don't know.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.460
Please, I'm on the wing.

34:31.460 --> 34:35.460
I'm a certified racist and I don't know whether you're on...

34:35.460 --> 34:37.460
Please, why am I out on the...

34:37.460 --> 34:38.460
I don't know.

34:38.460 --> 34:39.460
What?

34:39.460 --> 34:40.460
Just get on the bus.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.460
What about...

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
Get on the bus and choose your position within it.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.460
All right.

34:45.460 --> 34:46.460
Whoa!

34:46.460 --> 34:47.460
Psst!

34:47.460 --> 34:48.460
Psst!

34:48.460 --> 34:49.460
Psst!

34:49.460 --> 34:51.460
No, that's not a greeting.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.460
I'm opening the door.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.460
Okay, could I please...

34:55.460 --> 34:56.460
Yeah, good job.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.460
Get on the bus.

34:57.460 --> 34:58.460
Goddamn.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.460
I can't wait to find out where Rachel...

35:01.460 --> 35:02.460
What?

35:02.460 --> 35:10.460
Can I wear my religious garb in here?

35:10.460 --> 35:13.460
You're all free to do whatever you want.

35:13.460 --> 35:17.460
The question is what's going to antagonize me, your bus driver?

35:17.460 --> 35:22.460
That answer will be graded on a curve, I assure you.

35:22.460 --> 35:26.460
As I am thoroughly racist.

35:26.460 --> 35:33.460
I'm going to eat my own country's bread now.

35:33.460 --> 35:36.460
It better be my country.

35:36.460 --> 35:40.460
Oh, we dip our bread in mayonnaise.

35:40.460 --> 35:43.460
I hear so much mischievous gas back there.

35:43.460 --> 35:46.460
I can't concentrate on being a good bus driver.

35:46.460 --> 35:49.460
Could you drive a little slower, please?

35:49.460 --> 35:54.460
Can you turn the bus to the south?

35:54.460 --> 35:55.460
Yes.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.460
So, how far south?

35:57.460 --> 36:02.460
I can just do south so I can pray.

36:02.460 --> 36:05.460
To whom?

36:05.460 --> 36:06.460
What does it matter?

36:06.460 --> 36:09.460
You're right, it shouldn't, but...

36:09.460 --> 36:14.460
This is the coolest bus driver ever.

36:14.460 --> 36:15.460
This guy rules.

36:15.460 --> 36:18.460
All right, I've turned south.

36:18.460 --> 36:19.460
I hope...

36:19.460 --> 36:23.460
I'm going to pray myself that your God is appropriate.

36:23.460 --> 36:30.460
Please, racist God, let my passenger face south toward the right God,

36:30.460 --> 36:36.460
that I may continue to bus drive him and sleep at night tonight with my racist head on my pillow.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.460
Amen.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.460
Are you all finished?

36:39.460 --> 36:40.460
Yeah, I'm...

36:40.460 --> 36:41.460
Yeah, yeah, fine.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.460
Okay.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.460
Well, we're behind schedule now.

36:44.460 --> 36:46.460
You're making it weird up there, man.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.460
I'm not weird, I'm normal.

36:49.460 --> 36:55.460
Why is he doing that with his legs?

36:55.460 --> 36:59.460
It's a pedal bus, man.

36:59.460 --> 37:05.460
Last stop, Albuquerque Square.

37:05.460 --> 37:09.460
Can everybody get off the bus?

37:09.460 --> 37:11.460
I'm not leaving the bus.

37:11.460 --> 37:17.460
I'm leaving the bus.

37:17.460 --> 37:20.460
I'm waiting for a cab.

37:20.460 --> 37:27.460
Because I'm racist against long vehicles.

37:27.460 --> 37:30.460
I'm finished with my shift, that's all I know.

37:30.460 --> 37:32.460
See you later.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.460
Taking my mic back off.

37:34.460 --> 37:37.460
My star.

37:37.460 --> 37:39.460
My taser.

37:39.460 --> 37:42.460
My changed converter.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.460
My spare battery.

37:44.460 --> 37:46.460
My bus hat.

37:46.460 --> 37:49.460
My collar enforcer.

37:49.460 --> 37:52.460
My regular collar.

37:52.460 --> 37:54.460
My collar underlier.

37:54.460 --> 37:57.460
My sub-collar.

37:57.460 --> 37:59.460
My negla-collar.

37:59.460 --> 38:03.460
And my dicotelage.

38:03.460 --> 38:05.460
Force field.

38:05.460 --> 38:09.460
Now, time to go home to my wife and children.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.460
What's your wife's name?

38:11.460 --> 38:13.460
What?

38:13.460 --> 38:18.460
You're not supposed to still be on the bus, I'm racist.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.460
I don't have legs.

38:21.460 --> 38:25.460
Oh, my life, I've categorized people by race.

38:25.460 --> 38:30.460
This one lacks an ability.

38:30.460 --> 38:33.460
Carry me off the bus to your wife.

38:33.460 --> 38:36.460
What race are you?

38:36.460 --> 38:40.460
I'm... well, can't you tell?

38:40.460 --> 38:42.460
I can.

38:42.460 --> 38:46.460
You're a race in need.

38:46.460 --> 38:50.460
A race in need is a race indeed.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.460
Yay.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.460
Come off the bus.

38:54.460 --> 38:57.460
Why are you grabbing the side of my breast?

38:57.460 --> 39:02.460
Sorry, I don't know how to help.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.460
I'm a curmudgeon.

39:04.460 --> 39:08.460
Most films are about people like me.

39:08.460 --> 39:14.460
We start as comedically flawed, and then we progress to being normal.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.460
And then it's an arc.

39:16.460 --> 39:20.460
Like, oh, I can't stand popsicles, and then it's like,

39:20.460 --> 39:22.460
oh, yeah, the third act, I can eat a popsicle.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.460
Okay, cool.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.460
Cool, whatever.

39:26.460 --> 39:27.460
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

39:27.460 --> 39:28.460
No, no.

39:28.460 --> 39:30.460
Here's my bus station.

39:30.460 --> 39:33.460
Sit down, you grumpy, you racial person.

39:33.460 --> 39:34.460
Why?

39:34.460 --> 39:36.460
You eat your popsicle.

39:36.460 --> 39:38.460
Why?

39:38.460 --> 39:40.460
I'm tired of your race.

39:40.460 --> 39:44.460
I hope you like sandwiches on a hot plate.

39:44.460 --> 39:46.460
Extra, extra, read all about it.

39:46.460 --> 39:48.460
Who's that?

39:48.460 --> 39:50.460
I don't want your racial news.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.460
Extra, read all about it.

39:52.460 --> 39:54.460
Give me it.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.460
You're an idiot.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.460
Shut up.

39:58.460 --> 40:00.460
Go away.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.460
I can't breathe.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.460
I don't like anyone.

40:04.460 --> 40:08.460
I will never be different.

40:08.460 --> 40:12.460
He was the biggest racist of all.

40:12.460 --> 40:18.460
For one who loves all the races

40:18.460 --> 40:20.460
is a...

40:20.460 --> 40:22.460
not...

40:22.460 --> 40:26.460
no one who is welcome in the kingdom of me.

40:26.460 --> 40:32.460
Hitler Christ.

40:32.460 --> 40:34.460
Oh.

40:34.460 --> 40:40.460
I hear that voice every day.

40:40.460 --> 40:42.460
Haunts me at night.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.460
What did he mean by that?

40:44.460 --> 40:48.460
What's up, dog?

40:48.460 --> 40:52.460
Let's get boba, man.

40:52.460 --> 41:00.460
I'm Hitler Christ.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.460
Only I can see you.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.460
That's right.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.460
That's the way I like it.

41:06.460 --> 41:08.460
Well, okay.

41:08.460 --> 41:12.460
So now we're going to win an Oscar, right?

41:12.460 --> 41:16.460
Hey, man, we just make this art for Art's sake.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.460
If the Academy recognizes it,

41:18.460 --> 41:20.460
that's their prerogative.

41:20.460 --> 41:22.460
I'm going to...

41:22.460 --> 41:24.460
Oh, shit.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.460
Hello.

41:26.460 --> 41:28.460
This is the bus driver boss.

41:28.460 --> 41:33.460
Hey, there are people just flooding the streets.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.740
No one's picking them up.

41:34.740 --> 41:38.220
I just stopped at home to make a sandwich and a hot plate.

41:38.220 --> 41:40.300
You eat your sandwich on your own time,

41:40.300 --> 41:42.500
get in that bus and pick up some people,

41:42.500 --> 41:44.020
the streets are filled.

41:45.780 --> 41:48.860
Damn it, you racial character, you cost me my job.

41:48.860 --> 41:50.140
Get up, come on.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.660
Where am I supposed to go?

41:51.660 --> 41:53.820
I'm sick of you, go wherever you want,

41:53.820 --> 41:54.660
but get on the bus with me.

41:54.660 --> 41:56.180
I'll always be in your mind.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.540
Hey, I wanted to get on the bus.

41:59.540 --> 42:00.740
For Christ's sake.

42:00.740 --> 42:03.420
I'm gonna get into the door right behind your door.

42:03.420 --> 42:04.740
Okay, good.

42:04.740 --> 42:05.580
God damn it.

42:05.580 --> 42:07.540
I want to get on the bus too, I want to get on the bus.

42:07.540 --> 42:10.540
What a road of trials I'm on.

42:10.540 --> 42:12.340
Let all these people on.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.020
Okay, let's all get on the bus.

42:14.020 --> 42:14.860
Ah.

42:14.860 --> 42:15.700
How are you?

42:15.700 --> 42:16.540
Ah.

42:16.540 --> 42:17.380
Are you driving by the bus?

42:17.380 --> 42:18.220
Ah.

42:18.220 --> 42:19.820
I went to the car.

42:19.820 --> 42:21.740
You gotta keep this.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.940
I can't stop for anyone.

42:23.940 --> 42:25.220
They're too ethnic.

42:25.220 --> 42:26.060
Come on, come back, come back.

42:26.060 --> 42:28.180
No, I won't pick any of you up.

42:28.180 --> 42:30.380
I'm just gonna drag you to the bus.

42:30.380 --> 42:31.940
You've got to keep this.

42:31.940 --> 42:32.780
No.

42:32.780 --> 42:33.620
Oh.

42:33.620 --> 42:34.780
I'll drive the bus.

42:34.780 --> 42:35.620
Wait, man.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.580
Stop it, we're a racist bus driver.

42:37.580 --> 42:39.460
Hey, no, no.

42:39.460 --> 42:41.060
Billboard for Marlboro.

42:41.060 --> 42:41.900
No.

42:41.900 --> 42:42.740
Oh.

42:42.740 --> 42:43.580
Oh.

42:43.580 --> 42:44.420
Oh.

42:44.420 --> 42:45.260
Oh.

42:49.660 --> 42:53.460
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

42:53.460 --> 43:18.100
Sail away, sail away, sail away, sailing away, sail away,

43:18.100 --> 43:21.740
sail away, sail away.

43:21.740 --> 43:23.740
You finally have hands.

43:23.740 --> 43:29.740
You...

43:29.740 --> 43:31.740
They're back now.

43:31.740 --> 43:33.740
I'm ready.

43:33.740 --> 43:36.740
I'm ready to not be racist.

43:36.740 --> 43:39.740
Then get the fuck off my bus, man.

43:39.740 --> 43:41.740
Ah!

43:41.740 --> 43:48.740
Silhouette, Silhouette, Silhouette, Silhouette.

43:48.740 --> 43:54.740
Middle of the...

43:54.740 --> 43:56.740
All right, well...

43:56.740 --> 43:58.740
Well, I don't think...

43:58.740 --> 44:01.740
I mean, I'm not gonna defend our material,

44:01.740 --> 44:03.740
but I don't think that was the right way to...

44:03.740 --> 44:05.740
You can't defend gravity.

44:05.740 --> 44:08.740
That is the sixth funniest thing.

44:08.740 --> 44:10.740
Yeah, that was...

44:10.740 --> 44:12.740
A racist bus driver.

44:12.740 --> 44:15.740
We got a long show ahead of you guys.

44:15.740 --> 44:19.740
Not every item on the list is gonna be that long.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.740
That was just like the intervention.

44:21.740 --> 44:25.740
Why are you certainly taking care of him?

44:25.740 --> 44:27.740
Schrab, do you want something?

44:27.740 --> 44:29.740
All right, fifth funniest thing, what is it?

44:29.740 --> 44:31.740
Art Park School.

44:31.740 --> 44:33.740
Art Park School?

44:33.740 --> 44:35.740
Art Park School.

44:35.740 --> 44:37.740
Isn't there a children's show about that already?

44:37.740 --> 44:39.740
What?

44:39.740 --> 44:41.740
Isn't Arthur the Art Park?

44:41.740 --> 44:43.740
What?

44:43.740 --> 44:45.740
What?

44:45.740 --> 44:49.740
Jeremy, Oedvok?

44:49.740 --> 44:52.740
Brrr is?

44:52.740 --> 44:54.740
Todd, Oedvok?

44:54.740 --> 44:56.740
Prison!

44:56.740 --> 44:58.740
Here.

44:58.740 --> 45:00.740
Missy, Oedvok?

45:00.740 --> 45:02.740
Yo!

45:02.740 --> 45:04.740
Christopher, Oedvok?

45:04.740 --> 45:09.740
You may call me Royale Champagne.

45:09.740 --> 45:12.740
Brad, Oedvok?

45:12.740 --> 45:13.780
That's me.

45:15.620 --> 45:16.820
Kim Ardvark?

45:18.080 --> 45:20.420
Is this in alphabetical order?

45:20.420 --> 45:22.100
Yeah, Ardvark.

45:23.180 --> 45:24.540
We're on the A's.

45:25.620 --> 45:29.180
Yeah, I'm Kim Ardvark and I happen to be pregnant

45:29.180 --> 45:31.820
and you're not gonna tell me how to run my life.

45:31.820 --> 45:32.660
Okay.

45:33.860 --> 45:35.340
Shelley Ardvark?

45:37.340 --> 45:39.180
Yeah, hi.

45:40.740 --> 45:41.900
I'm friend with...

45:41.900 --> 45:43.660
Michael Ardvark?

45:43.660 --> 45:45.980
Yes, I'm Michael Ardvark and I'm wondering,

45:45.980 --> 45:47.540
what is Ardvark school?

45:47.540 --> 45:49.740
As an Ardvark, I...

45:49.740 --> 45:53.500
Ah, fucking Michael, always question and things.

45:53.500 --> 45:57.860
Michael, raise your hand before you start talking.

45:59.180 --> 46:01.100
I'm an Ardvark, I don't have hands.

46:01.100 --> 46:02.940
Yeah, well, then you're never gonna talk.

46:02.940 --> 46:03.980
Shut the fuck up.

46:05.740 --> 46:07.060
Racist?

46:07.060 --> 46:07.900
Damn.

46:07.900 --> 46:10.220
That's the fifth funniest thing.

46:10.220 --> 46:15.220
The fourth, we're now going to the fourth funniest thing.

46:15.620 --> 46:16.460
The fourth...

46:16.460 --> 46:17.940
Ardvark school really earned its perch

46:17.940 --> 46:20.100
in the middle of the list.

46:20.100 --> 46:21.980
The fourth funniest thing.

46:21.980 --> 46:25.140
You can see why racist bus drivers one notch below

46:26.060 --> 46:30.140
because it took 20 minutes to be half as funny.

46:30.140 --> 46:31.300
I get it, I get it.

46:35.180 --> 46:36.780
Racist bus driver.

46:36.780 --> 46:37.620
I get it.

46:37.620 --> 46:40.420
Ardvark school, now the fourth funniest thing.

46:42.260 --> 46:44.300
Living wreaths.

46:44.300 --> 46:47.140
Living wreaths.

46:47.140 --> 46:48.180
Living wreaths.

46:48.180 --> 46:50.540
Let's cut straight to the third funniest thing.

46:52.540 --> 46:54.140
I want to know why living wreaths

46:54.140 --> 46:56.340
beat out Ardvark school.

46:56.340 --> 46:59.340
Perhaps this short subject will...

47:01.140 --> 47:03.220
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.

47:03.220 --> 47:06.860
Let's hear the sleigh bells ringin' and dingin' and dingin'

47:06.860 --> 47:07.740
and ding, ding, ding, ding.

47:07.740 --> 47:10.580
Come on, Jessica, you're gonna be late for the ice.

47:10.580 --> 47:13.380
My feet are frozen onto the ground.

47:13.380 --> 47:14.220
Who cares?

47:14.220 --> 47:15.900
We're dating, come on.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.700
Okay.

47:17.700 --> 47:20.500
Crack, crack, crack, crack.

47:20.500 --> 47:23.540
Ayy, take it easy, baby.

47:27.840 --> 47:30.940
I wanted to get you a ring for Christmas,

47:30.940 --> 47:34.720
but all I could afford were these to reads.

47:34.720 --> 47:37.720
Thank you, Jessica.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.720
Oh, hello.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.720
I'm one of the wreaths.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.720
Oh, shit.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.720
I'm Hitler Christ.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.720
All right, I get it.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.720
I see why that's funny.

47:50.720 --> 47:52.720
That seems funny.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.720
That one works.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.720
That one.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.720
We're down to the top three.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.720
The top three funniest things.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.720
Wow, this bar is getting high.

48:02.720 --> 48:08.720
It's going to get to the point where the number one thing doesn't even need a scene to explain it.

48:08.720 --> 48:12.720
It'll all be references to the last nine things.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.720
So the number three funniest thing.

48:15.720 --> 48:17.720
Yeah, we know. We can say it at the same time.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.720
Sure.

48:19.720 --> 48:23.720
Baby with a mustache.

48:23.720 --> 48:26.720
Yeah.

48:26.720 --> 48:29.720
Good thing we didn't have to say it at the same time.

48:29.720 --> 48:35.720
Okay, okay. One more time. Push, push, push.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.720
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. You can do it, baby.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.720
Come on, baby. I'm with you, baby.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.720
One big fun of push.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.720
Baby, I'm with you, baby. Come on, baby.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.720
Oh, baby. Oh, it's coming out, Ben.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.720
It's coming out.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.720
I'm a baby.

48:54.720 --> 48:58.720
I need other oxygen.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.720
Oh, he's got something.

49:01.720 --> 49:05.720
We are now down to the top two.

49:05.720 --> 49:09.720
Wait, why did you cut off, baby, with a mustache early?

49:09.720 --> 49:12.720
Why did you give so much time to the bus driver?

49:12.720 --> 49:15.720
People were calling in why there were two doctors.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.720
Racist bus driver needed some more legs, I thought.

49:18.720 --> 49:23.720
Why was the wreath couple like two dudes who were abusing each other?

49:23.720 --> 49:28.720
We barely got into the actual living wreath.

49:31.720 --> 49:34.720
I get it.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.720
What are we to decide?

49:36.720 --> 49:38.720
Top two funniest things.

49:38.720 --> 49:41.720
Batmobile sandwich.

49:43.720 --> 49:46.720
It requires no explanation.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.720
Let's go right into the scene.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.720
A lot of times these top 10 lists get shorter and shorter.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.720
Because they're automatically...

49:53.720 --> 49:56.720
But in case you need to know...

49:56.720 --> 49:59.720
Alfred.

49:59.720 --> 50:02.720
Oh, yes, Master Wing.

50:02.720 --> 50:07.720
I've been fighting crime a lot all day.

50:07.720 --> 50:10.720
What have you brought me here?

50:10.720 --> 50:12.720
What is this?

50:12.720 --> 50:17.720
Eat me, eat me, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

50:17.720 --> 50:21.720
It's your favorite.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.720
Broom, boom, boom.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.720
I got a jet.

50:25.720 --> 50:30.720
It's talking to me.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.720
Yep, your favorite.

50:32.720 --> 50:36.720
It is a Batmobile sandwich.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.720
Ooh.

50:38.720 --> 50:43.720
Do you want me to cut it in half for you?

50:43.720 --> 50:47.720
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.720
Hello, Batman.

50:49.720 --> 50:52.720
I'm Mr. Bacon.

50:52.720 --> 50:56.720
Why did you back up into the...

50:56.720 --> 50:58.720
Batcave.

50:58.720 --> 51:02.720
I find it more efficient to back into a Batcave

51:02.720 --> 51:06.720
so I can drive straight out of it with all of the bacon.

51:06.720 --> 51:08.720
Your sandwich will be baconless, Batman.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.720
You're a villain.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.720
Yes.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.720
It's packed in here.

51:14.720 --> 51:15.720
Alfred.

51:15.720 --> 51:16.720
What?

51:16.720 --> 51:17.720
Way to go.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.720
I can't believe these things are unrelated.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.720
It's impossible.

51:21.720 --> 51:24.720
Dots are somewhat easy to connect.

51:24.720 --> 51:27.720
You brought me a sentient sandwich shaped like my car.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.720
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.720
Yes, and I've stolen all your bacon.

51:31.720 --> 51:33.720
And this guy's...

51:33.720 --> 51:36.720
Yes, your BLT will just be an LT.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.720
From now on...

51:38.720 --> 51:40.720
Yes, for the rest of time.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.720
What?

51:42.720 --> 51:44.720
No.

51:44.720 --> 51:47.720
I'm sorry, it's a one-way walkie-talkie.

51:47.720 --> 51:49.720
Wait, what?

51:49.720 --> 51:50.720
Who's on?

51:50.720 --> 51:52.720
Are we on conference call?

51:52.720 --> 51:54.720
This is Batman.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.720
Batman is talking.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.720
Go ahead, Batman.

51:58.720 --> 52:00.720
I'll come back later.

52:00.720 --> 52:02.720
No, you stay on.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.720
You brought me the sandwich.

52:04.720 --> 52:07.720
The sandwich is talking to me.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.720
It's shaped like my car.

52:09.720 --> 52:11.720
You've stolen the bacon.

52:11.720 --> 52:14.720
Bacon man pulled his truck into the back case.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.720
What?

52:15.720 --> 52:17.720
You're fucking racist.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.720
I have a lot of laundry to fold upstairs.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.720
Are we done?

52:28.720 --> 52:31.720
I'm going to the Bat booth.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.720
And then I'll deal with all of you.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.720
He's gonna jerk off.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.720
Yeah.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.720
Yeah.

52:39.720 --> 52:41.720
Computer.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.720
What's up, man?

52:43.720 --> 52:46.720
Give me super bad powers.

52:46.720 --> 52:49.720
Oh, okay.

52:49.720 --> 52:51.720
Uh...

52:51.720 --> 52:53.720
Yeah, there you go.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.720
That's not your step-sister.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.720
What?

52:57.720 --> 52:59.720
No, no, no.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.720
I was...

53:01.720 --> 53:03.720
Oh, baby bad.

53:03.720 --> 53:06.720
I went to the wrong booth.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.720
Oh, it happens.

53:08.720 --> 53:10.720
I'll see you later.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.720
Someone on the right.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.720
Going to this other booth.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.720
All right.

53:16.720 --> 53:18.720
Hey, you built two of me.

53:18.720 --> 53:20.720
One more to the right.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.720
I get it.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.720
All right.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.720
Look.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.720
Nobody wants me to be Batman anymore.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.720
No.

53:30.720 --> 53:32.720
Anymore than I want to keep doing it.

53:32.720 --> 53:34.720
You guys are bringing me comedy sandwiches.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.720
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.

53:36.720 --> 53:38.720
I got villains pulling their cars backwards.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.720
Can I be honest?

53:40.720 --> 53:42.720
I should have stolen bread.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.720
Bacon, like you can do without,

53:44.720 --> 53:46.720
but bread's kind of like...

53:46.720 --> 53:48.720
bread's kind of the whole point of a sandwich.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.720
If I were a good sandwich villain,

53:50.720 --> 53:52.720
I would have taken the bread.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.720
I don't want to fight you.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.720
I want you to be the new Batman.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.720
Bacon man.

53:58.720 --> 54:00.720
Here's the keys.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.720
Stop calling...

54:02.720 --> 54:04.720
This is Alfred.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.720
He's going to work for you.

54:06.720 --> 54:08.720
What are you doing?

54:08.720 --> 54:10.720
Stop calling me Bacon man.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.720
Here's the key to my house.

54:12.720 --> 54:14.720
Here's the pink slip

54:14.720 --> 54:16.720
to my vehicles.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.720
Pink slip for the pink dress.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.720
Here's my talking sandwich.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.720
I called Bacon Pink Slips.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.720
In case you wanted to know that.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.720
He just said it.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.720
I'm going to Sardinia.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.720
Sardinia.

54:34.720 --> 54:36.720
That's underwater.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.720
Splash.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.720
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

54:42.720 --> 54:44.720
Under the sea.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.720
Under the sea.

54:46.720 --> 54:48.720
I used to be Batman.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.720
This is the second funniest thing.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.720
Under the sea.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.720
It needed no explanation, but...

54:54.720 --> 54:56.720
Under the sea.

54:56.720 --> 54:58.720
It's awful. I used to be Batman.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.720
I used to be Batman.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.720
Under the sea.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.720
You're still here.

55:04.720 --> 55:06.720
Under the sea.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.720
Here I am in Sardinia.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.720
Right.

55:10.720 --> 55:12.720
I'm a tiny fish.

55:12.720 --> 55:14.720
Fuck. We fucked up.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.720
I'm a talking man.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.720
Fucked up.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.720
That's my lover.

55:26.720 --> 55:28.720
All right.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.720
The two of you.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.720
You could look him too in the eye.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.720
You don't have to be weird.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.720
I'm a very rich man.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.720
I'd like the two of you to help me dig a cave.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.720
Okay. We can work here both sides.

55:40.720 --> 55:42.720
Yeah.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.720
Help me dig a cave.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.720
We'll do that.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.720
I'd like to hook up some computer equipment

55:48.720 --> 55:50.720
just to keep track of what's going on

55:50.720 --> 55:52.720
in the outside world.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.720
We don't like that.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.720
No. No.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.720
No.

55:58.720 --> 56:00.720
Honey.

56:00.720 --> 56:02.720
I don't want to do it.

56:02.720 --> 56:04.720
I'll do it.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.720
All right. Bye.

56:06.720 --> 56:08.720
I'm going to watch him.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.720
Fucking shit.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.720
Fucking don't need anybody.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.720
Fucking got scared of bats after my parents died.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.720
I don't care.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.720
I don't need anybody.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.720
I don't need anybody.

56:20.720 --> 56:22.720
I never needed anything.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.720
Hello.

56:24.720 --> 56:26.720
Hi.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.720
Oh, he's leaving.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.720
Why is he leaving?

56:30.720 --> 56:32.720
I don't need anybody.

56:32.720 --> 56:34.720
We're the ghosts of the ocean.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.720
Ocean ghosts.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.720
There's only two of us.

56:40.720 --> 56:42.720
Yes. It was a slow year.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.720
I don't care.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.720
I'm not scared of anything.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.720
All right. Bye.

56:48.720 --> 56:50.720
Overcame my fears.

56:50.720 --> 56:52.720
I don't care.

56:52.720 --> 56:54.720
You're going to be missed at the party.

56:54.720 --> 56:56.720
Set up one computer.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.720
That's all I need.

56:58.720 --> 57:00.720
One computer.

57:00.720 --> 57:02.720
A little guy in a hole.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.720
Government access.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.720
Computer.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.720
Tell me what's going on.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.720
It doesn't matter.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.720
I don't care.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.720
The high is 93.

57:14.720 --> 57:16.720
It's fine. It's good.

57:16.720 --> 57:18.720
I like it.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.720
Forest area.

57:20.720 --> 57:22.720
I love being in my cave.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.720
Nothing happening.

57:24.720 --> 57:26.720
Can I plug my laptop in?

57:26.720 --> 57:28.720
You can't be down here.

57:28.720 --> 57:30.720
Sorry.

57:30.720 --> 57:32.720
Can I plug my laptop in next to you?

57:32.720 --> 57:34.720
Sorry.

57:34.720 --> 57:36.720
The outlet is over there.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.720
I'm sitting over here.

57:38.720 --> 57:40.720
I have to go between your legs.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.720
Go ahead.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.720
You can plug it in yourself.

57:44.720 --> 57:46.720
I dug a hole.

57:46.720 --> 57:48.720
I got a coffee.

57:48.720 --> 57:50.720
I got just as much right to be here as you do.

57:50.720 --> 57:52.720
Go ahead.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.720
Plug in your laptop.

57:54.720 --> 57:56.720
Sorry.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.720
My head is pretty big.

57:58.720 --> 58:00.720
Knock yourself out. Goodbye.

58:00.720 --> 58:02.720
I'm leaving.

58:02.720 --> 58:04.720
I'm leaving.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.720
You forgot your bag.

58:06.720 --> 58:08.720
I didn't forget anything.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.720
I can dig another hole.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.720
I don't care.

58:12.720 --> 58:14.720
Get the fuck out of the road.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.720
I'm not in the road.

58:16.720 --> 58:18.720
I'm not in the road.

58:18.720 --> 58:20.720
Meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.720
Hong Kong.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.720
Fuck off. I was Batman once.

58:24.720 --> 58:26.720
All right.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.720
Digging a hole in this field.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.720
Dig down.

58:30.720 --> 58:32.720
I'm a field mouse.

58:32.720 --> 58:34.720
So what?

58:34.720 --> 58:36.720
Just say hi, bye.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.720
Fine, bye.

58:38.720 --> 58:40.720
If you were scary, I'd pattern.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.720
You said field.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.720
I don't care.

58:44.720 --> 58:46.720
Animals can't talk.

58:46.720 --> 58:48.720
Tink.

58:48.720 --> 58:50.720
Tink.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.720
I'm trying to dig in a business.

58:52.720 --> 58:54.720
A metal box.

58:56.720 --> 58:58.720
Pull it up to the surface of this field

58:58.720 --> 59:00.720
in the middle of Sardinia on the other side of a freeway.

59:06.720 --> 59:08.720
It's just a featureless chrome box.

59:08.720 --> 59:10.720
That's right.

59:10.720 --> 59:12.720
It's a chrome box.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.720
It's a very practical

59:20.720 --> 59:22.720
laptop alternative.

59:26.720 --> 59:28.720
Oh, hey, should I go?

59:28.720 --> 59:30.720
Sorry, I just saw you looking at that chrome box.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.720
You know what this is?

59:32.720 --> 59:34.720
Yeah.

59:34.720 --> 59:36.720
You're the coffee guy.

59:36.720 --> 59:38.720
You followed me.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.720
You recognize this chrome box?

59:40.720 --> 59:42.720
I think we switched chargers earlier.

59:42.720 --> 59:44.720
You followed me?

59:44.720 --> 59:46.720
No, I was looking.

59:46.720 --> 59:48.720
It's all right.

59:48.720 --> 59:50.720
I could use a guy like you in my new

59:50.720 --> 59:52.720
lower budget Batman career.

59:52.720 --> 59:54.720
Do you know how to work a chrome box?

59:54.720 --> 59:56.720
Yeah, of course.

59:56.720 --> 59:58.720
Everybody does.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.720
It boots up in six seconds or less.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.720
Okay, start it up and

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.720
I don't know.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.720
I'm going to...

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.720
You're bailing out on the bit already?

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.720
No, I'm not.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.720
What do you mean already?

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.720
It's been 40 minutes.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.720
Well, it just seems like once I entered the bit,

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.720
you were like, I don't know.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.720
No, I don't want to be that guy.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.720
I refuse to be that guy.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.720
I'm not going to be like, oh, that's not to my liking

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.720
I fucking bail.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.720
So you're not just ending my information for the scene?

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.720
I pulled out a chrome box.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.720
You're like, that's a chrome box.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.720
I mean, you deal with it.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.720
I'm going to walk over there

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.720
10 feet. I'm not bailing.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.720
I'm walking over there 10 feet.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.720
Can you bring back information that helps

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.720
me with my comedy?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.720
Yeah, all right. Okay, yeah.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.720
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.720
Don't go too far. I brought my friend.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.720
Yeah, count my steps.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.720
Hi, my name's Eric.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.720
I'm Batman.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.720
I used to be and I wish

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.720
I miss it so much.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.720
Step, step, step,

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.720
step, step,

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.720
I'm walking 10 feet away.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.720
This is the second funniest thing.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.720
I found a twig.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.720
I found a twig.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720
Does that help you with your Chromebook bit?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.720
It seems like you're bailing out.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.720
No, I'm not. I'm supporting

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.720
your bit. Hey, I'm sorry.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.720
I didn't think you'd be like this.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.720
It's okay.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.720
It took me a long time to drive here

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.720
and I was like,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.720
I think he's in a mood, honestly.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.720
I don't...

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.720
He didn't like their Chrome stuff.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.720
Yeah.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.720
Baderang set

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.720
AI position

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.720
to knocking out

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.720
two adult males

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.720
and then positioning

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.720
their bodies

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.720
ass up

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.720
over two wood stumps.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.720
Anyway, I think he's a good guy

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.720
and he's like...

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.720
It's not my fault

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.720
if your pants come down.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.720
International waters, bitch.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.720
My father

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.720
was a success.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.720
I could never...

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.720
I could never be like him.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.720
My parents weren't even killed

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.720
outside of theater. I made that up.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.720
They died of diabetes.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.720
I told everybody

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.720
they got mugged.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.720
I just wanted to be special.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.720
I was doomed from the beginning.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.720
I'm a victim of privilege.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720
I just want to come.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.720
I mean, you could just ask.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.720
Tell all your friends about me.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.720
I'll have what he's having.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.720
All right, there we go.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.720
There was...

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.720
That was the second funniest thing.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.720
That was the second funniest thing.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.720
See, I thought...

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.720
I thought they would get shorter.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.720
I thought that the...

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.720
I think I just seen clips of it over the years.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.720
I felt like as the list progressed

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.720
that it would get like,

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.720
I don't need that explained.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.720
But it turned out that one

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720
needed the most explanation.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720
Why was it called Batmobile Sandwich?

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720
It seemed like...

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720
That didn't have a lot to do with it.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.720
And it turns out the reason it's funny

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.720
is because Batman is a predator.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.720
Yeah.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.720
No, he wants to...

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.720
How deep did he swim until he found

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.720
a freeway down there?

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.720
I did find a lot of it resonant.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.720
I liked that he was an isolated person

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.720
who kept seeking space

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.720
and the more he got the more he needed.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.720
I thought that was very important

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.720
to study.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.720
I thought it was cool when he was

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.720
fucking that guy in the ass.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.720
Well, you would.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.720
That's gauche.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.720
I understood

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.720
why they put that in there,

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.720
but I wasn't into it.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.720
I wasn't like, ooh, I got it.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.720
I thought that was cool.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.720
I wanted to know more about the consortium

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.720
of people that decided

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.720
what's the funniest thing,

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.720
because that's strangely the second

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.720
funniest thing of all time.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.720
It is, isn't it?

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.720
It just took that long to...

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.720
Well, I guess

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.720
it's about that time.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.720
What time is that then?

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.720
It's time to unveil the first funniest thing.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.720
Right after this commercial break.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.720
Do you have

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.720
an ear?

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720
Yeah, who doesn't?

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720
Is it about time

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.720
to get it checked out?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.720
Hey, I have your ears.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.720
I'm on one side of your head

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.720
and I'm on the other side of your head.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.720
I'll tell you one thing.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.720
Both of us are unhappy.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.720
Come down.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.720
No, you guys go.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.720
No, I'm here to listen.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720
I want to go.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.720
We're all ears here.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.720
No, I hear what you're doing.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.720
You go ahead.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.720
You talk. I'll listen. I'm ears.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.720
Has this happened to you?

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.720
What?

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.720
Do you have earitis?

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720
If your head's covered with ears,

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.720
all of them

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.720
want to hear each other.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.720
And it can actually accomplish the opposite effect.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.720
Call 1-8-8

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.720
300

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.720
Ear Pies

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.720
Dump.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.720
So dumb.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.720
Right.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.720
Yeah.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.720
That was the commercial.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.720
Ear Pies.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.720
Yeah.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.720
We hear.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.720
That's where you should have gone.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.720
I like what I did.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.720
If you're just tuning in,

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.720
we're coming up on the

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.720
10 funniest things countdown.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.720
And that was a word

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.720
from our sponsor.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.720
Dan, real quick.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.720
Recap the top

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.720
the top nine.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.720
Recap the top nine for us

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.720
and bring us up to number one.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.720
Of course, we can all remember

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.720
the least funny.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.720
It's funny

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.720
to remember those days.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.720
When

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.720
dog tripping.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720
Yeah, dog tripping.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720
Number nine, of course, is

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.720
oh, sorry, I got addicted fast

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.720
to the audience remembering.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.720
They were like, nope,

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.720
don't remember that one.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.720
Blacked out during that one.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.720
Something's about schools.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.720
The Macarena was number nine.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.720
Rabbit television,

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.720
I think was number seven.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.720
Racist bus driver,

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.720
of course, was number six.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.720
That was like five or six.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.720
Yeah, I think that was five.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.720
It was a baby with a moustache.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Baby with a moustache.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Which we just skipped over.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.720
Nobody wanted to touch that.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.720
We did it.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.720
We did it.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.720
Art Burke School, of course.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.720
Who could forget Art Burke School?

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.720
Bamobile sandwich.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.720
And then, of course,

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720
Bamobile sandwich.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.720
At number two, the penultimate.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.720
Which brings us now to the number one.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.720
To the much-wanted funniest thing.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.720
Number one, the funniest thing.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.720
It's the funniest thing.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.720
Not of the year.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.720
Not of the podcast.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.720
No, no, just empirically, the funniest thing.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.720
Of the human race.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.720
The funniest thing has ever happened.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.720
We all know it. Everybody in the audience knows it.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720
We all know it on stage.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.720
We all know it at the same time.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.720
It's all set.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.720
Three, two, one.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.720
The Fox anime is series Alan Gregory.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.720
It's hard, because the audience isn't Mike,

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.720
so it's hard to really...

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.720
I heard Gregory.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.720
And that's what it was.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.720
It was Gregory.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.720
Wait, look.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.720
It was Gregory.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.720
I heard one person shoot out real fast

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.720
when we were on the one

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.720
of three, two, one.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.720
Which was a good instinct shout out to you.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.720
And then the last thing I heard was

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.720
Gregory.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.720
And so you're

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.720
rewarding the bad instinct of Gregory.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.720
No, I want to applaud both of them.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.720
I think they're both great people,

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.720
because they're trying to make the show fun.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.720
Because they want to have fun.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.720
Yeah, they're heroes.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.720
Gregory, the funniest thing.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.720
Yeah.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.720
And if you don't know why...

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720
Gregory...

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.720
Gregory...

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.720
I mean, yeah,

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.720
if you know him,

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.720
goddamn.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.720
Fuck, that guy won't let up, you know?

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.720
I think Gregory is kind of

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.720
an all-purpose placeholder for jokes.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.720
Like, you know, Gregory walks into a thing.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.720
Sure, sure.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.720
But this is the greatest Gregory joke of all time.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.720
Yeah.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.720
And we don't even need to say it.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.720
We all know the

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.720
joke about Gregory and the barn.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.720
Yes, we do, yes, we do.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.720
It's the number one funny joke.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.720
The old barn Gregory joke.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.720
Oh, yeah.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.720
Yeah.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.720
Oh, Gregory!

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.720
All right, well, you're going to do it?

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.720
No, I'm

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.720
reacting like a British grandma

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.720
hearing that joke for the first time.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.720
Yeah, I...

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.720
Gregory goes,

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.720
he goes to the barn.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.720
He goes to the barn.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.720
And he doesn't have his...

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.720
To the barn or the barn?

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.720
Barn.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.720
He doesn't have a saddle.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.720
He doesn't have a saddle.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.720
He needs a saddle.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.720
It's a Gregory joke, gotcha.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.720
Yeah.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.720
It's the Gregory joke.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.720
The Gregory.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.720
Gregory is kind of like an American Belmont.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.720
Oh, Belmont, yeah.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.720
We have built up an expectation

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.720
that we can never...

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.720
What are you taught? What?

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.720
It's the funniest thing.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.720
Goes door to door,

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.720
looking in the night.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.720
Do you have my saddle?

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.720
Do you have my saddle?

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.720
Comedy comes in three.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.720
He goes to the first house.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.720
I have a saddle, but it's too small.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.720
The first guy is Irish.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.720
The first guy is Irish.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.720
I'd love to give you a saddle.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.720
Right.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.720
But my wee mare

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.720
needs the saddle

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.720
and its back is too skinny.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.720
Right.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.720
And the saddle won't fit

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.720
if I give it to you.

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.720
Okay.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.720
So he goes to the second barn.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.720
It's a Jewish barn.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.720
It's a Jewish barn, but he's from South Africa.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.720
He's a South African Jew.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.720
Right.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.720
South African Jew.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.720
But he's a perfect South African Jew.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.720
Absolutely.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720
And Gregory says,

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.720
Hello.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.720
I'm Gregory.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.720
Do you have my saddle?

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.720
And the South African

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.720
Jewish person says,

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.720
and a perfect...

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.720
Rob, you usually

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.720
do this part.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Well, you normally do it.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.720
Do it in the room.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.720
No, you're always doing it

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.720
in the room on phone calls.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.720
You're always doing it.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.720
The number...

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720
the number one funniest thing.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.720
Where is he?

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.720
He's just...

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.720
took his microphone away.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.720
No, you...

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.720
Yeah, okay.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.720
So the second one's like,

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.720
and they say it in a very,

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.720
very South African way.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.720
Oh, a very colorful way, yes.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.720
With a touch of...

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.720
South.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.720
A little Yiddish in it.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.720
So you get your South African,

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.720
you get your Yiddish white.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.720
If you heard it,

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.720
you'd be like...

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.720
Bing!

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.720
I know where that person's from

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.720
and what religion they worship.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.720
Totally appropriate.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.720
And we all know the joke, so we don't have to go through it.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.720
We don't have to go through it. It's a waste of time.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.720
Right. The idea is that

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.720
Gregory keeps going from house to house.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.720
He's looking for a saddle. Every house he goes to

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.720
is owned by a different nationality.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.720
They have a look at a different reason.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.720
I can't give you a saddle. I've got a saddle.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.720
It's not the right size.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.720
Right? South African Jew is like...

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.720
Well, Rob can do it.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.720
Do it, do it, do it.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.720
Dan, just...

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.720
Give it a try.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.720
Just try yourself.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.720
I'll do Gregory.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.720
Try. It's so easy.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.720
Could you give me a saddle for my horse?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.720
And then South African Jew says...

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.720
Right.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.720
Roy, mate, I don't have it.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.720
Just a South African in it.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.720
Right. There you go.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.720
Yeah, that's it.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.720
I mean, that's kind of the mid-part.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.720
So that's like, you know...

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.720
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.720
So at this point, it's pouring rain.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.720
Right. And he has no saddle.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.720
And he's cold.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.720
Oh, his horse is gonna...

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.720
He's got...

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.720
He goes to the third house.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.720
It's the...

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.720
Oh, God. Well, we all know.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.720
Yeah.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.720
It's the trap house.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.720
It's the...

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.720
It's Adolf Hitler's house.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.720
Adolf Hitler's trap house.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.720
Right.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.720
But he's not there.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.720
But who is...

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.720
No, because he died in 1945 or 46.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.720
So, yeah. But it's still his house.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.720
Right.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.720
And it is inside.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.720
But it's haunted by him.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.720
Because he died with unfinished business.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.720
Yes.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.720
No?

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.720
What?

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.720
Adolf Hitler, yeah, I guess.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.720
It's the funniest thing.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.720
The number one funniest thing.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.720
It's the funniest thing.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720
I don't know if I like the way this joke ended.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.720
The number one funniest thing.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720
We did the top 10 funniest things.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.720
We fucking nailed it.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.720
You know the rest of it.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.720
He ends up getting his saddle, but not the way he wanted it.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.720
It turns out that...

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.720
He's saddled with the most burden.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.720
The European Union is a complicated place.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.720
It's a hornet's nest.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.720
Shit, man.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.720
How's that Brexit going?

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.720
Is the president dead today?

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.720
He had a pain in his heart.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.720
By the time people hear this, maybe.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.720
Yeah.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.720
Fascinating conversations with people who...

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.720
Because I'm like, oh boy, what a test.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.720
The guy's got a pain in his heart.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.720
It's a test of your...

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.720
You're not supposed to be a bad person.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.720
The whole point of not liking a bad person

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.720
is you're not supposed to...

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.720
And I have friends who...

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.720
But they're privately...

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.720
They're like, no, fuck that.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.720
Remember in the Frost Nixon movie

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.720
when the guy in Frost Nixon

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.720
he represented the part of the public?

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.720
It was like, no, fuck this guy.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.720
He's a war criminal.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.720
Get him. Anything less than getting him

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.720
is fucking...

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.720
I feel like you just had nine conversations with yourself.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.720
And we need one conclusion to any of those.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.720
I learned two hours ago

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.720
that the president had chest pains.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.720
I have no...

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.720
I never even thought that I would have any

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.720
reason to parse it.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.720
I heard he has the best chest and the most wonderful...

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.720
It's a perfect chest.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.720
It's a perfect chest.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.720
Well, we were...

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.720
I mean, nobody wants him to...

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.720
I mean, we all want him to...

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.720
Well, I mean, it's complicated.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.720
You want him to die, but also you want him to pay.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.720
Yep.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.720
That's the trick.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.720
I immediately...

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.720
The Wisconsin of me immediately leaps to

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.720
you're being tested. This is how you're tested.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.720
You're not supposed to ever...

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.720
You're not...

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.720
You can't. That's the whole point.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.720
If you ever judged anybody,

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.720
then if they're like,

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.720
ow, my foot, you're supposed to be like, whoa.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.720
Wisconsin, nice.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.720
Which is largely passive-aggressive,

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.720
but you're...

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.720
Everything's a test.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.720
What do you mean?

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.720
I know the reason you're asking me that

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.720
is to find out whether or not I'm a bad person.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.720
Oh, yeah.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.720
That's the whole reason I've been on the show.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.720
Yes.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.720
It finally comes out.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.720
Isn't that the ultimate thing?

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.720
We've never...

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.720
Our generation, and I'm saying our generation,

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.720
in the broadest sense,

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.720
we've never had a Nixon.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.720
Isn't it a crazy thing

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.720
to have a historical president

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.720
and have them be old enough

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.720
that they would go like, ow, my arm hurts.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.720
I'm going to the hospital and for everybody

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.720
to check in for a second and go,

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.720
where do you stand

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.720
in the world of like,

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.720
I'm so

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.720
in favor of goodness

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.720
or things happening to good people

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.720
that are you willing

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.720
to hope that

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.720
ill health befalls

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.720
another human being?

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.720
I love it.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.720
Oh, yeah, I definitely am.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.720
We all definitely are, but...

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.720
I hope he has a UTI.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.720
Well, that's easy because

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.720
that just hurts and doesn't kill you.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.720
I know. It would be horrible.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.720
I guess I'm just like...

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.720
The fear is that

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.720
he will never die.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720
That's always been a fear.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.720
What time is it?

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.720
We're pretty much done.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.720
We're doing pretty good.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.720
We could leave now.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.720
I'm just pitching you guys.

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.720
I'm just trying to come up with ideas.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.720
Wait, let's find...

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.720
Why does he get to just leave?

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.720
We should all do that.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.720
Let's go see what he's doing.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.720
Let's take the mics back there and see what Jeff's doing.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.720
I'm just pitching ideas, you guys.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.720
Let's find someone in the audience

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.720
who, remember the last time I was on it?

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.720
There was a perfect version of me.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.720
There's Pele, the real.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.720
Let's see if there's a perfect version of Rob.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.720
Is Pele here?

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.720
I didn't think so.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.720
Pele is always here because he pays so much attention to the show.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.720
Has he pointed out?

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.720
It was good.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.720
I liked him. Let's talk to him again.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.720
But he's not here. Is there a perfect Rob though?

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.720
Yeah, he's sitting right next to me.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.720
Attractive Bald?

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.720
Any Attractive Balds in the audience?

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.720
Oh, no.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.720
But are you Attractive?

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.720
Let's not throw it to the audience then.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.720
I'm getting mixed signals from that.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.720
What are you drinking, Dan?

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.720
Who's come the farthest?

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.720
Who has the hardest drugs?

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.720
We got an Australia.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.720
DC.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.720
Milwaukee.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.720
The Carolinas.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.720
Detroit.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.720
The Farthest.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.720
Glendale, California.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.720
Okay, Australia, you want to come up?

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.720
Yeah.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.720
We'll just check in with you.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.720
That's...

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.720
Yeah, let's give a round of applause for Australia.

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.720
Have a seat on the pube chair.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.720
Have a seat.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.720
Have a seat.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.720
Oh, there's a mic.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720
This is a dream come true.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.720
Nick Rutherford, it's so good to meet you.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.720
And we didn't...

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.720
We asked you to come up.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.720
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.720
I met you yesterday at Dull Swim Fest.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.720
Shut the fuck up.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.720
Yeah, the dream club's amazing.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.720
Harrison.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.720
Oh, yeah, Harrison.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.720
Wait, Dan, I'll take it from here.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.720
Tell him again.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.720
Dan, what question did you have?

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.720
No, don't...

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.720
He won't respect you if you respect him.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.720
Okay, cool.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.720
That's what we've learnt over like seven years.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.720
I feel like that's the general consensus.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.720
I've known him like seven months and I figured it out.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.720
Yeah, I get it.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.720
Hey, Dan, can you hold up?

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.720
Everyone's just fucking...

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.720
It must be nice, man.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.720
Yeah, it is.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.720
Jeff, how you been?

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.720
I'm just trying to be friendly. It's real hard.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.720
It's hard to be friendly?

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.720
Spencer, I forgot to shake your hand, too.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.720
Go shake your hand.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.720
I can't blame you for that.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.720
How have you been?

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.720
I'm quite good.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.720
This is probably my last pilgrimage to Harmontown,

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720
so it's quite nice to...

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.720
Is something happening?

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.720
Australia, I'm from Sydney.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.720
Sydney.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.720
So you've come out before?

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.720
Yeah, this is my sixth time.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.720
So I've come out every year since 2014.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.720
Would you say that tonight's dinkum is fair?

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.720
It's very fair dinkum, mate.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.720
And I wish someone had a hat on.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.720
You would like that.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.720
Oh, like...

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.720
Like...

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.720
Just so you know.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.720
It's fun to pan to sometimes.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.720
But like...

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.720
Okay, so confirm or deny.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.720
Yes, yeah.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.720
In your continent,

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.720
there are spiders so big

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.720
they can eat birds.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.720
Yes, that's true.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.720
And they live under your house.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.720
But they have very tiny birds in Australia.

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.720
We literally call them minor birds,

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.720
because they're so small.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.720
I made it up, but I guess I was right.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.720
So it's a victim-blaming culture there.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.720
The spiders are so rampant.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.720
It's like, well, that bird deserved it.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.720
Minor birds.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.720
Look how small it was.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.720
I found over the years, if I go into the facts,

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.720
the real facts of like, oh yeah, this bloody happens

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.720
because of this. It's not funny, but I'm just going to agree.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.720
Yeah, no, it does.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.720
It's a consistent problem.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.720
It's a continent full of poison spiders.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.720
It's only some of them are poisonous.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.720
I think that's what Spencer was about to say.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.720
Isn't it true that there's a plant

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.720
that gives you chlamydia?

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.720
What?

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.720
Nobody's going to buy that, man.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.720
Again, I have the truth,

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.720
but it's like, yes, yes, that is the case.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.720
It's just because most of our koalas

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.720
have chlamydia. I mean, that's a fact.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.720
Yeah, because koalas are always

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.720
just fucking, they're STD riddled.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.720
They're just going for it,

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.720
and they just basically like...

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.720
It's true that Spencer fucked a koala once.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.720
That's...

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.720
The truth is that

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.720
Spencer just loves gum leaves.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.720
That's why he's so sweet all the time.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.720
Oh, I'm so sweet.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.720
Koalas are endangered, right?

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.720
Yes, mainly because a good chunk

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.720
of our country is on fire right now.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.720
But also because koalas don't like to fuck.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.720
Again, not funny.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.720
And that's the 10th funniest thing about Australia.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.720
Now give us the ninth.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.720
All right.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.720
What's the 11th funniest thing?

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.720
Number nine. We've had five prime ministers

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.720
in ten years.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.720
Eight.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.720
That's not a knife. This is a knife.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.720
Seven.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.720
Seven is our great barrier reef used

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.720
to be real colorful. Now it's white.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.720
That's hilarious.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.720
Not funny.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.720
You know how, like, the toilets go

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.720
this way up here? Comedy down there goes

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:46.720
the other way.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.720
Comedy goes the other way.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.720
That's not fair to him.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.720
That's very funny, but it's not fair to him.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.720
But it is fair to him, though.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.720
That is not fair to him.

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.720
That is unfair to him.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.720
That's true.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.720
Why is it dinkum?

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.720
It's a weird colloquialism

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.720
we have that just means, yes,

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.720
that is good.

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.720
We just make up words all the time

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.720
because we think we're smart, but we're not.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.720
Did you know that all words are made up?

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.720
God, I love you so much, Smith.

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.720
It's crazy.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.720
It's crazy to think about that.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.720
Yeah.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.720
I feel like when we were down there,

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.720
it was like somebody pointed at it.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.720
Someone just made it all up.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.720
It had to do with Chinese immigrants

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.720
or something in a way that if you wanted

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.720
to unravel it, it's offensive.

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.720
Which I only point out

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.720
that there's every other phrase

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.720
you can use in America,

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.720
a cup of Joe,

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.720
give me some jimmies on my ice cream.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.720
Uncle Ben,

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.720
every fucking thing that you say

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.720
in America is somehow

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.720
reaches back to immediate racism.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.720
I think fair dinkum is one of them.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.720
I would not be surprised.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.720
I would google it, but there's no Wi-Fi in it.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.720
I'm never going to say it on camera.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.720
Dinkum?

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.720
If it's fair dinkum, there has to be

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.720
the opposite.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.720
Which is unfair dinkum.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.720
Unfair dinkum means

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.720
go fuck yourself.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.720
But we have phrases

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.720
for that, like, I'm not here to fuck spiders.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.720
It was just like...

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.720
You have a phrase for that?

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.720
If you were dead serious...

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.720
Is that the phrase?

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.720
That's just like, if you

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.720
sell something on Facebook Marketplace

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.720
and they're like, you got the bike pump

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.720
and they're just like, yeah, I'm not here to fuck spiders.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.720
Then you exchange money and then you get the bike.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.720
So that means that at some point

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.720
somebody was there to fuck spiders.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.720
It's an important phrase

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.720
because so many people in Australia

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.720
are there to fuck spiders.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.720
I'm not here to fuck spiders.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.720
Meaning, like, let's talk turkey.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.720
Let's fucking get down to brass tacks.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.720
All right.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.720
I love that one. I'm using that all the time.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.720
I'm amazed you guys didn't hear that.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.720
You went through four or five different cities

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.720
and you didn't hear that one.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:04.720
Yeah, no, that's amazing.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.720
Well, they were there to fuck spiders.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.720
They never had to use those words.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.720
That's true.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.720
I was too busy fucking all those spiders.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.720
It's because Americans get off the plane

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.720
and they're going, where are the spiders?

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.720
And I think Australians are like, well, don't...

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.720
Don't fuck them.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.720
Don't upset them.

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.720
But it's weird because a lot of us do have

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.720
an innate arachnophobia.

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.720
Like, I...

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.720
You must be afraid of spiders or you'd be dead.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.720
Back home, I have it.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.720
Every time I've come here, I've been in an Airbnb

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.720
where I've seen a spider. That's just like a thing.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.720
This time, I was staying at the Airbnb

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.720
and a spider crawled out from under the pillow

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.720
the morning after I slept in the bed.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.720
In America?

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.720
No!

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.720
I'm worried I brought them here to fuck them.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.720
I won't accept it.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.720
I would have sucked that spider off so quick.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.720
You're talking about tiny, itty-bitty

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.720
little dime-sized spiders.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.720
Yeah, an American spider that knows its place.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.720
Yes.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.720
Underneath the pillow.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.720
You come from the fucking Vegemite spiders

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.720
that are like

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.720
refrigerator-magnet-sized

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.720
ass, hairy fucking spiders

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.720
that have like an ostrich in their tooth

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.720
and they're like...

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.720
We don't have ostriches, we've got emus.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.720
But anyways...

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.720
I miss you guys.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.720
I loved being down there.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.720
We would love to come back down.

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:26.720
Australia

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.720
has been

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.720
so generous

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.720
to the podcasting culture

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.720
in America.

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.720
It was like a weird British invasion

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.720
but if there was no invasion

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.720
Australia was just like

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.720
oh my god, all of you guys with podcasts

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.720
please come down here.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.720
It's really worth noting.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.720
We're just very lonely.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.720
We're a singular continent

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.720
and we would listen to New Zealand podcasts

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.720
to know that they're way better.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.720
It's like...

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.720
There's a ton of amazing

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.720
Australian podcasts

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.720
because it's like

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.720
I don't know, it's just great

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.720
great sportsmanship.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.720
So many

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.720
fringe American

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.720
podcasters

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.720
have gone on tour down in Australia

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.720
and come back baptized

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.720
feeling confident.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.720
I can't believe how many millions of people

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.720
have gone on tour

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:24.720
and then they...

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.720
Sorry, no you go first.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.720
It speaks to the way that we have

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.720
our culture. We do a lot of stuff

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.720
that's very DIY, very, very punk.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.720
We invented the first feature film

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.720
which is the History of the Killer Gang.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.720
It was the same thing with podcasting.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.720
Once we knew what we needed was

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.720
a mic and a guy named Tim

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.720
with a MacBook Pro, we were like

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.720
let's just do it, let's put all of our audio online.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.720
Also you guys

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.720
have a good fetish with avocado toast.

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.720
Oh yeah, we love it.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.720
Your avocado smash is

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.720
ready to go.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.720
It's great to a point where it is the

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.720
and don't tell anyone over

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:02.720
70 this, it's the antithesis of

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.720
okay boomer.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:06.720
Anytime you want to throw some shit at millennials

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.720
you'd be like, bloody avocado toast mate.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.720
And you're just like, fuck you!

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.720
I just want to eat avocado toast.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.720
They tried that here for a while.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.720
It's stuck with us.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.720
It's like avocado toast tastes good.

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.720
You guys have a big cult.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.720
But if you haven't had an avocado smash

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.720
in fucking Sydney that you haven't had an avocado smash

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.720
you have the little feta crumble.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.720
You guys still do it, he did pretty good.

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.720
We don't got the same toast that you guys got.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.720
It's the secret, it's just damper.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.720
That's all it is.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.720
It's the dampness of the toast.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.720
It's the type of bread, it's called damper.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.720
It's basically the same as sourdough

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:42.720
but it's a bit rougher.

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.720
Where the fuck did Schrab go?

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.720
How is he just like...

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.720
He comes on the show.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.720
I really wanted to thank Schrab for some shit.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.720
I don't like being on the show.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.720
Dude, the show's over.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.720
I want to come on the show.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.720
And then he's just like...

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.720
He just wanders off like my parents on a cruise.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.720
Like where is he?

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.720
Is he taking shuffleboard blessings?

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.720
He just got back from a shuffleboard.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.720
Yeah!

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.720
Oh yeah, look at the swagger.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.720
Welcome back.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.720
Blade returns to Whistler's lair.

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.720
Like what are you...

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.720
Yeah, I got some new weapons for you.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.720
I had to go to the bathroom.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.720
Okay, but...

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.720
Rob, it's good to meet you.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.720
Yeah, meet this guy.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.720
Wait, I have to go to the bathroom too.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.720
Should I not go? No, no, go.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.720
It'll be fucking funny as shit.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.720
Is Paley here?

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.720
Everyone's just pulling their own shit.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.720
Wait, is Paley like a character on the podcast now?

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.720
No.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.720
This show's been about nothing.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.720
This is like the most insane things I've ever been.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.720
Can I just say,

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.720
if Duke Nukem was from Australia,

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.720
he might say,

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.720
I'm here to kick ass and fuck spiders,

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.720
and I'm all out of spiders.

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.720
Because that could be fun.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.720
And I'm all out of spiders. That could be fun.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.720
Wait, that's a real saying.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.720
I'm not here to fuck spiders. I'm not here to fuck spiders, yeah.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.720
Meaning, like I've got bigger fish to fry?

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.720
Yeah, you keep bringing up other idioms to replace it.

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.720
It's quite amusing.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.720
Yeah, but I've got bigger spiders to fuck.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.720
I've got bigger fish to fry means that

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.720
there's other fish you would fry,

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.720
but they're too small.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.720
But I'm not here to fuck spiders.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.720
I've got bigger spiders.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.720
I'm not going to fuck those little spiders.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.720
But also you've got to fry the fish

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.720
before the spiders get out.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.720
I think that saying means

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:30.720
I'm here to fuck larger arachnids.

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.720
Like spiders,

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.720
my dick, if your dick is so small

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.720
that you could fuck a spider,

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.720
I say why live.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.720
And the fifth funniest thing about Australia is

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.720
the fact that we continue to

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720
refer to koalas as drop bears to confuse

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.720
the international community. Drop bears.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.720
Drop bears is a huge problem

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.720
that we have in Australia where

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.720
they will just basically be in most trees,

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.720
most dense like brush,

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.720
and they will drop onto tourists and then just

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.720
wipe them out instantly. They just get killed.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.720
They wipe out the tourists? Yeah, they kill the tourists.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:04.720
Wait, wait, wait, the bears do?

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.720
Now this is the lie that we tell people.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.720
Drop bears.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.720
Don't get underneath the koala because

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.720
they'll drop on you. No, and then you'll get

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.720
chlamydia.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.720
None of it's real. Don't kiss them.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.720
It's the one thing I don't like about you guys.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.720
Liars and cheats.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.720
That's how we ended up.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.720
We were in Australia and I'm like, you guys,

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.720
a lot of spiders.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.720
And the guy in the front row is like,

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.720
30% of all spiders are poisonous

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.720
in it.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.720
Why would your continent

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.720
have that statistic at the ready?

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.720
I think it was

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.720
Melbourne Spencer. We landed there and it was

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.720
Melbourne Jeff. Yeah, it was roasting out.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.720
It was really hot. It was a hot day.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.720
I'm sure I said this before,

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.720
but we're all in a van.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.720
It was the first time Spencer had been to

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.720
Australia.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.720
And

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.720
Spencer goes, hot Canada.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.720
Oh, that's so accurate.

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.720
And that's number.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.720
That's number four.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.720
So one of the funniest thing

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.720
about Australia now

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:10.720
the third funniest thing is just

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.720
Eric Benner Eric.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.720
Now we're on to the second funniest thing about

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.720
Australia. Colleen Henson.

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.720
Yeah, I was I was going to lean to

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.720
we've got like at least four or five Australians

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.720
in the audience. So I feel bad being up here.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.720
Yeah, thank you. Yeah.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.720
Now it's all right to bully me.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.720
It would have been worse if anyone else

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.720
got Australian in the audience.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.720
We did a show at the Underground

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.720
Theatre at the Sydney Opera House.

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.720
Yes, we did a couple shows there.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.720
And

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.720
some woman just stormed the stage and

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.720
like, were you there?

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.720
It was about one minute or something.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.720
Yes, they were here. She was,

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.720
she came here.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.720
It like draws forth a revenge like

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.720
she followed us.

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.720
She just comes up and she's like smile, you son of a bitch.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.720
She came here. Remember,

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.720
she was here. She came

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.720
down the aisle.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.720
But the crowd

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.720
Oh, what was

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.720
it wasn't Melbourne. What was the other one?

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.720
What was the really? Brisbane.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.720
Brisbane and the Quonset hut thing.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.720
Like an old like

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:14.720
aircraft hangar. Yeah.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.720
And we did a show there. The crowd started

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.720
heckling each other.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.720
Yeah, we do that. People got into

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.720
like just like interstitial fights

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.720
like amongst each other.

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.720
The show came to a grinding halt

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.720
while the crowd fucking sorted

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.720
out their own like, like their own

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.720
battles. I guarantee you those people became

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:34.720
friends the minute the show was done. I was like, you're

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.720
a cunt. I'm like, yeah, well,

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.720
he's a beer. That's it.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.720
So we in Melbourne,

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.720
there was a big ass theater we played at and

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.720
then we went to a bar afterwards and

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.720
someone said, hey, that dude that was shouting

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.720
back to back to back to money.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.720
And he's yelling at gibberish.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.720
That dude had apparently had like

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.720
eight or nine drinks before

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.720
the show and puked in his shoe.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.720
And we saw that shoe.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.720
He went

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.720
outside and emptied the puke out of his shoe

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.720
and got his ass kicked.

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:06.720
Because like, like, what are you doing emptying

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.720
out your pukey shoe on the fucking

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.720
pavement and he got his ass kicked.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.720
Why would he kick his ass

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:14.720
after he took all that

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.720
effort

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.720
to contain everything bad about him?

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.720
It's Chinatown, Jake.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.720
They're fucking Melbourne, baby.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.720
Then he may as well puke on the theater floor.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.720
That's the lesson he learned.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.720
He kept yelling, mom, mom, mom, mom.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.720
Oh, God.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:32.720
And then apparently someone said like,

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.720
I saw him drink 10, like, tall

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.720
beers. I remember that. Yeah, he puked

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.720
in the shoe.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.720
I like the fucking elegance of just saying

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.720
I'm not going to puke on the ground. I want to puke

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.720
in my own footwear and then walk

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720
it down to the restroom.

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.720
He rinsed out his shoe

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.720
and then I think he poured it out on the sidewalk.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.720
Yeah, this fucking

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.720
Australia's great. I liked it, yeah.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.720
It's a little, it's a little different down there

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.720
other than here in the

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.720
up over.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.720
Is that number two?

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.720
We will cut that out. Okay, sure.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.720
I was going to say, number two.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.720
Number two is Shoeys, where you drink from your shoe.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.720
Oh, no. And that's probably

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.720
what was happening to that man. That's where he got the idea.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.720
Yeah, yeah. Also, what's

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:16.720
in the fucking Brisbane West Coast Massive?

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.720
Yeah, what's that about?

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.720
It's basically just a part in the West Coast where it's very large.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:22.720
Why is it massive? I just there.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.720
This is a big part of it.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.720
Number one and number

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.720
one is Clive Palmer.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:30.720
He's a terrible politician

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.720
and also billionaire magnate.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.720
Yay, we love those

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.720
yeah.

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:38.720
A rich politician. Nice try Australia.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.720
We don't have them up here.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.720
He tried to he tried to ruin the election

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.720
by basically having as many seats

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.720
as possible and the most

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.720
like inconsiderate candidates

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.720
as possible.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.720
And it worked. It worked.

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.720
So you guys are Nazi now?

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.720
Yes. Yeah, yeah. It's not good.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.720
So it's just happening all over the planet.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.720
Everyone's just going Nazi.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.720
It's very sad.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:04.720
And there's no...

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.720
And everyone's increasingly in your friend groups.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.720
Do you have friends that are like,

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.720
I heard the fucking Proud Boys

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:12.720
had a fucking party at the

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.720
Baskin Robbins like fuck that place.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.720
I don't want

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.720
31 flavors or anything.

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.720
Do you have friends that are increasingly going like

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.720
well, I don't know when it's a fucking cancel culture

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.720
bullshit. I do.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.720
What the fuck is this conversation?

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.720
I just don't like Nazis. What the fuck?

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.720
When did this happen? Yeah, yeah.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.720
We've got like a lot of people who like that.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.720
There's a friend of mine. He has like a

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.720
it's like a like a Facebook team name him

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.720
and give his number out.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.720
Yeah, cancel him.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.720
Same exact thing.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.720
He's got a thing called yelling at racist dogs

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:46.720
where he will go to like places that are having

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.720
like pro-fascist like rallies and shit

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.720
and he'll just go and yell at them

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.720
and it's very popular and I love it.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.720
The dogs or the humans? Oh, they're humans.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.720
They just act like a bunch of fucking dogs.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.720
I think Cody got me too high.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.720
I think Cody got me too high.

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:04.720
Are you okay?

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.720
What did you have?

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.720
How do you know?

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.720
Nobody threw up any drugs for Rob to do.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.720
So if they even got any uppers, toss them up.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.720
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.720
Uh-oh. Rob.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.720
Zach, you got a beat?

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.720
Rob, stop. Rob.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.720
Rob.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.720
Rob.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.720
Rob.

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.720
Rob.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:36.720
Too high.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:38.720
Rob.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.720
Rob.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:42.720
Rob.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.720
Rob.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.720
Rob.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.720
Rob.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.720
Rob.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.720
You're 50 years old.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.720
Rob.

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.720
Don't you think it's time to grow up?

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.720
Rob.

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:00.720
Rob.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.720
Pay your mortgage.

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.720
Take care of Kate before she disengages.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.720
Take care of Kate before she disengages.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.720
Everyone dies eventually.

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.720
Everyone dies eventually.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.720
Rob Schrab you with me.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.720
Rob Schrab you with me.

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.720
I'm the Kim Reaper.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.720
Rob Schrab.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.720
You shouldn't have got high.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.720
Rob Schrab.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.720
Rob Schrab.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.720
You're too high.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:28.720
Rob Schrab.

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:30.720
There's no sky.

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.720
There's only underground.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.720
Rob everyone turns and turns.

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.720
Just for the only truth you know.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.720
I'm the devil.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.720
The devil's here to save.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.720
The devil's always gonna take your fucking soul away.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.720
I wait down here underneath the underground.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.720
Oh look.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:52.720
Look at what I found.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.720
Rob Schrab.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.720
What have you ever done?

01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.720
This is the kind of shit.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.720
I have fallen with.

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.720
You're my easel.

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:04.720
Time for art class.

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.720
It's time to suck down the life force through your ass.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.720
Down everything.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.720
Damn.

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.720
Shit.

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:18.720
Rob Schrab.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.720
You shouldn't have got too high.

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.720
Oh shit.

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.720
Rob.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.720
Why you get so high?

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.720
It don't matter.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.720
It don't matter.

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.720
I feel like you could peel the glasses off of him and he wouldn't know this.

No matter how free you, but you could live a life of crippled limbs, but you're gonna fuck your mama in a piece of fudge.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.720
A fudge, you're gonna fuck your mama in a piece of fudge.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:11.720

You got too high.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.720
Don't give me that look.

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720
You got too high.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.720

It's a good show.
