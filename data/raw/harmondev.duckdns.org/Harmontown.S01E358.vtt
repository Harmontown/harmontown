now.\n\n02:18.680 --> 02:23.680\nWe would have thought that we would have figured out seating before three shows left.\n\n02:23.680 --> 02:27.680\nYeah, my local choir is going to be coming in and we're going to...\n\n02:27.680 --> 02:30.680\nI'm glad someone cares about stage picture.\n\n02:30.680 --> 02:35.680\nThere was one thing that I wanted to share because we do sit up here and we go like,\n\n02:35.680 --> 02:38.680\noh, I heard this, I heard that, and I didn't understand it or whatever.\n\n02:38.680 --> 02:43.680\nOne of the guy, the guy that hosted my panel at the Norwegian Film Festival, he sent me\n\n02:43.680 --> 02:48.680\na message about getting to the bottom of this whole poop van too thing.\n\n02:48.680 --> 02:55.680\nAnd if I go to my Instagram, he said, poop van too equals Port Vien too.\n\n02:55.680 --> 02:57.680\nPort Road number two.\n\n02:57.680 --> 03:05.680\nNorwegian kids TV show from the 80s about two adults living together with a fucked up giraffe.\n\n03:05.680 --> 03:07.680\nPort Vien too.\n\n03:07.680 --> 03:10.680\nWe heard it as poop Vien too.\n\n03:10.680 --> 03:11.680\nNope.\n\n03:11.680 --> 03:12.680\nNo sex thing.\n\n03:12.680 --> 03:13.680\nIt wasn't something weird.\n\n03:13.680 --> 03:17.680\nIt was about two grownups and a giraffe for kids.\n\n03:17.680 --> 03:19.680\nHow was your trip, Dan?\n\n03:19.680 --> 03:20.680\nYou enjoyed?\n\n03:20.680 --> 03:21.680\nLoved it.\n\n03:21.680 --> 03:22.680\nLoved it.\n\n03:22.680 --> 03:24.680\nLoved you, Norway.\n\n03:24.680 --> 03:28.680\nProps to holding the line against Sweden.\n\n03:28.680 --> 03:37.680\nI didn't know those people were ever fighting, but the town we were in, it was 10 miles moved\n\n03:37.680 --> 03:42.680\nin one direction because the old town got burnt down by the Swedes during their fucking\n\n03:42.680 --> 03:45.680\nbitter struggle against the Swedes.\n\n03:45.680 --> 03:49.680\nYou talk to a Norwegian and they're like, they tolerate the Swedes.\n\n03:49.680 --> 03:51.680\nAnd vice versa.\n\n03:51.680 --> 03:56.680\nIt's centuries old, older than our country is at all.\n\n03:56.680 --> 03:58.680\nWe don't have any opinion about the English.\n\n03:58.680 --> 04:04.680\nSo how old does that make our country that you think in Europe, it's even older.\n\n04:04.680 --> 04:06.680\nThanks, Dan.\n\n04:06.680 --> 04:08.680\nDon't we have a Swede in the house tonight?\n\n04:08.680 --> 04:10.680\nWe have Sofia, right?\n\n04:10.680 --> 04:11.680\nYeah.\n\n04:11.680 --> 04:14.680\nShe burned down that town.\n\n04:14.680 --> 04:18.680\nI only have a handful of things to talk about.\n\n04:18.680 --> 04:20.680\nI think that was one of them.\n\n04:20.680 --> 04:22.680\nAnother one is that it's church's birthday.\n\n04:22.680 --> 04:24.680\nChurch's birthday.\n\n04:24.680 --> 04:26.680\nGet up here, church.\n\n04:26.680 --> 04:28.680\nStand up.\n\n04:28.680 --> 04:35.680\nHappy church day to you,

05:10.680\nJoin us, church.\n\n05:10.680 --> 05:15.680\nOne of the 17 chairs.\n\n05:15.680 --> 05:19.680\nShe's finding a slow way up.\n\n05:19.680 --> 05:20.680\nIt's dark.\n\n05:20.680 --> 05:21.680\nHappy birthday to church, everybody.\n\n05:21.680 --> 05:23.680\nHappy birthday.\n\n05:23.680 --> 05:25.680\nHappy birthday to church.\n\n05:25.680 --> 05:27.680\nTake your pick.\n\n05:27.680 --> 05:29.680\nTake your pick.\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:33.680\nWe thought Steve was just doing a weird joke, but really.\n\n05:33.680 --> 05:38.680\nNo, we are going to have a choir.\n\n05:38.680 --> 05:41.680\nAll those photos you've been seeing for how long, church,\n\n05:41.680 --> 05:44.680\nhave you been taking those photos to put on our Instagram account?\n\n05:44.680 --> 05:47.680\nThree years.\n\n05:47.680 --> 05:49.680\nJesus Christ.\n\n05:49.680 --> 05:51.680\nThis is why a show has to be quit.\n\n05:51.680 --> 05:55.680\nBecause before you know it, you're lost in cement.\n\n05:55.680 --> 05:59.680\nWe have to keep fresh or else we die.\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:02.680\nI was fresh changing venues three times.\n\n06:02.680 --> 06:04.680\nYeah.\n\n06:04.680 --> 06:07.680\nThat was my favorite part.\n\n06:07.680 --> 06:09.680\nRemember that one guy who was like,\n\n06:09.680 --> 06:11.680\noh, you're changing venues?\n\n06:11.680 --> 06:13.680\nNow you count down to your podcast ending.\n\n06:13.680 --> 06:15.680\nAnd we were like, fuck you, poser.\n\n06:15.680 --> 06:16.680\nFour shadowing.\n\n06:16.680 --> 06:19.680\nHe was right.\n\n06:19.680 --> 06:23.680\nThere's no way that he's around to feel joy.\n\n06:23.680 --> 06:25.680\nIf he is around, he's a hypocrite.\n\n06:25.680 --> 06:28.680\nBecause he was like, your podcast is good to end.\n\n06:28.680 --> 06:31.680\nAnd then he hung around for three years.\n\n06:31.680 --> 06:32.680\nSo if you're listening.\n\n06:32.680 --> 06:34.680\nThat was after Meltdown.\n\n06:34.680 --> 06:35.680\nYeah.\n\n06:35.680 --> 06:37.680\nThe only thing I wanted to talk about,\n\n06:37.680 --> 06:44.680\nI guess I was going to say before I bring our only guest out.\n\n06:44.680 --> 06:46.680\nAnd I put guest in quotes.\n\n06:46.680 --> 06:48.680\nBecause honestly, what is a guest?\n\n06:48.680 --> 06:50.680\nProbably like multiple sets of quotes.\n\n06:50.680 --> 06:51.680\nYeah.\n\n06:51.680 --> 06:58.680\nBut I wanted to talk about the Pizookie at BJ's.\n\n06:58.680 --> 07:00.680\nYeah.\n\n07:00.680 --> 07:01.680\nIt's supposed to be.\n\n07:01.680 --> 07:02.680\nI don't know what.\n\n07:02.680 --> 07:04.680\nThe idea is that it's a pizza cookie.\n\n07:04.680 --> 07:05.680\nPizza.\n\n07:05.680 --> 07:06.680\nPizza.\n\n07:06.680 --> 07:07.680\nPizza.\n\n07:07.680 --> 07:08.680\nPizza.\n\n07:08.680 --> 07:11.680\nWhy don't we bring out former BJ's employee and semi guest,\n\n07:11.680 --> 07:12.680\nNick Rutherford?\n\n07:12.680 --> 07:14.680\nOh, shit.\n\n07:14.680 --> 07:20.680\nAll your best friends are all your enemies.\n\n07:20.680 --> 07:25.680\nBut I come down for good person.\n\n07:25.680 --> 07:29.680\nBrought his own chair.\n\n07:29.680 --> 07:31.680\nUp your trap.\n\n07:31.680 --> 07:36.680\nAnd let's bring out our real guest political analyst,\n\n07:36.680 --> 07:37.680\nKaleigh.\n\n07:37.680 --> 07:42.680\nThe one we wanted to be here.\n\n07:42.680 --> 07:53.680\nWe get a bigger chair for Kaleigh, man.\n\n07:53.680 --> 07:54.680\nWho is that?\n\n07:54.680 --> 07:56.680\nI was singing that song that was the play on music.\n\n07:56.680 --> 07:58.680\nThat's Kali Fontecchio, everybody.\n\n07:58.680 --> 07:59.680\nKali, what?\n\n07:59.680 --> 08:00.680\nKali right here.\n\n08:00.680 --> 08:01.680\nHello, Kali.\n\n08:01.680 --> 08:04.680\nKali, what's the song called?\n\n08:04.680 --> 08:05.680\nWow.\n\n08:05.680 --> 08:09.680\nTake a Dive by Kali Kazoo.\n\n08:09.680 --> 08:10.680\nSing it.\n\n08:10.680 --> 08:11.680\nWow.\n\n08:11.680 --> 08:15.680\nSchrab, you didn't like it backstage when we found out it was\n\n08:15.680 --> 08:18.680\nchurch's birthday and we all sang happy church day to her.\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:20.680\nYou didn't like it because you don't like, you just had a\n\n08:20.680 --> 08:21.680\nbirthday.\n\n08:21.680 --> 08:23.680\nYou don't like it when people sing happy birthday to you.\n\n08:23.680 --> 08:24.680\nNo.\n\n08:24.680 --> 08:26.680\nYou don't like it when people sing happy birthday to someone\n\n08:26.680 --> 08:27.680\nelse in front of you.\n\n08:27.680 --> 08:31.680\nNo.\n\n08:31.680 --> 08:33.680\nYou just don't like the happy birthday song.\n\n08:33.680 --> 08:34.680\nYes.\n\n08:34.680 --> 08:35.680\nYou're just a villain.\n\n08:35.680 --> 08:37.680\nYou're just a terrible villain.\n\n08:37.680 --> 08:38.680\nNo.\n\n08:38.680 --> 08:39.680\nNo.\n\n08:39.680 --> 08:40.680\nOkay, okay.\n\n08:40.680 --> 08:43.680\nHappy birthday to you.\n\n08:43.680 --> 08:44.680\nHappy birthday, by the way.\n\n08:44.680 --> 08:45.680\nI don't like it.\n\n08:45.680 --> 08:48.680\nHappy birthday to you.\n\n08:48.680 --> 08:50.680\nHappy birthday to you.\n\n08:50.680 --> 09:02.900\nHappy Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab,...\n\n09:02.900 --> 09:05.140\nSo you just don't like it?\n\n09:05.140 --> 09:05.600\nNo.\n\n09:05.600 --> 09:06.500\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n09:06.500 --> 09:09.180\nHow's God to like?\n\n09:09.180 --> 09:11.780\nNobody likes singing it, no one likes hearing it.\n\n09:11.780 --> 09:13.620\nYeah, we all hate it.\n\n09:13.620 --> 09:17.940\nA happy birthday to you.\n\n09:17.940 --> 09:19.980\nOkay, well now I prove you right.\n\n09:19.980 --> 09:23.180\nWait, wait, I'm the, I'm, wait, I'm the guest.\n\n09:23.180 --> 09:24.020\nAll right.\n\n09:26.180 --> 09:27.520\nRemember I brought that chair up?\n\n09:27.520 --> 09:31.520\nHappy birthday to guest.\n\n09:31.520 --> 09:34.500\nAll right, you worked at BJ's.\n\n09:34.500 --> 09:36.060\nLet's talk about the Pizookie.\n\n09:36.060 --> 09:37.380\nThe Pizookie.\n\n09:37.380 --> 09:39.060\nIt's a pizza cookie.\n\n09:39.060 --> 09:39.900\nRight.\n\n09:39.900 --> 09:43.300\nThe word pizza and the word cookie combined\n\n09:44.460 --> 09:46.100\ninto the word Pizookie.\n\n09:46.100 --> 09:47.220\nPizookie.\n\n09:47.220 --> 09:48.060\nPizookie.\n\n09:48.060 --> 09:48.900\nPizookie.\n\n09:48.900 --> 09:50.220\nPizookie.\n\n09:50.220 --> 09:52.460\nWhat is the, what is the question?\n\n09:52.460 --> 09:53.300\nPizookie.\n\n09:53.300 --> 09:55.620\nIt doesn't, I know I'm not buying it.\n\n09:55.620 --> 09:57.140\nI don't like it either.\n\n09:57.140 --> 10:00.660\nAnd also as you said in the lift.\n\n10:00.660 --> 10:04.700\nWell it's a, there's no difference between a pizza\n\n10:04.700 --> 10:06.900\nand a cookie, they're the same shape\n\n10:06.900 --> 10:08.300\nand they're cooked in the same oven.\n\n10:08.300 --> 10:11.520\nAnd pizzas don't have ice cream on them either.\n\n10:12.620 --> 10:15.100\nSo you should have kept that bit in the lift\n\n10:15.100 --> 10:16.220\nfor just you and I.\n\n10:16.220 --> 10:18.540\nBut I thought it was so insightful.\n\n10:18.540 --> 10:20.460\nIt's like they're all wrong about this.\n\n10:20.460 --> 10:22.500\nIt's not a, they don't have a right to call\n\n10:22.500 --> 10:24.740\nthat a hybrid between a pizza and a cookie\n\n10:24.740 --> 10:26.100\nor to pronounce it that way.\n\n10:26.100 --> 10:28.760\nThere's, it's, they're all off base the entire time.\n\n10:28.760 --> 10:29.600\nIs it delicious?\n\n10:29.600 --> 10:32.020\nYeah, but you gotta, you can't call it a Pizookie.\n\n10:32.020 --> 10:33.860\nI like the salted caramel one.\n\n10:33.860 --> 10:35.660\nYou guys try that one?\n\n10:35.660 --> 10:36.500\nOh boy.\n\n10:36.500 --> 10:38.300\nAnd the monkey bread, that one's not as great.\n\n10:38.300 --> 10:40.340\nIt's not very moist.\n\n10:40.340 --> 10:41.820\nHey, it's me.\n\n10:41.820 --> 10:44.060\nPizza, Pizookie.\n\n10:44.060 --> 10:46.300\nIt's mini Pizookie.\n\n10:46.300 --> 10:51.300\nI love myself and what I'm named.\n\n10:53.940 --> 10:54.780\nSo, there you go.\n\n10:54.780 --> 10:56.660\nI know that someone does.\n\n10:56.660 --> 10:59.580\nYou know what they really call pizza cookies?\n\n10:59.580 --> 11:00.620\nCookie skillets.\n\n11:02.100 --> 11:02.940\nCookie skillets.\n\n11:02.940 --> 11:03.780\nI like that one.\n\n11:03.780 --> 11:04.740\nI like that name.\n\n11:04.740 --> 11:08.020\nIt makes sense because it's a cookie with a skillet.\n\n11:08.020 --> 11:11.620\nSomeone, oh, it was our lift driver who pointed out,\n\n11:11.620 --> 11:15.100\nactually, if you worked backwards from what should be\n\n11:15.100 --> 11:18.580\ncalled a Pizookie, that should be a name for if you,\n\n11:18.580 --> 11:22.420\nwhen you're taking a poop and you pee during the poop.\n\n11:22.420 --> 11:24.220\nBecause it's a piss dookie.\n\n11:24.220 --> 11:25.180\nYeah.\n\n11:25.180 --> 11:26.140\nA Pizookie.\n\n11:26.140 --> 11:26.980\nYeah.\n\n11:26.980 --> 11:27.820\nThat makes sense.\n\n11:27.820 --> 11:28.660\nThat tracks to me.\n\n11:28.660 --> 11:29.500\nI still stand by that.\n\n11:29.500 --> 11:31.060\nThat was when you piss in a Suzuki.\n\n11:32.980 --> 11:37.340\nBut you, yeah, I feel you player.\n\n11:37.340 --> 11:42.340\nBut, I think that's a rarefied audience.\n\n11:42.860 --> 11:46.220\nI don't know if you need a portmanteau.\n\n11:47.740 --> 11:49.460\nFucking dumb.\n\n11:49.460 --> 11:54.100\nDude, I just took the biggest piss on my Suzuki.\n\n11:54.100 --> 11:57.620\nBut versus like, dude, I was taking a shit\n\n11:57.620 --> 11:59.540\nand I peed during it.\n\n11:59.540 --> 12:00.780\nHappens to everyone.\n\n12:00.780 --> 12:03.460\nThat should be just called taking a shit.\n\n12:03.460 --> 12:04.900\nBut you took a Pizookie?\n\n12:04.900 --> 12:05.980\nYeah.\n\n12:05.980 --> 12:07.220\nThat should be called cookie skillets.\n\n12:07.220 --> 12:12.220\nNick, did you make, were you in the kitchen or are you a server?\n\n12:14.340 --> 12:16.260\nDid you make the Pizookie?\n\n12:16.260 --> 12:18.340\nNo, I was a server.\n\n12:18.340 --> 12:23.300\nI opened up the Westlake Village BJ's flagship.\n\n12:23.300 --> 12:24.140\nThank you.\n\n12:24.140 --> 12:25.620\nWhoa.\n\n12:25.620 --> 12:26.460\nRestaurant.\n\n12:26.460 --> 12:27.740\nThat was a classic location.\n\n12:27.740 --> 12:29.940\nI used to patronize that one.\n\n12:31.420 --> 12:32.260\nYeah.\n\n12:32.260 --> 12:33.100\nDid you ever see Wayne Gretzky there?\n\n12:33.100 --> 12:33.940\nOh, you were a restaurant.\n\n12:33.940 --> 12:34.780\nI don't think so.\n\n12:36.340 --> 12:37.180\nHe never ate there.\n\n12:37.180 --> 12:38.460\nI just rolled down his window and go like,\n\n12:38.460 --> 12:39.660\nyou're doing great.\n\n12:39.660 --> 12:41.780\nYou know, your name sounds like,\n\n12:41.780 --> 12:44.540\nyou serve a lot of food today.\n\n12:44.540 --> 12:45.380\nIt's okay.\n\n12:45.380 --> 12:46.220\nIt's okay.\n\n12:46.220 --> 12:47.060\nYou just opened.\n\n12:47.060 --> 12:47.900\nYou'll get better.\n\n12:47.900 --> 12:48.740\nYeah.\n\n12:48.740 --> 12:49.860\nI feel attacked right now.\n\n12:49.860 --> 12:50.700\nWait, what?\n\n12:50.700 --> 12:54.300\nNo, that's dumb work play from a bunch of drunk people.\n\n12:55.820 --> 12:58.340\nCan you talk, because we were talking over our Pizookie\n\n12:58.340 --> 13:01.740\nabout your job at the bank.\n\n13:01.740 --> 13:02.580\nOh, yeah.\n\n13:02.580 --> 13:03.860\nI just thought that was kind of entertaining.\n\n13:03.860 --> 13:04.700\nYeah.\n\n13:04.700 --> 13:08.700\nI mean, after I was a server at BJ's,\n\n13:08.700 --> 13:12.580\nI was a temp at Citibank.\n\n13:12.580 --> 13:15.180\nLet me hear my, where are my city peeps at?\n\n13:15.180 --> 13:16.260\nWhoa.\n\n13:19.260 --> 13:20.820\nSomebody hissed.\n\n13:22.020 --> 13:22.860\nChase.\n\n13:22.860 --> 13:24.260\nYeah, Chase.\n\n13:24.260 --> 13:26.260\nYeah, that's a Chase bank.\n\n13:26.260 --> 13:29.140\nAnd I was a temp there when I first lived in New York\n\n13:29.140 --> 13:32.900\nand you can make a lot of money as a temp in New York.\n\n13:32.900 --> 13:36.020\nAnd I just really milked that place dry.\n\n13:36.900 --> 13:39.060\nIt was right before they needed a huge bailout\n\n13:39.060 --> 13:40.020\nfrom the government.\n\n13:41.220 --> 13:42.460\nAnd you would go to work\n\n13:42.460 --> 13:45.540\nand then you would sleep on your desk for two hours.\n\n13:45.540 --> 13:47.420\nAnd then during lunch,\n\n13:47.420 --> 13:49.860\nyou would go to the park and sleep on newspapers.\n\n13:49.860 --> 13:51.260\nDo you want to tell the story?\n\n13:51.260 --> 13:53.980\nWell, I kind of hating the highlights\n\n13:53.980 --> 13:56.300\nbecause I think it's such a funny image of like a kid\n\n13:56.300 --> 13:58.140\nin the play, playing the system.\n\n13:58.140 --> 13:59.980\nBecause like you were sleeping on newspapers\n\n13:59.980 --> 14:01.740\nand then you'd come back to the office\n\n14:01.740 --> 14:03.020\nand type on a spreadsheet.\n\n14:03.020 --> 14:05.340\nAnd then they'd go, boy, look at this kid.\n\n14:06.380 --> 14:08.340\nYeah, no, I mean, you hit all the highlights.\n\n14:08.340 --> 14:10.780\nYeah, I mean, yeah, you don't have to waste any time.\n\n14:10.780 --> 14:11.620\nNo.\n\n14:11.620 --> 14:12.900\nWhat's it like being 50, bro?\n\n14:15.500 --> 14:17.980\nIt's not like half the age of a tortoise.\n\n14:17.980 --> 14:18.820\nWhat?\n\n14:19.820 --> 14:20.660\nWhat do you say?\n\n14:20.660 --> 14:21.900\nWhat's it like being 50?\n\n14:21.900 --> 14:23.340\nHow's it, what's it, what's it like?\n\n14:23.340 --> 14:24.660\nI feel so good.\n\n14:25.620 --> 14:28.620\nJeff, what was it like wherever you were?\n\n14:28.620 --> 14:32.900\nI was in Alaska, it was fucking cold.\n\n14:32.900 --> 14:34.700\nThe show me saked, saked.\n\n14:35.980 --> 14:40.100\nIt's the show me that you're freezing to death state.\n\n14:40.100 --> 14:41.260\nIt's fucking cold.\n\n14:41.260 --> 14:43.180\nHey, did you go to the blackbuster?\n\n14:45.700 --> 14:47.060\nAlaska.\n\n14:48.540 --> 14:49.580\nOh, I thought you were.\n\n14:53.060 --> 14:55.460\nI didn't, I thought you were teeing up like a word play.\n\n14:55.460 --> 14:56.300\nI don't know.\n\n14:56.300 --> 14:58.220\nWhat's up, what's up?\n\n14:58.220 --> 15:01.100\nHey, Dan, he's 50.\n\n15:01.100 --> 15:02.740\nWhat the fuck was that?\n\n15:02.740 --> 15:04.780\nI feel like I am, I don't know what's good.\n\n15:04.780 --> 15:08.100\nAll right, was it day or night there?\n\n15:08.100 --> 15:09.580\nIt was mostly night.\n\n15:10.900 --> 15:15.900\nThe sun came up at 9.44, and then it came down at 9.46.\n\n15:17.580 --> 15:20.020\nThe sun kind of just introduced itself\n\n15:20.020 --> 15:23.220\nover the horizon and said, I'm lazy.\n\n15:23.220 --> 15:25.860\nI feel like I would like that, but am I wrong?\n\n15:25.860 --> 15:28.100\nNo, you're wrong because you wake up in the morning\n\n15:28.100 --> 15:31.660\nand you're like, it's 8.45 a.m.\n\n15:31.660 --> 15:33.500\nand it's pitch black outside.\n\n15:33.500 --> 15:34.980\nYou want some feedback.\n\n15:34.980 --> 15:37.540\nYou want to know that you're alive.\n\n15:37.540 --> 15:39.260\nYou want a straight line.\n\n15:39.260 --> 15:43.780\nLike people were like, oh, I don't like the day.\n\n15:43.780 --> 15:45.900\nThat's neurotypical shit.\n\n15:45.900 --> 15:49.020\nBut you want it there so that you can play off of it.\n\n15:49.020 --> 15:49.860\nYeah.\n\n15:49.860 --> 15:51.860\nYou want to be like, ugh, the sun, fuck you.\n\n15:51.860 --> 15:56.860\nIn the summer, the sun never sets, it's daylight all the time.\n\n15:57.180 --> 16:00.500\nBut when you get into the fall, winter time, spring,\n\n16:00.500 --> 16:03.020\nit's just dusk at all times.\n\n16:03.020 --> 16:06.460\nIt feels like in both cases, to me it sounds romantic,\n\n16:06.460 --> 16:07.900\nlike I would want to experience it,\n\n16:07.900 --> 16:11.460\nbut I'm assuming that it would be awful.\n\n16:11.460 --> 16:14.260\nWhen you wake up at like, it's 8.30 a.m.\n\n16:14.260 --> 16:16.980\nand it's black outside, like it's totally nighttime,\n\n16:16.980 --> 16:20.700\nyou're like, okay, I want breakfast, but not in the dark.\n\n16:20.700 --> 16:25.700\nAnd you don't have any indication about any, even to defy it,\n\n16:26.020 --> 16:28.180\nlike some definition of whether you're a loser\n\n16:28.180 --> 16:30.260\nor a winner or punk rock or.\n\n16:30.260 --> 16:33.340\nLike electricity, they have lights.\n\n16:33.340 --> 16:35.900\nBut that doesn't feel the same.\n\n16:35.900 --> 16:36.740\nThat's right.\n\n16:36.740 --> 16:37.580\nYou can turn the lights on.\n\n16:37.580 --> 16:38.420\nThere's electricity all the time,\n\n16:38.420 --> 16:40.500\nbut your hotel room can turn lights on,\n\n16:40.500 --> 16:42.820\nbut it feels like it's still 4 a.m.\n\n16:42.820 --> 16:43.660\nRight.\n\n16:43.660 --> 16:45.020\nIt doesn't feel right.\n\n16:45.020 --> 16:46.500\nI think that would be bad.\n\n16:46.500 --> 16:47.540\nI'm going to go with bad.\n\n16:47.540 --> 16:50.220\nWell, I think Alaska would feel differently\n\n16:50.220 --> 16:51.620\nand we got Alaska here tonight.\n\n16:51.620 --> 16:54.180\nLet's give it up for Alaska.\n\n16:54.180 --> 16:56.100\nWhat?\n\n16:56.100 --> 16:57.500\nOh, shit, we have a guest.\n\n16:57.500 --> 17:00.740\nNick Rutherford, everybody.\n\n17:00.740 --> 17:02.220\nAll right, well, let's get to the show.\n\n17:02.220 --> 17:03.540\nLet's, that's enough warm up.\n\n17:03.540 --> 17:07.020\nYeah, yes, you wanted Alaska to come out.\n\n17:07.020 --> 17:08.380\nYeah.\n\n17:08.380 --> 17:09.220\nI don't know.\n\n17:09.220 --> 17:10.900\nHe's got a pedal that changes voices.\n\n17:10.900 --> 17:11.740\nI don't know.\n\n17:11.740 --> 17:12.740\nYeah, I thought we were going to.\n\n17:12.740 --> 17:15.820\nHey, I'll say this, Rob said, cause it's his birthday.\n\n17:15.820 --> 17:18.020\nHe said, we should ask the audience to throw up\n\n17:18.020 --> 17:19.900\nany drugs they have on the stage.\n\n17:19.900 --> 17:23.260\nAnd he would do any drugs that were thrown up on the stage.\n\n17:23.260 --> 17:23.980\nWhoa.\n\n17:28.620 --> 17:29.120\nAdvil.\n\n17:32.580 --> 17:33.260\nJust shut it out.\n\n17:33.260 --> 17:36.220\nWho's holding class A narcotics in the crowd right now?\n\n17:36.220 --> 17:39.380\nInstead of like going.\n\n17:39.380 --> 17:41.900\nOh, Steve's got drugs.\n\n17:41.900 --> 17:43.860\nThanks, Steve Levy.\n\n17:43.860 --> 17:46.540\nInstead of asking who like came the farthest,\n\n17:46.540 --> 17:48.020\nlike who came from the farthest away,\n\n17:48.020 --> 17:50.900\nwe should ask like who has the hardest drugs on them.\n\n17:50.900 --> 17:53.380\nRight.\n\n17:53.380 --> 17:55.260\nWho here is currently holding ice?\n\n17:55.260 --> 17:56.260\nEvan, Steve, Levy.\n\n17:59.260 --> 18:03.260\nI wanted to, I wanted to go to the random word generator\n\n18:03.260 --> 18:06.540\nthat I discovered today, because you can just\n\n18:06.540 --> 18:09.260\ngenerate two random words.\n\n18:09.260 --> 18:11.100\nBut I forgot there's no internet on the stage.\n\n18:11.100 --> 18:12.780\nWhat the fuck is this shit?\n\n18:12.780 --> 18:14.780\nWhat is this?\n\n18:14.780 --> 18:15.380\nWhat is it?\n\n18:15.380 --> 18:16.260\nIt's a cup.\n\n18:16.260 --> 18:18.180\nYou don't want to know that.\n\n18:18.180 --> 18:20.260\nAll right, it's we got to get to the show.\n\n18:20.260 --> 18:21.460\nYes, services.\n\n18:21.460 --> 18:22.500\nWe got to do it.\n\n18:22.500 --> 18:24.860\nAll right, so what's going around?\n\n18:24.860 --> 18:27.100\nCome on, quit screwing around.\n\n18:27.100 --> 18:28.180\nLet's quit screwing around.\n\n18:28.180 --> 18:28.780\nLet's do it.\n\n18:28.780 --> 18:29.420\nCome on.\n\n18:29.420 --> 18:30.820\nAnd here's the show.\n\n18:30.820 --> 18:32.940\nCome on, let's quit screwing around.\n\n18:32.940 --> 18:33.940\nQuit screwing around.\n\n18:33.940 --> 18:34.980\nQuit screwing around.\n\n18:34.980 --> 18:37.860\nLet's get Alaska up here.\n\n18:37.860 --> 18:40.540\nEverybody, everybody hear that Senator farted today?\n\n18:40.540 --> 18:42.740\nOh, no.\n\n18:42.740 --> 18:44.340\nI didn't hear about that.\n\n18:44.340 --> 18:47.220\nNo, I guess the senator farted.\n\n18:47.220 --> 18:47.700\nMoving on.\n\n18:47.700 --> 18:49.260\nSome people think it's a deep fake.\n\n18:55.260 --> 18:58.500\nDid the president have a heart problem?\n\n18:58.500 --> 19:00.060\nHe went to the doctor.\n\n19:00.060 --> 19:01.820\nAnd then he was like, it's part of my.\n\n19:01.820 --> 19:02.300\nYou can find it.\n\n19:02.300 --> 19:06.860\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.\n\n19:06.860 --> 19:07.860\nYou can't get internet on the stage.\n\n19:07.860 --> 19:10.300\nThat's what he was like.\n\n19:10.300 --> 19:15.420\nThat's not how you get internet, making that noise.\n\n19:15.420 --> 19:17.260\nWhat were you looking at, people?\n\n19:17.260 --> 19:19.300\nWhat didn't you say I can find it?\n\n19:19.300 --> 19:19.900\nWhat?\n\n19:19.900 --> 19:20.620\nWhat did you say?\n\n19:20.620 --> 19:21.500\nNo.\n\n19:21.500 --> 19:22.140\nWhat did you say?\n\n19:22.140 --> 19:23.420\nI forgot, honestly.\n\n19:23.420 --> 19:27.580\nOK, well, can you be accountable to stage time\n\n19:27.580 --> 19:29.260\nand your use of resources?\n\n19:29.260 --> 19:31.700\nLike you're occupying space and time on stage.\n\n19:31.700 --> 19:36.700\nSo when you say things, everyone has to pay attention to you.\n\n19:36.700 --> 19:41.140\nSo you can't just be like, he's free, ah, ah, bah, gah, gah.\n\n19:41.140 --> 19:43.180\nAnd then everyone's like, wait, what did you say?\n\n19:43.180 --> 19:47.260\nYou can do all that, but then you can't be like, I don't know.\n\n19:47.260 --> 19:48.700\nLike that's a crime.\n\n19:48.700 --> 19:51.460\nThat's a crime.\n\n19:51.460 --> 19:53.780\nEverything up until then, it's kind of like, well, none of us\n\n19:53.780 --> 19:54.700\nknew what we were doing.\n\n19:54.700 --> 19:57.780\nBut then when you're just like, don't ask me.\n\n19:57.780 --> 19:59.420\nNo, you're the only one we can ask.\n\n19:59.420 --> 20:01.380\nI don't know what you said.\n\n20:01.380 --> 20:02.580\nLike we're yes-anding you.\n\n20:02.580 --> 20:05.100\nWe're bothering to steer our attention towards you\n\n20:05.100 --> 20:06.660\nand go like, what did you say?\n\n20:06.660 --> 20:09.460\nMaybe that will be the direction the podcast travels in.\n\n20:09.460 --> 20:11.460\nMaybe we can build something on that.\n\n20:11.460 --> 20:12.460\nI'll buy him time.\n\n20:12.460 --> 20:14.460\nAnd then you're like, I don't know.\n\n20:14.460 --> 20:16.460\nSix to one, half a dozen to the other.\n\n20:16.460 --> 20:17.460\nLike, OK, great.\n\n20:17.460 --> 20:18.460\nWe're just going to drift.\n\n20:18.460 --> 20:20.460\nWe're just going to fucking scatter through the cosmos.\n\n20:20.460 --> 20:21.460\nYeah, I like it.\n\n20:21.460 --> 20:23.460\nLike everyone that came here tonight and stood in line\n\n20:23.460 --> 20:26.460\nis just doomed to fucking spin with no center of gravity.\n\n20:26.460 --> 20:27.460\nYeah.\n\n20:27.460 --> 20:29.460\nWe're all just twirling around each other and going like,\n\n20:29.460 --> 20:31.460\nhelp, I'm dying.\n\n20:31.460 --> 20:33.460\nAnd then eventually two hours will be done.\n\n20:33.460 --> 20:35.460\nAnd we'll all go like, good night, folks.\n\n20:35.460 --> 20:37.460\nSome people will be like, good night.\n\n20:37.460 --> 20:38.460\nI came from Australia.\n\n20:38.460 --> 20:39.460\nGood night, everybody.\n\n20:39.460 --> 20:40.460\nAll right.\n\n20:40.460 --> 20:41.460\nGood night to you.\n\n20:41.460 --> 20:42.460\nAll right.\n\n20:42.460 --> 20:43.460\nGood night to you.\n\n20:43.460 --> 20:44.460\nAll right.\n\n20:44.460 --> 20:45.460\nGood night, America.\n\n20:45.460 --> 20:46.460\nI'm Dan Harmon.\n\n20:46.460 --> 20:53.460\nAnd I wish every single one of you a happy, great night.\n\n20:53.460 --> 20:55.460\nDoes it feel good when it happens to you?\n\n20:55.460 --> 20:56.460\nNo.\n\n20:56.460 --> 20:57.460\nDoes it?\n\n20:57.460 --> 20:58.460\nUh-huh.\n\n20:58.460 --> 20:59.460\nBe made fun of.\n\n20:59.460 --> 21:01.460\nDoes it feel good?\n\n21:01.460 --> 21:03.460\nThere's no equivalence there.\n\n21:03.460 --> 21:05.460\nI didn't do that to you.\n\n21:05.460 --> 21:07.460\nI didn't do that to you.\n\n21:07.460 --> 21:09.460\nYou were kind of nasty.\n\n21:09.460 --> 21:13.460\nI admit I put an R in my good night.\n\n21:13.460 --> 21:15.460\nI do cop to that.\n\n21:15.460 --> 21:17.460\nI apologize to it.\n\n21:17.460 --> 21:20.460\nHe admits it.\n\n21:20.460 --> 21:24.460\nYou haven't, you've never acknowledged your offense expressed\n\n21:24.460 --> 21:26.460\nremorse or committed to change.\n\n21:26.460 --> 21:29.460\nThose are the three ingredients of an apology.\n\n21:29.460 --> 21:32.460\nI'm not sorry for what I do, though.\n\n21:32.460 --> 21:36.460\nSo you feel no remorse and you'll never commit to change.\n\n21:36.460 --> 21:38.460\nSo you're the anti-harmon.\n\n21:38.460 --> 21:39.460\nWhoa.\n\n21:39.460 --> 21:41.460\nYou're like, all right.\n\n21:41.460 --> 21:42.460\nWhoa.\n\n21:42.460 --> 21:43.460\nMan.\n\n21:43.460 --> 21:44.460\nAll right.\n\n21:44.460 --> 21:46.460\nI have a new enemy as the audience.\n\n21:46.460 --> 21:48.460\nI don't like their reactions.\n\n21:48.460 --> 21:49.460\nAll right.\n\n21:49.460 --> 21:50.460\nLet's get to the show.\n\n21:50.460 --> 21:52.460\nYeah, let's get to the fucking show.\n\n21:52.460 --> 21:53.460\nLet's go to the show.\n\n21:53.460 --> 21:54.460\nOkay.\n\n21:54.460 --> 21:55.460\nSo here we go.\n\n21:55.460 --> 21:56.460\nYou've all heard.\n\n21:56.460 --> 21:57.460\nHere it comes.\n\n21:57.460 --> 21:59.460\nI guess you've all heard that.\n\n21:59.460 --> 22:01.460\nYeah, put that anywhere.\n\n22:01.460 --> 22:04.460\nI'm going to go to the city hall.\n\n22:04.460 --> 22:05.460\nCapitol Hill.\n\n22:05.460 --> 22:09.460\nThere's been a little bit of an issue going on with dangling\n\n22:09.460 --> 22:12.460\nchads.\n\n22:12.460 --> 22:16.460\nBut I wonder what's happening over at Senator Kirschbaum's\n\n22:16.460 --> 22:17.460\nhouse.\n\n22:17.460 --> 22:24.460\nProbably flatulence.\n\n22:24.460 --> 22:27.460\nHere's a little sketch we did about it.\n\n22:27.460 --> 22:30.460\nHoney, where's my dangling chads?\n\n22:30.460 --> 22:33.460\nRight where you left them, sweetheart.\n\n22:33.460 --> 22:43.460\nBut I asked for an omelet.\n\n22:43.460 --> 22:44.460\nPause.\n\n22:44.460 --> 22:53.460\nNew choice.\n\n22:53.460 --> 22:55.460\nDing dong.\n\n22:55.460 --> 22:59.460\nI'll get it.\n\n22:59.460 --> 23:03.460\nWait, the new choice was the door was over there.\n\n23:03.460 --> 23:07.460\nOh, no, we closed the door.\n\n23:07.460 -->

turning every stove on.\n\n23:22.460 --> 23:26.460\nDon't take, you're combing your hair with everything.\n\n23:26.460 --> 23:29.460\nGod, don't punch the wall.\n\n23:29.460 --> 23:32.460\nOh, no, don't lock me in my own vestibule.\n\n23:32.460 --> 23:34.460\nOh, no.\n\n23:34.460 --> 23:35.460\nNo.\n\n23:35.460 --> 23:38.460\nNew choice.\n\n23:38.460 --> 23:44.460\nNo, that was a sketch about the bipartisan system.\n\n23:44.460 --> 23:45.460\nI got it.\n\n23:45.460 --> 23:46.460\nI get it.\n\n23:46.460 --> 23:50.460\nHey, Dan, Rob, Jeff.\n\n23:50.460 --> 23:52.460\nI don't want to pimp you

can't?\n\n24:07.460 --> 24:08.460\nDo you want to enter music?\n\n24:08.460 --> 24:11.460\nOr do you want to do it alfresco?\n\n24:11.460 --> 24:12.460\nNo, I know.\n\n24:12.460 --> 24:15.460\nI mean, it probably needs to be a little bit of a tee-up.\n\n24:15.460 --> 24:17.460\nI mean, you kids probably don't know.\n\n24:17.460 --> 24:21.460\nSometimes when you go to drive-thru for fast food,\n\n24:21.460 --> 24:28.460\nit's a little difficult to understand the person at the speaker.\n\n24:28.460 --> 24:40.460\nOkay, I like where this is going.\n\n24:40.460 --> 24:50.460\nFor $5 a

32:24.460\nDid we skip seven?\n\n32:24.460 --> 32:29.460\nI would have thought a grape returning a shirt would have been number one, but no.\n\n32:29.460 --> 32:30.460\nThat's not funny.\n\n32:30.460 --> 32:32.460\nIt changes every time.\n\n32:32.460 --> 32:34.460\nAre we at number seven now or number six?\n\n32:34.460 --> 32:36.460\nI think we're at seven.\n\n32:36.460 --> 32:37.460\nNumber seven.\n\n32:37.460 --> 32:39.460\nSeventh funniest thing.\n\n32:39.460 --> 32:42.460\nA lot of people are hissing the word six.\n\n32:42.460 --> 32:45.460\nYeah, the grape returning a shirt was number seven.\n\n32:45.460 --> 32:46.460\nOkay.\n\n32:46.460 --> 32:47.460\nAll right.\n\n32:47.460 --> 32:48.460\nSo we're at six.\n\n32:48.460 --> 32:49.460\nWe're on six.\n\n32:49.460 --> 32:52.460\nI personally didn't think it was that funny.\n\n32:52.460 --> 32:55.460\nI think that's fair.\n\n32:55.460 --> 32:56.460\nWe're at number six.\n\n32:56.460 --> 33:00.460\nNumber six is angry bus driver.\n\n33:00.460 --> 33:06.460\nAnd he's racist.\n\n33:06.460 --> 33:08.460\nI bet he thinks he's not funny at all.\n\n33:08.460 --> 33:10.460\nHe probably thinks he's telling the truth.\n\n33:10.460 --> 33:11.460\nHe's just living life.\n\n33:11.460 --> 33:13.460\nThat's why it's what's funny about it.\n\n33:13.460 --> 33:18.460\nJust the angry bus driver who's a racist say his jokes over the like PA system.\n\n33:18.460 --> 33:19.460\nI don't know.\n\n33:19.460 --> 33:22.460\nWe didn't have any questions about the other items.\n\n33:22.460 --> 33:25.460\nCan we get one of his racist bomo?\n\n33:25.460 --> 33:28.460\nI don't know.\n\n33:28.460 --> 33:29.460\nNo.\n\n33:29.460 --> 33:30.460\nIt's probably good.\n\n33:30.460 --> 33:31.460\nWe're about halfway through the list.\n\n33:31.460 --> 33:36.460\nWe should probably just show the racist bus driver movie.\n\n33:36.460 --> 33:40.460\nOh, yeah.\n\n33:40.460 --> 33:55.460\nKeep it down back there, depending on your skin color.\n\n33:55.460 --> 33:58.460\nThat's a certain amount of offensive to me.\n\n33:58.460 --> 33:59.460\nWhat?\n\n33:59.460 --> 34:00.460\nWho said that?\n\n34:00.460 --> 34:03.460\nAnd how light is your skin?\n\n34:03.460 --> 34:04.460\nOh, it's just me.\n\n34:04.460 --> 34:06.460\nAnd this is my skin color.\n\n34:06.460 --> 34:07.460\nLet me see.\n\n34:07.460 --> 34:08.460\nOkay.\n\n34:08.460 --> 34:11.460\nSo you could see how appropriate my conduct was or wasn't.\n\n34:11.460 --> 34:14.460\nJoel, don't make me come back there.\n\n34:14.460 --> 34:18.460\nCould I please get back into the bus, please?\n\n34:18.460 --> 34:20.460\nWhy am I out on the...\n\n34:20.460 --> 34:23.460\nI can't tell.\n\n34:23.460 --> 34:26.460\nI can't tell.\n\n34:26.460 --> 34:29.460\nPlease, let me get back into the bus.\n\n34:29.460 --> 34:30.460\nI don't know.\n\n34:30.460 --> 34:31.460\nPlease, I'm on the wing.\n\n34:31.460 --> 34:35.460\nI'm a certified racist and I don't know whether you're on...\n\n34:35.460 --> 34:37.460\nPlease, why am I out on the...\n\n34:37.460 --> 34:38.460\nI don't know.\n\n34:38.460 --> 34:39.460\nWhat?\n\n34:39.460 --> 34:40.460\nJust get on the bus.\n\n34:40.460 --> 34:41.460\nWhat about...\n\n34:41.460 --> 34:43.460\nGet on the bus and choose your position within it.\n\n34:43.460 --> 34:45.460\nAll right.\n\n34:45.460 --> 34:46.460\nWhoa!\n\n34:46.460 --> 34:47.460\nPsst!\n\n34:47.460 --> 34:48.460\nPsst!\n\n34:48.460 --> 34:49.460\nPsst!\n\n34:49.460 --> 34:51.460\nNo, that's not a greeting.\n\n34:51.460 --> 34:53.460\nI'm opening the door.\n\n34:53.460 --> 34:55.460\nOkay, could I please...\n\n34:55.460 --> 34:56.460\nYeah, good job.\n\n34:56.460 --> 34:57.460\nGet on the bus.\n\n34:57.460 --> 34:58.460\nGoddamn.\n\n34:58.460 --> 35:01.460\nI can't wait to find out where Rachel...\n\n35:01.460 --> 35:02.460\nWhat?\n\n35:02.460 --> 35:10.460\nCan I wear my religious garb in here?\n\n35:10.460 --> 35:13.460\nYou're all free to do whatever you want.\n\n35:13.460 --> 35:17.460\nThe question is what's going to antagonize me, your bus driver?\n\n35:17.460 --> 35:22.460\nThat answer will be graded on a curve, I assure you.\n\n35:22.460 --> 35:26.460\nAs I am thoroughly racist.\n\n35:26.460 --> 35:33.460\nI'm going to eat my own country's bread now.\n\n35:33.460 --> 35:36.460\nIt better be my country.\n\n35:36.460 --> 35:40.460\nOh, we dip our bread in mayonnaise.\n\n35:40.460 --> 35:43.460\nI hear so much mischievous gas back there.\n\n35:43.460 --> 35:46.460\nI can't concentrate on being a good bus driver.\n\n35:46.460 --> 35:49.460\nCould you drive a little slower, please?\n\n35:49.460 --> 35:54.460\nCan you turn the bus to the south?\n\n35:54.460 --> 35:55.460\nYes.\n\n35:55.460 --> 35:57.460\nSo, how far south?\n\n35:57.460 --> 36:02.460\nI can just do south so I can pray.\n\n36:02.460 --> 36:05.460\nTo whom?\n\n36:05.460 --> 36:06.460\nWhat does it matter?\n\n36:06.460 --> 36:09.460\nYou're right, it shouldn't, but...\n\n36:09.460 --> 36:14.460\nThis is the coolest bus driver ever.\n\n36:14.460 --> 36:15.460\nThis guy rules.\n\n36:15.460 --> 36:18.460\nAll right, I've turned south.\n\n36:18.460 --> 36:19.460\nI hope...\n\n36:19.460 --> 36:23.460\nI'm going to pray myself that your God is appropriate.\n\n36:23.460 --> 36:30.460\nPlease, racist God, let my passenger face south toward the right God,\n\n36:30.460 --> 36:36.460\nthat I may continue to bus drive him and sleep at night tonight with my racist head on my pillow.\n\n36:36.460 --> 36:37.460\nAmen.\n\n36:37.460 --> 36:39.460\nAre you all finished?\n\n36:39.460 --> 36:40.460\nYeah, I'm...\n\n36:40.460 --> 36:41.460\nYeah, yeah, fine.\n\n36:41.460 --> 36:42.460\nOkay.\n\n36:42.460 --> 36:44.460\nWell, we're behind schedule now.\n\n36:44.460 --> 36:46.460\nYou're making it weird up there, man.\n\n36:46.460 --> 36:49.460\nI'm not weird, I'm normal.\n\n36:49.460 --> 36:55.460\nWhy is he doing that with his legs?\n\n36:55.460 --> 36:59.460\nIt's a pedal bus, man.\n\n36:59.460 --> 37:05.460\nLast stop, Albuquerque Square.\n\n37:05.460 --> 37:09.460\nCan everybody get off the bus?\n\n37:09.460 --> 37:11.460\nI'm not leaving the bus.\n\n37:11.460 --> 37:17.460\nI'm leaving the bus.\n\n37:17.460 --> 37:20.460\nI'm waiting for a cab.\n\n37:20.460 --> 37:27.460\nBecause I'm racist against long vehicles.\n\n37:27.460 --> 37:30.460\nI'm finished with my shift, that's all I know.\n\n37:30.460 --> 37:32.460\nSee you later.\n\n37:32.460 --> 37:34.460\nTaking my mic back off.\n\n37:34.460 --> 37:37.460\nMy star.\n\n37:37.460 --> 37:39.460\nMy taser.\n\n37:39.460 --> 37:42.460\nMy changed converter.\n\n37:42.460 --> 37:44.460\nMy spare battery.\n\n37:44.460 --> 37:46.460\nMy bus hat.\n\n37:46.460 --> 37:49.460\nMy collar enforcer.\n\n37:49.460 --> 37:52.460\nMy regular collar.\n\n37:52.460 --> 37:54.460\nMy collar underlier.\n\n37:54.460 --> 37:57.460\nMy sub-collar.\n\n37:57.460 --> 37:59.460\nMy negla-collar.\n\n37:59.460 --> 38:03.460\nAnd my

categorized people by race.\n\n38:25.460 --> 38:30.460\nThis one lacks an ability.\n\n38:30.460 --> 38:33.460\nCarry me off the bus to your wife.\n\n38:33.460 --> 38:36.460\nWhat race are you?\n\n38:36.460 --> 38:40.460\nI'm... well, can't you tell?\n\n38:40.460 --> 38:42.460\nI can.\n\n38:42.460 --> 38:46.460\nYou're a race in need.\n\n38:46.460 --> 38:50.460\nA race in need is a race indeed.\n\n38:50.460 --> 38:52.460\nYay.\n\n38:52.460 --> 38:54.460\nCome off the bus.\n\n38:54.460 --> 38:57.460\nWhy are you grabbing the side of my breast?\n\n38:57.460 --> 39:02.460\nSorry, I don't know how to help.\n\n39:02.460 --> 39:04.460\nI'm a curmudgeon.\n\n39:04.460 --> 39:08.460\nMost films are about people like me.\n\n39:08.460 --> 39:14.460\nWe start as comedically flawed, and then we progress to being normal.\n\n39:14.460 --> 39:16.460\nAnd then it's an arc.\n\n39:16.460 --> 39:20.460\nLike, oh, I can't stand popsicles, and then it's like,\n\n39:20.460 --> 39:22.460\noh, yeah, the third act, I can eat a popsicle.\n\n39:22.460 --> 39:24.460\nOkay, cool.\n\n39:24.460 --> 39:26.460\nCool, whatever.\n\n39:26.460 --> 39:27.460\nSorry, I didn't mean to...\n\n39:27.460 -->

plate.\n\n39:44.460 --> 39:46.460\nExtra, extra, read all about it.\n\n39:46.460 --> 39:48.460\nWho's that?\n\n39:48.460 --> 39:50.460\nI don't want your racial news.\n\n39:50.460 --> 39:52.460\nExtra, read all about it.\n\n39:52.460 --> 39:54.460\nGive me it.\n\n39:54.460 --> 39:56.460\nYou're an idiot.\n\n39:56.460 --> 39:58.460\nShut up.\n\n39:58.460 --> 40:00.460\nGo away.\n\n40:00.460 --> 40:02.460\nI can't breathe.\n\n40:02.460 --> 40:04.460\nI don't like anyone.\n\n40:04.460 --> 40:08.460\nI will never be different.\n\n40:08.460 --> 40:12.460\nHe was the biggest racist of all.\n\n40:12.460 --> 40:18.460\nFor one who loves all the races\n\n40:18.460 --> 40:20.460\nis a...\n\n40:20.460 --> 40:22.460\nnot...\n\n40:22.460 --> 40:26.460\nno one who is welcome in the kingdom of me.\n\n40:26.460 --> 40:32.460\nHitler Christ.\n\n40:32.460 --> 40:34.460\nOh.\n\n40:34.460 --> 40:40.460\nI hear that voice every day.\n\n40:40.460 --> 40:42.460\nHaunts me at night.\n\n40:42.460 --> 40:44.460\nWhat did he mean by that?\n\n40:44.460 --> 40:48.460\nWhat's up, dog?\n\n40:48.460 --> 40:52.460\nLet's get boba, man.\n\n40:52.460 --> 41:00.460\nI'm Hitler

okay.\n\n41:08.460 --> 41:12.460\nSo now we're going to win an Oscar, right?\n\n41:12.460 --> 41:16.460\nHey, man, we just make this art for Art's sake.\n\n41:16.460 --> 41:18.460\nIf the Academy recognizes it,\n\n41:18.460 --> 41:20.460\nthat's their prerogative.\n\n41:20.460 --> 41:22.460\nI'm going to...\n\n41:22.460 --> 41:24.460\nOh, shit.\n\n41:24.460 --> 41:26.460\nHello.\n\n41:26.460

41:38.220\nI just stopped at home to make a sandwich and a hot plate.\n\n41:38.220 --> 41:40.300\nYou eat your sandwich on your own time,\n\n41:40.300 --> 41:42.500\nget in that bus and pick up some people,\n\n41:42.500 --> 41:44.020\nthe streets are filled.\n\n41:45.780 --> 41:48.860\nDamn it, you racial character, you cost me my job.\n\n41:48.860 --> 41:50.140\nGet up, come on.\n\n41:50.140 -->
