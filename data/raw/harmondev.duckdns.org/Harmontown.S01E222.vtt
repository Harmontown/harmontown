01:09.000\nThere's some points of order to be made.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.000\nNow, here's one of them.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:19.000\nTo our friends at MeUndies, who are not, I don't believe they're not paying for any advertising tonight,\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nbut I want to address them.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:30.000\nI have a problem at my home with my underwear, which is the following.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:37.000\nI have two dogs, adopted by Ms. McGathey and myself.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:42.000\nThe two dogs are now in my charge.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:50.000\nThe smaller of them, Nigel, eats the underwear.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:57.000\nI'm asking MeUndies if I can have another box of MeUndies,\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:04.000\nbecause I've gotten two shipments from them and I still own two pairs of underwear that are functional.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:10.000\nHowever, so that you understand that I'm the victim here.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:16.000\nDan, please figure out how to throw your underwear or put it in a hamper or something.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nDon't leave it on the floor.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nThe dog loves you.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:22.000\nHe wants to eat your piss and your shit.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:23.000\nAnd that's true.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:24.000\nYes, you're right.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:25.000\nI'm trying.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nI'm trying to learn.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nI don't enjoy not having underwear, but I just want to create a map of the cosmos for you to understand.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nYou should feel sorry for me, because here's the thing.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:41.000\nThis little fucker eats, he didn't do this when you were around.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:46.000\nHe started eating all the furniture when Aaron and I started divorcing.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:47.000\nAds up.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:49.000\nAds up?\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:55.000\nI'm just trying to, I don't know if I should do an impression of Spencer or I'm just trying to be Spencer.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:00.000\nI, for one, would like to hear you try.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:02.000\nOkay.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nYeah.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nThat happens.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nYeah.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:13.000\nOh, that dog, that dog eats all that underwear.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:17.000\nYeah, that dog, that dog really does that.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:22.000\nMaybe you shouldn't leave it on the floor.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:33.000\nSo this little fucker, he eats the fabric that was touching where my penis.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nAn asshole are, because he loves, he's a dog.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nHe thinks that's my wallet.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nHe thinks that's my, he thinks that's a locket.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nIn dog terms, they call that flavor country.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nYeah.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nYeah.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nYou notice they sniff your crotch, they sniff your butt.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:57.000\nThey're going like, oh, hello, Carl.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nI see you're allergic to coffee or something, you know, like they're thinking, all right.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:10.000\nSo, so he eats, but he eats perfect, perfect holes right where the junk and the trunk are.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nAnd so here's the thing, just so you understand that I'm a victim.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nTwo separate holes or one.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nTwo separate holes.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nHe eats a junk hole and a trunk hole.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nYes.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nIt just sounds like he wants you to explore a new fetish.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nTry not to get ahead of me here.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:33.000\nSo here is the part where you say, Dan, I feel bad for you.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:39.000\nIt's not out of property loss, which I'm asking the undies to, maybe they could reimburse.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nI don't know if the reimburse is the right word.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nRe-up.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nBail out.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nIt's a bail out.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nAnd you don't need to go.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.000\nYeah.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nI got a variety pack last time.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:57.000\nLet's, let's, let's target the boxer briefy more things like the bikini style ones are only good for an Instagram.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nWhat, what are you, what are you rocking right now?\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:10.000\nI don't, probably a good old fashioned cotton pair of, of Calvin Klein's that are one third the softness of Modal.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:17.000\nAs, as, are you saying that me and these are too delicious for dogs?\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nWell, he never ate the crotch out of my, no, I don't want to start that business.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nI don't want to, I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to be one of those people.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:30.000\nLike when the iPhone came out, people are like, did you know the screen gets degraded faster when you eat pizza?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not an alarmist.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:37.000\nI'm a futurist and I'm a, and I'm an underwear softness advocate.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nI wouldn't even, even if I thought that was the case, I would, I would pull back on that information.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nI'd be like a tobacco company.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nI'd be like, come on, let's get all the data.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n05:51.000 --> 06:04.000\nSo my soon to be thrown over a historical wall housekeeper who is terrified right now.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nWait, don't, don't you and I have the same housekeeper?\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:08.000\nWhat's that? Yeah.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nWe have the same housekeeper.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nIs she, is she documented?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nI don't, I'm not going to fucking ask.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nYeah, well, so.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nShe's coming to my place tomorrow.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nSo, so plan for the worst, hope for the best.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nYeah.

from your place\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nto clean my place after cleaning your place.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd she looked really, really shagged out.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nShe looked really tired.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nThat, I had to be when Aaron was living.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nYeah, you guys were together back then,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nbut that's not, that's not the point.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nShe's like, I think Jeff, thank you for letting me in.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nI go, how you

you know Harvey?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nCause you're golden doodle.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nI go, yeah, I know Harvey.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nHe goes, and she, she just like puts her backpack down in my kitchen\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nand she starts to like get like, like start washing the dishes.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:10.000\nShe goes, Harvey, he, he eats all the trash.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nHe eats all the trash.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nBut that, I mean that Harvey would do that once in a while,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nbut very intelligent dog.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nWhat?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nHe learned, he learned.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nHe picks up, he's a very empathic dog, Harvey.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nNigel is a fucking disaster.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nNigel is just like, look, you talk to parents,\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nthey have a favorite kid, they won't admit it.\n\n08:33.000 -->

kid better than the other kid.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nThat's well, that's, that's not well documented.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nSophia probably is.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:46.000\nLet's assume so.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:50.000\nAnd, but you don't, you don't say, but it's, we all know it's true.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.000\nYou have a favorite kid, especially if one comes from a breeder\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nand is amazingly intelligent.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:00.000\nThe combination of two thoroughbred species of a breed of dog\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nthat are renowned for their intelligence,\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:07.000\nand the other is just a mishmash of rescue crap from Echo Park.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nJust a, just a fucking...\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nAren't, aren't much notoriously more savvy,\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nlike because, because of the, the, the broader gene pool?\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nNot when the, no, that's like, applies to like,\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:20.000\noh, let's mix a shelter with a, with a, with a, with a Jack Russell.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nSo, so maybe he'll, maybe he'll...\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nJack Russell's the fucking worst.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nDon't get too fucking sidetracked, okay?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nLike, you're, you're supposed to be the anti-tangent guy.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nYou're supposed to keep me on rails.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nOh, that reminds me.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nI was having an enchilada today.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nAnd I'm fucking it.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nAnd I mean, fucking it.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nSo here's the situation.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:48.000\nSo imagine when I open my underwear drawer.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nI imagine this every morning.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:55.000\nAnd the underwear drawer is basically full,\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\neven though I'm like...\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd then I pull out, I pull out each pair of underwear\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:05.000\nand it's got this hole in the crotch and hole in the butt.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:09.000\nSo here I am, a man deprived of his property by his,\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nhis mutt.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:14.000\nAnd his housekeeper is folding,\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nneatly washing and folding,\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:19.000\nbecause she thinks I'm a fucking sex monster.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nWait.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nI can't, I can't have that conversation with her.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nHold up.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nHow many pairs, how many, multiple pairs, not just one?\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:33.000\nLike, every fucking pair that's ever touched the floor.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nFrom meundies. Only from meundies?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nI think maybe no. He's got, I think maybe he, I don't, look,\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nI told you I didn't want to get into that.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nI, I have a lot of questions.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nI feel like he's got, no, I have, I have cotton underwear\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:48.000\nthat has this treatment done to it.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nAre you trying to...\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nI do think it's possible that the modal,\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nwhich is a fabric, a three times softer than cotton.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nLet's do a free, let's do a free ad for them right now\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nbecause we're not even supposed to do an ad for them today.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nI believe we are.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nI would say, I would highly recommend this underwear.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nI would highly recommend you get a dog from a breeder.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nYeah, yeah.

because we got in a fight\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nand I wasn't at your wedding night,\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nbut you used to wear my mustache\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nand you were so pleased by that.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nShe would, oh good, sorry.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nOh yeah, I felt, yeah.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nI don't know what's happening again.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nI'm falling for that great stuff.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nThis magic moment.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nThis magic moment.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:13.000\nThe, uh, you had spirit gum the mustache to your lip\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nand they just said it wasn't like a cheese ball thing.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nIt was like, it was a really good mustache.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nThere was a month where we were living in like a,\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nlike a James Spader 80s independent film\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nwhere the three of us would just hang out\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nand drink and play party games\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nand I would wear the mustache and no pants and just tights.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nWoo!\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nAnd I used to eat the Pussy and Asshole\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nout of all of her tights.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:42.000\nThe point of this flashback being that\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nSophia,\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\non absolutely more than two occasions\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:52.000\nbecause we were doing like a lot of all-nighters\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nand then pass out and like,\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nI wasn't working on community.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nAnd she would find bags of drugs everywhere.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nShe always finds bags of drugs everywhere.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.000\nBut when I was first dating Erin,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nvery often, more than twice,\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nlike because Monday night would be like,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nlike up till four or maybe pass out up till six, whatever,\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:15.000\nand then Sophia would come over at 8.30 Tuesday morning.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:18.000\nSo on more than two occasions,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:23.000\nwe'd be asleep downstairs on two different sofas\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.000\nand she'd walk in and the things she'd see\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nwould be two bleary-eyed adults\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nrealizing someone was coming in,\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nboth of them sitting bolt upright,\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\none of them a woman with a mustache.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nAnd then we'd quietly excuse ourselves\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nand head upstairs and go out for a Bloody Mary.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nBut then the mustache,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nwhich would have been quickly ripped off\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nand kind of left on the kitchen bathroom sink,\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:54.000\nI would always then, she would neatly clean it\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:58.000\nand put it in its case and put it in a drawer.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nNext to the bed.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nNext to the bed.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nBecause she's like, I get it.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\nI don't get it, but I get that I don't get it.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nI'm north of the wall.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nThese are not wildlings.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:21.000\nThese are corrupted folk.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nThese are elitists.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nThey have to go further.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nI had a broken garbage disposal\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nand a broken microwave oven door\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nlike for a week.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nShe came in, I woke up in the morning,\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nshe left, they worked.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nWell, you better be prepared to fucking hide her\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nand battle to the death.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nI will.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nBattle skinheads.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nAll right, good.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:47.000\nHarvey, eat all the trash.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nI want you all to protect your housekeepers.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nAll right, now Dan.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nIt's war.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nDan, do you think...\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nIt's about values.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nDo you think me undies is a good underwear company\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nor a worse underwear company\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nthat the fact that it's delicious to dogs.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nI don't think it's delicious to dogs.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nIt stops fretting that rumor.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:14.000\nI think that my shit and gross crotch pheromones\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.000\nare delicious to Nigel.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nAnd I think it's possible, I'll go this far\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nand say it's maybe it's possible that whereas\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nwhen he eats, when he does that with the hains\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nor the shitty, the cotton underwear,\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nthat basically they kind of get torn apart\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nand it's like just shredded\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nand it's unmistakably dog-eaten underwear\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nthat the housekeeper throws in the garbage,\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nthat Modal, probably what keeps it three times as soft\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nis that it's very slightly knit.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nYou have a strap on peg fetish.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nSo he's able to, he's like, it's like a corn on the cob.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nHe just like makes a little circle.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:53.000\nHe's like a little Yosemite Sam robbing a pirate ship\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nwith a saw.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:01.000\nDan, it's been a year and I've, you know,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nsome memories fade and some memories stick with me,\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nbut for some reason the image of your dirty underwear,\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nI know exactly what it looks like.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nI have so many,

and Nigel used to fight over it,\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nlike Lady and the Tramp and the spaghetti.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nEat.

Are you Los Angelinos?\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nI moved here about a year ago.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.000\nFrom where?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:55.000\nFrom Oregon.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nStill on his way?\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nTwo.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nWere you followed here by your blue ox?\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nNice.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nYou fucking monster.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:09.000\nI'm a human being.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:15.000\nLet's do a segment called, the things we should know about Lucas.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:19.000\nA segment called, we're sorry, Lucas.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nIt's okay.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:29.000\nNow that he's been gracious about all that, his reward should be that we find out some non-height-related things about him.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:33.000\nWhat band are you in?\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nI'm not in a band. I do paint.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nYou don't play stand-up bass.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:41.000\nNo. I play sit-down bass.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:47.000\nI paint and I'm an actor at Universal Studios.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nGreat. What do you do at Universal Studios?\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nI am a character.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:53.000\nNow, I was once too. What do you do?\n\n28:53.000 --> 29:00.000\nI'm a few different things. I'm a who at Christmas and I also am the warm-up act for the animal show, if anyone has been there.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:05.000\nIt's very Harpo Marx. It's like a silent clown type. I do a lot of mime and mess with guests.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:11.000\nI'd, for a summer or two, did, I was Harry from Harry and the Hendersons and Frankenstein.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nThat's good. Yeah.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:17.000\nNow, this is not a height thing, but you would be too tall.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:23.000\nI am too tall. The tallest character in the park is Megatron and height cap is 6'6\".\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:29.000\nSo, I'm allowed to be the atmosphere character that's just like, you're a policeman. I can do that.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:37.000\nBecause I was Harry and the Hendersons and the dead of summer wearing a yak fur and latex mushroom.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nOh man. Yeah. Mushroom.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:42.000\nI feel really bad for the people who are shrek.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nOh my God.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:52.000\nIt was the hottest thing. You were just pouring sweat, but inside the big feet of the big foot of the Sasquatch, there was like metal high heels in it.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:59.000\nI'm 6'4\", I'm just like a shade under 6'4\". So, in that, in the head, I was like, probably 6'10\".\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:04.000\nBut I got one day, I got to play Frankenstein, which is the best, because you just wear a nice suit.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nYeah, a nice suit and like platform heels.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:09.000\nYeah. And also, nobody fucks with you when you're Frankenstein.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nOh, definitely not. Yeah.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:15.000\nAnd they bone out? They don't want to hang her.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:20.000\nSomeone stuck a wand in the mummy's butt.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:23.000\nThat seems like an awesome 80's Gary Newman song.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:37.000\nI got my wand inside. Inside the mummy's butt. I like my wrappings. I like my stick.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:42.000\nWhen I was Harry, Harry and the Hendersons, it was my own eyes that you could see through the mask.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:47.000\nAnd the jaw would work. And you were supposed to be kind of a comical, like lovable character.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:54.000\nBut nobody really screwed with you, because you're so big, and there's this big latex padded muscle suit.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nYeah.\n\n30:55.000 --> 31:00.000\nAnd it's a thousand degrees outside. And you're dying. You're dying.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:01.000\nYou're dying.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:04.000\nAnd you're making $10 an hour the fucking hard way.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:08.000\nWait, I think you meant Randy Newman, didn't you? I was doing Gary Newman.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nDid you mean Randy Newman?\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nGary Newman.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:17.000\nSomeone put a stick in the mummy's butt. It sounded more like a Randy Newman song.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:21.000\nLet's hear Randy Newman talk about putting a wand up the mummy's butt.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:24.000\nYou got that stick now, don't you, little boy?\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:28.000\nWhat you gonna do with that stick when you don't know what to do?\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nYou got a stick in your butt.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nLike that.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nTall people.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nYeah.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nThank you.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:45.000\nBut it was the Japanese businessmen would come up, and they would blow smoke into my mask.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nThey could see human beings' eyes in there.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:50.000\nAnd they would get in their tippy toes and go...\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:57.000\nAnd then a couple times, just take their hand and try to ram it up Sasquatch's butt.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:03.000\nAnd I would just shove them as hard as I could, and then run off like I was being a bad Sasquatch.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:19.000\nI've told the story before. I was a Captain Crunch during either their peak popularity as a serial or the Valley.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nI don't know what would make them...\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:25.000\nThis was at the short-lived General Mills Serial Theme Park.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nThe promotional campaign was Who's the Real Captain?\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.000\nThere were multiple captains wandering the city of Milwaukee.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nThere was another tour.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nAnd one of the other captains...\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nWait, you're not joking?\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nNo.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nI thought this was a bit.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:41.000\nI've told this story, but you've also talked about being Harry and the Henderson.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:44.000\nSo it's recycling night at Harmontown.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:48.000\nI was a captain, and there was another guy who was a captain, because there were multiple captains.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:51.000\nWe'd go around going, I'm the real captain.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.000\nNo, I am the real captain.\n\n32:54.000 --> 33:00.000\nAnd we had the big costumes with the spray-painted mesh mouth where you're looking out of it.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:03.000\nWe went to Winterfest, and they put ice skates on us.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nAnd they said, why don't you go out there?\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:10.000\nAnd the kids were like, there's six-foot pillows on ice skates.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nLet's attack.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nMy childhood is incumbent upon me.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:18.000\nIt's my patriotic duty to ram these fuckers into oblivion.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nThrow them down and watch the turtles trying to get up.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nWhat did they want to happen?\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:32.000\nIt was just like, if you've survived Pearl Harbor, I don't know why you think I'm trivializing your experience, but it was, to me, it was my Pearl Harbor.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:39.000\nDan, I remember when you told me that story, and for some reason I was so impressed.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nIt is impressive.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nI was Captain Crutch.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nYeah.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nYeah, it's fucking impressive.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nLook, also, you skated.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:47.000\nYeah.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nLike, that's hard.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nSkating for it.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:53.000\nWell, when you're in Milwaukee, it's like you're sliding everywhere anyway.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nAnd so then somebody's like, put these blades on.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\nYou'll go faster.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:57.000\nAnd they're like, OK.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nSo Lucas, right now, you're correct.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nHey.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:03.000\nI just got to finish the story.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nSo one of the kids kept bombarding us.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:14.000\nAnd one of the captains, my friend, I was near him and he grabbed one of the kids.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:17.000\nAnd the mouth is like right in front of the kid's face.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:24.000\nAnd he said, if you skate into me one more time, I will break your fucking arm.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:30.000\nAnd if you tell anybody I said this, I'll deny it.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:34.000\nAnd I think he was the real captain.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nThat's when I figured it out.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nI don't know if they ever gave us an answer, but.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:41.000\nThat might have been Admiral Crutch.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:42.000\nAll right.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nSo now continue.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:48.000\nSo you're currently still doing costume work and like character stuff up at university?\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:49.000\nYes.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:50.000\nCurrently we're preparing for Grinchmas.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nGrinchmas.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nAh, Grinchmas.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nCopyright problems there?\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:55.000\nCan't just.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.000\nYeah.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nChristmas is completely taken.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nNo, it's because we don't want to.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nIt's because we don't want to trump things.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nWe don't want to say, wait, what happened?\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nWe don't want to say Christmas.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:03.000\nWe don't want to say Hanukkah.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:04.000\nSo it's Grinchmas.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nYeah.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:06.000\nBut we sing Christmas girls.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nDo they still do the Westworld Waterworld?\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nWaterworld.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nYes, Waterworld.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:12.000\nI know.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nIt's still happening.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:14.000\nIt's not a great movie.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:15.000\nIt's not a great movie.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:19.000\nWaterworld, very, very beautiful movie, very successful ride.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:20.000\nAnd I'll tell you something.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nI heard what you just said.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:23.000\nYou're going to be saying Christmas.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nThey're going to be saying Christmas.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nThey're going to love it.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nThey're going to love it.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nWe're going to go down there.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:32.000\nWe're going to make them say Christmas.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nHugely.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:40.000\nSo tall.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nTall.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nBut more to it than that.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:48.000\nIronically, working in a theme park, the height doesn't figure in.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:51.000\nThe guy playing Megatron and Harry from Harry and the Henderson's,\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:58.000\nwhen you walk by wearing an ill-fitting bell-hop costume, they go,\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:01.000\nwhat's with the tall guy?\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nYou're too tall to be the tall character.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nI'm too tall to be the tall character.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nI can be the other atmosphere.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:10.000\nI can be police officer, British palace guard, train conductor, like those ones.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nRight.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nBut you can't put on the Franklin sign.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:19.000\nBut they're like, shaggy, 6'2\", and you're like, he's a cartoon.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:23.000\nDo you have a big dick?\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nI already mentioned this.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nI said it was proportionate.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:30.000\nI don't want to say things out loud like that.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:34.000\nHe said he has a proportionate to my height.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nWell, that's, okay, big dick then.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nSure.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:42.000\nBecause mine is not proportionate.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:49.000\nHow not proportionate is it?\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:55.000\nLegally, I'm required to call it a nipple.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:59.000\nDen's dick is so not proportionate to his size.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:02.000\nHow not proportionate is it?\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:06.000\nThere's never snow on it.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nCallback.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:11.000\nNo one ever agrees to meet in front of it if they go to Disneyland.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:15.000\nMy dick is so not proportionate to my size.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nHow not proportionate is it?\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:24.000\nTo this day, I still don't know if I'm circumcised.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:31.000\nBecause just the regular amount of skin.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:38.000\nStill turtlenecks around it and comes to a little brunch swagger.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:39.000\nNo.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:43.000\nDance.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:44.000\nGo ahead.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:50.000\nErin, you might be something of an expert on this topic.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:53.000\nA dance dick is so not proportionate to his size.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:56.000\nHow not proportionate is it?\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:00.000\nI feel uncomfortable joking about it.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:07.000\nHow beautiful is it?\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:10.000\nNo, Dan, I love you.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nIt's beautiful.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:15.000\nHow beautiful is it?\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:19.000\nIt's so beautiful that it needs to be beautiful.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.000\nSorry.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:24.000\nI just wanted to get in on the boy fun.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:27.000\nMy dick is so beautiful.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nHow beautiful is it?\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:48.000\nIt's in the background of three Terrence Malick movies.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:52.000\nLucas, you said that you're also not just an actor, but what else?\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:53.000\nI also paint.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nYou paint?\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nWhat sort of painting do you do?\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nMostly scenes from video games.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nWhat media?\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:01.000\nAcrylic on canvas.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:02.000\nReally?\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.000\nScenes from...\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nSo like pixel paintings?\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:10.000\nI recently did a painting of Pallet Town from Pokemon if people play Pokemon.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:14.000\nSo I drawed a grid on the canvas and then I paint it by hand.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:19.000\nHe tried doing landscapes, like traditional stuff, but the teacher would be like,\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nthat's just a plane.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:26.000\nI told you, I told you look out the window.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:33.000\nOh.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:36.000\nWhy is it that we think it's okay?\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:39.000\nTo comment about this, and it's the only physical thing you can.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:43.000\nWell, no, I was going to say, we had our friend Collin on here.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:44.000\nHe's a little person.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.000\nDwarfism.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nObviously, we don't feel quite as...\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:54.000\nWe range in our like, oh, if they make it okay for us, we can ask them questions about the latitude\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nand the effect and all the things.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nBut what is it about height that's like, because it doesn't really...\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:02.000\nYou can't kill a mammoth any better than anybody else.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:03.000\nDefinitely not.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:06.000\nWell, we feel like, oh, you know, he's fine, he's fine.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nLike we must be feeling that or we wouldn't feel okay.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nLike, are you faster?\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:12.000\nAre you...\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:13.000\nDefinitely not.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nI feel like your heart's probably like, you know...\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:17.000\nDying?\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:18.000\nYeah, it's like...\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nThere's probably risk involved.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nThere aren't a lot of tall, old people.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nReally?\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nSee, I know...\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nThat was sad.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:30.000\nLook, it's like being like just shy of 6'4\".\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:34.000\nI'm at the threshold of I can just fit into most like roller coasters.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:35.000\nYeah.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:38.000\nI can sit and coach without being miserable.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:39.000\nRight.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:40.000\nBut right at the edge of that.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nSo like, coach for you is probably a bummer, right?\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:43.000\nIt is a bummer.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:46.000\nIf you get Southwest and you board early, you can get the exit row.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nYeah, but you have to.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nYeah.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.000\nYou got to.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nWhat about roller coasters?\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:53.000\nYeah, what about roller coasters?\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:56.000\nI love roller coasters.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:59.000\nBecause I'm wedged into most roller coasters.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:00.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:01.000\nI mean, I just don't go on them.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.000\nYou don't even do it.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:03.000\nYeah, I just don't bother.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:04.000\nBecause it's like...\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:07.000\nBecause like, if I wait in line for an hour to get on the coaster and then they're like,\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:08.000\nyou can't go on.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:09.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, great.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:13.000\nAnd the goddamn nightmare of any theatrical situation at all.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:14.000\nEven me.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nI'm aware, you know, I'm 6 feet.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:23.000\nLike, it's like that dread of like, you walk into an already filled auditorium or picnic\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\noutdoor like thing where people are sitting or something.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:30.000\nAnd it's just that those comments like, oh, God, no.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:31.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nI apologize to this lovely gentleman behind me.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nI was like, I'm sorry, but I am.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nAnd the guy he's running to is an African-American gentleman.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nAnd how happy are you right now that he's on stage and not sitting in front of you?\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:47.000\nIt's okay, because he looks back and he goes, I'm sorry.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:51.000\nI'm like, you look great though, dude.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:54.000\nI have taught Guy Guilt about going to concerts and stuff.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.000\nLike, I stand in the back.\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:01.000\nYeah, I have that guilt, but it doesn't hold me back from living my life.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:06.000\nI love it.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:10.000\nI mean, you're still a white man.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:11.000\nOh, I know.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:14.000\nLucas, Lucas, if we, do you have like an Instagram or something like that?\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:17.000\nWe can follow your art and we can get people to buy something.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nI guess I do have an Instagram.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:22.000\nKing Lucas Lee on Instagram.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.000\nI don't know how to Instagram.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nKing Lucas, L-E-E.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:26.000\nL-E-E, yeah.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:27.000\nAll right.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nLet's check it out.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nMaybe we'll get one and like hang it on the wall here for our harm attack.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:31.000\nLovely.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nI'll pay you one for free and bring it next time.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.000\nAll right.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nAll right.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nYour free ride is over.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:37.000\nHe's coming back down.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nLet's hear it for Lucas, everybody.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nThank you.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nThank you.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:47.000\nOh, you can still see me.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:50.000\nAnd it's all about this view.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nBut as I, that is interesting.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:55.000\nI don't want to, I don't want to, but that is, I told, that didn't even, that was the\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:58.000\nlast thought I had was like, oh yeah, women.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:03.000\nLike, like, like you, like, like, it's, it's always the last thing I think of before\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:06.000\nI, like, house keys, women.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:10.000\nWell, like, if you, if you're like a six foot seven woman, you're going to, you, you\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nprobably, you're an experience of a completely different thing.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nIt's not like tall person, short person.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:16.000\nIt's like there's an additional layer of like, of course.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nYeah.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:21.000\nI wanted to ask Lucas, and you could nod yes or no, but I was curious if like, if\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\npeople, because I was thinking about that exact same thing.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:28.000\nLike if he was female, women, like a very tall woman may worry about whether or not\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nmen are fetishizing their tallness.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nLike they have a crumb fetish.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:37.000\nYou told me on one of our first dates that you, you know, like you, you, you have to\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:42.000\nwonder whether the, the, the, like a lot of guys ask you out, but you're always wondering\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nif they just want to climb you.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:45.000\nYeah.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:46.000\nYeah.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nLike I have, I mean, less so now.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:49.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:56.000\nLike from time to time I've had a, I've had a crumb body, like big thighs and I feel weird\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:57.000\ndescribing my body.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nI think you were speaking from a place of.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:00.000\nOf tallness.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:06.000\nAnd also that, that like, uh, I think you were referring possibly to the phenomenon of\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:07.000\nlike.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:08.000\nSmaller men.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:11.000\nGentlemen of a smaller stature, uh, seeming to have a proclivity.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:12.000\nYes.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nYes.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nExactly.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:15.000\nYeah.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:16.000\nYeah.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:17.000\nWhich is a weird, which is a weird line across if you're attracted to somebody and then\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nyou're like, well, is it am I a fetish for them?\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nDo you, Lucas, do you experience this?\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:22.000\nSometimes yes.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.000\nI don't know.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:27.000\nYou're asking from the perspective of a lady, right?\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.000\nNo, no.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:29.000\nFor you.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:33.000\nDo you ever, do you ever have any, can you tell when someone's like, oh, this is, this\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:34.000\nis a tall chaser.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:35.000\nThis is a building chaser.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:40.000\nI don't date much because people don't see me as a person a lot.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nAw.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nAw.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:43.000\nAw.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\nAw.\n\n44:44.000 -->

yeah, I don't know, there might be a disparity there, but\n\n45:33.060 --> 45:35.500\nthen I think about it, I'm like, yeah, probably not.\n\n45:35.500 --> 45:39.420\nLike I think you're evenly dispersed, like men and women who would either have a problem\n\n45:39.420 --> 45:40.920\nwith that or not have a problem with that probably.\n\n45:40.920 --> 45:45.420\nYeah, I think as long as it's like consensual and not secret, like that's cool, as long\n\n45:45.420 --> 45:50.700\nas someone's not hiding their, their deep, I don't know, as long as they, they don't,\n\n45:50.700 --> 45:52.380\nthey like the person as, as well.\n\n45:52.380 --> 45:55.260\nWell, what if somebody was going out with you and they said like, oh, I just love how\n\n45:55.260 --> 45:58.620\nyou're, I don't know, they said something really specific physically about you and it\n\n45:58.620 --> 46:00.740\nwas like something that felt temporary.\n\n46:00.740 --> 46:04.580\nWhat if they said, you know, it's like, isn't that the thing that's always being, people\n\n46:04.580 --> 46:11.060\nsuspect is not being said, like, like, or the, like, oh, I think he might like me.\n\n46:11.060 --> 46:13.060\nHe talks about my, how hot my body is.\n\n46:13.060 --> 46:14.940\nLike red hair.\n\n46:14.940 --> 46:19.940\nRed hair, red hair, you can buy in a bottle, you can, it doesn't, it's not, I'm talking\n\n46:19.940 --> 46:24.740\nabout the terror of like, oh, my boyfriend loves my ass, he loves my, he's always talking\n\n46:24.740 --> 46:28.980\nabout my ass, like, well, he's not just talking about its existence, he might be talking about\n\n46:28.980 --> 46:36.260\nits state of being, at that particular time, that must be fucking horrible.\n\n46:36.260 --> 46:43.460\nI, I, I have to find my own shame before I worry about like, my, my, my body and that,\n\n46:43.460 --> 46:48.260\nthat takes a long time and, and, and then I look really bad, like, I just, I'm just\n\n46:48.260 --> 46:52.620\nlike, I have to like, have difficulty breathing in my sleep before I'm like, I should lose\n\n46:52.620 --> 46:59.420\nsome weight, or I'll see myself from 90 degrees, like, profile in a Facebook live video talking\n\n46:59.420 --> 47:07.580\nabout Trump getting elected and I'll be like, it just looks like a mountain of, of, of,\n\n47:07.580 --> 47:18.700\nof leaves, it's like a, a shambling mound, squirrels hiding things in him, but I don't\n\n47:18.700 --> 47:21.980\ndo anything about it, I got an elliptical in my living room and it's just literally like\n\n47:21.980 --> 47:26.940\nsitting there since the day it was assembled, just waiting, just going, what did I do?\n\n47:26.940 --> 47:27.940\nHave you ever used it?\n\n47:27.940 --> 47:29.540\nI literally have not used it.\n\n47:29.540 --> 47:30.940\nHow long has it been there?\n\n47:30.940 --> 47:31.940\nI don't know, man.\n\n47:31.940 --> 47:32.940\nSteve, how long has it been there?\n\n47:32.940 --> 47:35.540\nHow long has the elliptical been there?\n\n47:35.540 --> 47:42.460\nHow long has the elliptical been there?\n\n47:42.460 --> 47:51.300\nHow long since you also found a laptop holder so I could play Minecraft while I was on the\n\n47:51.300 --> 47:53.700\nelliptical, thinking that might get me on it.\n\n47:53.700 --> 48:02.140\nI think I bought that before the elliptical, yeah, it's all set up and ready to go.\n\n48:02.140 --> 48:08.420\nI bought you a tracksuit, that was part of the whole journey.\n\n48:08.420 --> 48:10.100\nI want to know more about this tracksuit.\n\n48:10.100 --> 48:11.100\nWhat color is it?\n\n48:11.100 --> 48:13.340\nWait, did Jeff tell you get, get up there please?\n\n48:13.340 --> 48:14.340\nNo, I did not.\n\n48:14.340 --> 48:15.340\nHe just fucked it up.\n\n48:15.340 --> 48:16.340\nThat's awesome.\n\n48:16.340 --> 48:17.340\nWhat?\n\n48:17.340 --> 48:24.340\nHe just stormed the stage, just signed it up, going, flavor, flavor, flavor, flavor.\n\n48:24.340 --> 48:34.060\nAll right, well, I mean, maybe as a loving audience, we could all help you get on the\n\n48:34.060 --> 48:35.060\nelliptical.\n\n48:35.060 --> 48:42.500\nThere's a fine line between that and Fatty Fatty 2x4, yeah, like a bunch of people chanting\n\n48:42.500 --> 48:49.700\nyou need exercise is like, but it's not about your weight, it's just like a healthy thing\n\n48:49.700 --> 48:50.700\nto do.\n\n48:50.700 --> 48:57.060\nIs it true that you can't make it through the cellar door?\n\n48:57.060 --> 49:02.100\nI got a, the tracksuit was the final thing, I was like, I don't have an outfit, am I supposed\n\n49:02.100 --> 49:05.820\nto, the neighbors are going to see me with my dick coming out through my holy underwear\n\n49:05.820 --> 49:11.900\nand my asshole, they're going to see me in this weird, like, is that Depeche Mode exercising?\n\n49:11.900 --> 49:17.300\nIs there a, when we do raps, when you do kicky baby dance, that's like being on the\n\n49:17.300 --> 49:18.300\nelliptical.\n\n49:18.300 --> 49:20.780\nIt's certainly the exercise I currently get.\n\n49:20.780 --> 49:21.780\nYeah.\n\n49:21.780 --> 49:22.780\nYeah.\n\n49:22.780 --> 49:26.700\nOr if I tell a story where I'm especially vexed by election results, after a little,\n\n49:26.700 --> 49:33.140\nI do this and then like 10 minutes later, you'll be talking and I'll be like, why don't,\n\n49:33.140 --> 49:38.420\nwhy don't my body thinks I was swimming, why don't Steve and Aaron and Spencer and I\n\n49:38.420 --> 49:44.540\nlike to start coming up with long, like 20 minute, kind of medium tempo rap beats, where\n\n49:44.540 --> 49:49.180\nyou have to do the kicky baby dance the whole time and then.\n\n49:49.180 --> 49:54.620\nI think if everyone was just chanting about how adorable you were, you would exercise.\n\n49:54.620 --> 49:55.780\nWhile I was exercising, yeah.\n\n49:55.780 --> 50:00.180\nIf everybody was like, if I woke up one morning and I was like, where's all the attention?\n\n50:00.180 --> 50:04.380\nAnd then I could hear it coming from downstairs and it was like, it was like a video game\n\n50:04.380 --> 50:09.660\nor a tutorial where I had to get on the elliptical in order to get the attention and I was like,\n\n50:09.660 --> 50:19.740\nit started coming in like an incremental clicker game, like that's how I collected cookies.\n\n50:19.740 --> 50:32.100\nIt's exercise time at Harmontown.\n\n50:32.100 --> 50:34.420\nWe want you alive.\n\n50:34.420 --> 50:43.180\nWhen you wake up in the morning and you need to move to, to, to, take your mama to the\n\n50:43.180 --> 50:44.180\nbasket.\n\n50:44.180 --> 50:45.180\nLike be the little feet kicking in the air.\n\n50:45.180 --> 50:52.180\nEvery bird is gonna go to the market soon, be, be, to, to, sign your mama in the order\n\n50:52.180 --> 50:53.180\nto do.\n\n50:53.180 --> 51:01.180\nI want to fuck your mama's butt, I want to do it in the rut.\n\n51:01.180 --> 51:02.180\nYeah.\n\n51:02.180 --> 51:07.180\nLittle upper, upper body spin.\n\n51:07.180 --> 51:11.180\nI just smelled his pits.\n\n51:11.180 --> 51:14.180\nHe's not gonna do that.\n\n51:14.180 --> 51:17.180\nShits came out of his own pits.\n\n51:17.180 --> 51:21.180\nHe hasn't taken a shower in a while.\n\n51:21.180 --> 51:25.180\nHis girlfriend went out of town for a while.\n\n51:25.180 --> 51:30.180\nHe's been playing Deus Ex for a while.\n\n51:30.180 --> 51:37.180\nThat game's pretty hard on the medium difficulty.\n\n51:37.180 --> 51:42.180\nNow knees up, knees in the air and knees in the air.\n\n51:42.180 --> 51:44.180\nNow elbows to the side.\n\n51:44.180 --> 51:46.180\nNow elbows nice and wide.\n\n51:46.180 --> 51:48.180\nNow knees up once again.\n\n51:48.180 --> 51:50.180\nCount to ten.\n\n51:50.180 --> 51:56.180\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n\n51:56.180 --> 51:58.180\nBut dance while you're counting.\n\n51:58.180 -->

52:13.180\nYeah.\n\n52:13.180 --> 52:17.180\nAll right.\n\n52:17.180 --> 52:24.180\nHit.\n\n52:24.180 --> 52:31.180\nWhat that song reminds me of is my own mortality.\n\n52:31.180 --> 52:33.180\nWe're all gonna die.\n\n52:33.180 --> 52:37.180\nI will make whatever I just burnt off back by,\n\n52:37.180 --> 52:41.180\nI'll just lick something back there.\n\n52:41.180 --> 52:44.180\nI have ways of scrounging for calories\n\n52:44.180 --> 52:46.180\nthat people don't even know about.\n\n52:46.180 --> 52:47.180\nI find truffles.\n\n52:47.180 --> 52:50.180\nI just find truffles.\n\n52:50.180 -->

--> 54:09.180\nIt takes a strong marketer to volunteer his tombstone space.\n\n54:09.180 --> 54:11.180\nI'll just be vaporized into the ground.\n\n54:11.180 --> 54:13.180\nI'm not going to have the benefit of a tombstone.\n\n54:13.180 --> 54:14.180\nAnyways.\n\n54:14.180 --> 54:16.180\nPass the savings on to a larger tombstone.\n\n54:16.180 --> 54:17.180\nYeah.\n\n54:17.180 --> 54:18.180\nThere you go.\n\n54:18.180 --> 54:19.180\nI'm not even going to die.\n\n54:19.180 --> 54:22.180\nI'm just going to get lost like an elf in Middle Earth.\n\n54:22.180 --> 54:25.180\nBut I still want that fucking big ass tombstone.\n\n54:25.180 --> 54:26.180\nYeah.\n\n54:26.180 --> 54:27.180\nThere you go.\n\n54:27.180 --> 54:30.180\nSo the first project we ever did together was something called the Rick and Morty Ricks\n\n54:30.180 --> 54:31.180\nDiverse.\n\n54:31.180 --> 54:32.180\nHas anybody ever heard of that?\n\n54:32.180 --> 54:36.180\nInstagram account that you can waste a lot of time on.\n\n54:36.180 --> 54:42.180\nAnd we actually won an award for it from Cannes Lions from Cannes France.\n\n54:42.180 --> 54:43.180\nIt's an international award.\n\n54:43.180 --> 54:44.180\nSo it's not.\n\n54:44.180 --> 54:45.180\nIt's not an Emmy.\n\n54:45.180 --> 54:47.180\nIt's not the Emmy you're getting yet.\n\n54:47.180 --> 54:50.180\nBut we have a Cannes Lion for you.\n\n54:50.180 --> 54:51.180\nThis is your award.\n\n54:51.180 --> 54:52.180\nA Cannes Lion.\n\n54:52.180 --> 54:55.180\nThis is for you and Justin and for everybody at Starburns.\n\n54:55.180 --> 54:57.180\nIt's working on Rick and Morty really hard.\n\n54:57.180 --> 55:02.180\nIt's like I said, it's not an Emmy, but it's heavy as hell and it's made out of real bronze.\n\n55:02.180 --> 55:05.180\nYou were saying it's like the Academy Awards for advertising, right?\n\n55:05.180 --> 55:06.180\nYeah.\n\n55:06.180 --> 55:07.180\nAs lame as that sounds.\n\n55:07.180 --> 55:09.180\nBut it's still a big deal.\n\n55:09.180 --> 55:10.180\nJesus.\n\n55:10.180 --> 55:13.180\nLook at that.\n\n55:13.180 --> 55:18.180\nBut why do I get one?\n\n55:18.180 --> 55:19.180\nI didn't do the commercials.\n\n55:19.180 --> 55:21.180\nWell, I mean, you had to approve everything.\n\n55:21.180 --> 55:26.180\nYou can get an award for approving things?\n\n55:26.180 --> 55:28.180\nYou're part of the team.\n\n55:28.180 --> 55:32.180\nI remember at Comic Con a couple of years ago, you gave extensive notes.\n\n55:32.180 --> 55:35.180\nI gave no extensive notes of that thing.\n\n55:35.180 --> 55:36.180\nThese guys had it unlocked, man.\n\n55:36.180 --> 55:38.180\nI don't deserve this.\n\n55:38.180 --> 55:44.180\nI'm going to give this to clinically tall people.\n\n55:44.180 --> 55:46.180\nAccept your award with grace.\n\n55:46.180 --> 55:47.180\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n55:47.180 --> 55:48.180\nI didn't.\n\n55:48.180 --> 55:49.180\nOkay.\n\n55:49.180 --> 55:50.180\nAll right.\n\n55:50.180 --> 55:51.180\nThat was my Wisconsin thing.\n\n55:51.180 --> 55:52.180\nYeah.\n\n55:52.180 --> 55:54.180\nYou shouldn't deflect a compliment, but at the same time, I just want to.\n\n55:54.180 --> 55:55.180\nYeah.\n\n55:55.180 --> 55:56.180\nThank you so much.\n\n55:56.180 --> 55:58.180\nThis is so nice that you would think of me and give this to me.\n\n55:58.180 --> 55:59.180\nThank you.\n\n55:59.180 --> 56:01.180\nI'm just saying the system is fucked.\n\n56:01.180 --> 56:03.180\nWell, yeah.\n\n56:03.180 --> 56:06.180\nBut I mean, it is through you that we can do things like this,\n\n56:06.180 --> 56:10.180\nbecause any other show creator be like, I don't care about any of this.\n\n56:10.180 --> 56:12.180\nBut like, it was because you guys and because you're passionate,\n\n56:12.180 --> 56:13.180\nwe get to keep doing it.\n\n56:13.180 --> 56:16.180\nWe've done two different expansions for it.\n\n56:16.180 --> 56:17.180\nThere might be some more coming up.\n\n56:17.180 --> 56:19.180\nWe can't technically say, but.\n\n56:19.180 --> 56:20.180\nSounds like there are more.\n\n56:20.180 --> 56:21.180\nThere's stuff coming up.\n\n56:21.180 --> 56:22.180\nSo I mean.\n\n56:22.180 --> 56:23.180\nThere's more.\n\n56:23.180 --> 56:25.180\nAnd when is season three coming out?\n\n56:25.180 --> 56:26.180\nWhat's going on?\n\n56:26.180 --> 56:27.180\nI was going to ask you to say.\n\n56:27.180 --> 56:29.180\nOh, shit.\n\n56:29.180 --> 56:31.180\nIt seems to be taking a while.\n\n56:31.180 --> 56:32.180\nIt's just drawings.\n\n56:32.180 --> 56:34.180\nI think you can.\n\n56:34.180 --> 56:36.180\nWhy do you keep making Facebook posts?\n\n56:36.180 --> 56:37.180\nJust make season three.\n\n56:37.180 --> 56:38.180\nYeah.\n\n56:38.180 --> 56:39.180\nYeah.\n\n56:39.180 --> 56:41.180\nI'm tweeting like, oh, yeah, we elected a Nazi.\n\n56:41.180 --> 56:42.180\nHey, just shut up.\n\n56:42.180 --> 56:43.180\nGet back to work on season three.\n\n56:43.180 --> 56:45.180\nThey're drawing it.\n\n56:45.180 --> 56:47.180\nI don't draw it.\n\n56:47.180 --> 56:51.180\nWhy don't you just start approving things faster, Dan?\n\n56:51.180 --> 56:55.180\nMaybe that is my approval usually gets on the way.\n\n56:55.180 --> 56:58.180\nIt took stealth approval to finally make me nail it.\n\n56:58.180 --> 57:04.180\nI should just let people do what they were already doing.\n\n57:04.180 --> 57:06.180\nIt's real fun to kiss.\n\n57:06.180 --> 57:10.180\nI can say that.\n\n57:10.180 --> 57:12.180\nIt's not a Clio, but.\n\n57:12.180 --> 57:13.180\nOh, it's better than a Clio.\n\n57:13.180 --> 57:14.180\nIt's so much.\n\n57:14.180 --> 57:15.180\nThis is international, man.\n\n57:15.180 --> 57:16.180\nYeah, yeah.\n\n57:16.180 --> 57:17.180\nThat's like more than one country.\n\n57:17.180 --> 57:18.180\nYep.\n\n57:18.180 --> 57:21.180\nIt's like a beautiful, sexy, sleepy lion.\n\n57:21.180 --> 57:22.180\nWhat is it about?\n\n57:22.180 --> 57:24.180\nLike, like, like, what's your what?\n\n57:24.180 --> 57:29.680\nI talked to a lot of marketing people and at the risk of offending any of the ones that\n\n57:29.680 --> 57:34.180\nhave worked with me on anything, like, because I don't talk to a lot of good ones.\n\n57:34.180 --> 57:39.180\nLike, you guys are clearly like, you're on your shit.\n\n57:39.180 --> 57:42.180\nLike, you're thinking about this stuff.\n\n57:42.180 --> 57:46.180\nAnd it's like, what is the, what do I want to ask here?\n\n57:46.180 --> 57:51.180\nSo I want to ask a question that the answer can get through to like young people that\n\n57:51.180 --> 57:55.180\nwant to go into marketing or young people that shouldn't go into marketing who should\n\n57:55.180 --> 57:57.180\nhear it and go, oh, that's not me.\n\n57:57.180 --> 58:00.180\nI should be a cowboy.\n\n58:00.180 --> 58:01.180\nWhat is it?\n\n58:01.180 --> 58:06.180\nWhat is the, at its highest art, you know, like, what is the, there's something fancy\n\n58:06.180 --> 58:12.180\nto say about, you know, like the guy in chariots of fire goes, when I run, I feel God's pleasure.\n\n58:12.180 --> 58:14.180\nSo you can't use that.\n\n58:14.180 --> 58:15.180\nWhat is it about marketing?\n\n58:15.180 --> 58:16.180\nWhat is it?\n\n58:16.180 --> 58:18.180\nI don't know what I'm trying to ask.\n\n58:18.180 --> 58:19.180\nJust say something.\n\n58:19.180 --> 58:20.180\n9-11.\n\n58:20.180 --> 58:21.180\nNo, it's not.\n\n58:21.180 --> 58:22.180\nOkay.\n\n58:22.180 --> 58:24.180\nI thought that was about 10% 9-11.\n\n58:24.180 --> 58:25.180\nThat's right.\n\n58:25.180 --> 58:27.180\nEverything is, let's face it.\n\n58:27.180 --> 58:32.180\nNo, but like, I don't know, you're just kind of take over for me.\n\n58:32.180 --> 58:33.180\nDo good.\n\n58:33.180 --> 58:37.180\nI mean, it's, this is kind of a hard question to answer for this specific thing.\n\n58:37.180 --> 58:40.180\nWhat Dan's asking you guys is to market marketing.\n\n58:40.180 --> 58:41.180\nYeah.\n\n58:41.180 --> 58:43.180\nSell us on being in marketing.\n\n58:43.180 --> 58:45.180\nGotta think outside the box.\n\n58:45.180 --> 58:49.180\nI mean, well something like this, it's hard for me to even say it because it's for something\n\n58:49.180 --> 58:53.180\nso specific like Rick and Morty that we were all passionate about and huge fans of before\n\n58:53.180 --> 58:56.180\nwe were even like twinkles and adult swims eye.\n\n58:56.180 --> 58:57.180\nYou know what I mean?\n\n58:57.180 --> 58:59.180\nI was such a, just a huge fan of everything.\n\n58:59.180 --> 59:02.180\nAnd just, you know, I remember my buddy of mine running into my door room and talking\n\n59:02.180 --> 59:03.180\nabout, you got to see this thing.\n\n59:03.180 --> 59:06.180\nAnd it was Heat Vision and Jack and like all this other channel 101 stuff.\n\n59:06.180 --> 59:11.180\nSo it's just the fact that I'm able to work on something that, that I love so much.\n\n59:11.180 --> 59:12.180\nThat's part of it.\n\n59:12.180 --> 59:15.180\nSo you're not always be able to get to work on something that you love.\n\n59:15.180 --> 59:19.180\nLike I have to work on a lot of like Facebook ads for credit cards to get to Rick and Morty.\n\n59:19.180 --> 59:23.180\nSo I guess what I could say is like one part of it is giving a shit.\n\n59:23.180 --> 59:28.180\nAnd then part of it is like working your way towards, you can get to something that you\n\n59:28.180 --> 59:31.180\njust love and you're able to work on it because you're not going to get it right away.\n\n59:31.180 --> 59:32.180\nYou might not get it for a long time.\n\n59:32.180 --> 59:33.180\nIt took me a long time.\n\n59:33.180 --> 59:35.180\nUnlike Claire, who we hired just for the Rick's first.\n\n59:35.180 --> 59:38.180\nSo this was her, her first job out of school.\n\n59:38.180 --> 59:40.180\nI'm a brat.\n\n59:40.180 --> 59:41.180\nSorry.\n\n59:41.180 --> 59:44.180\nClaire, was it your pitch or did you pitch using Instagram that way?\n\n59:44.180 --> 59:45.180\nOh, 100%.\n\n59:45.180 --> 59:46.180\nIt was on me.\n\n59:46.180 --> 59:50.180\nIt was like 10,000% a team effort.\n\n59:50.180 --> 59:55.180\nAnd I actually, at the very beginning, wasn't even brought on until like halfway through\n\n59:55.180 --> 01:00:00.180\nproduction when we realized like, oh shit, we still have a lot to do and this is launching\n\n01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.180\nin a month or whatever.\n\n01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.180\nCarrot tells all their female employees to say that.\n\n01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.180\nIt was her idea.\n\n01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:07.180\nShe's, she's being a team player.\n\n01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:13.180\nAnthony and Claire, you came at a pretty propitious moment because speaking of marketing, Dan and\n\n01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:17.180\nI are marketing a whole new line of workout tapes.\n\n01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.180\nIt's called the baby kicky dance.\n\n01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.180\nYou guys got to get up there and do it.\n\n01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.180\nOne, two, three.\n\n01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.180\nAnd a one, two, three.\n\n01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.180\nI don't, I don't understand.\n\n01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.180\nWell first, you lift your award up to the sky.\n\n01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.180\nYou raise it up with your right hand high.\n\n01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.180\nThen you go down to the left side, lift it up on the left side.\n\n01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.180\nPass that over.\n\n01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.180\nI can't, I don't think it's.\n\n01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:49.180\nDan, you're acting like you don't want to sell these workout tapes.\n\n01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.180\nI can't, I couldn't hear you.\n\n01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.180\nI was being hilarious.\n\n01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:59.180\nI think you were saying bend over and pick something up off the floor and exercise deal breaker.\n\n01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:05.180\nBecause I'm going to have another workout tape called learn how to listen.\n\n01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.180\nI can't hear.\n\n01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.180\nI'd learn how to hear.\n\n01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.180\nMy ears are dying along with the rest of my body.\n\n01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.180\nHow old are you guys?\n\n01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.180\nYou guys dying?\n\n01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.180\nDefinitely.\n\n01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.180\nCan you feel it in your brain?\n\n01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.180\nWe're all technically dying.\n\n01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.180\nAre you?\n\n01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.180\nTo quote Duncan Tressel, God is a murderer.\n\n01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.180\nBut are you, are you starting to forget actor's names?\n\n01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.180\nLike you're just trying to riff.\n\n01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.180\nYou're like, ah, and then you take 10 minutes to go.\n\n01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.180\nRay Don Chong.\n\n01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:40.180\nIt's more that I'll see things online or like bands and like Saturday Night Live,\n\n01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180\nbetter on Saturday Night Live.\n\n01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.180\nLike I don't know who that is.\n\n01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.180\nI don't care who that is.\n\n01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.180\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.180\nOkay.\n\n01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.180\nThat's emotionally dying.\n\n01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180\nYeah.\n\n01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.180\nWell, that's curmudgeonry.\n\n01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.180\nThat's that's those are the beginning stages where you're just like, oh, I already did this.\n\n01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.180\nThat was called in excess.\n\n01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.180\nAnd then you're like, like, like, I don't know.\n\n01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.180\nI already saw a Spiderman movie for God's sakes.\n\n01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.180\nBut then you slowly, then you start to go like, I don't even know what I'm doing.\n\n01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.180\nAnd then you go to a Marvel movie and you're like, that was great.\n\n01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.180\nAnd they're like, you already saw that.\n\n01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.180\nI wrote part of it.\n\n01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.180\nAnd I'm like me and Stan Lee are just like, all right, great.\n\n01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:16.180\nExcelsior.\n\n01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.180\nI'm acting like I'm just fine.\n\n01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.180\nI really did.\n\n01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.180\nBy the way, I really didn't.\n\n01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.180\nI really did not write it.\n\n01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.180\nPeople are tweeting me and going like,\n\n01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.180\nHe's being humble.\n\n01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.180\nHe wrote the whole thing.\n\n01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.180\nThere were parts that have felt like it was you.\n\n01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.180\nI know, but that's the thing.\n\n01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:34.180\nLike if you could think about anybody and I just really like I'm a writer and I don't\n\n01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.180\nknow, my worst name would be those, the people that worked hard on that movie,\n\n01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:40.180\nthe writers of the hearing that they, like, I did not.\n\n01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.180\nThere's like a couple of words Tilda Swinton says when she's showing him the\n\n01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.180\nmirror dimension or something that I think accidentally got in there from like a\n\n01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.180\nbad version of a scene.\n\n01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.180\nI wrote, like, I didn't, I didn't, I just talked to them about, about portals\n\n01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.180\nand stuff for a little bit.\n\n01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.180\nBut let me ask you this.\n\n01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.180\nLet me.\n\n01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.180\nAnd they already shot like most of the movie when I talked to them about portals.\n\n01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.180\nSo I'm not even saying I gave them the idea for portals.\n\n01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.180\nI'm saying like, I was just like, yeah, portals are neat.\n\n01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.180\nAnd they're like, yeah, they're like holes.\n\n01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.180\nBut doors.\n\n01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.180\nAnd I was like, yeah, you got it.\n\n01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:10.180\nSo let me ask you this because it's something that I'm sort of on the other side\n\n01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.180\nnow for once because of this project.\n\n01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.180\nLike the fact that you got to touch the Doctor Strange movie, you got to say\n\n01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.180\nthings that, write things that Tilda Swinton said.\n\n01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.180\nLike, does that still make you feel something inside?\n\n01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.180\nMore than ever.\n\n01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.180\nI mean, especially the more, I think the longer you've worked.\n\n01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.180\nI guess maybe you get desensitized if you, if you, if you wrote for, I don't know,\n\n01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.180\nlike, I don't know if you were like super duper, I guess if you were Josh Whedon\n\n01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:36.180\nand then somebody was like, hey, Bob Denver from Gilligan's Island wants you to\n\n01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.180\nwrite a commercial for him.\n\n01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.180\nAnd I guess maybe you wouldn't be less than Starstruck.\n\n01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.180\nNo offense to a probably dead, Bob Denver.\n\n01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.180\nBut I just, I, but, but, but there's no way.\n\n01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:52.180\nLike at 43, it was like, it was more like, it was like in those biopics when the,\n\n01:03:52.180 --> 01:04:00.180\nwhen like that, the shitty, like, you know, like weird character that can't get a break\n\n01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:04.180\nor that like spends his life like saying, we should grow a corn on the moon or\n\n01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:08.180\nsomething like, and then it's like, it was like a, it was like a triumph.\n\n01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.180\nIt was great.\n\n01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.180\nCause it was like, yeah, no, I don't even know how to, yeah, of course it was amazing.\n\n01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.180\nCause that's the thought of it was, I mean, that's what this was to me.\n\n01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.180\nThe fact that I was able to sort of touch Rick and Morty, be able to write in this\n\n01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.180\nvoice and be able to write these comics to be able to name like an alien.\n\n01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.180\nI'm like, Hey, does this alien have a name?\n\n01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.180\nNo.\n\n01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.180\nCan we call it this?\n\n01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.180\nSure.\n\n01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.180\nLike I got to name the alien.\n\n01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.180\nLike something like that as somebody who like, not just as like a person, but a\n\n01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.180\ncreative person because I started advertising.\n\n01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.180\nDid you approve that name?\n\n01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.180\nI, somebody did.\n\n01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.180\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.180\nThat's really noteworthy.\n\n01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.180\nLike that, that stuff, all that stuff in that Rick's diverse, all of the stuff.\n\n01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.180\nAnd I assume that they generally are using you guys for all of the stuff that I'm\n\n01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.180\nalways noticing.\n\n01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.180\nI'm going like, wait, some, some person like just, they just made that up, but it\n\n01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.180\nkind of falls in line with, with everything.\n\n01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:58.180\nLike it never violates the, it's not about violating the cannon as much as it is\n\n01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.180\nviolating the.\n\n01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.180\nViolate that cannon.\n\n01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:09.180\nMarketing, marketing.\n\n01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:14.180\nThat cannon, that cannon does the violating.\n\n01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:19.180\nIt, it, it's, it's, it's violating that though the worry would be violating the\n\n01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:24.180\ntone, the, the, the tonal IQ or something like that.\n\n01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.180\nLike, oh, this isn't worthy of, you know, it's like, oh, this is like a hacky joke.\n\n01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.180\nLike someone's just connecting a dot because, oh, that guy's a pencil vester.\n\n01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.180\nSo of course they made Penn Stephanie or something like that, where you're just\n\n01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.180\nlike, well, that's not the, no, just don't, don't do that.\n\n01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.180\nLike, like,\n\n01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.180\nWe keep to the code.\n\n01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.180\nWhat's that?\n\n01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.180\nWe keep to the code.\n\n01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.180\nYeah.\n\n01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.180\nLike, and that's, that's not easy when the code isn't just linear dot connection,\n\n01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.180\nyou know, when it's not like, oh, now you play.\n\n01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.180\nLike it's like collaboration.\n\n01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.180\nYou guys like fill in with, you're just, you're, you're keeping with the actual\n\n01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.180\nlike tone of the, yeah, it's very impressive.\n\n01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.180\nThat shouldn't be, that shouldn't be overlooked.\n\n01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.180\nAnd obviously some French people didn't overlook it.\n\n01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.180\nClaire and Anthony, Anthony, right?\n\n01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.180\nYes.\n\n01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.180\nWhat's like, can you give us like, is there any like dirty underbelly of marketing,\n\n01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.180\nlike kind of mad men stuff that goes on?\n\n01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.180\nLike what, what, what goes on in marketing?\n\n01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.180\nWell, specifically for the can line, it's always a big deal because it's the\n\n01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:19.180\ninternational stage that there's just, it started, people show their true colors.\n\n01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:22.180\nThere's a woman out there called Cindy Gallup that you should follow because\n\n01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.180\nshe's like, I don't know what she's specifically done, but she's like the,\n\n01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.180\nlike badass woman in the advertising industry.\n\n01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.180\nAnd she's exposing people.\n\n01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.180\nSo like with the can lines, there's a number of different awards.\n\n01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.180\nA lot of it, cause we won for the entertainment lines, which is pretty cool\n\n01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.180\ncause it's all like entertainment.\n\n01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.180\nThat's what everybody's all excited about.\n\n01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.180\nBut I mean, everything, billboards, print ads, email marketing,\n\n01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.180\nthey all have lions categories.\n\n01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:46.180\nAnd especially like the print ads, there's always, there's like ways to get in it.\n\n01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.180\nThere's, you know, all you gotta do is you gotta run your ad one time in one\n\n01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:55.180\nrandom magazine and one random country in order for it to be approved.\n\n01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.180\nAnd you can qualify for a line.\n\n01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.180\nAnd then some of these things win because it's always like crazy provocative stuff.\n\n01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:04.180\nAnd there was one for some headache brand.\n\n01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.180\nIt was for like their PM product.\n\n01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.180\nAnd I can't, I'm paraphrasing here, but essentially the concept was,\n\n01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.180\ngive your wife this drowsy making headache product,\n\n01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.180\nand then you can have sex with her while she's passed out.\n\n01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.180\nAnd they gave that an award.\n\n01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.180\nI think I remember that.\n\n01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.180\nI think it was a Jella Pudding Pops commercial.\n\n01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.180\nRight.\n\n01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:29.180\nSo, so that got like all these people that are like, oh, that's funny.\n\n01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.180\nCheck it off, check it off.\n\n01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.180\nAnd so it's one thing that they're like, the judges aren't necessarily looking\n\n01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.180\nto like, well, is this real?\n\n01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.180\nWhere did this run?\n\n01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.180\nIs this, was this actually approved?\n\n01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.180\nIt's just those be like, and then they're right off.\n\n01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.180\nSo not only is it offensive that one, this fake thing won an award,\n\n01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.180\nbut it's also in a way it's offensive that these guys just sort of looked\n\n01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:51.180\nat the, the, the creative concept, which was rape.\n\n01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.180\nAnd they're like, yep.\n\n01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.180\nAnd then just checked it off.\n\n01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:57.180\nSo I mean, and what Cindy's doing and like just pointing people out,\n\n01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.180\nputting everybody to task, putting me to task, any male in advertising the task\n\n01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.180\nas we rightfully should be, especially now, it's just like, hey, this is kind\n\n01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.180\nof fucked up that we think this is funny.\n\n01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.180\nSo there's things like that.\n\n01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.180\nThere was another one that was like a fake app.\n\n01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.180\nIt was this, it was in this, one of the same categories\n\n01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.180\nthat the Rick's first was also up for, which we didn't win,\n\n01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:20.180\nbut this fake app won because it was, it was pulling cashed images of Google Earth\n\n01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.180\nin like the metagradian sea.\n\n01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.180\nIt's like, oh, you can spot refugees.\n\n01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.180\nAnd if you spot one, press a spot and then we'll let somebody know about it.\n\n01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.180\nBut it was fake.\n\n01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.180\nLike it didn't work.\n\n01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:32.180\nThey launched it like a week before the ads actually went up\n\n01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.180\nand the actual app didn't even work.\n\n01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.180\nSad. What was it, was it Levi's or what was the?\n\n01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.180\nI think it was actually a charity.\n\n01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:47.180\nOh, so it was actually just a, it wasn't even like, oh, this was a well intended,\n\n01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.180\nbut it'll concede like ad for Snickers bar.\n\n01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.180\nI don't think they put their name on it.\n\n01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.180\nIt was just like con artistry.\n\n01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:01.180\nYeah, I mean, it's, well, yeah, I've always felt like I'm not qualified\n\n01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:05.180\nto actually say this, but I've always, always had the suspicion\n\n01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.180\nuntil we went to white nationalism with this last election.\n\n01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.180\nLike I always had the suspicion that, that we had our thing going on over here\n\n01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:15.180\nthat we were like the Las Vegas of Earth, that we got this open book,\n\n01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:20.180\nthat we are dwelling among the, the legacy of the promises we made\n\n01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.180\nand dealing with the fallout with our free press and our, and, you know,\n\n01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:28.180\nhaving invented television and then inventing the culture that was based on it,\n\n01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:32.180\nhaving diverted from monarchy and any preexisting class system\n\n01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:37.180\ninto a pure like crazy ass, well intended, but totally fucking like\n\n01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:42.180\nout of control capitalistic class system that, that, that we were over here\n\n01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.180\nkind of like working all this shit out and everybody in Europe is like,\n\n01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.180\nlike holding their pinky out when they drink their tea and going like,\n\n01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.180\nyeah, well, fuck those guys.\n\n01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:56.180\nSo racist, so sexist, so out of control, so stupid, such gun nuts, all this stuff.\n\n01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:00.180\nBut that then every once in a while on Facebook, you see this thing that's like,\n\n01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:04.180\nlook at this detergent ad that this country just did.\n\n01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.180\nAnd it's like a woman puts a Chinese guy in a washing machine\n\n01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.180\nand because she uses their detergent, he comes out as a big black guy\n\n01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.180\nand fucks her brains out.\n\n01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.180\nAnd that won an award and won that same, not the exact same award,\n\n01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.180\nbut they have a very similar statue.\n\n01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.180\nAnd it's kind of like, like, like, and then you, and then you saw,\n\n01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.180\nI also saw, because I clicked on that thing and I was like, oh wait,\n\n01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:24.180\nand it was also a derivation of a different version of the same ad\n\n01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:27.180\nwhere it was also kind of like slight racial components\n\n01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.180\ncompared to like how color is good, protect your color.\n\n01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.180\nAnyways, like, I, it's like, like, I think, I think a lot of shit over there\n\n01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.180\nis like in the catacombs and like, like, like not bubbled up yet,\n\n01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.180\nlike, like that they're not ready at all.\n\n01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.180\nAnd now, now I'm just in a full blown panic because it's like, I thought,\n\n01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:45.180\nmy, my consolation was always that we were, we were the clumsy nutcases\n\n01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:51.180\nthat we came over here, like, to this weird, like, witch burning colony\n\n01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.180\nwhere we were like, let's work that out.\n\n01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.180\nAnd then we're like, oh, people in Africa look different.\n\n01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.180\nLet's work that out.\n\n01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.180\nAnd I was like, oh, let's build it.\n\n01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.180\nIt's like everything we ever did was just like foot and mouth,\n\n01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.180\nhead up ass, like, like burning both the candles of being a jackass\n\n01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.180\nat both ends.\n\n01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.180\nAnd like, while everyone watched and was like, we know how to do it better\n\n01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:16.180\nbecause we still have a crown in a case somewhere in a museum.\n\n01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.180\nBut now I'm just, now I'm just fucking terrified.\n\n01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.180\nBecause obviously we were, that wasn't the story.\n\n01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.180\nThat's not what was happening.\n\n01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:26.180\nWe were, we, we, we, we, we for 200 years, all we did was just rebuild\n\n01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:30.180\nour own little ad hoc kind of fucking, like, little, like fucking,\n\n01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.180\nshitty little petitions.\n\n01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.180\nWell, congratulations on the award.\n\n01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.180\nYeah.\n\n01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.180\nI mean, as frivolous as all this.\n\n01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.180\nThat was the weirdest acceptance speech I've ever heard.\n\n01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.180\nHe never thanked you.\n\n01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:51.180\nIf you were hired to sell America, but your demographic was not Trump supporters.\n\n01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:55.180\nHe figured out how to sell America to, you know, a certain kind of customer.\n\n01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.180\nAnd it turned out that was the strategy that worked with the electoral system\n\n01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.180\nand blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:05.180\nIf you were, if your job was just to sell our country post-election,\n\n01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:08.180\nlike, you know, like Chipotle probably had somebody come in.\n\n01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.180\nAnother quality.\n\n01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.180\nOkay.\n\n01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.180\nAnd that guy said, you need to focus on, on salsa.\n\n01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.180\nYeah.\n\n01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.180\nAny ideas that have to put you on the spot?\n\n01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.180\nLike, where would you start?\n\n01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:23.180\nYou'd like, you gotta, so who, who are we selling America to?\n\n01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.180\nWe're selling it.\n\n01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.180\nSo let's say Martians.\n\n01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.180\nLike, I don't know.\n\n01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.180\nLike, like, but, but they can distinguish between countries.\n\n01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.180\nThey're going like, we're going to, we're going to destroy earth,\n\n01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.180\nbut we're going to leave one country left.\n\n01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.180\nLet's try that.\n\n01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:39.180\nLike, like, like, they're like, show me what you got.\n\n01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:47.180\nThe Martians, the Martians are going, there's 250 countries.\n\n01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.180\nAll right.\n\n01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.180\nYou guys, you guys fucked up.\n\n01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.180\nLike, Mars is like, we have, I guess we have less oceans because we just started speaking\n\n01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.180\nMartian.\n\n01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.180\nAnd so, like, we, you guys need to clean this.\n\n01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:05.180\nSo, so your, your job, America sent you as the marketing guy to the up fronts.\n\n01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:10.180\nSo the first thing, um, we're probably in, in competition with, let's say the bigger\n\n01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.180\ncountries, nothing against like all these, like, nothing against Denmark.\n\n01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.180\nNothing against Malta.\n\n01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.180\nWe're, yeah, they're not going to offer anything to Mars.\n\n01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.180\nIt's going to be us, China and Russia.\n\n01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.180\nWhat do we got?\n\n01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:21.180\nUh, we got some pretty kick ass mountain.\n\n01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.180\nIt also depends on what they're going to be using America for.\n\n01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.180\nLike, we've got some pretty, we've got some halfway decent infrastructure.\n\n01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:30.180\nLike the internet sucks balls, but other than that, like we've got some pretty.\n\n01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.180\nShow me what you got.\n\n01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.180\nHigh waves.\n\n01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.180\nSome pretty solid highways.\n\n01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.180\nAll right.\n\n01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.180\nUm, pretty solid.\n\n01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.180\nWe all have that.\n\n01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:40.180\nThat's how it would.\n\n01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:44.180\nI would have started with, I would have started with jazz and rock and roll and shit like that.\n\n01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.180\nWell, that's the other things we have to know before we can sell America.\n\n01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.180\nWe got to know about the Martians.\n\n01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.180\nWhat are they looking for?\n\n01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.180\nAre they looking for like pure natural resources?\n\n01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.180\nWell, I got a shitload of oil in Texas this weekend.\n\n01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.180\nDo you hear about that?\n\n01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.180\nDid you hear about that?\n\n01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.180\nThey shouldn't.\n\n01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.180\nI can't believe they didn't start looking for it there.\n\n01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.180\nThat's where I go for all my oil.\n\n01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.180\nThey're probably post oil at this point.\n\n01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.180\nUh, I, well, I did think, yeah, you're right.\n\n01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.180\nI didn't specify, but I think it's interesting that you, that was a tech attack that I didn't\n\n01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.180\neven think about it.\n\n01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.180\nFirst of all, you, you're very practically intact.\n\n01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:16.180\nI'm the first thing you did is sweep 273 nations off the table.\n\n01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.180\nThis is my country too.\n\n01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.180\nYou know, I got it.\n\n01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.180\nYeah.\n\n01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.180\nHe, he, he I had a lot of teeth.\n\n01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.180\nLuckily you guys can see that he's saying Denmark right off the bats.\n\n01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:29.180\nEverybody but China and Russia to go fuck themselves.\n\n01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.180\nThat's very smart.\n\n01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.180\nNow it's a three person race.\n\n01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.180\nThis is my 2020 bit starting right now.\n\n01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.180\nUh,\n\n01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:44.780\nClare, how would you go about pitching America under a Trump presidency to an alien race?\n\n01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.780\nOh, Jesus.\n\n01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:49.060\nWell, can I first, I'll give you time to think while I refine, because I think that's a good\n\n01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:55.620\nquestion to ask me, and it's like, the Martians, the Martians, no, no, no, I mean, his question\n\n01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.820\nto me about refining the question, I'm not hijacking your question.\n\n01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.740\nYou guys love to watch me be a bad person, and you're just like, he's being a bad person,\n\n01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:10.660\nit's like you're projecting it a little bit, I'm a bad host, but I'm not a bad person.\n\n01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:15.940\nI'm helping her by saying like, okay, here's what the Martians, I'll answer that, here's\n\n01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.340\nwhat the Martians are looking for.\n\n01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:28.060\nThe Martians are looking for, they want to, they want Earth to, they want it to, they\n\n01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.020\nwant to plug and play, they want to like walk away from it, they want to, they're going to\n\n01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:37.100\nuse their bombs, or what a Martian raised, to wipe out all but one country, thinking\n\n01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:42.860\nthat that country will then be the only country on this place called Earth.\n\n01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:47.380\nAnd their goal is, they're looking for the country that represents the best of what the\n\n01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:53.500\nhuman species has to offer, intergalactically, there, take it.\n\n01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.020\nSo I would definitely take them in and out first.\n\n01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:00.260\nOh, there you go, yeah, take them out to a nice lunch, show them a burger.\n\n01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.260\nExactly.\n\n01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.260\nThere you are.\n\n01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:07.620\nI mean, if we're looking at like, if they want to keep, say, Earth is going to be like\n\n01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.460\nthis sort of zoo, not zoo, that's going to be awful, that's going to be an awful way\n\n01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:12.460\nto get into it.\n\n01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.420\nNo, it's not going to be a zoo, it's going to have to, it's going to have to trade with\n\n01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.420\nthem.\n\n01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.620\nI mean, so they're looking for a collaborator, otherwise they just blow us up and put like\n\n01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:22.700\na, they put a Martian in and out there, but they, they're saying like, well, you guys\n\n01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:28.500\nare, you're blocked, you're arguing with each other, you can't agree, you've got some\n\n01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.140\npeople thinking that you should put a tarp on your, on the female half, and you've got\n\n01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.740\nother people thinking that cars are more important than bullets, and bullets are more important\n\n01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:36.740\nthan feet.\n\n01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:41.140\nLike, like, you can't figure out your value system, you don't have any kind of, you need\n\n01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.540\nto get into the Star Trek mode of like, each planet has a gimmick, each gimmick is like,\n\n01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:50.740\nwe like war, we like logic, we like the color green, like, like all we're hearing when we\n\n01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.660\nlisten to Earth is a bunch of static, we're looking for the country that's going to like,\n\n01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:58.780\nyou know, next, we're going to, we're going to blow everybody else up, let the one country\n\n01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:04.660\nrepopulate so that it's like their language, their culture, their, you know, their history\n\n01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.420\nwill become, you know, their, their curation of the previous history before everyone got\n\n01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.660\nblown up, like all of that shit, next time we come back around, those people, that country\n\n01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:16.180\nwill be the planet, and so who's it going to be?\n\n01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.460\nWhy should it be America?\n\n01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:21.820\nI think it's because we have the raw tools to do it.\n\n01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.300\nIf you look at America compared to everybody else, and I know considering this election\n\n01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.220\nwas one because of like, from the help of a white nationalist movement, I think of what\n\n01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:35.420\nsets America great is our capacity for diversity, that we can like point at, I know, but we\n\n01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.580\ncan point, we can point at, yes.\n\n01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:43.420\nIf the aliens were going to have like, dinner party meetings with every nation, who would\n\n01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:44.420\nyou invite?\n\n01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.220\nWhat Americans would you be like, oh, I'm going to have these celebrities, and we're\n\n01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.060\ngoing to serve this, and the music's going to be this.\n\n01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.060\nYou know what you do?\n\n01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.060\nYou just have the aliens.\n\n01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.580\nThis is when I would punt to my producer.\n\n01:17:54.580 --> 01:18:00.300\nIf you're me, you just say, aliens, we're going to have, we're going to sit down, we're\n\n01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:07.700\nall going to go to Dentana's, and you're going to meet, you're going to meet Aerosmith,\n\n01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.820\nand they're just going to tell you some fucking awesome rock and roll stories, and then you\n\n01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:17.260\nget them real high, and then you steal their resources.\n\n01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:23.220\nWell, I guess if it's just like a face-to-face meeting, I would probably hire more character\n\n01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.220\nactors than anything.\n\n01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.700\nWho's the guy with the big mustache from the big old-\n\n01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.540\nDennis Farina.\n\n01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.540\nSam Elliott.\n\n01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.540\nSam Elliott?\n\n01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.540\nYeah.\n\n01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:37.940\nI wonder what a commercial by Sam Elliott for Earth would sound like.\n\n01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.660\nI'm Sam Elliott for Earth.\n\n01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.620\nIt's not what's for dinner.\n\n01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:57.180\nWe're not a steak, we're a planet, but America is the potatoes on that plate, because marketing\n\n01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:09.220\nresearch has proved that you eat the potato first, and then Sam Elliott just stabs everybody.\n\n01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:13.980\nI would say to them, I guess, given my criteria, I would say, but you would do it as Rosie\n\n01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:14.980\nPerez.\n\n01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:23.740\nI would say to them, well, look, we've been trying to do what you're talking about for\n\n01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:29.260\na long time, like blowing everybody else up and taking their place.\n\n01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.420\nWe might not be the best candidate for the job, but at least we know what you're talking\n\n01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.260\nabout when you pitch it.\n\n01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:39.140\nYou pick China, you might come back, and they're just like, we love being China, and like half\n\n01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.060\nthe planet just sitting there, fucking go with America, man.\n\n01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:46.460\nHello, I'm Sam Elliott for America.\n\n01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.140\nOur Chinese food is better than China.\n\n01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:54.900\nThey eat any fucking thing over there.\n\n01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:59.060\nWe cold it down to the good stuff.\n\n01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.020\nAnd then he stabs everybody.\n\n01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:08.340\nThere's only one country in the planet Earth that has murder vans, and it ain't America.\n\n01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:14.060\nAlso, oh shit, look, it's Aerosmith.\n\n01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.260\nWe're the only country that has Aerosmith, so fuck everybody else.\n\n01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:21.540\nAll right, I think we should thank our marketing people from Carrot.\n\n01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:25.260\nWe'll cheap the award.\n\n01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.260\nThank you.\n\n01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.260\nThank you.\n\n01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.260\nCarrot Creative, everybody.\n\n01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.260\nClaire and Anthony.\n\n01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:38.260\nNow, Steve, is that why you came out to bring the Carrot people out?\n\n01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:41.700\nI didn't know how to get them out, but I was happy to be a part of this...\n\n01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:42.700\nSteve, you're staying.\n\n01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.700\nExercise conversation.\n\n01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:46.700\nCan you just stay up here?\n\n01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:53.260\nYou're like a little sleepy hoodie gnome right now.\n\n01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.860\nHarmon works Steve so hard.\n\n01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:00.020\nBecause Steve...\n\n01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:02.540\nThat he's constantly sleeping.\n\n01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:09.540\nThis Steve's job is to make it easier for me to do more things.\n\n01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:16.660\nSteve's job...\n\n01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.380\nOur crowd's funny as we are right now.\n\n01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.100\nI disagree with him completely.\n\n01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:27.780\nBased on that, I would have agreed with him five minutes ago, that Steve's job thing.\n\n01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.780\nYou should be able to let that over the plate.\n\n01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:30.780\nHave you guys...\n\n01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:33.780\nYou shouldn't get that excited about sounds.\n\n01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:34.780\nSorry.\n\n01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.780\nHave you guys been doing any role-playing?\n\n01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.940\nNo, not since Harmon Quest yesterday.\n\n01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:49.980\nBut on the show, on Harmontown, no, we have not done any shadow runs or any pathfinder\n\n01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.980\nin a long time.\n\n01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:52.980\nSorry.\n\n01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:56.900\nSince you're replacing Spencer, do you want to do a little DM for a second?\n\n01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:03.900\nDo you want to be our Dungeon Master?\n\n01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:08.900\nI mean, Aaron, I know that you try to shy away from game-playing.\n\n01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:14.740\nHe had to be passed out with a mustache on an ottoman.\n\n01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:19.420\nThat Lion Award, just the trophy, I'm not talking about the honor of receiving it.\n\n01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:24.500\nJust talking about the trophy itself.\n\n01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.860\nIt's not able to sit on anything.\n\n01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:31.660\nIt says to you, hang me on a wall or go fuck yourself.\n\n01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.660\nNow, that's good marketing.\n\n01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:34.660\nOh, really?\n\n01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.660\nDoes it?\n\n01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:43.660\nOh, it balances on the pause!\n\n01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:52.340\nDan, I'm so happy I was here for that breakthrough.\n\n01:22:52.340 --> 01:23:01.340\nI just love that the answer also is cute, that it's a lion, but then it's a little pause.\n\n01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:05.340\nDo you, Dan, or do you, Aaron, want to decide what kind of realm we're in, what kind of\n\n01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:06.340\ngame we're playing?\n\n01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.340\nThe Sharpie Quark?\n\n01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.340\nThrowback?\n\n01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.340\nSharpie Quark?\n\n01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.340\nThrowback.\n\n01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:15.460\nSteve will enter at some point.\n\n01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:29.620\nWe now take you to the old school of early days D&D slash Pathfinder.\n\n01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:35.060\nYou find yourself Sharpie and Quark.\n\n01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.060\nWe did it!\n\n01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.060\nWe found ourselves!\n\n01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.060\nWe found ourselves!\n\n01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:43.260\nIs there a last week, or is it, like, this is when Spencer would say what happened.\n\n01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.260\nDo you want to do a wrap-up?\n\n01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:56.260\nPreviously on Harmontown, Sharpie and Quark fought two giant hydras wearing hats.\n\n01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.620\nThe hats contained puzzles, and it took them a long time to complete the puzzles, but they\n\n01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:05.660\nsuccessfully completed those puzzles, and now they have found themselves in the shoot-a-cores\n\n01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.740\nrealm.\n\n01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:18.820\nThey, after walking down an incorrect door, have now found themselves in a wet room, surrounded\n\n01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.820\nby small objects.\n\n01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:27.140\nThis is Harmontown, or what did Spencer say this week on Heart, what is Lou?\n\n01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.140\nWell, he would, well...\n\n01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.140\nWhat would he do?\n\n01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.740\nHe would say, sometimes you'd say, last time on Harmon Time.\n\n01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:38.340\nOh yeah, last time on Harmon Time, but will they find themselves out of the wet room containing\n\n01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:46.100\nsmall figurines, each figurine detailed and odd.\n\n01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:49.180\nWhat secrets did the figurines contain?\n\n01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.100\nWho owed them previously?\n\n01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.980\nWhat are they worth?\n\n01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:59.580\nYou're kind of going from recap to wrap-up, which...\n\n01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:05.460\nIt sounds like, it sounds like we just had an adventure.\n\n01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:16.100\nNow you're going to say, you learned it from sleeping with me, because I always start sex\n\n01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.180\nby telling them how I had sex with them last time.\n\n01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:23.700\nYeah, and just apologizing.\n\n01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:27.380\nBut will you now, and then I go to sleep?\n\n01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:30.700\nHow many apologies constitute a relationship?\n\n01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.700\nOkay.\n\n01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.700\nYou're in a wet room with small figurines.\n\n01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.900\nWe're in the wet room, we're in the wet room, okay, you find yourselves in a wet room surrounded\n\n01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:37.900\nby figurines.\n\n01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:43.100\nAll right, Sharpie, I have detect magic, so I detect magic on the figurines.\n\n01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.700\nYou do that.\n\n01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:52.780\nYou see there are two figurines on the far right side of the square room that are shaped\n\n01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:59.260\nlike clowns, and you detect magic on them.\n\n01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.740\nDo I detect good magic or evil magic on these?\n\n01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.020\nLet me roll.\n\n01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.500\nYou don't know, you just know there's magic.\n\n01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:12.660\nAll right, I take one of the figurine clowns in my hand and I toss the other one to Sharpie.\n\n01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.660\nThat happens.\n\n01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:23.220\nAll right, I walk toward him and I hold my clown figurine towards his clown figurine,\n\n01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.220\nand we make them like kiss.\n\n01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:31.940\nWhen you're making them kiss, you see their eyes glow red, and you smell something that\n\n01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:41.940\nsmells like burning rubber, and you hear a cackling.\n\n01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:47.940\nDuh.\n\n01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:50.940\nSpongeBob SquarePants.\n\n01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:58.620\nTo your right, you see SpongeBob SquarePants licensed character from the Cartoon Network.\n\n01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:02.340\nI'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.\n\n01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.620\nIs that a reference to SpongeBob?\n\n01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:08.620\nYeah, he's nailing SpongeBob right now.\n\n01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.820\nIt's Sharpie's turn.\n\n01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:20.340\nI approach this young kkknave.and say, Prithee, Gramercy's Renfairee talk.\n\n01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:24.300\nWe are two explorers that have lost our way.\n\n01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:29.220\nAre you native to this realm?\n\n01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.220\nNo.\n\n01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:37.940\nLooking at SpongeBob, you see that he's wearing tattered clothing.\n\n01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.740\nHis shorts are not as you would expect them to be.\n\n01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.300\nIt seems like he's been through some sort of war or siege.\n\n01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:54.060\nOh, God, can you imagine how long it would take to waterboard SpongeBob?\n\n01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.220\nYou poor thing.\n\n01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:03.620\nBut we're bringing it back, we're bringing it back, because a lot of these guys, I'm\n\n01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.420\nsure they did something wrong anyway.\n\n01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:17.180\nI say to SpongeBob, I say to SpongeBob, we heard your cackling, are you friend or foe?\n\n01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.180\nFriend?\n\n01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:26.660\nI sense his equivocation, and I pull out my emerald dagger.\n\n01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.700\nAll right, let me roll that.\n\n01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.460\nBut I don't use it.\n\n01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:34.460\nI just pull it out.\n\n01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:38.500\nI say, whoa, man, I mean, somebody can be not sure they're your friend and still be\n\n01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.500\na good person.\n\n01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.300\nRight, yeah, I'm using Bluff right now.\n\n01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.300\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.020\nDid I kind of blow that for you?\n\n01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:49.820\nYeah, I think the icing's off that cupcake now.\n\n01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:53.940\nYeah, well, you always do fuck things up, because you're too soft.\n\n01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:54.940\nFuck this guy.\n\n01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:55.940\nWhoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:03.260\nAs you say, fuck this guy, all of the figurines in the room, including clowns and children\n\n01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:12.020\nkissing, and because precious moments figurines and angels and small lions and birds and\n\n01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:18.820\na butterfly, all of their eyes glow red, and the lasers from their eyes meet in the middle\n\n01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:23.020\nof the room into a pyramid, and you hear it buzzing.\n\n01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:29.260\nUh, guys, we've got company.\n\n01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:32.220\nI cast Mystic Smoke Bomb.\n\n01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.220\nAll right, hold on a second.\n\n01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:41.740\nBecause what you don't know is that Dan and I have anti-smoke bomb goggles that we can\n\n01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:50.260\nsee through the smoke, but nobody else can, unless they have a will-save of 22.\n\n01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.260\nThat happens.\n\n01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.260\nAll right.\n\n01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:58.860\nCasting Smoke Bomb, the smoke fills the room, Spongebob is disoriented for a second, but\n\n01:29:58.860 --> 01:29:59.860\nwe can go-\n\n01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.860\nWhoa.\n\n01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:11.300\nYou should get experience points for also doing the face, as far as I know, because\n\n01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:16.300\nI've never heard the cartoon, but I know Spongebob when I see him.\n\n01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.300\nHe's really vanilla.\n\n01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.300\nHe's transformed.\n\n01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.300\nYeah.\n\n01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:26.460\nUsing your smoke goggles, you see on the far side of the room, a hatched door with an\n\n01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.660\nintricate lock.\n\n01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.660\nSharpie, you have-\n\n01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.660\nI cast Intricate Key.\n\n01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:36.700\nAll right, hold on, hold on, hold on.\n\n01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.220\nWaving my hands in a magical manner.\n\n01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:47.660\nThat works, using Intricate Key, the hatch unlocks, revealing a tunnel that is lit with\n\n01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.660\ngreen light.\n\n01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:51.900\nI dive through the tunnel.\n\n01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.340\nDiving through the tunnel, you feel your clothing changing.\n\n01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:08.220\nUncanny Dodge Imitation, he becomes a Pontiac.\n\n01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:19.620\nThe dads of the world rejoice.\n\n01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.740\nI open up the driver's door and get inside Sharpie.\n\n01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:36.980\nGetting inside your friend, getting inside your friend, you examine the inner workings\n\n01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.420\nof his.\n\n01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:44.740\nI put the Pontiac Sharpie into drive and I hit the gas pedal through the tunnel.\n\n01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:49.020\nThrough the tunnel, you feel your clothing change.\n\n01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.220\nYour clothes, what was Sharpie before?\n\n01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.220\nA person.\n\n01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:55.220\nHim, you mean, right, Quark.\n\n01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:57.220\nQuark, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:04.500\nQuark, you feel yourself, your clothing changes into a red leather jumpsuit.\n\n01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:13.580\nYour shoes become beautiful black shoes.\n\n01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:18.260\nI start singing a print song.\n\n01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:21.940\nPurple droplets drop down from the top of the tunnel.\n\n01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:29.260\nAs you get through the tunnel, you find yourself in a darkly lit living room, all of the furniture\n\n01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:38.900\nupholstered with leopard, and in the corner is a man, a quiet man, small of stature, but\n\n01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.140\ngreat of sexuality.\n\n01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140\nDudley Moore?\n\n01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140\nHello.\n\n01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:52.340\nWell, I'm still a car, so I just say vroom, vroom.\n\n01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:55.500\nYou don't have to be a car anymore if you want to go back into not-\n\n01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:59.500\nBut you're in this room, you're no longer a car.\n\n01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:03.500\nDo you get out before I turn into a person?\n\n01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.500\nI can't breathe.\n\n01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.500\nMy gallbladder.\n\n01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.500\nI can't breathe.\n\n01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:17.980\nYou're a full scart for life by this process.\n\n01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:22.500\nI use my emerald dagger to carve my way out of his body.\n\n01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.580\nOh, Jesus.\n\n01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.580\nThat's fine.\n\n01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.580\nAnything but this.\n\n01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:29.580\nHis feet are on my appendix.\n\n01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:36.460\nI plop out, and I use my green potion of healing to heal up the wound that I left.\n\n01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:42.420\nThat happens, and is effective.\n\n01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.900\nWho are you people?\n\n01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:50.420\nWe were about to ask you that very question.\n\n01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:59.100\nYou look at him and recognize him as an androgynous superstar, sexuality, sex.\n\n01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:08.020\nYou realize that you are in the afterlife, and this is, in fact, the posthumous prince.\n\n01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:17.420\nBut not that prince, the prince of the scar glue realm, whose laws restricted people for\n\n01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.700\nyears and years.\n\n01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:24.300\nYou have a lot of beef against this person, but you know that he is a dangerous prince,\n\n01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:27.700\nbut he models himself after a prince.\n\n01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.700\nThe artist.\n\n01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:34.220\nThe artist, formally, and then.\n\n01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:37.140\nDid you ask us a moment ago who we are?\n\n01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:38.140\nI did.\n\n01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.580\nAsk it again.\n\n01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.580\nWho are you people?\n\n01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:47.060\nThe two guys about to kick your shit.\n\n01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:56.820\nAnd I link hands with Sharpie, and we do that weird like something, we kind of caress thumbs.\n\n01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:01.420\nAnd magical energy emanates because of our spell of friendship.\n\n01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.940\nFriendship!\n\n01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:07.460\nYou notice movement in prince's pants.\n\n01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:17.020\nWell, I'm going to hit you with my magical dick.\n\n01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:24.340\nThis produces a fermented elephant's dick in a jar.\n\n01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:33.300\nIt is disgusting, but also majestic.\n\n01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.780\nI use it.\n\n01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.620\nI go to hit them with it.\n\n01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.620\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.620\nHow are you using this?\n\n01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.620\nAre you going to like...\n\n01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:40.620\nBe really specific.\n\n01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:43.460\nYeah, I need to roll for a specific fish.\n\n01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.380\nIt's like, it's cut off from the body, right?\n\n01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:47.620\nSo it's just like something I can hold like a mallet.\n\n01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:50.420\nYou got a magical pickled elephant's dick in a jar.\n\n01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.540\nIt's like a curio.\n\n01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:59.460\nWell, I unscrew the jar, I take the giant dick out, I hold it like a mallet.\n\n01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:00.460\nWhat?\n\n01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:01.460\nI'm joking.\n\n01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:09.180\nAnd then I charge at Sharpie, no, I charge at where their hands meet and try to destroy\n\n01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.180\nthe link.\n\n01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.180\nOkay.\n\n01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:12.180\nAll right.\n\n01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.180\nHold on.\n\n01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.180\nHold on.\n\n01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.180\nHold on.\n\n01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:18.260\nI'm going to be using at Sharpie and Quirk's meeting.\n\n01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:22.860\nI've never seen this side of you.\n\n01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:29.100\nSharpie takes 12 damage.\n\n01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.980\nQuirk uses dodge and he takes no damage.\n\n01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:38.820\nI tumble away and I pull out, I still have my emerald dagger in my hand, which I believe\n\n01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:43.340\nhas now a keen edge to it dealing more damage.\n\n01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:49.700\nAnd I, as I roll, I roll and I try to slice him in the leg.\n\n01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:52.980\nRolling in slow motion like the Matrix.\n\n01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.540\nQuirk slices his leg.\n\n01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.220\nWell, hold on.\n\n01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:01.700\nFor our listeners, he's just pantomiming dice right now.\n\n01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:05.260\nDoes anybody here have dice on them?\n\n01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.260\nYou do?\n\n01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.260\nYes.\n\n01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.260\nGet him up here.\n\n01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.260\nI'll take those dice, baby.\n\n01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.260\nAt least a D20.\n\n01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.260\nLet me see.\n\n01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:13.540\nAt least a D20.\n\n01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.540\nLet me have those dice.\n\n01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:16.540\nWhy are you just sitting there?\n\n01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.540\nWhere?\n\n01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:23.020\nI asked that question pretty certain that somebody was going to have these dice.\n\n01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.020\nIs he going to his car?\n\n01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.020\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.020\nAll right.\n\n01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.020\nContinue.\n\n01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.020\nOkay.\n\n01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:30.020\nOkay.\n\n01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:31.020\nRoll.\n\n01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:32.020\nAll right.\n\n01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.020\nOkay.\n\n01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.020\nYou.\n\n01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.020\nAre you there?\n\n01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.740\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:47.140\nIn a small black velvet pouch, a man comes up from the audience producing a small, velveteen\n\n01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:48.140\npouch.\n\n01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.140\nOkay.\n\n01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:50.140\nYou find dice in them.\n\n01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.140\nOkay.\n\n01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.900\nSo, so you, you try to slice at the ankle.\n\n01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.540\nI aim for the first leg to try to cut him with my dagger.\n\n01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:56.540\nOkay.\n\n01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:57.540\nWith a keen edge.\n\n01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.540\nOkay.\n\n01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:06.060\nYou do not slice his leg, but you braise it showing that you are business.\n\n01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.060\nI braise it.\n\n01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:08.060\nYeah.\n\n01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:13.380\nYou, you, you, I, like, meaning I can a welding fashion or I make like a nice roast out of\n\n01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.380\nit.\n\n01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.380\nThere.\n\n01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.380\nWhere's this guy?\n\n01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.380\nI have more pouches.\n\n01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.380\nNot to be outdone.\n\n01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:26.980\nUnless you think nerds don't have their own hierarchy.\n\n01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:35.660\nAn alpha nerd with a tense ponytail or full on man bun just came up with a much larger\n\n01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:41.500\nequally black velvet sack bulging with millions of dice.\n\n01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.340\nIt couldn't be more or less phallic.\n\n01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.340\nYeah.\n\n01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:49.380\nI'm being presented with sacks of increasing size.\n\n01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.380\nOkay.\n\n01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.380\nOkay.\n\n01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.380\nOkay.\n\n01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.380\nFine.\n\n01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.380\nOkay.\n\n01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:55.380\nOkay.\n\n01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.380\nSo, I, I lightly braise him.\n\n01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:01.020\nI lightly braise his leg and I put a little shallots on there, a little white pepper,\n\n01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.140\na little olive oil.\n\n01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.140\nThat happens.\n\n01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:08.020\nAnd I, I, I, I, I cast a preheat to 350.\n\n01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.020\nAll right.\n\n01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:10.020\nHold on.\n\n01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.020\nHold on.\n\n01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:12.020\nHold on.\n\n01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.020\nHold on.\n\n01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:17.660\nUh, that, there's like a slight heat, but it doesn't do anything.\n\n01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660\nAh, shit.\n\n01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:21.420\nIt was a critical fail.\n\n01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:25.820\nI'm just waiting now for like a dune pilot to float up and put a giant asthma inhaler\n\n01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:28.820\non the table.\n\n01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:37.820\nSuddenly, the floor turns into bandanas, thousands and thousands of bandanas.\n\n01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:39.820\nOh no.\n\n01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:41.940\nOh no.\n\n01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:42.940\nMy kryptonite.\n\n01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:50.340\nYou all fall, you feel yourselves, all three of you feel yourselves falling through the\n\n01:39:50.340 --> 01:40:03.140\nrealm of bandanas and into a new room that resembles a pumpkin.\n\n01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:07.620\nDo we, the inside of a pumpkin, like we're inside a giant pumpkin?\n\n01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:14.580\nI mean, how could a room resemble the outside of a, how well inside a pumpkin would you\n\n01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:16.580\nknow it was a pumpkin?\n\n01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:27.900\nThis is, you really aren't nailing Spencer, you fall through the bandanas and, and Prince\n\n01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:28.900\nhas disappeared.\n\n01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:29.900\nIt's just the two of you.\n\n01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:30.900\nOkay.\n\n01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.900\nYou don't know where he's gone.\n\n01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.900\nThat was a close call.\n\n01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:36.540\nWe almost got beaten up by the Prince's craggledore.\n\n01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:48.180\nI take the pumpkin seeds and I get some artisanal sea salt and I put them on a cookie sheet\n\n01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:51.180\nand I bake the pumpkin seeds.\n\n01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.180\nI'm in Spencer character right now.\n\n01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.580\nThere are no pumpkin seeds.\n\n01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.580\nOh.\n\n01:40:55.580 --> 01:41:02.460\nAnd you start to hear a faint singing.\n\n01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:11.980\nI examine my, I listen.\n\n01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:27.820\nYou are my fire, the war, desire, cliffhanger, Steve Levy, Jeff Davis, Erin McGathy, give\n\n01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:36.420\nher a hand, Lucas, thank you, Lucas.\n\n01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:45.620\nOur chariot friends, our marketing chariot, our, our, our, our, our dice wielders.\n\n01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:46.620\nThank you so much everybody.\n\n01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:47.620\nThat's been Hamilton.\n\n01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:48.620\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:50.620\nThe black guy that had to sit behind the tall guy.\n\n01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:56.380\nThe black guy that's happened to be the tall white guy, if that's not a metaphor for the\n\n01:41:56.380 --> 01:42:03.500\ncurrent state of America, we're all the black guys sitting behind a tall guy now.\n\n01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.500\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:25.660\nI should marry Dan Harmon, drive fast, take chances.\n\n01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:26.660\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:27.660\nIt's a good show.\n\n01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:56.660\nFeral Audio.\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[144200]}
