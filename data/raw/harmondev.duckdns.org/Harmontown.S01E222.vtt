00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Welcome to Meltdown Comics from Hollywood, California.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Music

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Music

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Tonight, the role of Spencer Crittenden will be played by Erin McGathy.

00:33.000 --> 00:48.000
Music

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And the role of Mayor will be played by Dan Harmon.

00:51.000 --> 01:03.000
Music

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Thank you very much.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
There's some points of order to be made.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Now, here's one of them.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
To our friends at MeUndies, who are not, I don't believe they're not paying for any advertising tonight,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
but I want to address them.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
I have a problem at my home with my underwear, which is the following.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
I have two dogs, adopted by Ms. McGathey and myself.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
The two dogs are now in my charge.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
The smaller of them, Nigel, eats the underwear.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm asking MeUndies if I can have another box of MeUndies,

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
because I've gotten two shipments from them and I still own two pairs of underwear that are functional.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
However, so that you understand that I'm the victim here.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Dan, please figure out how to throw your underwear or put it in a hamper or something.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Don't leave it on the floor.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
The dog loves you.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
He wants to eat your piss and your shit.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
And that's true.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes, you're right.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm trying.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm trying to learn.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
I don't enjoy not having underwear, but I just want to create a map of the cosmos for you to understand.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
You should feel sorry for me, because here's the thing.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
This little fucker eats, he didn't do this when you were around.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
He started eating all the furniture when Aaron and I started divorcing.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Ads up.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Ads up?

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
I'm just trying to, I don't know if I should do an impression of Spencer or I'm just trying to be Spencer.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
I, for one, would like to hear you try.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Okay.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
That happens.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, that dog, that dog eats all that underwear.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah, that dog, that dog really does that.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Maybe you shouldn't leave it on the floor.

03:22.000 --> 03:33.000
So this little fucker, he eats the fabric that was touching where my penis.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
An asshole are, because he loves, he's a dog.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
He thinks that's my wallet.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
He thinks that's my, he thinks that's a locket.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
In dog terms, they call that flavor country.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
You notice they sniff your crotch, they sniff your butt.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
They're going like, oh, hello, Carl.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
I see you're allergic to coffee or something, you know, like they're thinking, all right.

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
So, so he eats, but he eats perfect, perfect holes right where the junk and the trunk are.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
And so here's the thing, just so you understand that I'm a victim.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Two separate holes or one.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Two separate holes.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
He eats a junk hole and a trunk hole.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
It just sounds like he wants you to explore a new fetish.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Try not to get ahead of me here.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
So here is the part where you say, Dan, I feel bad for you.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
It's not out of property loss, which I'm asking the undies to, maybe they could reimburse.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't know if the reimburse is the right word.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Re-up.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Bail out.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
It's a bail out.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
And you don't need to go.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I got a variety pack last time.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
Let's, let's, let's target the boxer briefy more things like the bikini style ones are only good for an Instagram.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
No, no, no.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
What, what are you, what are you rocking right now?

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't, probably a good old fashioned cotton pair of, of Calvin Klein's that are one third the softness of Modal.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
As, as, are you saying that me and these are too delicious for dogs?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, he never ate the crotch out of my, no, I don't want to start that business.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
I don't want to, I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to be one of those people.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Like when the iPhone came out, people are like, did you know the screen gets degraded faster when you eat pizza?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not an alarmist.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm a futurist and I'm a, and I'm an underwear softness advocate.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
I wouldn't even, even if I thought that was the case, I would, I would pull back on that information.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I'd be like a tobacco company.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
I'd be like, come on, let's get all the data.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Here's the thing.

05:51.000 --> 06:04.000
So my soon to be thrown over a historical wall housekeeper who is terrified right now.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Wait, don't, don't you and I have the same housekeeper?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
What's that? Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
We have the same housekeeper.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Is she, is she documented?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I don't, I'm not going to fucking ask.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, well, so.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
She's coming to my place tomorrow.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
So, so plan for the worst, hope for the best.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah. Like I've, I've, I've, I've.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You're not going to sell her out, are you?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
No, I'm going to, I'm going to.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
You just, you just threatened to throw over a historical wall.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I said soon to be, I didn't say soon to be by me.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm building a fucking wall.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
It wasn't my platform.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm not a sociopath.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
I'm not a, I'm not a fucking kleptocratic fucking like pathological monster man.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm a monster man.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't run for the dumbest job in the world

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
after failing at nine slightly worse ones.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Well.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Born into a trust fund.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And a show that started with you complaining about how your free underwear

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
gets eaten by your, your rescue dog.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We also just bonded over that we have,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
we have the same possibly non documented housekeeper.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Right. Yes.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And you'll, well, you notice I'm not like, yeah,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm not going like, what about my housekeeper?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm just saying she's part of this story.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Now imagine what she's going through.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Right.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
She came to my place one time after coming from your place

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
to clean my place after cleaning your place.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
And she looked really, really shagged out.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
She looked really tired.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
That, I had to be when Aaron was living.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, you guys were together back then,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
but that's not, that's not the point.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
She's like, I think Jeff, thank you for letting me in.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I go, how you doing Sophia?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And she's like, I'm so tired.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I'm so tired.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I go, why?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And she goes, do you know Harvey?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Cause you're golden doodle.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I go, yeah, I know Harvey.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
He goes, and she, she just like puts her backpack down in my kitchen

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
and she starts to like get like, like start washing the dishes.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
She goes, Harvey, he, he eats all the trash.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
He eats all the trash.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
But that, I mean that Harvey would do that once in a while,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
but very intelligent dog.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
What?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
He learned, he learned.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
He picks up, he's a very empathic dog, Harvey.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Nigel is a fucking disaster.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Nigel is just like, look, you talk to parents,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
they have a favorite kid, they won't admit it.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
They know that's bad parenting.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
You're not supposed to do that.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
They have a favorite kid.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
They like one kid better than the other kid.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
That's well, that's, that's not well documented.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Sophia probably is.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Let's assume so.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And, but you don't, you don't say, but it's, we all know it's true.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
You have a favorite kid, especially if one comes from a breeder

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
and is amazingly intelligent.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
The combination of two thoroughbred species of a breed of dog

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
that are renowned for their intelligence,

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
and the other is just a mishmash of rescue crap from Echo Park.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Just a, just a fucking...

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Aren't, aren't much notoriously more savvy,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
like because, because of the, the, the broader gene pool?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Not when the, no, that's like, applies to like,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
oh, let's mix a shelter with a, with a, with a, with a Jack Russell.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So, so maybe he'll, maybe he'll...

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Jack Russell's the fucking worst.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Don't get too fucking sidetracked, okay?

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Like, you're, you're supposed to be the anti-tangent guy.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
You're supposed to keep me on rails.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh, that reminds me.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I was having an enchilada today.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And I'm fucking it.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And I mean, fucking it.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
So here's the situation.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
So imagine when I open my underwear drawer.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I imagine this every morning.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
And the underwear drawer is basically full,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
even though I'm like...

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And then I pull out, I pull out each pair of underwear

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
and it's got this hole in the crotch and hole in the butt.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
So here I am, a man deprived of his property by his,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
his mutt.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And his housekeeper is folding,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
neatly washing and folding,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
because she thinks I'm a fucking sex monster.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Wait.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I can't, I can't have that conversation with her.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Hold up.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
How many pairs, how many, multiple pairs, not just one?

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Like, every fucking pair that's ever touched the floor.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
From meundies. Only from meundies?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I think maybe no. He's got, I think maybe he, I don't, look,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I told you I didn't want to get into that.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I, I have a lot of questions.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
I feel like he's got, no, I have, I have cotton underwear

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
that has this treatment done to it.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Are you trying to...

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I do think it's possible that the modal,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
which is a fabric, a three times softer than cotton.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Let's do a free, let's do a free ad for them right now

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
because we're not even supposed to do an ad for them today.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I believe we are.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I would say, I would highly recommend this underwear.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I would highly recommend you get a dog from a breeder.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
No, I'm kidding.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And figure fish kids.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
You know, Anne Frank kicked a cat once.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
It didn't make the book.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
She loved burgers.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Not a villain. She's not a villain.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
She's a human being.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
But you're saying that you have a rescue dog

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
that's going around eating the,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
the fetus and butthole out of all of your me and these underwear.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yes.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And then your Guatemalan housekeeper

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
looks at them and thinks that you're probably a bad person.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, well, yeah, she, and she, and forgives it and says,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
oh, this is my job. This is my Latin life.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm a Santa, like, Cicnaughty.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
But when Aaron and I, we could say,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
when Aaron and I were first dating,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
we'd been really dating when we were platonically friends

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
and I was going,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
if I could make it through this platonic friendship,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
maybe I can sell her on the, on the, on the great stuff.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
We would, we would, we would, we would party at night

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
and like, and I had a, I had a mustache.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I had a mustache.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It was my mustache when I was, for Halloween,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
was Gomez from the Atmos family.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And then Aaron loved, Aaron, you loved wearing my mustache.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I loved it. I did love it.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I don't think I've ever seen you happier

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
except on your wedding night,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
which I wasn't there for because we got in a fight

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
and I wasn't at your wedding night,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
but you used to wear my mustache

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
and you were so pleased by that.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
She would, oh good, sorry.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Oh yeah, I felt, yeah.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I don't know what's happening again.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm falling for that great stuff.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
This magic moment.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
This magic moment.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
The, uh, you had spirit gum the mustache to your lip

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
and they just said it wasn't like a cheese ball thing.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It was like, it was a really good mustache.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
There was a month where we were living in like a,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
like a James Spader 80s independent film

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
where the three of us would just hang out

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
and drink and play party games

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
and I would wear the mustache and no pants and just tights.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Woo!

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
And I used to eat the Pussy and Asshole

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
out of all of her tights.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
The point of this flashback being that

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Sophia,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
on absolutely more than two occasions

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
because we were doing like a lot of all-nighters

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
and then pass out and like,

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I wasn't working on community.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And she would find bags of drugs everywhere.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
She always finds bags of drugs everywhere.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
But when I was first dating Erin,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
very often, more than twice,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
like because Monday night would be like,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
like up till four or maybe pass out up till six, whatever,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
and then Sophia would come over at 8.30 Tuesday morning.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
So on more than two occasions,

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
we'd be asleep downstairs on two different sofas

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
and she'd walk in and the things she'd see

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
would be two bleary-eyed adults

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
realizing someone was coming in,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
both of them sitting bolt upright,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
one of them a woman with a mustache.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And then we'd quietly excuse ourselves

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
and head upstairs and go out for a Bloody Mary.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
But then the mustache,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
which would have been quickly ripped off

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
and kind of left on the kitchen bathroom sink,

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
I would always then, she would neatly clean it

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
and put it in its case and put it in a drawer.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Next to the bed.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Next to the bed.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Because she's like, I get it.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I don't get it, but I get that I don't get it.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm north of the wall.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
These are not wildlings.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
These are corrupted folk.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
These are elitists.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
They have to go further.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I had a broken garbage disposal

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and a broken microwave oven door

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
like for a week.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
She came in, I woke up in the morning,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
she left, they worked.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Well, you better be prepared to fucking hide her

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
and battle to the death.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I will.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Battle skinheads.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
All right, good.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Harvey, eat all the trash.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I want you all to protect your housekeepers.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
All right, now Dan.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
It's war.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Dan, do you think...

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
It's about values.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Do you think me undies is a good underwear company

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
or a worse underwear company

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
that the fact that it's delicious to dogs.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I don't think it's delicious to dogs.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
It stops fretting that rumor.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
I think that my shit and gross crotch pheromones

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
are delicious to Nigel.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And I think it's possible, I'll go this far

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
and say it's maybe it's possible that whereas

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
when he eats, when he does that with the hains

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
or the shitty, the cotton underwear,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
that basically they kind of get torn apart

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
and it's like just shredded

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and it's unmistakably dog-eaten underwear

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
that the housekeeper throws in the garbage,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
that Modal, probably what keeps it three times as soft

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
is that it's very slightly knit.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
You have a strap on peg fetish.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
So he's able to, he's like, it's like a corn on the cob.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
He just like makes a little circle.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
He's like a little Yosemite Sam robbing a pirate ship

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
with a saw.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Dan, it's been a year and I've, you know,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
some memories fade and some memories stick with me,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
but for some reason the image of your dirty underwear,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I know exactly what it looks like.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I have so many, everything.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's such a...

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah, it looks delicious.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
It's like a candy store.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah, me and Nigel used to fight over it,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
like Lady and the Tramp and the spaghetti.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Eat. That's not fair, yeah.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
So, if Meundee's is listening,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I promise I am not,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
because I would think that they would have a chart on there

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
while they go, how many Meundee's have we given him?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Is he selling them? Is he being jaded?

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Is he some kind of weird like guy that would take product

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
and then he would sell it and like,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
no, I'm not one of those people.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
You know, like, I could name a couple people

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
that are those people,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
but that wouldn't prove I wasn't, that would just...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Am I just lazy?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I've never gotten...

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I've done 9,000 Meundee's ads.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I don't have any Meundee's.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I'd never worn them.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Am I...

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Am I supposed to call up, like,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Meundee's and say, where's my...

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Where's my Undee's? Who do I talk to?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Just have Levy hook you up, man.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Because I eat the... I eat the penis and butthole

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
out of my own Undee's.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
You're gonna love these things.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I promise you that.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
The thing is, we're not actually doing an ad right now.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
No, we're not. This is an actual relationship.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
An actual platonic relationship.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Do they make it for gals, too? Is it just gentlemen?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
They sure do.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
You and your loved one can wear matching underwear, even.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Is that right? Yeah, that's true.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Where's my Undee's? I don't have shit.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
We just told you.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Levy will hook you up.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Now you have to make the decision to move on or...

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Or do what America is doing right now.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
If I cared so much about it,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
I would have got on this earlier.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
But now that I realize that they make dogs

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
want to eat the butthole out of them...

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Have we talked about this thing where it's like,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
I'm trying to rise above, you know, I'm like,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
okay, what's my job? Have some humor about it.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
But what's normalizing? What's going numb?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, ignoring this.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
So, okay, I gotta make jokes about this fucking Hitler situation.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
This Hitleration.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
This situleration.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
With the Bannon-Goebbels and the fucking whole thing

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
and the goddamn fucking family of the damned

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
staring into the camera.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
He's not going to do that...

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Who are you talking about?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
So anyways, I'm not a political person.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I'm a humorist.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
You're one of the leading satirists of our time.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm like a Jonathan Swift or Will Rogers.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
You're like a Lily Tomlin.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Sometimes this crosses over into politics if it's Ocaron.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
But I try to keep things light.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
So you make a joke. Oh, and knock knock, who's there?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Trump's a fucking fascist dictator. We're all going to die.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
We're all going to die.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Trump's a fascist dictator. We're all going to die.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
We're all going to die. Who?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't have to answer that question.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Your door's been removed from its hinges by...

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Oh my God!

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Sophia! Sophia, no!

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
So, see, you guys came here to see a podcast.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
You didn't know that you're going to get biting, trenchant political satire like this.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
No, this is social media observation.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
You make the comment, you do the joke.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
I got like, oh, knock knock, Trump's a fucking fascist dictator.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Some people are still responding.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
They got like, oh, I think a fucking fascist dictator is somebody who deletes your emails.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Thank you very much.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Do you know how elections work?

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
She's not going to hang out like Mimi and Drew Carey.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
That's not what happens to the loser in elections.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
She doesn't just sit in the lobby and be like, oh, I'm worse.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
She's fucking gone and you're going to miss her.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
She's in the woods, literally. That was the last sighting of her.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I hope she starts making honey or jewelry.

21:17.000 --> 21:28.000
I hope she writes a book and it's just like, oh, I hope the title is noted.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
Or just like, I can take a hint and then the whole book is just like fucking, yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
You want to see a bitch?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
You want to not trust somebody?

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
I hope it's called Good Luck and it's 200 pages and it's just like GDG for like 20 pages.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
It's just like, good luck.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
And the letters get smaller and smaller and smaller.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
And the last picture is just Bill holding acorns.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Holding acorns.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
This is a question that no one can really answer.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I mean, I'm assuming that Bill really wanted her to win.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
But do you think part of him was like, yeah, in your face?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
In your face.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Because he's a guy.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Because he's a guy.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
It's not as easy as it looks.

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm going to make the assumption that the ninth time she caught him cheating on her,

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
he was like, yeah, but you know, you could get to be president.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
As I ask anybody that wrote on community, it's like the phrase,

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
you'll thank me at the Emmys became a running joke.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
By season six, they had caught on.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
You're not going to win an Emmy.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
And at this point, I wouldn't thank you at them.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
I should not have to bring a toothbrush to work, sir.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
It's Yahoo.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
You never close your eyes anymore.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
Rubik's Steven Merchant.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Lucas, would you stand and sit down for a moment?

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
Jesus.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Can you grab a mic?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
What does that really mean? Can you?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
It's so far down.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
I'm curious, I'm going to give some space to...

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm curious, I talk to tall people, like for the listeners,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
we've got a very tall, very handsome, good...

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Thank you.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Gentlemen, it's like...

23:44.000 --> 23:51.000
He's like a Kiba Schaffer from Lonely Island who was like on the Knicks.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
So tallness, like, you know, like, so what is there?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I'm afraid to tell the truth, no matter what it is,

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
like, just inside, it's not the same as you saying,

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
you should feel sorry for me or anything like that,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
just inside your actual emotions.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
Do you feel hurt when people just, like, joke about it at all?

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
It's... every single interaction in my entire life is all that only.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
So is that... is that troublesome?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
It's kind of like you wish you could...

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I don't know if I can, like, every single experience,

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
since the time I was, like, five, has been shaped by the fact that I'm tall,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
so I'm just, I guess, used to it.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Do you ever play that card in a conversation with black people?

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
Oh, definitely.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Like in a comment section, it's always going,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
what do you... what do you mean, blue lives matter?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
That's the most offensive thing, and you're like,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
hey, I know what you mean, all right?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Do you feel compelled to distract from your height?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Yes, that's why I'm wearing this shirt.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I know.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Well, it might be an actual attempt.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
We might find out that this takes two inches off the optic nerve,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
because it's like, by some principle, we don't know about that.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
You've researched, you and three guys in a club in, like, London.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Well, it's like, since everyone only talks about how tall I am,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
it's nice to let them talk about something other than that sometimes.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Wow. That makes sense.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Did you go through a big, like, growth spurt, like a painful growth spurt?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I have always been very tall.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I was 11 pounds seven ounces when I was born.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
What?

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah, I was six foot in fifth grade.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
He was such a tall baby.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
How tall was he?

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
He was such a tall baby that he didn't finish being born

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
until his third birthday.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
That's great.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
That's like a Play-Doh Fun Factory in this motherfucker with this guy.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
Lucas was such a tall baby.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
How tall was he?

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
That when he was an infant, when he went to Disneyland,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
families agreed to meet around him if they got separated.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
They actually do. They actually do that.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
They absolutely do that.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Lucas was such a tall baby.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
How tall was he?

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
There was still snow on him in the summertime.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Lucas was such a tall baby.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
How tall was he?

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
He's not allowed to go to zoos because the drafts will be insecure.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Lucas is such a tall baby.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
How tall was he?

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
To this day, he was the only...

26:46.000 --> 26:53.000
He was the only fetus allowed on roller coasters.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I'm not allowed on some.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
That's what I was going to say.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
I bet you aren't allowed on a lot of shit.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Harry Potter at the University of the Light.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You're too tall. You will get your head cut off.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
That's fucked up.

27:06.000 --> 27:15.000
Lucas is so tall that his dick has its own dick and is bigger than your dick.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
It is proportionate.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
I love that that's like Lucas' slam.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.000
He gets so subtly and says, it all works together.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
What do you do?

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
Let's stop doing tall jokes for a few minutes.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
They use him to change the Liberty Torch.

27:43.000 --> 27:51.000
Lucas, do you live in LA? Are you Los Angelinos?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I moved here about a year ago.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
From where?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
From Oregon.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Still on his way?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Two.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Were you followed here by your blue ox?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Nice.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You fucking monster.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm a human being.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Let's do a segment called, the things we should know about Lucas.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
A segment called, we're sorry, Lucas.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It's okay.

28:21.000 --> 28:29.000
Now that he's been gracious about all that, his reward should be that we find out some non-height-related things about him.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
What band are you in?

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I'm not in a band. I do paint.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
You don't play stand-up bass.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
No. I play sit-down bass.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
What do you do?

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
I paint and I'm an actor at Universal Studios.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Great. What do you do at Universal Studios?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
I am a character.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Now, I was once too. What do you do?

28:53.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm a few different things. I'm a who at Christmas and I also am the warm-up act for the animal show, if anyone has been there.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
It's very Harpo Marx. It's like a silent clown type. I do a lot of mime and mess with guests.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
I'd, for a summer or two, did, I was Harry from Harry and the Hendersons and Frankenstein.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
That's good. Yeah.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
Now, this is not a height thing, but you would be too tall.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
I am too tall. The tallest character in the park is Megatron and height cap is 6'6".

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
So, I'm allowed to be the atmosphere character that's just like, you're a policeman. I can do that.

29:29.000 --> 29:37.000
Because I was Harry and the Hendersons and the dead of summer wearing a yak fur and latex mushroom.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Oh man. Yeah. Mushroom.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I feel really bad for the people who are shrek.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Oh my God.

29:44.000 --> 29:52.000
It was the hottest thing. You were just pouring sweat, but inside the big feet of the big foot of the Sasquatch, there was like metal high heels in it.

29:52.000 --> 29:59.000
I'm 6'4", I'm just like a shade under 6'4". So, in that, in the head, I was like, probably 6'10".

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
But I got one day, I got to play Frankenstein, which is the best, because you just wear a nice suit.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Yeah, a nice suit and like platform heels.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Yeah. And also, nobody fucks with you when you're Frankenstein.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Oh, definitely not. Yeah.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
And they bone out? They don't want to hang her.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
Someone stuck a wand in the mummy's butt.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
That seems like an awesome 80's Gary Newman song.

30:23.000 --> 30:37.000
I got my wand inside. Inside the mummy's butt. I like my wrappings. I like my stick.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
When I was Harry, Harry and the Hendersons, it was my own eyes that you could see through the mask.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
And the jaw would work. And you were supposed to be kind of a comical, like lovable character.

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
But nobody really screwed with you, because you're so big, and there's this big latex padded muscle suit.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Yeah.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
And it's a thousand degrees outside. And you're dying. You're dying.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
You're dying.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
And you're making $10 an hour the fucking hard way.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
Wait, I think you meant Randy Newman, didn't you? I was doing Gary Newman.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Did you mean Randy Newman?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Gary Newman.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
Someone put a stick in the mummy's butt. It sounded more like a Randy Newman song.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Let's hear Randy Newman talk about putting a wand up the mummy's butt.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
You got that stick now, don't you, little boy?

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
What you gonna do with that stick when you don't know what to do?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
You got a stick in your butt.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Like that.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Tall people.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Yeah.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Thank you.

31:38.000 --> 31:45.000
But it was the Japanese businessmen would come up, and they would blow smoke into my mask.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
They could see human beings' eyes in there.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
And they would get in their tippy toes and go...

31:50.000 --> 31:57.000
And then a couple times, just take their hand and try to ram it up Sasquatch's butt.

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
And I would just shove them as hard as I could, and then run off like I was being a bad Sasquatch.

32:03.000 --> 32:19.000
I've told the story before. I was a Captain Crunch during either their peak popularity as a serial or the Valley.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't know what would make them...

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
This was at the short-lived General Mills Serial Theme Park.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
The promotional campaign was Who's the Real Captain?

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
There were multiple captains wandering the city of Milwaukee.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
There was another tour.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And one of the other captains...

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Wait, you're not joking?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
No.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
I thought this was a bit.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
I've told this story, but you've also talked about being Harry and the Henderson.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
So it's recycling night at Harmontown.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
I was a captain, and there was another guy who was a captain, because there were multiple captains.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
We'd go around going, I'm the real captain.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
No, I am the real captain.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
And we had the big costumes with the spray-painted mesh mouth where you're looking out of it.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
We went to Winterfest, and they put ice skates on us.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
And they said, why don't you go out there?

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
And the kids were like, there's six-foot pillows on ice skates.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Let's attack.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
My childhood is incumbent upon me.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
It's my patriotic duty to ram these fuckers into oblivion.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Throw them down and watch the turtles trying to get up.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
What did they want to happen?

33:22.000 --> 33:32.000
It was just like, if you've survived Pearl Harbor, I don't know why you think I'm trivializing your experience, but it was, to me, it was my Pearl Harbor.

33:32.000 --> 33:39.000
Dan, I remember when you told me that story, and for some reason I was so impressed.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
It is impressive.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I was Captain Crutch.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah, it's fucking impressive.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Look, also, you skated.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh, yeah.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Like, that's hard.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Skating for it.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
Well, when you're in Milwaukee, it's like you're sliding everywhere anyway.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
And so then somebody's like, put these blades on.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
You'll go faster.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
And they're like, OK.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
So Lucas, right now, you're correct.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Hey.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
I just got to finish the story.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Oh, sorry.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
So one of the kids kept bombarding us.

34:06.000 --> 34:14.000
And one of the captains, my friend, I was near him and he grabbed one of the kids.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
And the mouth is like right in front of the kid's face.

34:17.000 --> 34:24.000
And he said, if you skate into me one more time, I will break your fucking arm.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
And if you tell anybody I said this, I'll deny it.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
And I think he was the real captain.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
That's when I figured it out.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I don't know if they ever gave us an answer, but.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
That might have been Admiral Crutch.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
All right.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
So now continue.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
So you're currently still doing costume work and like character stuff up at university?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Yes.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Currently we're preparing for Grinchmas.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Grinchmas.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Ah, Grinchmas.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Copyright problems there?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Can't just.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Yeah.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Christmas is completely taken.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
No, it's because we don't want to.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
It's because we don't want to trump things.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
We don't want to say, wait, what happened?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
We don't want to say Christmas.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
We don't want to say Hanukkah.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
So it's Grinchmas.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Yeah.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
But we sing Christmas girls.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Do they still do the Westworld Waterworld?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Waterworld.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Yes, Waterworld.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
I know.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
It's still happening.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
It's not a great movie.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
It's not a great movie.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Waterworld, very, very beautiful movie, very successful ride.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
And I'll tell you something.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I heard what you just said.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
You're going to be saying Christmas.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
They're going to be saying Christmas.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
They're going to love it.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
They're going to love it.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
We're going to go down there.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
We're going to make them say Christmas.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Hugely.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
So tall.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Tall.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But more to it than that.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Ironically, working in a theme park, the height doesn't figure in.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
The guy playing Megatron and Harry from Harry and the Henderson's,

35:51.000 --> 35:58.000
when you walk by wearing an ill-fitting bell-hop costume, they go,

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
what's with the tall guy?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
You're too tall to be the tall character.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I'm too tall to be the tall character.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
I can be the other atmosphere.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
I can be police officer, British palace guard, train conductor, like those ones.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Right.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
But you can't put on the Franklin sign.

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
But they're like, shaggy, 6'2", and you're like, he's a cartoon.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
Do you have a big dick?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I already mentioned this.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I said it was proportionate.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I don't want to say things out loud like that.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
He said he has a proportionate to my height.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Well, that's, okay, big dick then.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Sure.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Because mine is not proportionate.

36:42.000 --> 36:49.000
How not proportionate is it?

36:49.000 --> 36:55.000
Legally, I'm required to call it a nipple.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Den's dick is so not proportionate to his size.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
How not proportionate is it?

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
There's never snow on it.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Callback.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
No one ever agrees to meet in front of it if they go to Disneyland.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
My dick is so not proportionate to my size.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
How not proportionate is it?

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
To this day, I still don't know if I'm circumcised.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.000
Because just the regular amount of skin.

37:31.000 --> 37:38.000
Still turtlenecks around it and comes to a little brunch swagger.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
No.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Dance.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Go ahead.

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
Erin, you might be something of an expert on this topic.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
A dance dick is so not proportionate to his size.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
How not proportionate is it?

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
I feel uncomfortable joking about it.

38:00.000 --> 38:07.000
How beautiful is it?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
No, Dan, I love you.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
It's beautiful.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
How beautiful is it?

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
It's so beautiful that it needs to be beautiful.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
I don't know.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Sorry.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
I just wanted to get in on the boy fun.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
My dick is so beautiful.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
How beautiful is it?

38:29.000 --> 38:48.000
It's in the background of three Terrence Malick movies.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Lucas, you said that you're also not just an actor, but what else?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
I also paint.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
You paint?

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
What sort of painting do you do?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Mostly scenes from video games.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
What media?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Acrylic on canvas.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Really?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Scenes from...

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
So like pixel paintings?

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
I recently did a painting of Pallet Town from Pokemon if people play Pokemon.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
So I drawed a grid on the canvas and then I paint it by hand.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
He tried doing landscapes, like traditional stuff, but the teacher would be like,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
that's just a plane.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
I told you, I told you look out the window.

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
Oh.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
Why is it that we think it's okay?

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
To comment about this, and it's the only physical thing you can.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
Well, no, I was going to say, we had our friend Collin on here.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
He's a little person.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Dwarfism.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Obviously, we don't feel quite as...

39:47.000 --> 39:54.000
We range in our like, oh, if they make it okay for us, we can ask them questions about the latitude

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
and the effect and all the things.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
But what is it about height that's like, because it doesn't really...

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
You can't kill a mammoth any better than anybody else.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Definitely not.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Well, we feel like, oh, you know, he's fine, he's fine.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Like we must be feeling that or we wouldn't feel okay.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Like, are you faster?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Are you...

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Definitely not.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
I feel like your heart's probably like, you know...

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Dying?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Yeah, it's like...

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
There's probably risk involved.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
There aren't a lot of tall, old people.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Really?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
See, I know...

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
That was sad.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Look, it's like being like just shy of 6'4".

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm at the threshold of I can just fit into most like roller coasters.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
I can sit and coach without being miserable.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Right.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
But right at the edge of that.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
So like, coach for you is probably a bummer, right?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
It is a bummer.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
If you get Southwest and you board early, you can get the exit row.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Yeah, but you have to.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Yeah.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
You got to.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
What about roller coasters?

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah, what about roller coasters?

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
I love roller coasters.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
Because I'm wedged into most roller coasters.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Oh, yeah.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
I mean, I just don't go on them.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
You don't even do it.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Yeah, I just don't bother.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Because it's like...

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Because like, if I wait in line for an hour to get on the coaster and then they're like,

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
you can't go on.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
And I'm like, oh, great.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
And the goddamn nightmare of any theatrical situation at all.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Even me.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I'm aware, you know, I'm 6 feet.

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
Like, it's like that dread of like, you walk into an already filled auditorium or picnic

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
outdoor like thing where people are sitting or something.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
And it's just that those comments like, oh, God, no.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah, I know.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I apologize to this lovely gentleman behind me.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I was like, I'm sorry, but I am.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
And the guy he's running to is an African-American gentleman.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
And how happy are you right now that he's on stage and not sitting in front of you?

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
It's okay, because he looks back and he goes, I'm sorry.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
I'm like, you look great though, dude.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I have taught Guy Guilt about going to concerts and stuff.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Like, I stand in the back.

41:55.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah, I have that guilt, but it doesn't hold me back from living my life.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
I love it.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
I mean, you're still a white man.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Oh, I know.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
Lucas, Lucas, if we, do you have like an Instagram or something like that?

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
We can follow your art and we can get people to buy something.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I guess I do have an Instagram.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
King Lucas Lee on Instagram.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
I don't know how to Instagram.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
King Lucas, L-E-E.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
L-E-E, yeah.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
All right.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Let's check it out.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Maybe we'll get one and like hang it on the wall here for our harm attack.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Lovely.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I'll pay you one for free and bring it next time.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
All right.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
All right.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Your free ride is over.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
He's coming back down.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Let's hear it for Lucas, everybody.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Thank you.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Thank you.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Oh, you can still see me.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
And it's all about this view.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
But as I, that is interesting.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
I don't want to, I don't want to, but that is, I told, that didn't even, that was the

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
last thought I had was like, oh yeah, women.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
Like, like, like you, like, like, it's, it's always the last thing I think of before

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
I, like, house keys, women.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
Well, like, if you, if you're like a six foot seven woman, you're going to, you, you

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
probably, you're an experience of a completely different thing.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
It's not like tall person, short person.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
It's like there's an additional layer of like, of course.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Yeah.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
I wanted to ask Lucas, and you could nod yes or no, but I was curious if like, if

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
people, because I was thinking about that exact same thing.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
Like if he was female, women, like a very tall woman may worry about whether or not

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
men are fetishizing their tallness.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Like they have a crumb fetish.

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
You told me on one of our first dates that you, you know, like you, you, you have to

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
wonder whether the, the, the, like a lot of guys ask you out, but you're always wondering

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
if they just want to climb you.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Yeah.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Like I have, I mean, less so now.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Well, I don't know.

43:49.000 --> 43:56.000
Like from time to time I've had a, I've had a crumb body, like big thighs and I feel weird

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
describing my body.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
I think you were speaking from a place of.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Of tallness.

44:00.000 --> 44:06.000
And also that, that like, uh, I think you were referring possibly to the phenomenon of

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
like.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Smaller men.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Gentlemen of a smaller stature, uh, seeming to have a proclivity.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Yes.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Yes.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Exactly.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Yeah.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Yeah.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Which is a weird, which is a weird line across if you're attracted to somebody and then

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
you're like, well, is it am I a fetish for them?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Do you, Lucas, do you experience this?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Sometimes yes.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
I don't know.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
You're asking from the perspective of a lady, right?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
No, no.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
For you.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
Do you ever, do you ever have any, can you tell when someone's like, oh, this is, this

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
is a tall chaser.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
This is a building chaser.

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
I don't date much because people don't see me as a person a lot.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Aw.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000

45:19.940 --> 45:20.940
Aw.

45:20.940 --> 45:21.940
Aw.

45:21.940 --> 45:22.940
Aw.

45:22.940 --> 45:23.940
Aw.

45:23.940 --> 45:24.940
Aw.

45:24.940 --> 45:26.940
I know guys don't loveOG series.

45:26.940 --> 45:33.060
But I think, I think, I think, yeah, I don't know, there might be a disparity there, but

45:33.060 --> 45:35.500
then I think about it, I'm like, yeah, probably not.

45:35.500 --> 45:39.420
Like I think you're evenly dispersed, like men and women who would either have a problem

45:39.420 --> 45:40.920
with that or not have a problem with that probably.

45:40.920 --> 45:45.420
Yeah, I think as long as it's like consensual and not secret, like that's cool, as long

45:45.420 --> 45:50.700
as someone's not hiding their, their deep, I don't know, as long as they, they don't,

45:50.700 --> 45:52.380
they like the person as, as well.

45:52.380 --> 45:55.260
Well, what if somebody was going out with you and they said like, oh, I just love how

45:55.260 --> 45:58.620
you're, I don't know, they said something really specific physically about you and it

45:58.620 --> 46:00.740
was like something that felt temporary.

46:00.740 --> 46:04.580
What if they said, you know, it's like, isn't that the thing that's always being, people

46:04.580 --> 46:11.060
suspect is not being said, like, like, or the, like, oh, I think he might like me.

46:11.060 --> 46:13.060
He talks about my, how hot my body is.

46:13.060 --> 46:14.940
Like red hair.

46:14.940 --> 46:19.940
Red hair, red hair, you can buy in a bottle, you can, it doesn't, it's not, I'm talking

46:19.940 --> 46:24.740
about the terror of like, oh, my boyfriend loves my ass, he loves my, he's always talking

46:24.740 --> 46:28.980
about my ass, like, well, he's not just talking about its existence, he might be talking about

46:28.980 --> 46:36.260
its state of being, at that particular time, that must be fucking horrible.

46:36.260 --> 46:43.460
I, I, I have to find my own shame before I worry about like, my, my, my body and that,

46:43.460 --> 46:48.260
that takes a long time and, and, and then I look really bad, like, I just, I'm just

46:48.260 --> 46:52.620
like, I have to like, have difficulty breathing in my sleep before I'm like, I should lose

46:52.620 --> 46:59.420
some weight, or I'll see myself from 90 degrees, like, profile in a Facebook live video talking

46:59.420 --> 47:07.580
about Trump getting elected and I'll be like, it just looks like a mountain of, of, of,

47:07.580 --> 47:18.700
of leaves, it's like a, a shambling mound, squirrels hiding things in him, but I don't

47:18.700 --> 47:21.980
do anything about it, I got an elliptical in my living room and it's just literally like

47:21.980 --> 47:26.940
sitting there since the day it was assembled, just waiting, just going, what did I do?

47:26.940 --> 47:27.940
Have you ever used it?

47:27.940 --> 47:29.540
I literally have not used it.

47:29.540 --> 47:30.940
How long has it been there?

47:30.940 --> 47:31.940
I don't know, man.

47:31.940 --> 47:32.940
Steve, how long has it been there?

47:32.940 --> 47:35.540
How long has the elliptical been there?

47:35.540 --> 47:42.460
How long has the elliptical been there?

47:42.460 --> 47:51.300
How long since you also found a laptop holder so I could play Minecraft while I was on the

47:51.300 --> 47:53.700
elliptical, thinking that might get me on it.

47:53.700 --> 48:02.140
I think I bought that before the elliptical, yeah, it's all set up and ready to go.

48:02.140 --> 48:08.420
I bought you a tracksuit, that was part of the whole journey.

48:08.420 --> 48:10.100
I want to know more about this tracksuit.

48:10.100 --> 48:11.100
What color is it?

48:11.100 --> 48:13.340
Wait, did Jeff tell you get, get up there please?

48:13.340 --> 48:14.340
No, I did not.

48:14.340 --> 48:15.340
He just fucked it up.

48:15.340 --> 48:16.340
That's awesome.

48:16.340 --> 48:17.340
What?

48:17.340 --> 48:24.340
He just stormed the stage, just signed it up, going, flavor, flavor, flavor, flavor.

48:24.340 --> 48:34.060
All right, well, I mean, maybe as a loving audience, we could all help you get on the

48:34.060 --> 48:35.060
elliptical.

48:35.060 --> 48:42.500
There's a fine line between that and Fatty Fatty 2x4, yeah, like a bunch of people chanting

48:42.500 --> 48:49.700
you need exercise is like, but it's not about your weight, it's just like a healthy thing

48:49.700 --> 48:50.700
to do.

48:50.700 --> 48:57.060
Is it true that you can't make it through the cellar door?

48:57.060 --> 49:02.100
I got a, the tracksuit was the final thing, I was like, I don't have an outfit, am I supposed

49:02.100 --> 49:05.820
to, the neighbors are going to see me with my dick coming out through my holy underwear

49:05.820 --> 49:11.900
and my asshole, they're going to see me in this weird, like, is that Depeche Mode exercising?

49:11.900 --> 49:17.300
Is there a, when we do raps, when you do kicky baby dance, that's like being on the

49:17.300 --> 49:18.300
elliptical.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.780
It's certainly the exercise I currently get.

49:20.780 --> 49:21.780
Yeah.

49:21.780 --> 49:22.780
Yeah.

49:22.780 --> 49:26.700
Or if I tell a story where I'm especially vexed by election results, after a little,

49:26.700 --> 49:33.140
I do this and then like 10 minutes later, you'll be talking and I'll be like, why don't,

49:33.140 --> 49:38.420
why don't my body thinks I was swimming, why don't Steve and Aaron and Spencer and I

49:38.420 --> 49:44.540
like to start coming up with long, like 20 minute, kind of medium tempo rap beats, where

49:44.540 --> 49:49.180
you have to do the kicky baby dance the whole time and then.

49:49.180 --> 49:54.620
I think if everyone was just chanting about how adorable you were, you would exercise.

49:54.620 --> 49:55.780
While I was exercising, yeah.

49:55.780 --> 50:00.180
If everybody was like, if I woke up one morning and I was like, where's all the attention?

50:00.180 --> 50:04.380
And then I could hear it coming from downstairs and it was like, it was like a video game

50:04.380 --> 50:09.660
or a tutorial where I had to get on the elliptical in order to get the attention and I was like,

50:09.660 --> 50:19.740
it started coming in like an incremental clicker game, like that's how I collected cookies.

50:19.740 --> 50:32.100
It's exercise time at Harmontown.

50:32.100 --> 50:34.420
We want you alive.

50:34.420 --> 50:43.180
When you wake up in the morning and you need to move to, to, to, take your mama to the

50:43.180 --> 50:44.180
basket.

50:44.180 --> 50:45.180
Like be the little feet kicking in the air.

50:45.180 --> 50:52.180
Every bird is gonna go to the market soon, be, be, to, to, sign your mama in the order

50:52.180 --> 50:53.180
to do.

50:53.180 --> 51:01.180
I want to fuck your mama's butt, I want to do it in the rut.

51:01.180 --> 51:02.180
Yeah.

51:02.180 --> 51:07.180
Little upper, upper body spin.

51:07.180 --> 51:11.180
I just smelled his pits.

51:11.180 --> 51:14.180
He's not gonna do that.

51:14.180 --> 51:17.180
Shits came out of his own pits.

51:17.180 --> 51:21.180
He hasn't taken a shower in a while.

51:21.180 --> 51:25.180
His girlfriend went out of town for a while.

51:25.180 --> 51:30.180
He's been playing Deus Ex for a while.

51:30.180 --> 51:37.180
That game's pretty hard on the medium difficulty.

51:37.180 --> 51:42.180
Now knees up, knees in the air and knees in the air.

51:42.180 --> 51:44.180
Now elbows to the side.

51:44.180 --> 51:46.180
Now elbows nice and wide.

51:46.180 --> 51:48.180
Now knees up once again.

51:48.180 --> 51:50.180
Count to ten.

51:50.180 --> 51:56.180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

51:56.180 --> 51:58.180
But dance while you're counting.

51:58.180 --> 52:02.180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.180
Again.

52:04.180 --> 52:09.180
You just burned four calories.

52:09.180 --> 52:13.180
Yeah.

52:13.180 --> 52:17.180
All right.

52:17.180 --> 52:24.180
Hit.

52:24.180 --> 52:31.180
What that song reminds me of is my own mortality.

52:31.180 --> 52:33.180
We're all gonna die.

52:33.180 --> 52:37.180
I will make whatever I just burnt off back by,

52:37.180 --> 52:41.180
I'll just lick something back there.

52:41.180 --> 52:44.180
I have ways of scrounging for calories

52:44.180 --> 52:46.180
that people don't even know about.

52:46.180 --> 52:47.180
I find truffles.

52:47.180 --> 52:50.180
I just find truffles.

52:50.180 --> 52:57.180
People don't know that Dan makes most of his money by being a truffle finder.

52:57.180 --> 52:59.180
We just did a joke about Dan Exorcimer.

52:59.180 --> 53:01.180
We were like, no, no, I will not say pig.

53:01.180 --> 53:02.180
Couldn't ever.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.180
All right.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.180
Was that that?

53:04.180 --> 53:05.180
Sorry.

53:05.180 --> 53:07.180
That was you, not me.

53:07.180 --> 53:08.180
Well, no, no.

53:08.180 --> 53:09.180
All right.

53:09.180 --> 53:14.180
Well, so you're not going to get divorced twice.

53:14.180 --> 53:21.180
There are people here that want to present you with this thing

53:21.180 --> 53:25.180
that you tangentially, well, I just had them come out,

53:25.180 --> 53:28.180
are friends from Carrot Top?

53:28.180 --> 53:29.180
Carrot.

53:29.180 --> 53:30.180
Carrot.

53:30.180 --> 53:31.180
Carrot Top.

53:31.180 --> 53:32.180
Carrot Top.

53:32.180 --> 53:34.180
Our friends from Carrot Top?

53:34.180 --> 53:38.180
From Carrot.

53:38.180 --> 53:39.180
Thank you, Steve.

53:39.180 --> 53:40.180
What's up, Dan?

53:40.180 --> 53:41.180
My name is Anthony and this is Claire.

53:41.180 --> 53:46.180
We've never met, but we've worked together before.

53:46.180 --> 53:49.180
We work for a company called Carrot Creative.

53:49.180 --> 53:50.180
Does that ring a bell?

53:50.180 --> 53:51.180
I'm familiar.

53:51.180 --> 53:52.180
Yeah.

53:52.180 --> 53:53.180
You guys do all this great stuff for adult swim like here.

53:53.180 --> 53:54.180
Wizards of marketing.

53:54.180 --> 53:55.180
Wizards of marketing.

53:55.180 --> 53:57.180
Put that on my tombstone.

53:57.180 --> 53:58.180
So.

53:58.180 --> 53:59.180
That would be good marketing.

53:59.180 --> 54:00.180
Yeah.

54:00.180 --> 54:04.180
You're very dedicated.

54:04.180 --> 54:09.180
It takes a strong marketer to volunteer his tombstone space.

54:09.180 --> 54:11.180
I'll just be vaporized into the ground.

54:11.180 --> 54:13.180
I'm not going to have the benefit of a tombstone.

54:13.180 --> 54:14.180
Anyways.

54:14.180 --> 54:16.180
Pass the savings on to a larger tombstone.

54:16.180 --> 54:17.180
Yeah.

54:17.180 --> 54:18.180
There you go.

54:18.180 --> 54:19.180
I'm not even going to die.

54:19.180 --> 54:22.180
I'm just going to get lost like an elf in Middle Earth.

54:22.180 --> 54:25.180
But I still want that fucking big ass tombstone.

54:25.180 --> 54:26.180
Yeah.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.180
There you go.

54:27.180 --> 54:30.180
So the first project we ever did together was something called the Rick and Morty Ricks

54:30.180 --> 54:31.180
Diverse.

54:31.180 --> 54:32.180
Has anybody ever heard of that?

54:32.180 --> 54:36.180
Instagram account that you can waste a lot of time on.

54:36.180 --> 54:42.180
And we actually won an award for it from Cannes Lions from Cannes France.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.180
It's an international award.

54:43.180 --> 54:44.180
So it's not.

54:44.180 --> 54:45.180
It's not an Emmy.

54:45.180 --> 54:47.180
It's not the Emmy you're getting yet.

54:47.180 --> 54:50.180
But we have a Cannes Lion for you.

54:50.180 --> 54:51.180
This is your award.

54:51.180 --> 54:52.180
A Cannes Lion.

54:52.180 --> 54:55.180
This is for you and Justin and for everybody at Starburns.

54:55.180 --> 54:57.180
It's working on Rick and Morty really hard.

54:57.180 --> 55:02.180
It's like I said, it's not an Emmy, but it's heavy as hell and it's made out of real bronze.

55:02.180 --> 55:05.180
You were saying it's like the Academy Awards for advertising, right?

55:05.180 --> 55:06.180
Yeah.

55:06.180 --> 55:07.180
As lame as that sounds.

55:07.180 --> 55:09.180
But it's still a big deal.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.180
Jesus.

55:10.180 --> 55:13.180
Look at that.

55:13.180 --> 55:18.180
But why do I get one?

55:18.180 --> 55:19.180
I didn't do the commercials.

55:19.180 --> 55:21.180
Well, I mean, you had to approve everything.

55:21.180 --> 55:26.180
You can get an award for approving things?

55:26.180 --> 55:28.180
You're part of the team.

55:28.180 --> 55:32.180
I remember at Comic Con a couple of years ago, you gave extensive notes.

55:32.180 --> 55:35.180
I gave no extensive notes of that thing.

55:35.180 --> 55:36.180
These guys had it unlocked, man.

55:36.180 --> 55:38.180
I don't deserve this.

55:38.180 --> 55:44.180
I'm going to give this to clinically tall people.

55:44.180 --> 55:46.180
Accept your award with grace.

55:46.180 --> 55:47.180
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:47.180 --> 55:48.180
I didn't.

55:48.180 --> 55:49.180
Okay.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.180
All right.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.180
That was my Wisconsin thing.

55:51.180 --> 55:52.180
Yeah.

55:52.180 --> 55:54.180
You shouldn't deflect a compliment, but at the same time, I just want to.

55:54.180 --> 55:55.180
Yeah.

55:55.180 --> 55:56.180
Thank you so much.

55:56.180 --> 55:58.180
This is so nice that you would think of me and give this to me.

55:58.180 --> 55:59.180
Thank you.

55:59.180 --> 56:01.180
I'm just saying the system is fucked.

56:01.180 --> 56:03.180
Well, yeah.

56:03.180 --> 56:06.180
But I mean, it is through you that we can do things like this,

56:06.180 --> 56:10.180
because any other show creator be like, I don't care about any of this.

56:10.180 --> 56:12.180
But like, it was because you guys and because you're passionate,

56:12.180 --> 56:13.180
we get to keep doing it.

56:13.180 --> 56:16.180
We've done two different expansions for it.

56:16.180 --> 56:17.180
There might be some more coming up.

56:17.180 --> 56:19.180
We can't technically say, but.

56:19.180 --> 56:20.180
Sounds like there are more.

56:20.180 --> 56:21.180
There's stuff coming up.

56:21.180 --> 56:22.180
So I mean.

56:22.180 --> 56:23.180
There's more.

56:23.180 --> 56:25.180
And when is season three coming out?

56:25.180 --> 56:26.180
What's going on?

56:26.180 --> 56:27.180
I was going to ask you to say.

56:27.180 --> 56:29.180
Oh, shit.

56:29.180 --> 56:31.180
It seems to be taking a while.

56:31.180 --> 56:32.180
It's just drawings.

56:32.180 --> 56:34.180
I think you can.

56:34.180 --> 56:36.180
Why do you keep making Facebook posts?

56:36.180 --> 56:37.180
Just make season three.

56:37.180 --> 56:38.180
Yeah.

56:38.180 --> 56:39.180
Yeah.

56:39.180 --> 56:41.180
I'm tweeting like, oh, yeah, we elected a Nazi.

56:41.180 --> 56:42.180
Hey, just shut up.

56:42.180 --> 56:43.180
Get back to work on season three.

56:43.180 --> 56:45.180
They're drawing it.

56:45.180 --> 56:47.180
I don't draw it.

56:47.180 --> 56:51.180
Why don't you just start approving things faster, Dan?

56:51.180 --> 56:55.180
Maybe that is my approval usually gets on the way.

56:55.180 --> 56:58.180
It took stealth approval to finally make me nail it.

56:58.180 --> 57:04.180
I should just let people do what they were already doing.

57:04.180 --> 57:06.180
It's real fun to kiss.

57:06.180 --> 57:10.180
I can say that.

57:10.180 --> 57:12.180
It's not a Clio, but.

57:12.180 --> 57:13.180
Oh, it's better than a Clio.

57:13.180 --> 57:14.180
It's so much.

57:14.180 --> 57:15.180
This is international, man.

57:15.180 --> 57:16.180
Yeah, yeah.

57:16.180 --> 57:17.180
That's like more than one country.

57:17.180 --> 57:18.180
Yep.

57:18.180 --> 57:21.180
It's like a beautiful, sexy, sleepy lion.

57:21.180 --> 57:22.180
What is it about?

57:22.180 --> 57:24.180
Like, like, like, what's your what?

57:24.180 --> 57:29.680
I talked to a lot of marketing people and at the risk of offending any of the ones that

57:29.680 --> 57:34.180
have worked with me on anything, like, because I don't talk to a lot of good ones.

57:34.180 --> 57:39.180
Like, you guys are clearly like, you're on your shit.

57:39.180 --> 57:42.180
Like, you're thinking about this stuff.

57:42.180 --> 57:46.180
And it's like, what is the, what do I want to ask here?

57:46.180 --> 57:51.180
So I want to ask a question that the answer can get through to like young people that

57:51.180 --> 57:55.180
want to go into marketing or young people that shouldn't go into marketing who should

57:55.180 --> 57:57.180
hear it and go, oh, that's not me.

57:57.180 --> 58:00.180
I should be a cowboy.

58:00.180 --> 58:01.180
What is it?

58:01.180 --> 58:06.180
What is the, at its highest art, you know, like, what is the, there's something fancy

58:06.180 --> 58:12.180
to say about, you know, like the guy in chariots of fire goes, when I run, I feel God's pleasure.

58:12.180 --> 58:14.180
So you can't use that.

58:14.180 --> 58:15.180
What is it about marketing?

58:15.180 --> 58:16.180
What is it?

58:16.180 --> 58:18.180
I don't know what I'm trying to ask.

58:18.180 --> 58:19.180
Just say something.

58:19.180 --> 58:20.180
9-11.

58:20.180 --> 58:21.180
No, it's not.

58:21.180 --> 58:22.180
Okay.

58:22.180 --> 58:24.180
I thought that was about 10% 9-11.

58:24.180 --> 58:25.180
That's right.

58:25.180 --> 58:27.180
Everything is, let's face it.

58:27.180 --> 58:32.180
No, but like, I don't know, you're just kind of take over for me.

58:32.180 --> 58:33.180
Do good.

58:33.180 --> 58:37.180
I mean, it's, this is kind of a hard question to answer for this specific thing.

58:37.180 --> 58:40.180
What Dan's asking you guys is to market marketing.

58:40.180 --> 58:41.180
Yeah.

58:41.180 --> 58:43.180
Sell us on being in marketing.

58:43.180 --> 58:45.180
Gotta think outside the box.

58:45.180 --> 58:49.180
I mean, well something like this, it's hard for me to even say it because it's for something

58:49.180 --> 58:53.180
so specific like Rick and Morty that we were all passionate about and huge fans of before

58:53.180 --> 58:56.180
we were even like twinkles and adult swims eye.

58:56.180 --> 58:57.180
You know what I mean?

58:57.180 --> 58:59.180
I was such a, just a huge fan of everything.

58:59.180 --> 59:02.180
And just, you know, I remember my buddy of mine running into my door room and talking

59:02.180 --> 59:03.180
about, you got to see this thing.

59:03.180 --> 59:06.180
And it was Heat Vision and Jack and like all this other channel 101 stuff.

59:06.180 --> 59:11.180
So it's just the fact that I'm able to work on something that, that I love so much.

59:11.180 --> 59:12.180
That's part of it.

59:12.180 --> 59:15.180
So you're not always be able to get to work on something that you love.

59:15.180 --> 59:19.180
Like I have to work on a lot of like Facebook ads for credit cards to get to Rick and Morty.

59:19.180 --> 59:23.180
So I guess what I could say is like one part of it is giving a shit.

59:23.180 --> 59:28.180
And then part of it is like working your way towards, you can get to something that you

59:28.180 --> 59:31.180
just love and you're able to work on it because you're not going to get it right away.

59:31.180 --> 59:32.180
You might not get it for a long time.

59:32.180 --> 59:33.180
It took me a long time.

59:33.180 --> 59:35.180
Unlike Claire, who we hired just for the Rick's first.

59:35.180 --> 59:38.180
So this was her, her first job out of school.

59:38.180 --> 59:40.180
I'm a brat.

59:40.180 --> 59:41.180
Sorry.

59:41.180 --> 59:44.180
Claire, was it your pitch or did you pitch using Instagram that way?

59:44.180 --> 59:45.180
Oh, 100%.

59:45.180 --> 59:46.180
It was on me.

59:46.180 --> 59:50.180
It was like 10,000% a team effort.

59:50.180 --> 59:55.180
And I actually, at the very beginning, wasn't even brought on until like halfway through

59:55.180 --> 01:00:00.180
production when we realized like, oh shit, we still have a lot to do and this is launching

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.180
in a month or whatever.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.180
Carrot tells all their female employees to say that.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.180
It was her idea.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:07.180
She's, she's being a team player.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:13.180
Anthony and Claire, you came at a pretty propitious moment because speaking of marketing, Dan and

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:17.180
I are marketing a whole new line of workout tapes.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.180
It's called the baby kicky dance.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.180
You guys got to get up there and do it.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.180
One, two, three.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.180
And a one, two, three.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.180
I don't, I don't understand.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.180
Well first, you lift your award up to the sky.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.180
You raise it up with your right hand high.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.180
Then you go down to the left side, lift it up on the left side.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.180
Pass that over.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.180
I can't, I don't think it's.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:49.180
Dan, you're acting like you don't want to sell these workout tapes.

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.180
I can't, I couldn't hear you.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.180
I was being hilarious.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:59.180
I think you were saying bend over and pick something up off the floor and exercise deal breaker.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:05.180
Because I'm going to have another workout tape called learn how to listen.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.180
I can't hear.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.180
I'd learn how to hear.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.180
My ears are dying along with the rest of my body.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.180
How old are you guys?

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.180
You guys dying?

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.180
Definitely.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.180
Can you feel it in your brain?

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.180
We're all technically dying.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.180
Are you?

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.180
To quote Duncan Tressel, God is a murderer.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.180
But are you, are you starting to forget actor's names?

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.180
Like you're just trying to riff.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.180
You're like, ah, and then you take 10 minutes to go.

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.180
Ray Don Chong.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:40.180
It's more that I'll see things online or like bands and like Saturday Night Live,

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180
better on Saturday Night Live.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.180
Like I don't know who that is.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.180
I don't care who that is.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.180
Well, yeah.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.180
Okay.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.180
That's emotionally dying.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180
Yeah.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.180
Well, that's curmudgeonry.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.180
That's that's those are the beginning stages where you're just like, oh, I already did this.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.180
That was called in excess.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.180
And then you're like, like, like, I don't know.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.180
I already saw a Spiderman movie for God's sakes.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.180
But then you slowly, then you start to go like, I don't even know what I'm doing.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.180
And then you go to a Marvel movie and you're like, that was great.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.180
And they're like, you already saw that.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.180
I wrote part of it.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.180
And I'm like me and Stan Lee are just like, all right, great.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:16.180
Excelsior.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.180
I'm acting like I'm just fine.

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.180
I really did.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.180
By the way, I really didn't.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.180
I really did not write it.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.180
People are tweeting me and going like,

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.180
He's being humble.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.180
He wrote the whole thing.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.180
There were parts that have felt like it was you.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.180
I know, but that's the thing.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:34.180
Like if you could think about anybody and I just really like I'm a writer and I don't

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.180
know, my worst name would be those, the people that worked hard on that movie,

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:40.180
the writers of the hearing that they, like, I did not.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.180
There's like a couple of words Tilda Swinton says when she's showing him the

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.180
mirror dimension or something that I think accidentally got in there from like a

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.180
bad version of a scene.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.180
I wrote, like, I didn't, I didn't, I just talked to them about, about portals

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.180
and stuff for a little bit.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.180
But let me ask you this.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.180
Let me.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.180
And they already shot like most of the movie when I talked to them about portals.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.180
So I'm not even saying I gave them the idea for portals.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.180
I'm saying like, I was just like, yeah, portals are neat.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.180
And they're like, yeah, they're like holes.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.180
But doors.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.180
And I was like, yeah, you got it.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:10.180
So let me ask you this because it's something that I'm sort of on the other side

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.180
now for once because of this project.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.180
Like the fact that you got to touch the Doctor Strange movie, you got to say

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.180
things that, write things that Tilda Swinton said.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.180
Like, does that still make you feel something inside?

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.180
More than ever.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.180
I mean, especially the more, I think the longer you've worked.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.180
I guess maybe you get desensitized if you, if you, if you wrote for, I don't know,

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.180
like, I don't know if you were like super duper, I guess if you were Josh Whedon

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:36.180
and then somebody was like, hey, Bob Denver from Gilligan's Island wants you to

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.180
write a commercial for him.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.180
And I guess maybe you wouldn't be less than Starstruck.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.180
No offense to a probably dead, Bob Denver.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.180
But I just, I, but, but, but there's no way.

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:52.180
Like at 43, it was like, it was more like, it was like in those biopics when the,

01:03:52.180 --> 01:04:00.180
when like that, the shitty, like, you know, like weird character that can't get a break

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:04.180
or that like spends his life like saying, we should grow a corn on the moon or

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:08.180
something like, and then it's like, it was like a, it was like a triumph.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.180
It was great.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.180
Cause it was like, yeah, no, I don't even know how to, yeah, of course it was amazing.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.180
Cause that's the thought of it was, I mean, that's what this was to me.

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.180
The fact that I was able to sort of touch Rick and Morty, be able to write in this

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.180
voice and be able to write these comics to be able to name like an alien.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.180
I'm like, Hey, does this alien have a name?

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.180
No.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.180
Can we call it this?

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.180
Sure.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.180
Like I got to name the alien.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.180
Like something like that as somebody who like, not just as like a person, but a

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.180
creative person because I started advertising.

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.180
Did you approve that name?

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.180
I, somebody did.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.180
Here's the thing.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.180
That's really noteworthy.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.180
Like that, that stuff, all that stuff in that Rick's diverse, all of the stuff.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.180
And I assume that they generally are using you guys for all of the stuff that I'm

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.180
always noticing.

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.180
I'm going like, wait, some, some person like just, they just made that up, but it

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.180
kind of falls in line with, with everything.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:58.180
Like it never violates the, it's not about violating the cannon as much as it is

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.180
violating the.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.180
Violate that cannon.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:09.180
Marketing, marketing.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:14.180
That cannon, that cannon does the violating.

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:19.180
It, it, it's, it's, it's violating that though the worry would be violating the

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:24.180
tone, the, the, the tonal IQ or something like that.

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.180
Like, oh, this isn't worthy of, you know, it's like, oh, this is like a hacky joke.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.180
Like someone's just connecting a dot because, oh, that guy's a pencil vester.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.180
So of course they made Penn Stephanie or something like that, where you're just

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.180
like, well, that's not the, no, just don't, don't do that.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.180
Like, like,

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.180
We keep to the code.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.180
What's that?

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.180
We keep to the code.

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.180
Yeah.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.180
Like, and that's, that's not easy when the code isn't just linear dot connection,

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.180
you know, when it's not like, oh, now you play.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.180
Like it's like collaboration.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.180
You guys like fill in with, you're just, you're, you're keeping with the actual

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.180
like tone of the, yeah, it's very impressive.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.180
That shouldn't be, that shouldn't be overlooked.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.180
And obviously some French people didn't overlook it.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.180
Claire and Anthony, Anthony, right?

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.180
Yes.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.180
What's like, can you give us like, is there any like dirty underbelly of marketing,

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.180
like kind of mad men stuff that goes on?

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.180
Like what, what, what goes on in marketing?

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.180
Well, specifically for the can line, it's always a big deal because it's the

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:19.180
international stage that there's just, it started, people show their true colors.

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:22.180
There's a woman out there called Cindy Gallup that you should follow because

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.180
she's like, I don't know what she's specifically done, but she's like the,

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.180
like badass woman in the advertising industry.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.180
And she's exposing people.

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.180
So like with the can lines, there's a number of different awards.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.180
A lot of it, cause we won for the entertainment lines, which is pretty cool

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.180
cause it's all like entertainment.

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.180
That's what everybody's all excited about.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.180
But I mean, everything, billboards, print ads, email marketing,

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.180
they all have lions categories.

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:46.180
And especially like the print ads, there's always, there's like ways to get in it.

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.180
There's, you know, all you gotta do is you gotta run your ad one time in one

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:55.180
random magazine and one random country in order for it to be approved.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.180
And you can qualify for a line.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.180
And then some of these things win because it's always like crazy provocative stuff.

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:04.180
And there was one for some headache brand.

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.180
It was for like their PM product.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.180
And I can't, I'm paraphrasing here, but essentially the concept was,

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.180
give your wife this drowsy making headache product,

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.180
and then you can have sex with her while she's passed out.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.180
And they gave that an award.

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.180
I think I remember that.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.180
I think it was a Jella Pudding Pops commercial.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.180
Right.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:29.180
So, so that got like all these people that are like, oh, that's funny.

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.180
Check it off, check it off.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.180
And so it's one thing that they're like, the judges aren't necessarily looking

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.180
to like, well, is this real?

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.180
Where did this run?

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.180
Is this, was this actually approved?

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.180
It's just those be like, and then they're right off.

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.180
So not only is it offensive that one, this fake thing won an award,

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.180
but it's also in a way it's offensive that these guys just sort of looked

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:51.180
at the, the, the creative concept, which was rape.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.180
And they're like, yep.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.180
And then just checked it off.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:57.180
So I mean, and what Cindy's doing and like just pointing people out,

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.180
putting everybody to task, putting me to task, any male in advertising the task

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.180
as we rightfully should be, especially now, it's just like, hey, this is kind

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.180
of fucked up that we think this is funny.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.180
So there's things like that.

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.180
There was another one that was like a fake app.

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.180
It was this, it was in this, one of the same categories

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.180
that the Rick's first was also up for, which we didn't win,

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:20.180
but this fake app won because it was, it was pulling cashed images of Google Earth

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.180
in like the metagradian sea.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.180
It's like, oh, you can spot refugees.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.180
And if you spot one, press a spot and then we'll let somebody know about it.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.180
But it was fake.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.180
Like it didn't work.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:32.180
They launched it like a week before the ads actually went up

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.180
and the actual app didn't even work.

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.180
Sad. What was it, was it Levi's or what was the?

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.180
I think it was actually a charity.

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:47.180
Oh, so it was actually just a, it wasn't even like, oh, this was a well intended,

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.180
but it'll concede like ad for Snickers bar.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.180
I don't think they put their name on it.

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.180
It was just like con artistry.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:01.180
Yeah, I mean, it's, well, yeah, I've always felt like I'm not qualified

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:05.180
to actually say this, but I've always, always had the suspicion

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.180
until we went to white nationalism with this last election.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.180
Like I always had the suspicion that, that we had our thing going on over here

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:15.180
that we were like the Las Vegas of Earth, that we got this open book,

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:20.180
that we are dwelling among the, the legacy of the promises we made

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.180
and dealing with the fallout with our free press and our, and, you know,

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:28.180
having invented television and then inventing the culture that was based on it,

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:32.180
having diverted from monarchy and any preexisting class system

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:37.180
into a pure like crazy ass, well intended, but totally fucking like

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:42.180
out of control capitalistic class system that, that, that we were over here

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.180
kind of like working all this shit out and everybody in Europe is like,

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.180
like holding their pinky out when they drink their tea and going like,

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.180
yeah, well, fuck those guys.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:56.180
So racist, so sexist, so out of control, so stupid, such gun nuts, all this stuff.

01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:00.180
But that then every once in a while on Facebook, you see this thing that's like,

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:04.180
look at this detergent ad that this country just did.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.180
And it's like a woman puts a Chinese guy in a washing machine

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.180
and because she uses their detergent, he comes out as a big black guy

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.180
and fucks her brains out.

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.180
And that won an award and won that same, not the exact same award,

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.180
but they have a very similar statue.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.180
And it's kind of like, like, like, and then you, and then you saw,

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.180
I also saw, because I clicked on that thing and I was like, oh wait,

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:24.180
and it was also a derivation of a different version of the same ad

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:27.180
where it was also kind of like slight racial components

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.180
compared to like how color is good, protect your color.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.180
Anyways, like, I, it's like, like, I think, I think a lot of shit over there

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.180
is like in the catacombs and like, like, like not bubbled up yet,

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.180
like, like that they're not ready at all.

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.180
And now, now I'm just in a full blown panic because it's like, I thought,

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:45.180
my, my consolation was always that we were, we were the clumsy nutcases

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:51.180
that we came over here, like, to this weird, like, witch burning colony

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.180
where we were like, let's work that out.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.180
And then we're like, oh, people in Africa look different.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.180
Let's work that out.

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.180
And I was like, oh, let's build it.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.180
It's like everything we ever did was just like foot and mouth,

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.180
head up ass, like, like burning both the candles of being a jackass

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.180
at both ends.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.180
And like, while everyone watched and was like, we know how to do it better

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:16.180
because we still have a crown in a case somewhere in a museum.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.180
But now I'm just, now I'm just fucking terrified.

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.180
Because obviously we were, that wasn't the story.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.180
That's not what was happening.

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:26.180
We were, we, we, we, we, we for 200 years, all we did was just rebuild

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:30.180
our own little ad hoc kind of fucking, like, little, like fucking,

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.180
shitty little petitions.

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.180
Well, congratulations on the award.

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.180
Yeah.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.180
I mean, as frivolous as all this.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.180
That was the weirdest acceptance speech I've ever heard.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.180
He never thanked you.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:51.180
If you were hired to sell America, but your demographic was not Trump supporters.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:55.180
He figured out how to sell America to, you know, a certain kind of customer.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.180
And it turned out that was the strategy that worked with the electoral system

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.180
and blah, blah, blah.

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:05.180
If you were, if your job was just to sell our country post-election,

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:08.180
like, you know, like Chipotle probably had somebody come in.

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.180
Another quality.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.180
Okay.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.180
And that guy said, you need to focus on, on salsa.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.180
Yeah.

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.180
Any ideas that have to put you on the spot?

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.180
Like, where would you start?

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:23.180
You'd like, you gotta, so who, who are we selling America to?

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.180
We're selling it.

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.180
So let's say Martians.

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.180
Like, I don't know.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.180
Like, like, but, but they can distinguish between countries.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.180
They're going like, we're going to, we're going to destroy earth,

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.180
but we're going to leave one country left.

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.180
Let's try that.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:39.180
Like, like, like, they're like, show me what you got.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:47.180
The Martians, the Martians are going, there's 250 countries.

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.180
All right.

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.180
You guys, you guys fucked up.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.180
Like, Mars is like, we have, I guess we have less oceans because we just started speaking

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.180
Martian.

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.180
And so, like, we, you guys need to clean this.

01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:05.180
So, so your, your job, America sent you as the marketing guy to the up fronts.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:10.180
So the first thing, um, we're probably in, in competition with, let's say the bigger

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.180
countries, nothing against like all these, like, nothing against Denmark.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.180
Nothing against Malta.

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.180
We're, yeah, they're not going to offer anything to Mars.

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.180
It's going to be us, China and Russia.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.180
What do we got?

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:21.180
Uh, we got some pretty kick ass mountain.

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.180
It also depends on what they're going to be using America for.

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.180
Like, we've got some pretty, we've got some halfway decent infrastructure.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:30.180
Like the internet sucks balls, but other than that, like we've got some pretty.

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.180
Show me what you got.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.180
High waves.

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.180
Some pretty solid highways.

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.180
All right.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.180
Um, pretty solid.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.180
We all have that.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:40.180
That's how it would.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:44.180
I would have started with, I would have started with jazz and rock and roll and shit like that.

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.180
Well, that's the other things we have to know before we can sell America.

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.180
We got to know about the Martians.

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.180
What are they looking for?

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.180
Are they looking for like pure natural resources?

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.180
Well, I got a shitload of oil in Texas this weekend.

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.180
Do you hear about that?

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.180
Did you hear about that?

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.180
They shouldn't.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.180
I can't believe they didn't start looking for it there.

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.180
That's where I go for all my oil.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.180
They're probably post oil at this point.

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.180
Uh, I, well, I did think, yeah, you're right.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.180
I didn't specify, but I think it's interesting that you, that was a tech attack that I didn't

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.180
even think about it.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.180
First of all, you, you're very practically intact.

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:16.180
I'm the first thing you did is sweep 273 nations off the table.

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.180
This is my country too.

01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.180
You know, I got it.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.180
Yeah.

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.180
He, he, he I had a lot of teeth.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.180
Luckily you guys can see that he's saying Denmark right off the bats.

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:29.180
Everybody but China and Russia to go fuck themselves.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.180
That's very smart.

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.180
Now it's a three person race.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.180
This is my 2020 bit starting right now.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.180
Uh,

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:44.780
Clare, how would you go about pitching America under a Trump presidency to an alien race?

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.780
Oh, Jesus.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:49.060
Well, can I first, I'll give you time to think while I refine, because I think that's a good

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:55.620
question to ask me, and it's like, the Martians, the Martians, no, no, no, I mean, his question

01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.820
to me about refining the question, I'm not hijacking your question.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.740
You guys love to watch me be a bad person, and you're just like, he's being a bad person,

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:10.660
it's like you're projecting it a little bit, I'm a bad host, but I'm not a bad person.

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:15.940
I'm helping her by saying like, okay, here's what the Martians, I'll answer that, here's

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.340
what the Martians are looking for.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:28.060
The Martians are looking for, they want to, they want Earth to, they want it to, they

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.020
want to plug and play, they want to like walk away from it, they want to, they're going to

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:37.100
use their bombs, or what a Martian raised, to wipe out all but one country, thinking

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:42.860
that that country will then be the only country on this place called Earth.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:47.380
And their goal is, they're looking for the country that represents the best of what the

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:53.500
human species has to offer, intergalactically, there, take it.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.020
So I would definitely take them in and out first.

01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:00.260
Oh, there you go, yeah, take them out to a nice lunch, show them a burger.

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.260
Exactly.

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.260
There you are.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:07.620
I mean, if we're looking at like, if they want to keep, say, Earth is going to be like

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.460
this sort of zoo, not zoo, that's going to be awful, that's going to be an awful way

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:12.460
to get into it.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.420
No, it's not going to be a zoo, it's going to have to, it's going to have to trade with

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.420
them.

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.620
I mean, so they're looking for a collaborator, otherwise they just blow us up and put like

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:22.700
a, they put a Martian in and out there, but they, they're saying like, well, you guys

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:28.500
are, you're blocked, you're arguing with each other, you can't agree, you've got some

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.140
people thinking that you should put a tarp on your, on the female half, and you've got

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.740
other people thinking that cars are more important than bullets, and bullets are more important

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:36.740
than feet.

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:41.140
Like, like, you can't figure out your value system, you don't have any kind of, you need

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.540
to get into the Star Trek mode of like, each planet has a gimmick, each gimmick is like,

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:50.740
we like war, we like logic, we like the color green, like, like all we're hearing when we

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.660
listen to Earth is a bunch of static, we're looking for the country that's going to like,

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:58.780
you know, next, we're going to, we're going to blow everybody else up, let the one country

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:04.660
repopulate so that it's like their language, their culture, their, you know, their history

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.420
will become, you know, their, their curation of the previous history before everyone got

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.660
blown up, like all of that shit, next time we come back around, those people, that country

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:16.180
will be the planet, and so who's it going to be?

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.460
Why should it be America?

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:21.820
I think it's because we have the raw tools to do it.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.300
If you look at America compared to everybody else, and I know considering this election

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.220
was one because of like, from the help of a white nationalist movement, I think of what

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:35.420
sets America great is our capacity for diversity, that we can like point at, I know, but we

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.580
can point, we can point at, yes.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:43.420
If the aliens were going to have like, dinner party meetings with every nation, who would

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:44.420
you invite?

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.220
What Americans would you be like, oh, I'm going to have these celebrities, and we're

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.060
going to serve this, and the music's going to be this.

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.060
You know what you do?

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.060
You just have the aliens.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.580
This is when I would punt to my producer.

01:17:54.580 --> 01:18:00.300
If you're me, you just say, aliens, we're going to have, we're going to sit down, we're

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:07.700
all going to go to Dentana's, and you're going to meet, you're going to meet Aerosmith,

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.820
and they're just going to tell you some fucking awesome rock and roll stories, and then you

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:17.260
get them real high, and then you steal their resources.

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:23.220
Well, I guess if it's just like a face-to-face meeting, I would probably hire more character

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.220
actors than anything.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.700
Who's the guy with the big mustache from the big old-

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.540
Dennis Farina.

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.540
Sam Elliott.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.540
Sam Elliott?

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.540
Yeah.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:37.940
I wonder what a commercial by Sam Elliott for Earth would sound like.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.660
I'm Sam Elliott for Earth.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.620
It's not what's for dinner.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:57.180
We're not a steak, we're a planet, but America is the potatoes on that plate, because marketing

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:09.220
research has proved that you eat the potato first, and then Sam Elliott just stabs everybody.

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:13.980
I would say to them, I guess, given my criteria, I would say, but you would do it as Rosie

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:14.980
Perez.

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:23.740
I would say to them, well, look, we've been trying to do what you're talking about for

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:29.260
a long time, like blowing everybody else up and taking their place.

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.420
We might not be the best candidate for the job, but at least we know what you're talking

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.260
about when you pitch it.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:39.140
You pick China, you might come back, and they're just like, we love being China, and like half

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.060
the planet just sitting there, fucking go with America, man.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:46.460
Hello, I'm Sam Elliott for America.

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.140
Our Chinese food is better than China.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:54.900
They eat any fucking thing over there.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:59.060
We cold it down to the good stuff.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.020
And then he stabs everybody.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:08.340
There's only one country in the planet Earth that has murder vans, and it ain't America.

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:14.060
Also, oh shit, look, it's Aerosmith.

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.260
We're the only country that has Aerosmith, so fuck everybody else.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:21.540
All right, I think we should thank our marketing people from Carrot.

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:25.260
We'll cheap the award.

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.260
Thank you.

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.260
Thank you.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.260
Carrot Creative, everybody.

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.260
Claire and Anthony.

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:38.260
Now, Steve, is that why you came out to bring the Carrot people out?

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:41.700
I didn't know how to get them out, but I was happy to be a part of this...

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:42.700
Steve, you're staying.

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.700
Exercise conversation.

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:46.700
Can you just stay up here?

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:53.260
You're like a little sleepy hoodie gnome right now.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.860
Harmon works Steve so hard.

01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:00.020
Because Steve...

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:02.540
That he's constantly sleeping.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:09.540
This Steve's job is to make it easier for me to do more things.

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:16.660
Steve's job...

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.380
Our crowd's funny as we are right now.

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.100
I disagree with him completely.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:27.780
Based on that, I would have agreed with him five minutes ago, that Steve's job thing.

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.780
You should be able to let that over the plate.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:30.780
Have you guys...

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:33.780
You shouldn't get that excited about sounds.

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:34.780
Sorry.

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.780
Have you guys been doing any role-playing?

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.940
No, not since Harmon Quest yesterday.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:49.980
But on the show, on Harmontown, no, we have not done any shadow runs or any pathfinder

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.980
in a long time.

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:52.980
Sorry.

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:56.900
Since you're replacing Spencer, do you want to do a little DM for a second?

01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:03.900
Do you want to be our Dungeon Master?

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:08.900
I mean, Aaron, I know that you try to shy away from game-playing.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:14.740
He had to be passed out with a mustache on an ottoman.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:19.420
That Lion Award, just the trophy, I'm not talking about the honor of receiving it.

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:24.500
Just talking about the trophy itself.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.860
It's not able to sit on anything.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:31.660
It says to you, hang me on a wall or go fuck yourself.

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.660
Now, that's good marketing.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:34.660
Oh, really?

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.660
Does it?

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:43.660
Oh, it balances on the pause!

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:52.340
Dan, I'm so happy I was here for that breakthrough.

01:22:52.340 --> 01:23:01.340
I just love that the answer also is cute, that it's a lion, but then it's a little pause.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:05.340
Do you, Dan, or do you, Aaron, want to decide what kind of realm we're in, what kind of

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:06.340
game we're playing?

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.340
The Sharpie Quark?

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.340
Throwback?

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.340
Sharpie Quark?

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.340
Throwback.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:15.460
Steve will enter at some point.

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:29.620
We now take you to the old school of early days D&D slash Pathfinder.

01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:35.060
You find yourself Sharpie and Quark.

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.060
We did it!

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.060
We found ourselves!

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.060
We found ourselves!

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:43.260
Is there a last week, or is it, like, this is when Spencer would say what happened.

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.260
Do you want to do a wrap-up?

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:56.260
Previously on Harmontown, Sharpie and Quark fought two giant hydras wearing hats.

01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.620
The hats contained puzzles, and it took them a long time to complete the puzzles, but they

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:05.660
successfully completed those puzzles, and now they have found themselves in the shoot-a-cores

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.740
realm.

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:18.820
They, after walking down an incorrect door, have now found themselves in a wet room, surrounded

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.820
by small objects.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:27.140
This is Harmontown, or what did Spencer say this week on Heart, what is Lou?

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.140
Well, he would, well...

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.140
What would he do?

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.740
He would say, sometimes you'd say, last time on Harmon Time.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:38.340
Oh yeah, last time on Harmon Time, but will they find themselves out of the wet room containing

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:46.100
small figurines, each figurine detailed and odd.

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:49.180
What secrets did the figurines contain?

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.100
Who owed them previously?

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.980
What are they worth?

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:59.580
You're kind of going from recap to wrap-up, which...

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:05.460
It sounds like, it sounds like we just had an adventure.

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:16.100
Now you're going to say, you learned it from sleeping with me, because I always start sex

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.180
by telling them how I had sex with them last time.

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:23.700
Yeah, and just apologizing.

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:27.380
But will you now, and then I go to sleep?

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:30.700
How many apologies constitute a relationship?

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.700
Okay.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.700
You're in a wet room with small figurines.

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.900
We're in the wet room, we're in the wet room, okay, you find yourselves in a wet room surrounded

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:37.900
by figurines.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:43.100
All right, Sharpie, I have detect magic, so I detect magic on the figurines.

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.700
You do that.

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:52.780
You see there are two figurines on the far right side of the square room that are shaped

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:59.260
like clowns, and you detect magic on them.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.740
Do I detect good magic or evil magic on these?

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.020
Let me roll.

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.500
You don't know, you just know there's magic.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:12.660
All right, I take one of the figurine clowns in my hand and I toss the other one to Sharpie.

01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.660
That happens.

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:23.220
All right, I walk toward him and I hold my clown figurine towards his clown figurine,

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.220
and we make them like kiss.

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:31.940
When you're making them kiss, you see their eyes glow red, and you smell something that

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:41.940
smells like burning rubber, and you hear a cackling.

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:47.940
Duh.

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:50.940
SpongeBob SquarePants.

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:58.620
To your right, you see SpongeBob SquarePants licensed character from the Cartoon Network.

01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:02.340
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.620
Is that a reference to SpongeBob?

01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:08.620
Yeah, he's nailing SpongeBob right now.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.820
It's Sharpie's turn.

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:20.340
I approach this young kkknave.and say, Prithee, Gramercy's Renfairee talk.

01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:24.300
We are two explorers that have lost our way.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:29.220
Are you native to this realm?

01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.220
No.

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:37.940
Looking at SpongeBob, you see that he's wearing tattered clothing.

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.740
His shorts are not as you would expect them to be.

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.300
It seems like he's been through some sort of war or siege.

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:54.060
Oh, God, can you imagine how long it would take to waterboard SpongeBob?

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.220
You poor thing.

01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:03.620
But we're bringing it back, we're bringing it back, because a lot of these guys, I'm

01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.420
sure they did something wrong anyway.

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:17.180
I say to SpongeBob, I say to SpongeBob, we heard your cackling, are you friend or foe?

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.180
Friend?

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:26.660
I sense his equivocation, and I pull out my emerald dagger.

01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.700
All right, let me roll that.

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.460
But I don't use it.

01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:34.460
I just pull it out.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:38.500
I say, whoa, man, I mean, somebody can be not sure they're your friend and still be

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.500
a good person.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.300
Right, yeah, I'm using Bluff right now.

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.300
Oh, yeah.

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.020
Did I kind of blow that for you?

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:49.820
Yeah, I think the icing's off that cupcake now.

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:53.940
Yeah, well, you always do fuck things up, because you're too soft.

01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:54.940
Fuck this guy.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:55.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:03.260
As you say, fuck this guy, all of the figurines in the room, including clowns and children

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:12.020
kissing, and because precious moments figurines and angels and small lions and birds and

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:18.820
a butterfly, all of their eyes glow red, and the lasers from their eyes meet in the middle

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:23.020
of the room into a pyramid, and you hear it buzzing.

01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:29.260
Uh, guys, we've got company.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:32.220
I cast Mystic Smoke Bomb.

01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.220
All right, hold on a second.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:41.740
Because what you don't know is that Dan and I have anti-smoke bomb goggles that we can

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:50.260
see through the smoke, but nobody else can, unless they have a will-save of 22.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.260
That happens.

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.260
All right.

01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:58.860
Casting Smoke Bomb, the smoke fills the room, Spongebob is disoriented for a second, but

01:29:58.860 --> 01:29:59.860
we can go-

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.860
Whoa.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:11.300
You should get experience points for also doing the face, as far as I know, because

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:16.300
I've never heard the cartoon, but I know Spongebob when I see him.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.300
He's really vanilla.

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.300
He's transformed.

01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.300
Yeah.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:26.460
Using your smoke goggles, you see on the far side of the room, a hatched door with an

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.660
intricate lock.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.660
Sharpie, you have-

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.660
I cast Intricate Key.

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:36.700
All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.220
Waving my hands in a magical manner.

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:47.660
That works, using Intricate Key, the hatch unlocks, revealing a tunnel that is lit with

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.660
green light.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:51.900
I dive through the tunnel.

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.340
Diving through the tunnel, you feel your clothing changing.

01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:08.220
Uncanny Dodge Imitation, he becomes a Pontiac.

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:19.620
The dads of the world rejoice.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.740
I open up the driver's door and get inside Sharpie.

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:36.980
Getting inside your friend, getting inside your friend, you examine the inner workings

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.420
of his.

01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:44.740
I put the Pontiac Sharpie into drive and I hit the gas pedal through the tunnel.

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:49.020
Through the tunnel, you feel your clothing change.

01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.220
Your clothes, what was Sharpie before?

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.220
A person.

01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:55.220
Him, you mean, right, Quark.

01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:57.220
Quark, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:04.500
Quark, you feel yourself, your clothing changes into a red leather jumpsuit.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:13.580
Your shoes become beautiful black shoes.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:18.260
I start singing a print song.

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:21.940
Purple droplets drop down from the top of the tunnel.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:29.260
As you get through the tunnel, you find yourself in a darkly lit living room, all of the furniture

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:38.900
upholstered with leopard, and in the corner is a man, a quiet man, small of stature, but

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.140
great of sexuality.

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140
Dudley Moore?

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140
Hello.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:52.340
Well, I'm still a car, so I just say vroom, vroom.

01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:55.500
You don't have to be a car anymore if you want to go back into not-

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:59.500
But you're in this room, you're no longer a car.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:03.500
Do you get out before I turn into a person?

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.500
I can't breathe.

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.500
My gallbladder.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.500
I can't breathe.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:17.980
You're a full scart for life by this process.

01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:22.500
I use my emerald dagger to carve my way out of his body.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.580
Oh, Jesus.

01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.580
That's fine.

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.580
Anything but this.

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:29.580
His feet are on my appendix.

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:36.460
I plop out, and I use my green potion of healing to heal up the wound that I left.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:42.420
That happens, and is effective.

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.900
Who are you people?

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:50.420
We were about to ask you that very question.

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:59.100
You look at him and recognize him as an androgynous superstar, sexuality, sex.

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:08.020
You realize that you are in the afterlife, and this is, in fact, the posthumous prince.

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:17.420
But not that prince, the prince of the scar glue realm, whose laws restricted people for

01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.700
years and years.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:24.300
You have a lot of beef against this person, but you know that he is a dangerous prince,

01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:27.700
but he models himself after a prince.

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.700
The artist.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:34.220
The artist, formally, and then.

01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:37.140
Did you ask us a moment ago who we are?

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:38.140
I did.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.580
Ask it again.

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.580
Who are you people?

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:47.060
The two guys about to kick your shit.

01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:56.820
And I link hands with Sharpie, and we do that weird like something, we kind of caress thumbs.

01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:01.420
And magical energy emanates because of our spell of friendship.

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.940
Friendship!

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:07.460
You notice movement in prince's pants.

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:17.020
Well, I'm going to hit you with my magical dick.

01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:24.340
This produces a fermented elephant's dick in a jar.

01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:33.300
It is disgusting, but also majestic.

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.780
I use it.

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.620
I go to hit them with it.

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.620
I'm sorry.

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.620
How are you using this?

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.620
Are you going to like...

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:40.620
Be really specific.

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:43.460
Yeah, I need to roll for a specific fish.

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.380
It's like, it's cut off from the body, right?

01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:47.620
So it's just like something I can hold like a mallet.

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:50.420
You got a magical pickled elephant's dick in a jar.

01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.540
It's like a curio.

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:59.460
Well, I unscrew the jar, I take the giant dick out, I hold it like a mallet.

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:00.460
What?

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:01.460
I'm joking.

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:09.180
And then I charge at Sharpie, no, I charge at where their hands meet and try to destroy

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.180
the link.

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.180
Okay.

01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:12.180
All right.

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.180
Hold on.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.180
Hold on.

01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.180
Hold on.

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:18.260
I'm going to be using at Sharpie and Quirk's meeting.

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:22.860
I've never seen this side of you.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:29.100
Sharpie takes 12 damage.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.980
Quirk uses dodge and he takes no damage.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:38.820
I tumble away and I pull out, I still have my emerald dagger in my hand, which I believe

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:43.340
has now a keen edge to it dealing more damage.

01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:49.700
And I, as I roll, I roll and I try to slice him in the leg.

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:52.980
Rolling in slow motion like the Matrix.

01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.540
Quirk slices his leg.

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.220
Well, hold on.

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:01.700
For our listeners, he's just pantomiming dice right now.

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:05.260
Does anybody here have dice on them?

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.260
You do?

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.260
Yes.

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.260
Get him up here.

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.260
I'll take those dice, baby.

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.260
At least a D20.

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.260
Let me see.

01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:13.540
At least a D20.

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.540
Let me have those dice.

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:16.540
Why are you just sitting there?

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.540
Where?

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:23.020
I asked that question pretty certain that somebody was going to have these dice.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.020
Is he going to his car?

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.020
What's happening?

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.020
All right.

01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.020
Continue.

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.020
Okay.

01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:30.020
Okay.

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:31.020
Roll.

01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:32.020
All right.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.020
Okay.

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.020
You.

01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.020
Are you there?

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.740
Oh, thank you.

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:47.140
In a small black velvet pouch, a man comes up from the audience producing a small, velveteen

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:48.140
pouch.

01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.140
Okay.

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:50.140
You find dice in them.

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.140
Okay.

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.900
So, so you, you try to slice at the ankle.

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.540
I aim for the first leg to try to cut him with my dagger.

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:56.540
Okay.

01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:57.540
With a keen edge.

01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.540
Okay.

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:06.060
You do not slice his leg, but you braise it showing that you are business.

01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.060
I braise it.

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:08.060
Yeah.

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:13.380
You, you, you, I, like, meaning I can a welding fashion or I make like a nice roast out of

01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.380
it.

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.380
There.

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.380
Where's this guy?

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.380
I have more pouches.

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.380
Not to be outdone.

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:26.980
Unless you think nerds don't have their own hierarchy.

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:35.660
An alpha nerd with a tense ponytail or full on man bun just came up with a much larger

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:41.500
equally black velvet sack bulging with millions of dice.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.340
It couldn't be more or less phallic.

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.340
Yeah.

01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:49.380
I'm being presented with sacks of increasing size.

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.380
Okay.

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.380
Okay.

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.380
Okay.

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.380
Fine.

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.380
Okay.

01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:55.380
Okay.

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.380
So, I, I lightly braise him.

01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:01.020
I lightly braise his leg and I put a little shallots on there, a little white pepper,

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.140
a little olive oil.

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.140
That happens.

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:08.020
And I, I, I, I, I cast a preheat to 350.

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.020
All right.

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:10.020
Hold on.

01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.020
Hold on.

01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:12.020
Hold on.

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.020
Hold on.

01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:17.660
Uh, that, there's like a slight heat, but it doesn't do anything.

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660
Ah, shit.

01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:21.420
It was a critical fail.

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:25.820
I'm just waiting now for like a dune pilot to float up and put a giant asthma inhaler

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:28.820
on the table.

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:37.820
Suddenly, the floor turns into bandanas, thousands and thousands of bandanas.

01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:39.820
Oh no.

01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:41.940
Oh no.

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:42.940
My kryptonite.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:50.340
You all fall, you feel yourselves, all three of you feel yourselves falling through the

01:39:50.340 --> 01:40:03.140
realm of bandanas and into a new room that resembles a pumpkin.

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:07.620
Do we, the inside of a pumpkin, like we're inside a giant pumpkin?

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:14.580
I mean, how could a room resemble the outside of a, how well inside a pumpkin would you

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:16.580
know it was a pumpkin?

01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:27.900
This is, you really aren't nailing Spencer, you fall through the bandanas and, and Prince

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:28.900
has disappeared.

01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:29.900
It's just the two of you.

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:30.900
Okay.

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.900
You don't know where he's gone.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.900
That was a close call.

01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:36.540
We almost got beaten up by the Prince's craggledore.

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:48.180
I take the pumpkin seeds and I get some artisanal sea salt and I put them on a cookie sheet

01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:51.180
and I bake the pumpkin seeds.

01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.180
I'm in Spencer character right now.

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.580
There are no pumpkin seeds.

01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.580
Oh.

01:40:55.580 --> 01:41:02.460
And you start to hear a faint singing.

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:11.980
I examine my, I listen.

01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:27.820
You are my fire, the war, desire, cliffhanger, Steve Levy, Jeff Davis, Erin McGathy, give

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:36.420
her a hand, Lucas, thank you, Lucas.

01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:45.620
Our chariot friends, our marketing chariot, our, our, our, our, our dice wielders.

01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:46.620
Thank you so much everybody.

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:47.620
That's been Hamilton.

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:48.620
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:50.620
The black guy that had to sit behind the tall guy.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:56.380
The black guy that's happened to be the tall white guy, if that's not a metaphor for the

01:41:56.380 --> 01:42:03.500
current state of America, we're all the black guys sitting behind a tall guy now.

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.500
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:25.660
I should marry Dan Harmon, drive fast, take chances.

01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:26.660
Did you get any of that?

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:27.660
It's a good show.

01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:56.660
Feral Audio.
