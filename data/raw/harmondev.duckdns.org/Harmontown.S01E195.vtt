00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
From Hollywood, California, at Meltdown Commerce, the nerdest, nerdy, nerdy, melty merch, Harmontown is now in session.

00:20.000 --> 00:40.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden. You know what? He's crashed at it. I forgot he's not here. I guess in a pinch, let's bring out Rob Schwab.

00:40.000 --> 00:58.000
In a pinch. Give me some cards.

00:58.000 --> 01:10.000
Rob, you want to do like a minute or two before Dan comes out? I can do some table magic. Table magic? Table magic. I need some cards in the Sharpie.

01:10.000 --> 01:32.000
Is anybody here have a deck of cards? Is anybody here have a blank deck of cards? I'm going to put my own symbols on it. And my own royalty. No, a blank set of cards.

01:32.000 --> 01:43.000
Everybody just give me a blank set of cards and I will do some table magic. I'll make up my own royalty. Okay. I'll introduce Dan and then I'll make it. No.

01:43.000 --> 01:57.000
You're saying Dan doesn't come out until you get some three by five cards. I'm not being clear. I want a blank set of cards and a Sharpie. Dan, go.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
Dan Hummer is bringing out.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Dan, go away.

02:10.000 --> 02:20.000
Rob, how much lead time do you want? Just a few seconds. Should I stall until then? Should I fill time? Fill time.

02:20.000 --> 02:37.000
You know, the Feral Audio Network. It's the Lexus of Audio Networks. And if you go to feralaudio.com, you get a free Maserati.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
A little bit more.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Maserati is the Lexus of cars.

02:46.000 --> 02:55.000
How much more do you need? Just one more. This is going to be a good set of cards.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
The person I'm about to introduce needs no introduction. You know him as the mayor of the show that you came to see. You ready, Rob?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Yes. Go for it. Let's do this.

03:07.000 --> 03:24.000
Dan Harmon.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Our guest has a hard out tonight.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
I have a hard out for you.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I want you to pick one card.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
This is just table magic.

03:44.000 --> 03:59.000
That's the card you got. Now read it. Aids.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
But how did he know?

04:03.000 --> 04:14.000
The nose knows. The nose knows, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, the nose knows. I like the table.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I'm so nervous about tonight. Who are you doing?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm not nervous at all.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
This is an important night for me.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I know it's important to you.

04:22.000 --> 04:31.000
I feel great. I feel good. I'm so fucking drunk right now.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Dan?

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
We have a guest here tonight that I'd like to talk to.

04:38.000 --> 04:49.000
Needs no introduction.

04:49.000 --> 05:02.000
We're going to talk to him about the emerging world of new media because all media is new to him because he was there at the actual birth of fucking television when it was all beginning.

05:02.000 --> 05:12.000
He's written on, what? Written on, created. He's developed over 100 shows. I don't even know how it's possible.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
All 100 of them.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
Some of them are more noteworthy than others. All in the family. Sanford and son. Good times. Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Fernwood tonight.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
The Jeffersons. The Jeffersons I skipped right over as one of the, I mean, let's just bring them out.

05:31.000 --> 05:57.000
All of you millennials have no idea how fucking awesome this is. You have no idea. This is really cool. Dan, take it away.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Thanks, Rob.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Please do not screw this up, Dan.

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
All right. So you have this documentary coming out that's about you. Did you have a hand in any of it editorially?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Like Harmontown.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Absolutely. Two women made it.

06:17.000 --> 06:33.000
They're two great women.

06:33.000 --> 06:42.000
And you had an agreement with them. I'm sure they're very reverent of you, but in order to make a, I got a sneak peek at it.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
It's a very powerful emotional portrait.

06:45.000 --> 06:54.000
You did a great job. It's an American master. So PBS didn't want anybody to see. I mean, it's a rule of the game.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
And they made sure I saw none of it.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
And then you finally saw it and you, how'd you feel?

07:02.000 --> 07:11.000
You know, I saw it with, it opened Sundance. It opened the festival. So that was a great compliment to the film.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
And I saw it with my family. So I was just wondering how's my wife like it. My kids, I have six kids.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
They were all there. What are they thinking? I have yet to really sit down and see it.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah. I mean, one of the more powerful emotional themes that keeps coming up is about your dad.

07:31.000 --> 07:42.000
But let's put a pin in that because the really interesting thing to me is that, I mean, your career in television before,

07:42.000 --> 07:50.000
it's almost a footnote in an equally amazing just lifetime. It describes you, you describe yourself in your book,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
sitting with that crystal radio. Do you want to talk about that for a moment? That first experience you had with?

07:56.000 --> 08:05.000
You don't. Do you want to sing about it?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You know about it?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
A little song?

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
No. Do you know about the crystal radio set he's talking about?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I do not.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
Why don't you tell me, Mr. Lear?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
My dad went to prison when I was nine years old.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
And when I was eight and a half, tending toward nine, we made a crystal radio set.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
It was one of the best times I could remember having with him.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
And he was gone and I'm fully with the little crazy.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
You had the headphones and a little what they call the cat's whisker over this little crystal.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
And if you caught a signal, you were lucky. And I caught a signal.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
And I was unlucky because the signal I caught had a guy by the name of Father Coglin.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
He was a priest who had a big radio show.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
And he was a madman and a vicious anti-Semite and anti-Rosevelt.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
And he liked the things he heard beginning in Germany.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I'm talking about 1931.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
And you're a kid of nine years old and you're listening to this guy.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I'm listening to this guy and he hates Jewish people.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
And it was the first time I knew anything about anti-Semitism,

09:39.000 --> 09:47.000
which it didn't take me long to realize if I was hurting as a result of a Father Coglin,

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
these people I didn't see a lot of at that time in my high school and my school black people.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I started to see a lot of them a little bit later.

09:57.000 --> 10:06.000
And I had an automatic affinity for everybody who was suffering even more than we were.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I thought that was an interesting part of your...

10:08.000 --> 10:17.000
But I want to make mention of we had civics classes in those years.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
So we were learning at that tender age about the Declaration of Independence,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment.

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
All of those guarantees that this country was going to protect all of us

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
and we would have equal protection under the law.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
And that saved my ass emotionally.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
You mean it protected you from the fear?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I don't know, but...

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
Do you mean listening to this guy and feeling you might have felt hunted and endangered if it weren't for civics classes?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
My country said he was evil and wrong.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
And we don't have civics classes in public schools anyway.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
They cut that like they cut the arts and music and all those things

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
that bring us together make us feel as one seem to go first.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Something we hung onto is the Pledge of Allegiance,

11:14.000 --> 11:25.000
which you mentioned on this really stirring patriotic portrait of the America that you belong to at that time.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
An America that hadn't entered World War II yet.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
You talked about patriotism, you talked about being at parades with your grandfather,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
you talked about what it felt like to be proud to be an American back then.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And one thing that you mentioned that caught my attention was

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
this was before they had gratuitously added under God to the end of the Pledge of Allegiance.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
When did they add that?

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I could have looked it up, but I figured you were coming.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I think it was 1936.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
I mean, recently they added that.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
This idea that this is one of the dragons that you fought your whole career and very capably.

12:03.000 --> 12:13.000
It's this weird, this morality concept that some people say has something to do with Christian values,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
which you would not argue with, I don't get the impression.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
But what you would argue with is that being shoved down people's throat

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
and unduly influencing elected office and things like that,

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
which is why in the 80s when the moral majority started...

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
That's when I started People for the American Way.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
To fight the moral majority, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swagger,

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
all those guys that were building these giant congregations,

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
insisting that you were a good American or a bad American.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
I mean, you were a good Christian or a bad Christian, depending on your political point of view.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
I didn't start People for the American Way at the beginning.

12:59.000 --> 13:07.000
I just did a 60-second television spot with a working guy sitting on a piece of factory equipment

13:07.000 --> 13:15.000
and saying that he and his family sit around the dinner table, breakfast table,

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
talking politics all the time, his wife and his kids disagree about all kinds of things,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
and he disagrees, but here come these ministers.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
He said on radio and television, telling you you were a good Christian or a bad Christian,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
if you agree with them, you're a good Christian.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, I agreed with them on a lot of political stuff, so I was a good Christian.

13:36.000 --> 13:44.000
My wife was a bad one, and I've got to tell you, I know my wife is a hell of a much better Christian than I am.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
And he winds up saying, so there's got to be something wrong.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
When anybody tells you you are a good or a bad Christian, depending on your political point of view,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
that's not the American way he said.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
It also ties into something you talked about, about comedy,

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
in the part where you're talking about Jerry Lewis, which we can start to talk about,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
your early career, which gets pretty fascinating.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
But you stopped while talking about Jerry Lewis and talked about the way you put it,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
because if you're comedically empowered and paraphrasing you,

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
once you become so popular for making people laugh that you can do whatever you want next,

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
you can continue to be a clown, or you can rise to the papacy, you said.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
And that idea that certainty is the enemy in comedy as well,

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
not to put words in your mouth, but that Jerry Lewis being an example of somebody who became so certain of himself

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
and a sense of control, his need for control, that maybe he started to get a little unfuddy.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, he became a kind of pope figure.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
You know, he makes his own point. I don't have to talk about that.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
If you've ever seen the years of muscular, the muscular dystrophy, telethon,

15:03.000 --> 15:11.000
you can watch him at the beginning being the most hilarious 35 years ago or however many.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
I mean, he was the funniest man I ever met.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
And we all but died laughing at Simmons, my partner and I.

15:20.000 --> 15:28.000
And then little by little he became, he knew everything.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
And every year he did that telethon as the master of ceremonies,

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
and you can see him change over the years and become that figure.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
You know, when they split up everybody thought Jerry was going to have a huge, huge career.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
What was Dean going to do without Jerry?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
And Dean did better.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
And now I guess you now tell him about the birthday candle.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Jerry Lewis.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
It's funny a moment as I can ever recall.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Please, please, this blew my mind. Please tell us.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
It was, we were doing, I think, the third or fourth Colgate Comedy Hour.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And the guys were in Chicago.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
So we were, they were at the Che Paris in Chicago.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
And we were staying at the, and I forget the name of the hotel, the fanciest hotel in the...

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Drake. The Drake.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Did you say Drake? The Drake.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
No.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Was it the Drake?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
No.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
It was just the worst game show I've ever been on.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Drake.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
He, it was Jerry's birthday.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
And Eddie and I, we were on the same floor.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
And we went to pick him up.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
We were all going out to dinner. We were going to meet Dean in the lobby.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And we knocked on his door.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
Again, that was his birthday. And, come in.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
And so we opened the door. It was pitch dark.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
And we tiptoed in in the darkness.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
And suddenly there was a lit candle.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I mean, a match lit.

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
And as the match descended, we saw him with an erection.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
And sitting naked.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
With an erection and a baby candle in it.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Wait, in it?

17:39.000 --> 17:48.000
Singing Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Jerry Lewis.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Norman.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I'm the king of birthdays.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
I have a couple of follow-up questions on that.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
How long do you think he'd been waiting there for that?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Do you think it was like five minutes?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Long enough to get an erection.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
I think he could have heard the knock and run into him.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Oh, really?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
The candle was in.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
The candle, no, he'd have to be sitting there a little while with the candle.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
There was preparation there.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
How long was the candle in his dick?

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
Just so you guys know, November 12th.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
That's when it took place?

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
No, that's my birthday.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
You're invited, Norman.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
If the lights are out, don't worry about it.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah, if the lights are out, please come inside.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
I was wondering when I heard these old Hollywood stories.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
I'd like to go back to say that there was never anybody funnier than he was those years.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
And that was a hilarious prank among thousands of hilarious pranks.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
No, you literally truly loved him.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I mean, you say so.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
You praise him to no end.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
We used to.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
He had a little play.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
He was on a Malfoy Drive in Pacific Palisades.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And he had a playhouse next door.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
I mean, in the back, the Garon Playhouse named after his sons, Gary and Ronnie.

19:21.000 --> 19:30.000
And we, Eddie and I used to, he'd be behind the bar, you know, getting us a, we were not drinkers,

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
but, you know, in the afternoon.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
And we'd say you're 86 years old.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So he'd become 86 years old.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
86 years old with an Italian accent, Italian accent and you're blind in one eye.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
You're hearing your aunt call you from another room and there's a baby crying.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And we just throw things at him.

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
And he'd add, he'd do everything you asked him to do one and combine them.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
And until we fell apart.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, I only, I mean, I didn't mean to bring him up in a bad light when I brought him up

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
immediately.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
I was, I was, it was the connection between in politics and in comedy certainty being the enemy.

20:16.000 --> 20:25.000
And it was curious what you, when you, when you watch today's comedy, like this,

20:25.000 --> 20:32.000
our country loves its comedy and we're a very successful country and we're, and our comedy is very successful and it's institutional.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
And to what extent, you know, you, you very quickly gravitated towards controversy in your comedy.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
You went out of your way.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
You win it when you could have easily taken the path most traveled.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
You tended to end up on projects that were causing letters and to be written.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
That wasn't the, you know, the intention at all.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
There was no such intention.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
I don't think you were Geraldo Rivera, but you know, you wanted people to have a discussion.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
What got that laugh?

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
I said, I said, I said, it's not like you were Geraldo Rivera or something.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm not saying you're like a controversy junkie.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Like you, like you wanted to make headlines with your shenanigans.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
No, we were, I learned, I mentioned my father going away.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
When my father went away, my mother was selling all the furniture.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
She had to get out of the house.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
She couldn't live there in shame anymore.

21:23.000 --> 21:31.000
And it was like two nights after he, they had taken him away.

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
And as the house is full of people that were looking at the furniture, especially my, killed me to see somebody thinking of buying my father's red leather chair,

21:39.000 --> 21:48.000
from which he controlled the dial and the radio and so forth, like our chiefs all those years later.

21:48.000 --> 21:59.000
But somebody, an adult buying this stuff, I couldn't bear to start with, puts his hand on my shoulder and says, well, you're the man of the house now.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
Under those circumstances, you're looking at a kid in that situation and you're telling me he's the man of the house.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
Somehow I got a sense of the foolishness of the human condition.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
That was just in its own stupid, ugly way, hilarious.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And I got it.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And that's what we rode out of.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
There wasn't any subject that we ever dealt with that wasn't in the neighborhood.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
They weren't talking about down the street, across the street.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
Women went through, women went through men and parents and their kids, the kids in school.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
All the things we did were just out of what we were reading about or hearing about or living through.

22:45.000 --> 22:55.000
When you were doing all in the family and some of the more, some of the topics you dealt with and that were very controversial compared to what else was going on in the air,

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
did you get a lot of interference from the network or studio at the time?

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Did they have any say on the set like during the week of rehearsals?

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
No, they, yeah.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
It took me three years to get the show on because ABC, who bought it the first time,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
laughed like hell but wouldn't put it on.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
There were two pilots for all in the family.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
There were three.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
There were two pilots and then on the air show.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
The two pilots had Gene Stapleton and Carol O'Connor, the two leads and different young couple.

23:33.000 --> 23:46.000
I kept thinking I could improve the young couple and happily it took three years and three, you know, three makings, tapings before I got Rob Reiner.

23:46.000 --> 23:58.000
Oh, so he wasn't your, you described, you were friends with Carl Reiner and you described little Rob Reiner being hilarious on the floor because he had been raised around comics.

23:58.000 --> 24:08.000
My oldest daughter, they're both 68 years old and my oldest daughter and he were playing together and he was teaching how to play jacks.

24:08.000 --> 24:19.000
And because he had been eight years old or seven years old hanging around his father and his father's Jewish friend, comedians, he was talking like this.

24:19.000 --> 24:28.000
That's the kind of way you do it, you punch the bowl and then you pick them up anyway.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
As you said, he wasn't doing impressions of anybody.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
In particular, he had just adopted a comedian's personality.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
He grew up around Sid Caesar's whole cast.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
But he wasn't just parroting them, he had affected their language.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
It rubbed off.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I wanted to talk.

24:48.000 --> 24:58.000
Well, what I was leading you down the road of was just to get the master Jedi to make a quick commentary about today's comedy, but I'm not going to lead you to that whatever.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Who cares?

24:59.000 --> 25:16.000
I guess I was just a little curious about somebody for whom politics and comedy were both inseparable because when you look at today, when everything seems decidedly noncontroversial in terms of comedy.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Well, none of you are watching South Park.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Well, South Park is amazing.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Do you watch South Park?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I do watch it.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I watch it when I can.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
There's so very much.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
He officiated Trey Parker's wedding.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Really?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I just read.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Amazing.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
That's amazing.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
That's amazing.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You sat in their writer's room, right?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Fantastic.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
He does bar mitzvahs.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
He does Quintanillas.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
I can be at anybody's house tomorrow morning.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Competitive rates?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Your career begins always.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
We've touched on your dad.

25:50.000 --> 25:57.000
It's amazing in your book how you parse it out.

25:57.000 --> 26:05.000
Even in your book, you're stirred by this and confused by your relationship with your father.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Can we find out who it is?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Yeah.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Yeah.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Who is it?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't know.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I gotta find out.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Please be Rob Reiner.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I have six kids and I always sell them.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Please be Rob Reiner.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Well, if Rod Serling wrote this, that's your dad.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
Who is Brianna Lear?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Oh!

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
It's Jerry Lewis' lawyer.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm sorry, bud.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
It's Jerry Lewis' lawyer.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
No, it is a daughter at Vassar who just got something she sought.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Oh, great.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
She could be happier about it.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Oh, thank you.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
You said you have six kids, you said?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
I have six kids.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
My kids range from 21 to 68.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Wow.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Yeah, you have a daughter.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Try that on for some.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah!

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
You have a daughter that's 50 years older than you.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
And I did that with small hands.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
So for those young people planning to have kids, it's good to have them 50 years apart,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
but the older one doesn't pick on the little one as much.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
It's less bullying.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
They're all, may I say, they're all very close.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Who's the worst one?

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
I'm the worst one.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
So your career starts as, like, your childhood is sort of like,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
your feelings about your dad are so prominent.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
And the thing that you later reveal after you've talked about your exploits for a while

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
and you touch back on it and you say in the book,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
there's a word I haven't been using and that word is fraud.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Like, I talked about the trouble that my dad got into.

27:54.000 --> 28:03.000
Your dad's, like, sort of inauthenticity was a huge factor in your life that was very confusing to you.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
You loved the guy.

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
So then he goes away, you, like, let's put a pin in World War II for a second,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
which you find.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
It's impossible to interview you and I'm a terrible interviewer.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And you were impossible.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
You'd have to take it just any chunk.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I was talking about civil liberties for six hours,

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
but your writing career, I mean, you initially, you wanted to be a publicist.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
You wanted to be...

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
One uncle used to flick me a quarter when he saw me.

28:33.000 --> 28:39.000
And I just got a picture of him today from his granddaughter,

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
someplace in Maine where she went for whatever reason.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
She went to her mother's.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Her grandmother just died.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
And she was going through all this stuff and she came across some pictures of this.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Uncle used to flick me a quarter.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
What was he flicking you a quarter for?

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
What had you done that was so great?

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
He just liked me and flicked me a quarter.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
That was my role model.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
An uncle who could flick a quarter.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
I wanted to grow up to be a guy who could do that.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I have a niece right now.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
You can still flick a quarter?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Can we get a quarter here?

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
See, I have a niece, but I don't think a quarter would work anymore.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Well, I guess it added zinc or something.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Somebody give this man a quarter.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
I remember sitting on a fire escape with my mother and my father and my sister

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
on a hot summer's night and the conversation for 20 minutes

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
was whether they could afford to give me a dime or a quarter.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I can't remember what that was.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
To go get a pint of ice cream at the drugstore.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
That's how much a dime or a quarter.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You got ice cream from the drugstore?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Yes, from the drugstore.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
That's the best place.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Before there was ice cream.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I used to in high school.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
I would go to Thrifty's drugstore and get ice cream when I was a kid.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
So you cannot...

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Don't interrupt my ice cream story.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
You're entry into writing...

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
You were talking about the war.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I put a pin in the war because we'll be here all night.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
We'll go back to it in a second,

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
but you come out of the war interested in the world of publicity.

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
You end up writing just as if it was a moving job.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
It was a way to keep from going broke.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
The audacity of you...

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Was it Danny Thomas?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
What was your first gig?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Who was the guy that you called?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Danny Thomas.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Do you want to tell that story really quickly?

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
No, take your time.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I'm on panels and people say,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
how do you break into the business?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Listen to this method.

30:56.000 --> 31:05.000
I read in Variety the reporter that Danny Thomas' agent was William Morris's office.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
I had an idea for Danny Thomas.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Called his office at 12.30 or so,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
hopefully hoping that he would be at lunch.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Got his secretary on the phone.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
He was at lunch.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
And he was talking as fast as I could.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I said, I'm normally here.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
I just spent three days with Danny Thomas.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I'm writing a big story for the New York Times.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I'm at the airport. I'm going back now.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I hope they're calling my plane.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I've got to talk to him. I have two questions.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm going to write on the plane and file it when I get there.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
She gave me his number.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
So I called his number and he answered the phone.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
He was alone in the house with his accompanist.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
I even remember the guy's name. Wally Popp was his name.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
And he was going to appear at Siro's,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
a very famous nightclub on the strip,

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
the very next night at a Friars frolic.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
It was a show business event.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Everybody there would know his material.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
He said, and he was looking for something in his,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
you know, that went back a few years,

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
that they hadn't heard.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
And I said, well, this is brand new.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
They haven't heard it.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
He said, it has to be short. I said, it's very short.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Whatever I have to say.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
He said, all right, get your ass over here.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
So I said, well, this is like, you know, quarter of one.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
I said, well, we'll be there. I can be there by four o'clock.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
He said, he's mad.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
And he says, you say you're calling from Hollywood.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I'm in Beverly Hills. I'm 20 minutes away.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
What do you mean four o'clock?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
But we hadn't written this thing.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
So he said,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
if you're not over here by three or whatever the hell he said,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
we got there.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
He read it. He liked it.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It told very easily.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
And he did it the next night and he killed.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
And we were in the kitchen at Syros,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
peeking out through a curtain,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
and saw him just.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
And I got a call the next morning.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Could we be in the, do we write television?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I said, yes, we write television.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Hey, everybody, why not?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
It was new.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
Norman, I'm sorry. How old are you at this time?

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
I'm 29.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
29 or 28.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Amazing.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
He had already, you know, fought in World War II.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Voluntarily.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Was any Thomas, was he already on,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
was it Father Most Best, right?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Was that on or no? Was that later?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
No, it's later.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
Father Most Best was later.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
He was a nightclub comic.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
He was a nightclub raconteurist like nobody else.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
He told long stories.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
And I like his style.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Lots of them, biographical.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
There was nobody else like Danny Thomas.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
We could tell a story for eight minutes

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
and get a thousand laughs along the way.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
So we wrote this story for him.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
So that audacity,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
which you have this remarkable combination

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
of audacity and acquiescence,

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
which I have a question about in a second,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I swear, it's going to be great.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Wait till you hear this question.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
But in those moments,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
your career beginning like that

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
just because by sheer force of will

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
and through, let's call it dishonesty,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I mean, it's a negative word,

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
but like you were lying to Danny Thomas.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
You lied to him.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
You lied to his agent.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
You lied to him on the phone.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
You were a con artist in that moment.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
And you, and you're, you're, you're, oh, no, Norman.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
Well, how do you reconcile that with this,

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
with this already irreconcilable relationship

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
with the spirit of your dad?

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
I was, I was all about doing good for Danny Thomas.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Right. You did. So, okay. So then

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
I had something for him.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
He couldn't get anywhere else in the world.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Well, that was going to be my,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
my unforgettable question that I was about to ask is,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
is this odd, this unique blend of audacity

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
plus acquiescence is my suspicion was that

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
it's actually a surplus of personal security

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
that you know you're so good that you don't mind

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
listening to other people's needs.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
And there's a little piece,

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
I've done a few interviews over the years.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
This is the first time anybody called the attention to that.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
You're absolutely right to call attention to it.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
But it is the first time I'm thinking about it.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
I lied to the secretaries telling her who I was.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
And I lied to him.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Well, I didn't really lie to him,

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
but I didn't say yes or no as to whether I had written it.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
But let's call it that lie.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
Now I have to make, I have to make my peace with that.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Well, gosh, no, it wasn't a crime.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
You did.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
What did you do?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
You did fight.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Dan, what did you do?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I, I broke Norman Lear.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
What did you do?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Oh my god.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
You know, I've said like,

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
It's robbing a sham, Lear.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
What did you do, Dan?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Dan.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
Your stories about your dad make it sound

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
like your dad was just bad at something

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
that you turned out to be very good at.

36:27.000 --> 36:34.000
Like you, like you, my father was selling fake blood.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Right.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
He was, he was, you use the word fraud later

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
and it's like hard to sticks in your throat

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
to say the word fraud.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Yeah.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Because I'd rather call him a scoundrel.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Right.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And so, well, I guess.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Or a rascal.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
That's a good one.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
I love a rascal.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Okay.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Well, we don't have to.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I mean, I'm not Freud.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
I'm not going to like, I just, I just, yeah,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I guess my answer is you hadn't thought about it.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Like, like, like how that sort of applies

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
when you're going like, yeah, well, I'm at a gas station.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
That's why I'll be, I'll be three hours.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Okay.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
I have to write this thing, which is like,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I've done that a lot too.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
And I, I, I guess I wonder like for you was,

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
is writing, is it a magical thing that people are

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
boring to do or is it a means to an end

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
and you could do anything you want

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
because you're a God?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
It's a loaded question.

37:22.000 --> 37:28.000
No matter what you answer, you sound like a prick.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
I say, I sound like a what?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
If you, if you took either of those options,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
you'd sound like a prick.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I guess I, I, I created a trap there.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
I just mean, is writing, is writing this,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
did writing become, did you, did you,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
you, you didn't, you didn't, you weren't,

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
in order to write, you have to be a prick.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Thank God.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Well, yeah, if you have met Vince Gilligan,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
he ruins it for everybody, right?

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Oh, Vince is so nice.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
He's really nice.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
He is.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Super nice guy.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Really nice.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I hope to work with him.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I think my, I think my question is,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
is writing in the blood or is writing a,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
just another thing you can learn to do,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
like juggling or?

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
No, I think writing is its own,

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
yeah, yeah, a writer pays attention to life,

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
not with the conscience of forethought,

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
but differently from another, the average person.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Because I, because I've spent a lot of years

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
when I wasn't writing and a lot of years when I wasn't,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I was paying more attention to everything

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
when I was writing.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And, and I'm doing that now.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
We're doing a new show.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
This is Brent Miller sitting here.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
We're doing a new show together.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
And next to him is Keomey.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
And when you call me, she says hello.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Yeah, well, I'll give props to Steve Levy

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
who hunted Keomey down.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Is it Keomey?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Yes.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah, I said on this stage it was a fantasy

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
to have you up here and Steve Levy went

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
and made it a reality so I could show

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
what a bad interviewer I am.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
It would have been fine as a fantasy,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
but here we are.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Yes, this, well, you're doing a thing for Netflix

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
that sounds really interesting.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
It's sort of, I don't know if you're offended

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
by the word reboot, but you're revisiting

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
One Day at a Time with Rita Moreno.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Rita Moreno?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Rita Moreno.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Oh my God.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
We're doing a Cuban-American version

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
of One Day at a Time.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
And she is the older generation,

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
Justina Machado, who's just great,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
is playing the daughter.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And I forget the name of the young actress

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
who plays the granddaughter.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Three generations of Cuban-Americans,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
and they're gorgeous and brilliant.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Yeah, and plus black people,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
like we're, you know, we saved them already

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
with TV, right?

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
But speaking of which,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
What are you doing?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
What are you doing right now?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Oh my God.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Oh my God.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I'm so sorry, Norman Lear.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
I'm so sorry.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
One of these examples of audacity

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
plus acquiescence.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
One of these examples of audacity

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
plus acquiescence is this,

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
it's briefly touched on in the documentary I saw.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
What is the documentary called?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Jesus Christ.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
My bumper sticker reads

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
just another version of you.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
That's the title.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
And that's the title.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Just look at his bumper when you want to remember it.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Okay, I'm looking at it right now.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Just Google Norman Lear, you piece of shit.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Bring in the car.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
Bring in the car.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Bring in the car.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
In between Good Times and the Jeffersons,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
there's this anecdote.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
The Good Times was,

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
was it literally like the first black family on television?

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
In a sitcom, at least?

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Literally in any version.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
And so there's,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
it kind of like,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
you got this,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
you have that amazing feat which is breaking the syndrome

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
of people are watching television

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and they're taking their cues,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
the national psyche is,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
it can change.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
We have a responsibility to change it.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
There's this amazing feat

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
in terms of a writer's accountability

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
to the public trust.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And then at the same time,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
there's a guy on it whose catchphrase is dynamite

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
and there's conflict, therefore, on the set.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
The documentary touches just on this.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
It can't be an easy set of highway cones to thread.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
Then there's this anecdote

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
about three black panthers

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
show up and come to your office and say,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
they want to talk to the garbage man.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
They want to talk to Norman Lear, the garbage man.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And they storm into your office and say,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
good times is bullshit.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
How do you have this guy?

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
They read you the riot act.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Now pause here and anybody listening,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
put yourself in this situation.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
How acquiescent are you going to be?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You in that moment,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
maybe not in that moment,

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
like it's forest gump,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
but you credit that moment

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
as starting us down the road

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
toward the Jeffersons.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
So you're still listening.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
You've already proven that you're the king of television

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
at that point and people are barging into your office

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
to call you a garbage man.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And you listened to them and took their feedback

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
and made another great show.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
That was great from another perspective.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
What were the panthers,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
because they were living in the projects,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
because they were downtrodden?

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
They just wanted to talk about

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
why their big

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
billy ache was,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
why does the guy have to hold down

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
three jobs since occasionally

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
in an episode

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
it almost seems like he's

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
looking for a fourth.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
He's so hungry to make some money

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
to support his family.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And why can't there be an affluent

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
family on,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
black family on television?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
They didn't get as fired,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
why can't there be that?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
But they were

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
pissed off that the only family

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
that existed,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
the guy had to hold down three jobs.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
And you didn't say, hey, you didn't get mad,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
you have a point.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
When they came in looking for the garbage man,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I did take him over to the window

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
and pulled the curtain aside

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
and said, look down there.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
We were on the third floor.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
See down there, you see those cans and so on.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
The garbage man

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
can't be far from there.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
So they said, oh, okay,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
okay, okay.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
But Jefferson spun off of

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
All in the Family,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
where did, yeah,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
George was on All in the Family, right?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
They lived next door.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
All in the Family,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Lionel was

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
his good friend

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
and they moved in,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
the Jefferson's moved in

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
next door to the bunkers.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
On Maud,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Esther Rowe

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
played the maid on Maud.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
And

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
she was just dynamite.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
You know.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
it's pronounced dynamite.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
On Maud,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
we introduced her husband, John Amos,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
and the network said

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
there's a show in those two people.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Because, I mean,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I was born in 73,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
so I was like a little kid growing up

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
on some of your shows,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
and then there was syndication and stuff

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
and such and all from the very beginning.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
But, like,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
those, this might be...

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I'm 51 years in this, man.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Holy shit.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
He looks to me like a friend

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
of my dad's.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Well, that's...

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
We drink more than you do.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
It's been a long weekend.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
But, like,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
the beauty of the shows is that

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
it's, first and foremost,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
the writing. I mean, obviously,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
what the content of the shows was.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
But, also, you have these wonderful casts

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
that I don't, like, you don't see that a lot.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Like, the cast of Good Time to Jefferson

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
is all in the family.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Like, the acting that went on.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Also, some of the most memorable theme songs

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
in the world.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
We all know every word to those

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
for the rest of our lives. Were you involved

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
in how you selected

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
the themes?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I selected them. I certainly wasn't involved

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
in your creation.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
But you said this is the one.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
But I'd like to sing them all for you now.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
They were...

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I mean, you...

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Your shows are all characterized

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
by something that...

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I mean, they're like plays.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I mean, you...

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
We did them in front of a live audience

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
like a play. They were written

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
to play like a play.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
And when we talk about multi-cam

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
as a format, you know,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
we talk about canned laughter.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
And we talk about the cheesiness

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and the sanitized artifice of it all.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
But then we continue to go

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
to that bat. At least I do.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I always say,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
well, I mean, we haven't

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
been doing what Norman Lear did.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
We don't have any right

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
to shit on the multi-cam

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
format until we go back to

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
doing what you were doing.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I'm curious, do you have any

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
theories, thoughts,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
rants, screeds about why is it

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
that we saw you nail it and then

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
turned our backs so willingly?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
It was working. It was working

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
as a business model. Your shows were hits.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
They were also...

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
They didn't have...

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
They allowed for 10-second

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
gaps of... I could listen to the man

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
all night.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
They were...

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
They were plays and they were character-driven

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
and they had stories to them and

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
you didn't think...

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Why is it that we went from

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
that to

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
what we have now? There are a lot of shows

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
that are paying... Modern Family

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
is paying attention.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
That's about a lot of important things.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
It's a wonderful show.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
And as I say,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Seth MacFarlane

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
and

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
South Park...

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
But what about multi-cam sitcoms, though?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
If you...

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Well, I love

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
What's His Face?

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
What's the name of the show?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Carmichael.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I think Carmichael is correct.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
They haven't even heard of this.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
You whip your snappers on the show.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Carmichael, he's a 27,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
8-year-old comedian.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
He is the centerpiece

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
of a family of a show.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
They do it live.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And it's terrific.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
All right.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Hipster.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Then

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
then there is

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Black-ish.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
But Black-ish isn't multi-cam, right?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Yes, made in front of a live audience.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
You know, terrific show.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
All right, well, I'll check it out.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Ish.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
And Wednesday night, we're making

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
the first episode of

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
One Day at a Time.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
So

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
this ability

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
to listen to people

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
who barge into your office

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
and are totally...

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
you would be entitled to not listen to them.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You'd be entitled to not listen to anybody.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
You clearly didn't have to come here

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and listen to my bullshit.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You're still watching other people's comedy.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I'm 43 and have already started

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
down the road of total obsolescence

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
because I don't.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Why are you so nice?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Yeah.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
What's your problem?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
What are you hiding, Norman?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Here's a fact.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
It has taken me

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
93 years,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
a bunch of months,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
a lot of... several weeks,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
a lot of days,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
minutes, seconds

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
to get to this fucking

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
second.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
It's a tough booking this show.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
It is.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
It has taken

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
everybody

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
who is applauding has taken

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
every bloody second of their lives

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
to get here just

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
to be looking in this direction at me.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
So you remind yourself...

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
So if you add that up against

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
my 93, I'm way ahead.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
No, but seriously, the answer

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
to the question is

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
living in the moment.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
But it sounds like that's

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
leading automatically to empathy

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
because it sounds like you're talking about

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
you don't have to remind yourself

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
whereas my therapist has to

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
remind me that they

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
are people.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
By being in the moment,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
you're like, you are them.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
You are the people that barged

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
into your office and call you a garbage man.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
You are them. You are another

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
version of them.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I figured it out.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
No, I have

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
sat here, you know how good you can have

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
90 strains of thought

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
in your brain at any one moment.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
You can.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
But again, well, then four.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I top out at two.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I'm like, holy shit, Norman Lear's here.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
What am I going to ask next?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Those are the two thoughts I can hold

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
in my head.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I figured about these faces

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
and some I can't see back there with the lights.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
But, you know, everybody

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
has

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
put it this way.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
If you have some sense of

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
the creator's design here,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
the enterprise,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
this being a planet among a billion

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
in a universe of which

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
they say there are also billions,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
then can you get your fingers close

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
enough to measure the

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
importance or the impact

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
of any two individuals

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
from

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Albert Einstein to anybody sitting here.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
If you appreciate it,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
we all matter.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
And

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
how much we matter, you can't

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
you can't, as I said,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
you can't get your fingers close enough to measure.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
And so it may as well be

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
bad and living in the moment and

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I don't know, great.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I love waking up in the morning.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I don't have a more favorite thing.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Are you guys applauding the morning?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Or did you get the sense

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
he has a heart out?

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Norman, when a famous person

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
dies,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
do you like

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
text some of your friends and say

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I love you,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I just really appreciate you

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and you just like

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
say David Bowie dies and you're like

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
oh man, it hurts me so much

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and you want to reach out to your friends

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
and say I really appreciate you.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I think that I really,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
you know, you're only going to be here for so long

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
and I appreciate you.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Something he does to me every time

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
someone dies, it could be a famous person,

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
it could be a loved one, he texts me that he loves me.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I take it as

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
a criticism of my lifestyle.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
So

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I want to know

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
which one of us is right?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I think you're both wrong.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Okay, good.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I think that's

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
where we'll give him his freedom.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Watch for one day at a time on Netflix

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
June or July?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I think it's June or July.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Just Google one day at a time

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Netflix and the movie

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
a different version of you is

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
another version of you.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
July. Okay, so it's January

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
is the Netflix thing.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I mean everything's a Google away.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Why do we do the whole plugging thing anymore?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Also it's Norman Lear, why are we plugging Norman Lear stuff?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I like to give the kids a chance

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
to keep them off the street.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
It's part of our outreach program.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Can I just say this was great?

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Oh, thank you, I hope to God

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
that you're not just being nice.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
It was worth waiting all this time for.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Yeah!

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Alright, Norman Lear

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
the legend, the icon,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
the human being,

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
the son, the father,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
the writer.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
The Holy Ghost.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Coming to a theater near you

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
and still on your television.

54:08.000 --> 54:14.000
Thank you so much.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
The fellow that has to sit here

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
holding this cannot

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
drink at the same time.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Alright, notes?

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Next time you might...

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I will listen to those notes.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
They're coming from a good source.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Thank you, Norman.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
What are you guys talking about?

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
What are you talking about over there?

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Yeah, what are you guys talking about?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I like the coloring

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
of the beard

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
and some other.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
And I told him

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
that if the animals were collecting us

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
he'd be a prize.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Just sit back down.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Stay forever.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Don't leave us.

55:22.000 --> 55:38.000
Norman Lear. Alright.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Unbelievable.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I like his style.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I don't want him to go. I'm sad now.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I know, I like his style.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I like his style. I'm going to dress like that.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I think it's weird that he thinks about

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
people now.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
That's a weird instinct.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Hopefully he'll come back

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
and we can just expound on that.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Isn't that something that somebody would say

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
if that was a person that collects people?

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
He has a bunch of heads on as well.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
If anyone could get away with it.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
You have a collectible face.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
That new Russell Crow movie

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
with him and Ryan Gosling.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
You look just like him.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
He's starting to look more like you

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
day by day.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Shots fired Russell Crow.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
But I want to hit the gym.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I wanted to ask Norman Lear

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
about the under-roof

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
situation in the Avengers trailer.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
That's Stan Lee,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
you fucking asshole.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
You don't know it, isn't it?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
He got Norman Lear mixed up with Stan Lee.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I did not. I thought that was your joke.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
No.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Anyways.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I wanted to know if he pays attention to that stuff.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Sinatra.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
He yelled at Sinatra on the phone.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
It's World War II.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
A little thing called World War II.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
We can talk about any...

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
It's impossible.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Ask me some stuff.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Ask bombers or something?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
He was in one of those fucking things.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
He bombed Germany.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I think he might have been in the other theater.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I can't remember.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Why did they call him theaters, by the way?

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
So creepy.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Because always make an entrance.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Yeah.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
And never be the first to...

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
leave.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
It's where we got...

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
It used to be...

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Break a leg used to blow off a leg.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Gross.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
All right.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Well, now we got to figure out what to do for an hour.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I think we just weep mournfully.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Also, that was...

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I've never been that nervous with a guest that we've ever had.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I was okay.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I was pretty cool.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
You were crying.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I saw you. You were weeping.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I was crying a little bit.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
You kept putting on your glasses and taking them off

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
and wiping beautiful, giant tears out of your eye.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Yeah. I was looking at some vines, though.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
My feet is sick.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I had a...

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Right? I've got a sick feet, man.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I did some revining.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
I did some revining that's fucking sick,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Norman Lear, man.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I had a Jefferson's dream when I was probably like...

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
So hot.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Oh, it was really hot.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I was probably like in my mid-twenties.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I dreamed that I was JJ

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
and I was

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
getting it on with Selma.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
With his sister.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
But it wasn't like

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
an incest thing. I was so... I had such a crush on her.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
And

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I was JJ and I just

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
kept finding ways to be around her

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
when she was naked.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Then she realized that I wasn't her brother.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
But I was still JJ Walker.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
But I was fucking Selma.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
It was really good.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
It was good times. Not Jefferson's.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Good times. Good times.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait to correct you.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
What?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I had good times.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Jefferson's dreams, too.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Also

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
We didn't even scratch the surface.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
By the way, it was a soap opera parody.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
I've seen half of an episode

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
back in reruns when I was a kid.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
To really...

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Watch Fernwood Tonight,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
which I haven't seen enough of.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Experimental television.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Talk about...

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Taco Bell about it.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Taco Bell, man.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Taco Bell, man.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Run for the border, man.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Think out of the box, man.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Taco Bell about that shit, man.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Mary Hartman.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Let's Taco Bell about...

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Let's...

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Let me get my...

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Let's Taco Bell about it.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Let's Taco Bell about...

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Let's Taco Bell.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Let's Taco Bell.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Let's Taco Bell about it.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
We could Taco Bell

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
about it.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Let's Taco Bell about it.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Taco Bell

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
about it.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
See you again.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
This is why people should subscribe.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
For $5, you can see that Rob wrote

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Taco and a shitty bell on the card.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
On the back of an envelope.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
He's probably still here

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and now knows for sure we're stupid.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
He might have come back.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
This is the smartest I've ever been.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I thought...

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I wanted to be grown up tonight.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I kind of felt down like we shoot him up.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I feel like he would have stayed for a while.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I think he just didn't like you.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Well...

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Well, a lot of people...

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I don't want to ruin what could have been a great

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
historical segment for Harmontown.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
But toward the end, he farted.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
No, no.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I was so nervous

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
about being professional and making

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
a contained thing.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And then there was a big applause thing

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
and it was like,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
oh no, what if I go past that?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Which I could constantly do.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And then I was like, get out of here!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Get out of here!

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
They're applauding!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I wanted to talk about World War II a lot.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I thought that would be fascinating.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
It's a weird, awesome third dimension.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Yeah, man. Charlie in the bush.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
That was one of his worst sitcoms, by the way.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
But we could talk about that stuff

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
without asking him questions.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That's why I'm a bad interview.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You read the book.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And I tried to just...

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
But really, I could just talk about...

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Damn read the book!

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
He listened to the book.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
He listened to the book.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
He listened to the book.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Yeah!

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Is the audio version of his book

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
him reading it or somebody else?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
No, it's him. That's awesome.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
That's a feat, too. That's another feat.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It's fucking hard

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
reading your book into a microphone.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
It probably took, like, six days.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Because you... Yeah.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I think probably less.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Well, we'll never know now

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
because I fucked up the interview.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
You did a good interview.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
You did a very good interview.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I wasn't fishing for that.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I wasn't fishing for that.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But you cut a nice

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
20-pound compliment.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
You did good.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You did good, Harmon.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Now what? I think we...

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
You know, you're so goddamn

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
fun when something else is going on

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and you're...

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
What?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I am fun!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
What were you talking about?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Why did you send me a clipping

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
of a comment?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Why are you still reading

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Reddit threads about community for?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I just said some of the

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
worst parts of community were

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
my fault.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Were you in a community subreddit?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
No.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Where were you? What were you...

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I just typed my name into...

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I don't

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
care about anything else, man.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I'm just looking up me, man.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
What's the best

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
case scenario typing in your name?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
She's so fucking hot.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So hot.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So hot.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Well, if you're not going to take my question seriously...

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
No, I am.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I'm not doing that.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I'm thinking I'm hot.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
There's nothing but pain there.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
No, I know, I know.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But, look, we as humans, we seek out pain.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You know, we do.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
You have something that goes on the air.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
When LEGO 2 comes out, I'm going to be

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
digging for

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
the one, and it is only going to be

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
one bad review

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
of that movie.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You directed the highest rated episode of Season 6.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
That is true.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
What is it? The last one?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Steve, leave me back in your room.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
The last episode?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
It's probably the last one.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Everyone showed up to bury the show.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
What was it? Paintball.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Paintball.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Yeah.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Okay.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Well, a lot of people are probably wondering,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
oh, so the first half of the show is the show,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
and then the second half is just talking about

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
how the show's going.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
We could do some improv.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
What's a controversial topic?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I think you guys should do like a 70's sitcom.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I think you should do like a...

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Are you doing Rockford Files?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Ba-da-da-da-da-da.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
The sitcom.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Rockford Files the sitcom.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Right.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Shhh.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The year is 2014.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Shhh.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Shhh.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Shhh.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Shhh.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Lego Movie just came out.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Shhh.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Shhh.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
It all goes downhill from here.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Shhh.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Ding dong.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Well, that sounds like someone at the doorbell.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I'll get it, Martha.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Okay, Jeremiah.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Hey, Jeremiah.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Help me.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Help me, God.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Help me, please.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Help me so much.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
There's a Mothman on the porch.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Help me.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Help me, my wings fell off.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I can't get home.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Help me, please, Rockford Files.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Please.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Rockford Files, my giant

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Mothman wings fell off.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I can't get home.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Rockford Files, please, help me.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I love a message on your machine,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
but nobody answers Rockford Files.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I heard your message.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Now, if you know whom I am...

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I do Rockford Files.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Then you know I'm a straight dealer.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Not a double dealer.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But you know I'm swift to justice

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
if someone hurts the people I love.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
With that, come on in.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Okay.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I'm so cold.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I'm so cold without my big old

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Mothman wings, please.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Could I have some of that soup

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
cooking on your stove, sir?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Martha, give him some soup.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Uh...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
This is the last of our soup,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
sweetheart.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Just a little nibble on the soup, please.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Now, now.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Just a little nibble on your wife's soup.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Honey.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I want to have some of your wife's soup,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
please.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I didn't work all day making soup

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
so I could serve dirty Moth people.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I'm not that dirty.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Should I wait in the living room?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Should I wait in the living room?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I didn't know your hearing was that cute.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I thought you said to both...

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I'm going to wait in the living room.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I was trying to be racist, but quietly.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
That's okay.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Now that the cat's out of the bag,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I don't like dirty Moth people

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
in my house.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'm a racist 1970s housewife.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You know something?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I don't like them that much either.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You're a self-hating Moth person.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
If you had a shower or a towel,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I would clean off this dirty Moth person.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
That you see before you.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
If you give me a shower.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Okay, I have a shower.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I take...

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Which way to the shower?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
It's right upstairs.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Right upstairs in your mobile home?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Yes, we're...

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It's a double dicker.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's fine.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I'm going to climb up the rope.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Every time you talk to a Moth person,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
you get the fucking third degree.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
This is the shower right here?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Moth people,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
you circle the light of my

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
boredom.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
This is your shower?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Yes.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Okay, I'm stealing it. Fuck you!

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I was lying.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I was lying about the wings.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I flew that fucking out of there.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Man, man.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
He flew away.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
He stole our shower.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Honey,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
why did I take all that time

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
cross-ditching that little thing

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
that we have above our door that says,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
No Mothys?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Oh.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I'm a racist

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
housewife.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Well, we still have our soup.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Meanwhile, in space...

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Boom!

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Boom!

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Boom!

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Hello.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Hello, Commander.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Hi.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Hi.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Bob.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Uh...

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
You're looking very fit this morning.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Um...

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It's a dark T-shirt.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Slimming.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I am. I should get one of those.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Where'd you get that from?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Navy.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Old Navy.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Old Navy. I should take that out.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Have a seat here. I want to just go over your report.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Uh...

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So you said

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
you didn't see a meteor

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
yesterday.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
merely stated

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
what I was

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
told was

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
to be said

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
by my superiors.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Can I ask you a question?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Have you ever seen

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
this?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Have you seen this before?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Have you ever seen this?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Have you seen this before, Commander?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Commander?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Commander, have you seen this before?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Commander, I am assuming

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
you still have eyes.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Podcast alert. Rob is holding a picture of a person.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Have you seen this person before?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
It's got big eyes

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and a mouth that's going...

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
That's a meteor,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
not a person.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Exactly.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
You pass the first test.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I'm going to beam you down to Earth.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
You're going to meet up with Jim Rockford,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
who's going to help you out

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
with the shower case.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Energize.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Oh, no.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
No.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Hey, get the fuck out of the road, asshole.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Get the fuck out of the road, asshole.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Put some clothes on.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Get the fuck out of the road, you stupid piece of shit.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Wow.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Wow.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
This is CPH, you motherfucking stupid piece of shit.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
You fat fuck.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Get the fat fuck out of the way.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Shit.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Get out of CPH.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
CPH, get the fuck out of the road, man.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I'm going to turn around and tell you again.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
This is California Pacific Highway.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Get the fuck out of the road.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Get the fuck out of the road, you piece of shit,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
you fat fuck.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Get on the beach, you piece of shit.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Dude.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Kleenex

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Engaged.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I hate being

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
from space

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
and being fat.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I hate myself.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I have

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
body dysmorphia.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I am

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
chained by

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
self-esteem.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I am bound

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
to society's definitions of beauty.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
They do not compute

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
with my

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
big synthetic bones.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Must eat

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
feelings.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Must eat

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
feelings.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Car.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Feelings

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
not eaten.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Need more feelings.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Manhole cover.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Throwing manhole cover

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
at cop car like a weapon.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Must eat police

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
like feelings.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I have a family.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Must find family

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and eat it.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Going back for

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
now tiny driver's license

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
because I got bigger

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
when I ate everything.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Family at

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
1-800

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
dentist.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Honey, is that you coming?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
You're early, I haven't made lunch yet.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
What?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Honey, is that you coming up the steps?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You sound heavier and bigger than normal.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Is this 1-800

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
dentist? Yes.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Mommy,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
what happened to my

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
son?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I hear a dog inside house

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
ripping top of house off.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Finding dog in

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
sewing room. Hey, come on, don't

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
come on. Oh shit, oh fuck.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Is it a talking dog?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Dog's ability to talk

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
lost on me.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
You down there, giant

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
spaceman. You are delicious.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
You will not

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
what did you say, freeze?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
We have a special weapon

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
that can neutralize you in moments unless you stand

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
down.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
That's it.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Cut to five weeks later

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
at the Oval Office.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I can't believe that big

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
monster fell for it.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
We never had a special weapon.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
You're just very good at what you do, Jeff.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I've been saying it forever,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
but nobody believes me. You're really good

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
at what you do. Thank you.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You're really good. Thank you, Madam President.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
You're that good.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
You're that good.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Now you're kind of overcooking the lamb chops.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
You sound sarcastic.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Mr. President?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I have a question about my job.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I was talking to Madam President over there.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Mr. President?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Don't assume the gender

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
stereotype.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
As Secretary of State,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
by state we mean country, so if I'm

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Secretary of it, why am I not in charge of everything?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
You're in charge now.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Oh, okay.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I'm sarcastic.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I mean, why do you need a Secretary

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
of the country?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
What? What?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
What do you mean what?

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I didn't hear you. What would you say

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
if you didn't hear me?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
What would you say if you didn't hear me?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Would you say a different word other than what?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I'd say what? What would you say?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I'd say what? I'd say what?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
How could you not hear me? Did a car drive by?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I was talking into a microphone.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
You were mumbling? You were looking away?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I was not mumbling.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I wasn't mumbling. Then I did hear you.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
What? I heard you. What?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Then I did hear you.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
What? Then I did hear you.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
What? Cut to Jim Rockford's apartment.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
So you say that somebody stole your

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
shower, Madam?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Yes.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I'm sorry.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
It was foolish of me to assume that

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
only one of you was a woman.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I didn't realize that

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
you both had

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
your own shower stolen.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Do you live together?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Because this is the third shower

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
theft that I've got this week.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And I'm really in trouble.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I've just got some gum in my hair.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
There's an old remedy to get rid of that.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
What's the old remedy?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
You have to come into this room with me.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Okay.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I guess I'll wait out here.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Okay. Excuse me.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I open the refrigerator

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
in the freezer

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and I take an ice cube out

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and I freeze the gum

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and it's easier to get out.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Meanwhile, I'm snooping around

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
and I find a shoebox full of Polaroids

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
and I gasp

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
upon seeing Polaroids

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
depicting ice cubes

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
being applied to hair with chewing gum in it.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Kathy, get out of there!

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
See, the gum comes right out.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Kathy, we've got to go right now.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
What do you mean?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
There's something I have to talk to you about

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
in the park.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Lockdown.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Oh my god,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
my hair's been locked down.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
This gum

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
is never going to come out of my hair now

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
thanks to you.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
You fuck!

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Fucking asshole.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
On the night of my best date,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
this gum

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
is never going to come out of my hair.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You've always wanted me to lose, Dan.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Lockdown removed.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
It seems like I was going to kill you both,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
but it seems like you guys have a lot of

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
things to work out.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I know it was you writing on Reddit.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I can't go near the internet

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and type my name in

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and you're still doing that. It's insane.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
It's just crazy to me.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I had to turn my back on that world

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
a long time ago. It's sad.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I'm catching up with you.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
All right.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
So that episode will be continued

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
like they did in the old days.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Tune in next week on Jim Rockford

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
when he finds out what

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
happened with the shower.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And also with

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
the president of the United States

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
finds out what happened with the alien

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
who came from

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
another planet.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Coming up next on the Duke's Hazard

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
check out

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
JR Ewing is going to be all crazy

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
when he meets Mark and Mindy

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
coming up

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
on the fantastic

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
fantastic television show

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
that you're going to watch.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Let's bring out Demordge Brown.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Yeah!

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Oh!

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Don't mind me.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Hi, everybody. How y'all doing?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
All right.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
You're looking very smart

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
in your blue blazer right now.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Okay. I believe it.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I lost a button.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Oh!

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But gained a daughter.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Her name is Rosario.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
When's the last time you were at a wedding?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Don't mock me.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I don't know. Five weeks ago?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I think five or six weeks ago.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Here's the thing. A lot of you kids

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
are going to get married soon.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Not me

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
from the looks of it.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
A lot of choices you can make

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
when you're doing your wedding.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Where are you going to do it?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
What time of year? Who are you going to invite?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
How much are you going to spend?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Here's something that's free to do

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
for me when I come to your wedding.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Do a fucking mic check! Do a mic check!

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
On your wedding! God damn it!

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I can't hear a fucking thing from back here.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Jesus Christ!

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
How many weddings you go to where it's like

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
fucking windy or there's a train

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
happening and then the fucking

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
pastor or whoever, somebody goes

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
and you're like, you can't say at a wedding

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
like, you got to eat that mic, brother!

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Like something's...

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Father.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Well, you know, if it's Los Angeles

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
so mostly it's just like a friend of a friend.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
It's not like an actual...

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Yeah, I mean, fucking mic check your wedding.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Mic check it.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Hey, were you at a wedding last night?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Mm-hmm.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Is that why you sent me this drunken text?

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Why? What are you talking about?

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
What drunken text?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
He sent me...

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
He's a man without a country but...

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Wait, wait, start from the top.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
We need to start from the top.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Total silence in the house, please.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Let's see.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
If I can do this without...

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
What is this?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
By Rachel Swimmer.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
He doesn't have race

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
but he's swimming

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
along by Rachel

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Swimmer.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
All right. It's coming back to me.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I love it.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
There was a guy in the lobby

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
of the standard...

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I said, I said...

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I called

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
by Rachel Swimmer.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I got...

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I don't think you were sober.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I got that too.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I thought I missed

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
some connective tissue.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I didn't know what that was.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Yeah, I thought you were there, Jeff,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and I was an accidental addict.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Yeah, that's about it.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Was that guy kicking you out of

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
wherever you were? No, no, no.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Because he was like, hey, you gotta leave.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Did you ask him to take that?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I know, but he was

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
pulling aside a velvet rope

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
so I could go to my suite.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And he was by Rachel Swimmer.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Fucking gross.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Sounds like a sitcom to me.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
By Rachel Swimmer.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I didn't know...

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Wait, so did I text

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
a voice message to you?

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Is that...

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I got that too.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Play it.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Play it? I just did.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Yeah.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
How was the wedding?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Aside from the mic problems, did you enjoy it?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Did you cry?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I cry at all weddings now.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Because I'm just like,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
this must have caused a fortune.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
No, I...

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
You start...

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
In your late 20s,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
you start crying

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
at the dad toasts

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
and then you move into the dad

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
plus the brother toasts

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
and then you move into all the toasts

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
and then you start crying during the ceremony

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and then you just cry

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
when you walk into a wedding.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I just cry the whole time now.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Because it's nice.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Yeah.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
You're catching two people

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
at a moment

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
of bliss.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Are you a crier, DeMorge?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
No.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I've been saying that.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
By and large, now.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Sounds like a challenge.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Sounds like we can't...

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Let's make

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
DeMorge cry!

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
DeMorge,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
what have you been reading

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
about the situation

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
in Japan?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Well, you know,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I know...

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Well, I heard a kid got eaten.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And he didn't even deserve it.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
By a kappa?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
By a kappa?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
The Japanese river monster.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
That only eats children?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
No, it wasn't cartoonish.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
It was grounded and real

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and a real child lost its life.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And it

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
loved its life.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It was a child

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
that was excited about growing up.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Oh!

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
He didn't make DeMorge cry.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Guests of Make DeMorge Cry

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
stay at

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Bioracial Swimmers

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Downtown Standard Hotel.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Don't you swimmer?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Bioracial Swimmer.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000
A dunky classic hotel.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
No, not a crier.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
But I grew up in a house where

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
you showed

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
just Steely Reserve

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
at all sort of emotional and critical moments.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
What house?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
The Brown House.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It was a brown house.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
There's not a movie?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
There's like a chair joker for you?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Yeah, man.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
There's two Australian movies

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
about the same character.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And then the second one,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
the last sort of monologue

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
that the kid gives you,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
which is sort of after he's grown up,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
it just wrecks everything.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I'm like that with the end of Wrath of Khan.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Woo!

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yeah.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Duck Hollywood.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I cry at everything.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I'm an easy movie.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
When the music crescendos,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I'm crying.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
You know what gets me?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I won't even watch it.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I saw somebody on the plane

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
watching Glory and I cried

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
just looking over it.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I saw that Glory was on and I'm like,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
okay, I'm gonna start crying.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Which scene?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
A bunch.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
That guy just made a sound

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
that sounded like the word taco

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and it reminded me of a thing.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Pornhub.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Under fire.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Here we go!

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Let's do our race

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
in porn segment.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
It doesn't need to have a theme.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Pornography

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
is emerging

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
and so is

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
race.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Pornhub

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I don't even know

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
what they were doing.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
There was a page that

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Spencer was here, he could explain it.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Spencer, you did it?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Do you remember what the context is?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Steve Levy?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Do you want to come explain it?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Steve Levy?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Steve Levy, everybody!

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Steve Levy.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Hello.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
They were

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
putting emojis

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
in our categories.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Specifically,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
here's emojis you can use.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
No, they picked them and that's what...

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
This is...

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I'm saying, what the hell was their point?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Were they trying to do?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Create a secret code?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
It was like a cute thing.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Here are emojis for our categories.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Yes.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
They were saying,

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
when you want to text your friend about porn,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
you can use these emojis

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
to mean these code phrases.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Is that what it was?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I thought they were doing it on their website,

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
or on their mobile...

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So, I don't remember.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
You don't know.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
But at any rate, whatever it was,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
whatever the context, it was like

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
their emoji for

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Latina, which is a category of porn,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
because fetish,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
it was a taco.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I'm going like this because

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I'm indicating the size of the emoji.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Emojis are like...

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
It was a taco.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
You know, that's

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
valid outrage.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
It taps into a...

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
It's like this is...

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Yeah, like the...

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
What's the emoji for white person?

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I'm sure it's

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
nothing, Rob, because

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
it's the...

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It's the hegemity

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
of normativization.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Hegemity

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
of normativization.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
You don't have to say something

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
all the time.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
If you don't,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
you can...

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
It's just...

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I mean, it's like...

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It's not like you're going to get invoiced

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
if there's...

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Oh, my God.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
If you just behave yourself for a second.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So, Steve, you and Dan watch porn together,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
or you text each other about porn?

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
It was like a top 10 article.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
He knows about my passion for...

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And I was like, oh, Dan, you know...

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
He's a progressive guy.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Is that the issue with it?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Or is the issue that they're using

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
of just, you know...

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Okay, well, some of the kids...

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Well, I think it pokes into a whole larger issue.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Which I think is a good...

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I think it's great

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
that now these conversations are being had about porn

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
because it's furthering the normalization

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
of porn being outraged

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
about minutiae of porn.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Like, hey, like...

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
10 years ago,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
an adolescent or young adult,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
like a Latin person in their Tumblr blog,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
they wouldn't...

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
They would be afraid to say,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
oh, this is an offensive thing

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
because they'd be simultaneously

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
copping to awareness of porn

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
in the comments and be like, oh, watch porn much?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I mean, as recently as 10 years ago,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
that might have been the case.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So, there's a little silver lining in there.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Alright, so it's...

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
It's like...

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
So if you text them a taco...

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
They'll send you a video...

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
What are the other races?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
What is Asian?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
What is black?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Well, they're all pretty...

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Guess what?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Like, it's scissors for lesbians.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Interracial is a...

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
a yin and yang sign.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
That's great.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Omron.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Lesbian is a scissor.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Cream pie is a cake

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
with cream in the middle.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
So this is like a Montessori sort of

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
porn exercise.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Big dick is the eggplant.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Squirting is the little...

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Come on.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Come on!

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
What are the other ethnicities?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
This is all of them?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Is that the whole...

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Yeah, you got it.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
What are some of the more

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
specific ones?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So, not that I care.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
It's very dim.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Yeah.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
You saving your battery?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I don't know. Good luck.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
You gotta save that battery there, Levy.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
But, I have like...

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Anyways, refreshing that

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
porn, which

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I keep beating that drum.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And other things.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
There's a cherry.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Two cherries. Guess what that stands for?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
What that is?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Fruit salad.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Small tips.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Two cherries?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Yeah, it's dumb.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Does it make any sense?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Well, yeah.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
They were on thin ice before they stepped out the door.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
You should come out with a moochie.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Guess what an old school Atari joystick is

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
with the knob and the red button.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Solo mail.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
That's all porn.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Oh, in terms of what you're looking at.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Oh, okay.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Hey, Bob.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Here's some solo mail porn for you.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
All the other

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
ethnicities are

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
flags.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
This is something that, you know...

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
It's terrifying.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Not just Japanese.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Isn't sushi?

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Oh, come on.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Steve, leave. I thought it was.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Steve, come on.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Guess what the right on-fist

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
means?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
You get one, guess.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
It's pretty funny.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I don't know, but...

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Panamime?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Two crossed cutlassies, like pirate swords.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Two crossed cutlassies.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
That's gay porn.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Oh, sword fight.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I was slow on that one.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
That's the classy one.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I was slow.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I just realized, but you can flowchart

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
through that now.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Imagine being in whatever that think tank is.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Maybe they did

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
initially go flag,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
because that's the easy choice.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And then they're like, oh, is that gonna...

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
No, there's no way they went down that road.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
They're like, oh, that might offend people

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
if you used the Mexican flag.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
What would a Colombian think?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
They're like, let's put a taco.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I just thought for a second,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
like, oh, there must be...

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I'll bet you a million dollars

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
that...

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Is there a llama on there?

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Everybody over there would agree they made a mistake.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
But the good news is,

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I just like, you know, not to beat a dead horse,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
but I like that today's

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
young person

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
in a sea

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
of outrage and complaint

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
and hashtagging and all that stuff,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I like porn being added to that.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It represents, to me,

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
who has no horse in the other race,

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
to me, it represents porn

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
being closer to the front door

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
and in our living rooms and being talked about.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I like it.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Talk about porn.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Talk about it to understand.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Talk about porn.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Talk about it. Give your neighbor a hand.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Go over at night.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
No, no.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Don't give your neighbor a hand.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Until we teach people

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
what the heck it is

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
and what sexuality is

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
and what...

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
You had to be really careful with that stuff, dude.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Wait, so you should teach people...

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Yeah, we need to teach people...

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
We don't and we shut it

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
and we block people away.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
We push it down and that's where it turns

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
into a weird black market thing

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
where then you're entrusting

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
sex awareness

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
to, you know,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
hard working, but maybe not...

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
There's no regulation and there's no...

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Yeah, exactly. That's my point.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Exactly. We finally agree about porn.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
No, we don't.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
No, we don't.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
What do you want porn to become, Dan?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
What would be your

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
dream future of porn?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
What would be the state of porn

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
in, you know, 20 years?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Well, I think it should become the equivalent

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
of, like, a cosplay.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
The way we talk about...

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
The way we compartmentalize our fantasy life

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
from our reality and are comfortable with it

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
so that people don't get hurt.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Like, you know, there's people...

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
We're having conversations now about, like,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
you know,

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
young women that dress up as poison ivy

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
and go to Comic-Con, you know,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
you're not allowed to just...

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
You're not allowed to objectify them

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
just because they're dressed that way, et cetera.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It's like a conversation starting to happen,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
but it doesn't have anything to do with,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
as it did 20 years ago,

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
oh, why are you dressed like poison ivy

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
if you don't want blah, blah, blah to happen?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
So it's like, I...

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
What I want for porn, which is an industry

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
that has been for a long time,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
you know,

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
like, just rife with

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
suicide and

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
drug abuse and...

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
you know, disease and, like, just sad stories,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
uh,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
exploitation and things like that.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Like, the more you talk to people

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
who, you know,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
as a younger generation is coming into it

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
that has a little, a few less catexes,

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
like, they're...

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
You're seeing a little more possibly mental health

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
within the porn world, maybe,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
but we need...

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
What I would like to see is for porn to be

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
just on the other side of a curtain

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
where, you know,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
you don't need it to be

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
ever present and visible,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
but it's like, it's also,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
at the same time, it's accountable to

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
uh,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
the same

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
rules that, uh,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
normal life is. It's just on the other

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
side of a curtain, which means that this life

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
doesn't have to be such a fucking lie,

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
because you don't have to have conversations

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
with people where you're, like, sitting,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
like, our worship of movies and television

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and stuff, like,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
it has, like, this dark side to it,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
where we think that our real life is, like,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
not a thing that's

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
worth living, because we're not

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Robert Downey Jr. in a robot armor suit.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Like, it's like, we need to...

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
It would be nice to be able to recognize, like,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
that's mythology, and that we use that

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
to entertain ourselves

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
during this very important life

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
that is happening right here, that's very entertaining,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
even though maybe my podcast is two hours

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
long and has no structure to it.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I'm...

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I'm advocating for the right

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
to be boring.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And, yes, I have an agenda.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Here's

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
something I didn't know I was into.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Wilma Flintstone.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
You did send

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
me that vine.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Yeah, she was... Wilma and, uh,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Betty Rubble. Pretty good.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I mean, I just,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
you know, because I, you know,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I was checking out cosplay stuff,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
you know, and then it was just like...

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Do people cosplay as Betty Rubble

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
and Wilma Flintstone? Yes.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
They must. They must. I'm sure they do.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
This is what I found out.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I had a big thing for Judy Jetson.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Judy Jetson, wow.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Sure. Same... same deal.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Yeah.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I'll be checking that out when I get home.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Someone from...

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Someone from Goodtimes.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Yeah.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It did the job.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
From Scooby-Doo is what you're saying.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Velma.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Yeah. I mean...

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Velma from the Jeffersons.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I met two girls at a school,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I think it was at Smith,

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
one of the East Coast colleges.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
By and large, there's a very large,

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
like, lesbian community

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
there at that school.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Large lesbians or the community is large.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Like, both.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Oh, okay.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
And somebody was saying,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
maybe somebody here can verify that,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
that those schools,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
those sister schools are based on,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
or Scooby-Doo is based on them,

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
or that one school is the shaggy

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
because the people there get high,

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
and one is the Thelma,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
because everybody there is lesbian,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
and...

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Is that a real thing? It is?

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Vassar is shaggy.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Vassar is shaggy.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Smith is, I think,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Velma.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
But I met these two girls at a bar

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
in Southampton, Northampton,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
whatever that is, in Massachusetts,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
and there was two girls sitting there,

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
and they were dressed exactly

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
like Daphne and Velma.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And they were exactly what they were

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
in this thing, but totally non-ironically,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
there was just two girls sitting there.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Anyway, long story.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I like...

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I've grown to accept Daphne,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
like...

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
in my old age, but...

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Isn't she right in your wheelhouse?

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Well, you'd think so, but...

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I mean, I really did...

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I watched that show,

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
and I really was quite taken with Velma,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
and, you know,

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I really liked her,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
and so she kind of distracted.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And then Marianne,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Marianne from Gilligan's Island Complex,

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
it's like Ginger was a redhead

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
and she was supposed to push your buttons,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
but it's like when it's so...

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
but it's like Marianne had dimension,

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
so, you know, you kind of like,

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
well, then it's like, it's a trick,

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
it's a...

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
you know, it's like, oh, you're...

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
it's like, oh, she's...

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
she's not the glamorous movie star,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
she's got pigtails.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And then you're like...

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
you're like, fuck you,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
you're not beautiful, I hate you.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Like, girl, you're pressing.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I wonder what Norman Lear would think

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
or share with Schwartz.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
He was like, fuck that hack.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I kind of want to ask him about Erwin Allen, too.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Yeah, like people who were prolific,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
but...

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
maybe, yeah.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Yeah, I'm curious,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
would you ever catch Norman Lear

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
like just talking shit

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
about hacks and stuff,

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
that he just like so...

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
He talked shit about later Jerry Lewis.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Like, he's like, he was funny,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
then he fucking lost his shit,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
and he wasn't funny anymore.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I think he would, you know, shoot straight on that.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Can I tell a story about that,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
that I learned from that book?

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Yeah.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Him and his partner,

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
last name Emerson,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
he mentioned him up here,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I can't remember his name.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
That's great, Dan.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
They were working on the...

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
for Martin and Lewis,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
and

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
they went from...

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
their first paycheck was,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
they were splitting 700 bucks,

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
which was a big deal to them.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
It was a lot of money, it was a windfall,

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
and then by the time they were done,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
like three seasons of that show,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
they were making like 10,000 an episode or something.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
So you can imagine, I mean, if 700 was a big deal.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
So, and then

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
they...

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
the whole page ad that was taken out,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I think by the producers of the show,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
that's just said,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
you know, you guys have been the unsung heroes of comedy

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
for a long time, we just wanted to acknowledge,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
sort of probably in variety, or whatever existed then,

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
it...

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
you guys are great,

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
and mentioned them by name, and said,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
like, hey,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Lear and Emerson,

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
like, you guys are...

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
you guys are great, you've been writing great comedy,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
thank you for writing for Martin and Lewis,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
and then it was like a month later,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Jerry Lewis unceremoniously

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
fired them,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
and Lear points out in the

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
book that in all of his

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
million interviews and books

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
and documentaries and things,

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Lewis has never

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
acknowledged that anything has ever been written

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
for him.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
So there's a dot connection there,

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
where it's like, is that what the...

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
the society

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
started saying, like, oh,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
you guys write for you,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
and then they got fired.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
But Jerry Lewis's movies,

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
the ones that he didn't write, where he had

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
writers, those are fucking hilarious,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
because he's one of the greatest physical comedians

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
of all time, then when he's writer,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
director, producer, actor, everything,

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
they're garbage.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
I mean, there'll be a funny scene or two,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
but...

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And I was trying to stitch that to, like, look,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
if I see a talk show, a late night talk show,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
and it's like, tonight's guest is the vice president

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
of the United States, and we're gonna play tug-of-war.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Gap, gap.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Is that comedy?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I wanted to ask someone who

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
spent his career, like, right...

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I wanted to, because I just wanted to hear him go,

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
no, thank you.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Because it makes me angry.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I don't like institutional Apple on the desk

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
fucking fun is funny.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I was so intimidated by

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
just his aura and presence, and the fact

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
that he's also just really magnanimous,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
nice, like...

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
You laid back.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
You chicken and stride.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Uh, I should...

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
That was an...

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
This whole thing that happened earlier

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
was an amazing moment for me, because

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
those shows... Did you know he was gonna be here tonight, by the way?

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Uh, I got tipped to it

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
this afternoon, so I came just to be around it,

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
but it's just... You have to understand that that guy...

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Uh...

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
O's me ten bucks.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Sure. But he's like Sidney...

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
He's like Sidney Lumet, and he's like Haskell Wexler

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
and these guys who are politically active,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
and I would say,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
in his stead, maybe somebody else would have done it,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
but created the sitcom

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
as a political venture, the political sitcom,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
which was not just selling soap,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
but it was saying, this is what's going on in the world

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
right now, all things.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Having the conversation... Yeah.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
You could list the things that happened.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
There's a Ron Glass episode that's just about

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
the way we perceive race,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and it's split in half.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
The refrigerator breaks down.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
I don't have any food or something. Meathead's left in charge,

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
and Archie happens to be there,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
and then Ron Glass comes in

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
as the...

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
the repairman, and there's two different versions,

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
and one, he has

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
a gigantic afro and a switch-bladed

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
is the biggest thing you've ever seen

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
just to eat an apple, and Archie's talking about

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
how threatening this guy is, and whatever,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
and then Meathead tells his version of the story,

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
and it's a totally different thing.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And it's hilarious from minute one all the way through

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
to the end, but

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
it's like a kid, watching this stuff

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
on my floor, like, I would just go,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Jesus Christ.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Regular use of the N word

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
in both All in the Family and the Jeffersons,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
and, like, you know,

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
like, that was...

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
It was just all constant conversations

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
about the actual thing.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
My grandpa

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
was a World War II vet

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
who lied about his age

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
so he could be in the war,

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
so he's like...

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I don't even want to call anyone

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
from the greatest generation

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
a conservative or a liberal

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
because it's like those words have been so polluted,

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
because it's like, what else could you be

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
if you were a vet?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Like, I don't want to fault my grandfather

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
being, by our modern definition,

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
a little more

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
like, not the most open-minded dude

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
in the world,

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
and one of my uncles,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
his son, his only son,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
was a total hippie.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
He was very analogous of the meat-head thing,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and it was going on in every house

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
in every city,

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
and they would watch All in the Family together.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I would watch them watch it.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I was just a little kid, and all I knew

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
was that my grandpa didn't really like my uncle

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
that much, but that they both liked this show,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
and that one guy would talk,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
and he would say, like, the N word and stuff,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
and they'd go and fag it and queer,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and then they would take turns laughing.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
It was like the old guy would talk,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
and then the old guy in my living room would laugh,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
and the young guy would laugh,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
and it was like, it was,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
why did we turn our backs on that?

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Because of Reagan is one.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
The episode when Sammy Davis Jr. comes on,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
and he says,

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
like, I think someone says, like,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
he's black,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
oh, Carol O'Connor goes, Archie Margaret says,

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
he's black and Jewish? Oh, that's a two-time loser.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And then Sammy Davis,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
when he leaves, before leaving,

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
plants a giant kiss on his mouth,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
and it got the audience

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
shrieked with joy.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
It's really, really amazing.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
The big controversial thing was not only that,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
it was like,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Norman Lear was catching it from both sides

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
when that show started.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
It wasn't a ratings hit overnight.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
It won Emmys immediately,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
but it wasn't a ratings hit.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
And can you imagine,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
liberals were mad

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
because

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
there was a lovable bigot on TV,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
and they kept using that phrase,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
a lovable bigot,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
and there's footage

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
in Carol O'Connor,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
who you really walk away with so much respect for,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
because he was so passionate

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
about that role, and as Norman points out,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Carol O'Connor was,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
he was fucking out there.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
The word showrunner didn't exist back then.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
It didn't matter that much.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
This guy was on TV playing this character.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
So liberals were mad

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
that he was a lovable bigot,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
and bigots were mad because it was clearly

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
making fun of them, etc.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
It was easy to look at it

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
as a no-win situation,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
but it also was

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
an all-win situation.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
That's great. I wouldn't be here

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
if it wasn't for him,

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
and for my parents sticking me

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
in front of the TV.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
We, they were really, really strict about stuff,

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
and about watching TV, and when you could watch it,

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
and how many hours and stuff, but if they heard the TV on,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
and they yelled out,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
the more it's, what are you watching?

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Whatever it was, and because they knew that it was

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
complex, Jet Magazine, or Ebony Magazine

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
would come out, and Richard Pryor would be in it,

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
or somebody would be in it, and they would mention

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
writing on one of his sitcoms, or shows, or something.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
You know, whatever, Paul Mooney.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I think he hired him to write for

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
several shows and stuff, and these are

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
people we had records of, but nobody

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
else talked about it outside of that, or knew,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
you know, and my parents would get these things,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and they'd put it in front of me and go,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
see that guy, and he's, it's just,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
it's

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
insane at every level of him taking,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
you know, just taking situations and putting

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
them out there, and the mechanics are sound,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
and the jokes are tight,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and you're laughing the whole time, but there is

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
so much going on, mod,

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
with B. Arthur just

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
attacking these ideas

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
of, in the

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
height of the Power

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Woman's movement, just

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
everything, what that is to be

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
that, how you deal with menopause, and how you

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
move these things in and out of a

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
storyline and make people laugh, but also make them

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
walk away understanding what's going on.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
At the end of it, all the studio audience

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
claps like crazy, and it's, you know, it's,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Yeah, but you don't get the sense that there's

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
like, juiced laughter, there's comfort

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
with silence, you can hear people clearing their

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
throat. They did

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
a rape episode, they did an abortion

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
episode, cancer episode,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Yeah, if it was, if it was

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
something, and it was, and it was, back then

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
it wasn't like, yeah, you go, let's do a

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
special episode, and win an Emmy, it was like

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, and

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
he always had to say every step of the way.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
But all the family, um, because

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
it's, like, the sets were just like, like plays,

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
they were just like, you know, like

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
community theater sets, they were

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
really, like, Samford and Son, all in the family,

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
like, they were just these really simple

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
sets, uh,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
the, the writing

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
is so funny on those shows that

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
they work, like, like, satellite

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
radio comedy stations play

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
giant sections of All in the Family,

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
or, or Samford and Son, and

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
it's incredibly

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
like, it's, it's Vaudeville, it's

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
really good writing, and

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I mean, again, like, it's, it's

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
character-driven, uh, plays, it's

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
really, really crazy.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
The Jefferson's was, it was same setup as

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
any other sitcom I could turn on TV anywhere

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
else and watch, but the people

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
steering, stirring the drink

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
were black, and for me as a kid it was insane,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
and the buffoon that was a neighbor was the guy

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Bentley or anything like, it was a

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
white guy, and I'm just watching this, like, this

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
this exists, this is happening.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Who is the asshole couple that lived next door to you that were always

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
being a bummer? No, no, there was a multi-racial

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
couple, right? Wasn't there like a- Well, it was Rocky

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Rokers, Lenny Crabs, Lenny Crabs' mom, and, um,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I didn't know that. Yeah, and,

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
um, um, cheese.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
The big, the big white guy. Yeah, oh, oh, Tom.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Right? Yeah.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
She was, she was like, Tom, and he would go,

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
oh, oh, oh, oh, everybody,

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
oh, oh, and then just these dad jokes

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
that would just fall flat, but then you're just laughing

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
because this is like the least funny guy

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
in the room, but it's buy and buy design and buy

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
intent. I remember, people used to,

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
adults used to call me in to parties and stuff

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
and, like, set up kids and, like, reenact that

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
episode, and people would do, my little brother would

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
walk around and go, whoa, Archie,

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
how was your day?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
DeMorge, like, was there a time,

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
like, where you, did that, did those

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
shows come on, and you, you saw the shift?

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Were, oh, now there's black leading

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
characters, or was that already on when you

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
were, like- It was, like, in New York, there

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
were so many channels that needed programming,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
and so they would just fill up blocks with

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
everything, and so you could see everything

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
on any given day, and you could

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
essentially binge watch as a kid,

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
because you're around in the summers, and it's just

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
nonstop, Bob Newhart, the old Bob Newhart

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
show, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
You know, and so you're just getting blasted

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
with this brilliance, but this is, like,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
this, I learned immediately, and I think

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
someone or parents even said, if you see

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Norman Lear's name on something, you can

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
watch it, because it's, it's going

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
to be complex, it's going to be important,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
and he's doing stuff

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
that's not, I mean, and again, like I say, there

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
were these people who existed. Wexler

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
shot medium cool and, like, walked right into

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
the Chicago riots in 68, I think it was,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
and just shot, shot a movie, because

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
that's what was happening now, that's what

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
was important, and he thought art should

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
reflect that these movements have any

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
kind of movement, has two, or any successful

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
movement, has two things. There's a rhetoric of

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
agitation, which is the thing that's shaking the

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
glass, threatening to break it, and makes everybody

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
and a rhetoric of convergence behind it, which is

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
the thing that sort of makes everybody,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
they, they, people go around it and

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
they just kind of go, okay, look, shut that guy up

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
and we'll advance you a little bit, and you have

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
to rattle the box, and you have to move it,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
and in his show specifically, I think

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
you get, and this might be this thing about

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
acquiescing and stuff, you get both of those

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
elements, you know, the topic for topic

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
for topic, it can be

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
aggressive, politically and controversial

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
or whatever, but then also, it exists,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
so now the playing field

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
is changing. But another TV person told me,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
when you watch All in the Family, the secret

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
to keeping that thing going, was that

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
if you actually watch it through a political

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
lens, Meathead was

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
always wrong

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
politically, and so was Archie, but

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
there, Meathead was always right about Archie,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
and Archie was always right about Meathead.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
So, is that, because that was

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
that, that's what makes it, like

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
you, you can just do that for 100 episodes

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
then, because it's never preachy.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Certainty being the enemy in politics

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
and comedy and

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
religion and everything.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Certainty is the enemy. And even in that show

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I think as an audience, you are often wrong about Edith

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
and then they take the latter half of that

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
series to prove to you that

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
there was so much more going on in there, and

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
there's a point where she, they're arguing, and it's the same thing that's

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
been happening every episode, and then she stops

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
and she screams at him and she goes, not this time,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
not now, and if you watch

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
any of those episodes, you just, your heart stops

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
dead and you go, oh crap, what's gonna happen?

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
The secret wisdom that she has

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
that she can put up with somebody like Archie,

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
like she's not just a dummy, she's

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
really, really great. It sounds like it's aggressive

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
preaching, but watch

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
the, I mean, if you haven't seen any of these episodes

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
or any of these things, just watch the shows and you're

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
and there's a great clip. You will be entertained

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
as the top priority. Awesome, I forget what the

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
episode is, but there's a bit, it's so funny

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
and it will last forever, like in the annals

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
of comedy, it's, she asked, Archie

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
do you love me?

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
He's like, oh Jesus Christ, do you?

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
He did that?

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
She nails him down on her

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
and it's really, really wonderful because

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
she's the

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
she's the straight man, like she's

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
the protagonist in that thing, it's really, really great.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And Gene Stapleton, right? Yeah.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Oh my God, the cast, the acting, fucking

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
amazing. And then later in life, you see

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
them do things out of that context and realize

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
these are the most

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
brilliant performers, artists

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
in the world. Yeah, because they're all

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
British and shit.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I mean, they may as well be like,

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Carol Connor is not,

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
he's not like this,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
you know, he's like, his accent

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
is not Archie Bunker's accent

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
and Norris Stapleton's like, they're

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
intelligent people.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Alright, so. Sorry, I didn't mean to go off

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
there, but that was like a life-changing

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
thing today, so thanks for that.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Sorry, Dan, your fight story got interrupted

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
before. I didn't really fight.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I'm sorry.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Alright, well, what have we learned

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
tonight?

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I think a whole lot.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
How about being

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
the career that that

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
guy has

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
and will continue to have

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
and it's a kiyomi, right? Yeah.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And you work with him kind of

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
as what capacity? Oh God, she's still here.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
It's so embarrassing, we're talking about your boss all night.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Well, you come up and

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
grab a mic,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
if you want to.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Yeah,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I was going to say

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
he's 93

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
and he looks

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
like a million bucks.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And he's groovy and easy

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
going and he's not a contanker

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
as old grouch.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Yeah, not at all.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Or is he? No, he's not.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
He's very nice.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
How did you hook up with him?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I got lucky.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I had an agent call

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
me saying that there was a job opening there

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
and I interviewed for it

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
and I got it.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And now you're working for Norman Lair? Yes.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
It's amazing, but what if we could all be

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
93-year-olds that could still smile and be so

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
completely

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
open-hearted

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
and open-minded about stuff?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I don't think it's possible.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I just don't want to set myself over

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
disappointment.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
We didn't get into the biological

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
the age-old, because I didn't want to feel

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
like a morning show, like what's your secret

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
kind of thing, but

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
assume he doesn't drink that much?

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
He's not a big drinker? No, not really.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Does he smoke anything?

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
He's pretty healthy.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
He's pretty in the angel dust.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I know he's got kind of an angel dust thing.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
He references some stuff.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
He gives partial credit to his writing partners

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Dexadrine and

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
what's the other ones

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
back then?

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Seek and all?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Second all.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
What are the downers

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
for though?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
To go to bed. For the third act?

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
All right.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
But he talks about clutch writing

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
and all that stuff. I wanted to ask him about

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Adderall and what his feelings

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
were. Because he mentions doing ecstasy

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
in the book, just in passing.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Is

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
his writing partner still alive?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
You know, I actually don't know.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I've only worked with him for about a little

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
over a year, so I'm probably one of the

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
newest people on his team. Got it.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
What would Norman Lear's porn

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
emoji be?

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Like if I

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
was sending a text to my friend and I was

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
like, this clip is amazing.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
It's Norman Lear fucking...

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
A little upright piano that they play.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
The theme song

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
all in the family.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Oh, no, no. It would be an easy chair.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
It would be Archie's chair.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I didn't really want an answer.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
All right.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Well, it's past time.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I guess traditionally this is

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
part of the show where Kiyomi does a wrap.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Right. It's true.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
We usually have the assistance of our guests

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
do a wrap

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
at the end of the night.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
We have a special beat from Zach.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Zach, is that you want to lay a beat on us?

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Or some Harry Foster?

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Harry, you got a beat?

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Apparently Zach has my beat.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Zach, drop that beat.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Kiyomi, do whatever you like. You don't have to do anything if you don't want to.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
No, I'm good. Thank you.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
All right.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Oh, shit.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Yeah.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Yeah.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I love

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
hand, foot,

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
chimney,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
foot.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Fuck your mama.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Inside and out.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Fuck your mama till she got

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
the gout.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
She needs iodine.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Less rich food.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I fucked your mama cause

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
she's in the mood.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
That's consensual.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
That makes it good

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
till it plays.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Sounds like

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
the hip hooray.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
It's like we had it made.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
So it's for the day.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Steiffel, Edith,

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I'm trying to top.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
The beat head has got to take a

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
walk with his liberal

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
viewpoints and pro-clear

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
views.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Fuck your mama so much she's in the news.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I'm trying to

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
go up

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
to the east side.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Yo.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
To a dealer's apartment

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
in the sky.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
It's in the sky.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Yo.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Yo.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Yo.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
I'm moving on.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Yo.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Yo.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Yo.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Beans on the griddle.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Burn on the grill.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
I fucked your mama till she had her fill.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
I fucked your mama

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
in a dealer's apartment.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I fucked your mama

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
and I was able to compartmentalize it.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Cause I have

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
autistic traits.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And I fuck her so great.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
She loves my

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
focus and my ability to

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
focus on her.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Cause she's put off by my lack of eye contact.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Cause you take the good with the bad.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Keeping your head above water.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Making our way

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
when we can.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
And for rarity layoffs.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Good times.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Yo.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Not good times.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Yo. Good times.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Good rhymes.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I fucked your mama so hard.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000

I went out in the hall

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
