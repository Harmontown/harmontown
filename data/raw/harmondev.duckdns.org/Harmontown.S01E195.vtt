{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:20.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, at Meltdown Commerce, the nerdest, nerdy, nerdy, melty merch, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:40.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden. You know what? He's crashed at it. I forgot he's not here. I guess in a pinch, let's bring out Rob Schwab.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:58.000\nIn a pinch. Give me some cards.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:10.000\nRob, you want to do like a minute or two before Dan comes out? I can do some table magic. Table magic? Table magic. I need some cards in the Sharpie.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:32.000\nIs anybody here have a deck of cards? Is anybody here have a blank deck of cards? I'm going to put my own symbols on it. And my own royalty. No, a blank set of cards.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:43.000\nEverybody just give me a blank set of cards and I will do some table magic. I'll make up my own royalty. Okay. I'll introduce Dan and then I'll make it. No.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:57.000\nYou're saying Dan doesn't come out until you get some three by five cards. I'm not being clear. I want a blank set of cards and a Sharpie. Dan, go.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:06.000\nDan Hummer is bringing out.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:10.000\nDan, go away.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:20.000\nRob, how much lead time do you want? Just a few seconds. Should I stall until then? Should I fill time? Fill time.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:37.000\nYou know, the Feral Audio Network. It's the Lexus of Audio Networks. And if you go to feralaudio.com, you get a free Maserati.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.000\nA little bit more.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:46.000\nMaserati is the Lexus of cars.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:55.000\nHow much more do you need? Just one more. This is going to be a good set of cards.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:04.000\nThe person I'm about to introduce needs no introduction. You know him as the mayor of the show that you came to see. You ready, Rob?\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nYes. Go for it. Let's do this.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:24.000\nDan Harmon.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:28.000\nOur guest has a hard out tonight.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:35.000\nI have a hard out for you.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nI want you to pick one card.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:44.000\nThis is just table magic.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:59.000\nThat's the card you got. Now read it. Aids.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nBut how did he know?\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:14.000\nThe nose knows. The nose knows, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, the nose knows. I like the table.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nI'm so nervous about tonight. Who are you doing?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nI'm not nervous at all.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nThis is an important night for me.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nI know it's important to you.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:31.000\nI feel great. I feel good. I'm so fucking drunk right now.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nDan?\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:38.000\nWe have a guest here tonight that I'd like to talk to.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:49.000\nNeeds no introduction.\n\n04:49.000 --> 05:02.000\nWe're going to talk to him about the emerging world of new media because all media is new to him because he was there at the actual birth of fucking television when it was all beginning.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:12.000\nHe's written on, what? Written on, created. He's developed over 100 shows. I don't even know how it's possible.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nAll 100 of them.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:23.000\nSome of them are more noteworthy than others. All in the family. Sanford and son. Good times. Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nFernwood tonight.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:31.000\nThe Jeffersons. The Jeffersons I skipped right over as one of the, I mean, let's just bring them out.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:57.000\nAll of you millennials have no idea how fucking awesome this is. You have no idea. This is really cool. Dan, take it away.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nThanks, Rob.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\nPlease do not screw this up, Dan.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:11.000\nAll right. So you have this documentary coming out that's about you. Did you have a hand in any of it editorially?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nLike Harmontown.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nAbsolutely. Two women made it.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:33.000\nThey're two great women.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:42.000\nAnd you had an agreement with them. I'm sure they're very reverent of you, but in order to make a, I got a sneak peek at it.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nIt's a very powerful emotional portrait.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:54.000\nYou did a great job. It's an American master. So PBS didn't want anybody to see. I mean, it's a rule of the game.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nAnd they made sure I saw none of it.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nAnd then you finally saw it and you, how'd you feel?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:11.000\nYou know, I saw it with, it opened Sundance. It opened the festival. So that was a great compliment to the film.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:18.000\nAnd I saw it with my family. So I was just wondering how's my wife like it. My kids, I have six kids.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:25.000\nThey were all there. What are they thinking? I have yet to really sit down and see it.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:31.000\nYeah. I mean, one of the more powerful emotional themes that keeps coming up is about your dad.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:42.000\nBut let's put a pin in that because the really interesting thing to me is that, I mean, your career in television before,\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:50.000\nit's almost a footnote in an equally amazing just lifetime. It describes you, you describe yourself in your book,\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:56.000\nsitting with that crystal radio. Do you want to talk about that for a moment? That first experience you had with?\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:05.000\nYou don't. Do you want to sing about it?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nYou know about it?\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nA little song?\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:13.000\nNo. Do you know about the crystal radio set he's talking about?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nI do not.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:18.000\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:25.000\nWhy don't you tell me, Mr. Lear?\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nMy dad went to prison when I was nine years old.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:35.000\nAnd when I was eight and a half, tending toward nine, we made a crystal radio set.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nIt was one of the best times I could remember having with him.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:47.000\nAnd he was gone and I'm fully with the little crazy.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nYou had the headphones and a little what they call the cat's whisker over this little crystal.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nAnd if you caught a signal, you were lucky. And I caught a signal.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:01.000\nAnd I was unlucky because the signal I caught had a guy by the name of Father Coglin.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:06.000\nHe was a priest who had a big radio show.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:13.000\nAnd he was a madman and a vicious anti-Semite and anti-Rosevelt.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:19.000\nAnd he liked the things he heard beginning in Germany.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:23.000\nI'm talking about 1931.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:30.000\nAnd you're a kid of nine years old and you're listening to this guy.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nI'm listening to this guy and he hates Jewish people.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:39.000\nAnd it was the first time I knew anything about anti-Semitism,\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:47.000\nwhich it didn't take me long to realize if I was hurting as a result of a Father Coglin,\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:54.000\nthese people I didn't see a lot of at that time in my high school and my school black people.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nI started to see a lot of them a little bit later.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:06.000\nAnd I had an automatic affinity for everybody who was suffering even more than we were.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nI thought that was an interesting part of your...\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:17.000\nBut I want to make mention of we had civics classes in those years.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:23.000\nSo we were learning at that tender age about the Declaration of Independence,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nthe Bill of Rights, the First Amendment.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:32.000\nAll of those guarantees that this country was going to protect all of us\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nand we would have equal protection under the law.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:41.000\nAnd that saved my ass emotionally.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nYou mean it protected you from the fear?\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nI don't know, but...\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:51.000\nDo you mean listening to this guy and feeling you might have felt hunted and endangered if it weren't for civics classes?\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nMy country said he was evil and wrong.\n\n10:54.000 --> 11:01.000\nAnd we don't have civics classes in public schools anyway.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:06.000\nThey cut that like they cut the arts and music and all those things\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:12.000\nthat bring us together make us feel as one seem to go first.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nSomething we hung onto is the Pledge of Allegiance,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:25.000\nwhich you mentioned on this really stirring patriotic portrait of the America that you belong to at that time.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nAn America that hadn't entered World War II yet.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:32.000\nYou talked about patriotism, you talked about being at parades with your grandfather,\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:36.000\nyou talked about what it felt like to be proud to be an American back then.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nAnd one thing that you mentioned that caught my attention was\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:44.000\nthis was before they had gratuitously added under God to the end of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nWhen did they add that?\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:50.000\nI could have looked it up, but I figured you were coming.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nI think it was 1936.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:56.000\nI mean, recently they added that.\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:03.000\nThis idea that this is one of the dragons that you fought your whole career and very capably.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:13.000\nIt's this weird, this morality concept that some people say has something to do with Christian values,\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:17.000\nwhich you would not argue with, I don't get the impression.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:22.000\nBut what you would argue with is that being shoved down people's throat\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nand unduly influencing elected office and things like that,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:30.000\nwhich is why in the 80s when the moral majority started...\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nThat's when I started People for the American Way.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:39.000\nTo fight the moral majority, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swagger,\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nall those guys that were building these giant congregations,\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:49.000\ninsisting that you were a good American or a bad American.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:54.000\nI mean, you were a good Christian or a bad Christian, depending on your political point of view.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:59.000\nI didn't start People for the American Way at the beginning.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:07.000\nI just did a 60-second television spot with a working guy sitting on a piece of factory equipment\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:15.000\nand saying that he and his family sit around the dinner table, breakfast table,\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:21.000\ntalking politics all the time, his wife and his kids disagree about all kinds of things,\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nand he disagrees, but here come these ministers.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:29.000\nHe said on radio and television, telling you you were a good Christian or a bad Christian,\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nif you agree with them, you're a good Christian.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:36.000\nWell, I agreed with them on a lot of political stuff, so I was a good Christian.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:44.000\nMy wife was a bad one, and I've got to tell you, I know my wife is a hell of a much better Christian than I am.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.000\nAnd he winds up saying, so there's got to be something wrong.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:54.000\nWhen anybody tells you you are a good or a bad Christian, depending on your political point of view,\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nthat's not the American way he said.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:01.000\nIt also ties into something you talked about, about comedy,\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:06.000\nin the part where you're talking about Jerry Lewis, which we can start to talk about,\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nyour early career, which gets pretty fascinating.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:16.000\nBut you stopped while talking about Jerry Lewis and talked about the way you put it,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:21.000\nbecause if you're comedically empowered and paraphrasing you,\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:27.000\nonce you become so popular for making people laugh that you can do whatever you want next,\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:33.000\nyou can continue to be a clown, or you can rise to the papacy, you said.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:38.000\nAnd that idea that certainty is the enemy in comedy as well,\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:44.000\nnot to put words in your mouth, but that Jerry Lewis being an example of somebody who became so certain of himself\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:49.000\nand a sense of control, his need for control, that maybe he started to get a little unfuddy.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.000\nYeah, he became a kind of pope figure.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nYou know, he makes his own point. I don't have to talk about that.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:03.000\nIf you've ever seen the years of muscular, the muscular dystrophy, telethon,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:11.000\nyou can watch him at the beginning being the most hilarious 35 years ago or however many.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nI mean, he was the funniest man I ever met.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:20.000\nAnd we all but died laughing at Simmons, my partner and I.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:28.000\nAnd then little by little he became, he knew everything.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:34.000\nAnd every year he did that telethon as the master of ceremonies,\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:40.000\nand you can see him change over the years and become that figure.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:45.000\nYou know, when they split up everybody thought Jerry was going to have a huge, huge career.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nWhat was Dean going to do without Jerry?\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnd Dean did better.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:57.000\nAnd now I guess you now tell him about the birthday candle.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nJerry Lewis.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nIt's funny a moment as I can ever recall.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nPlease, please, this blew my mind. Please tell us.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:12.000\nIt was, we were doing, I think, the third or fourth Colgate Comedy Hour.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nAnd the guys were in Chicago.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:18.000\nSo we were, they were at the Che Paris in Chicago.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:25.000\nAnd we were staying at the, and I forget the name of the hotel, the fanciest hotel in the...\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nDrake. The Drake.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nDid you say Drake? The Drake.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nNo.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nWas it the Drake?\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nNo.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:39.000\nIt was just the worst game show I've ever been on.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:43.000\nDrake.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nHe, it was Jerry's birthday.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nAnd Eddie and I, we were on the same floor.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:53.000\nAnd we went to pick him up.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:57.000\nWe were all going out to dinner. We were going to meet Dean in the lobby.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nAnd we knocked on his door.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:06.000\nAgain, that was his birthday. And, come in.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nAnd so we opened the door. It was pitch dark.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:14.000\nAnd we tiptoed in in the darkness.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nAnd suddenly there was a lit candle.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nI mean, a match lit.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:27.000\nAnd as the match descended, we saw him with an erection.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:31.000\nAnd sitting naked.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:37.000\nWith an erection and a baby candle in it.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nWait, in it?\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:48.000\nSinging Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nJerry Lewis.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:53.000\nNorman.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nI'm the king of birthdays.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nI have a couple of follow-up questions on that.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nHow long do you think he'd been waiting there for that?\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nDo you think it was like five minutes?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nLong enough to get an erection.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nI think he could have heard the knock and run into him.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nOh, really?\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nThe candle was in.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nThe candle, no, he'd have to be sitting there a little while with the candle.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nYeah.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nThere was preparation there.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:24.000\nHow long was the candle in his dick?\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:29.000\nJust so you guys know, November 12th.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nThat's when it took place?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:36.000\nNo, that's my birthday.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nYou're invited, Norman.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nIf the lights are out, don't worry about it.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:44.000\nYeah, if the lights are out, please come inside.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:48.000\nI was wondering when I heard these old Hollywood stories.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:54.000\nI'd like to go back to say that there was never anybody funnier than he was those years.\n\n18:54.000 --> 19:00.000\nAnd that was a hilarious prank among thousands of hilarious pranks.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nNo, you literally truly loved him.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nI mean, you say so.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nYou praise him to no end.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nWe used to.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nHe had a little play.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:14.000\nHe was on a Malfoy Drive in Pacific Palisades.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nAnd he had a playhouse next door.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:21.000\nI mean, in the back, the Garon Playhouse named after his sons, Gary and Ronnie.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:30.000\nAnd we, Eddie and I used to, he'd be behind the bar, you know, getting us a, we were not drinkers,\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\nbut, you know, in the afternoon.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:39.000\nAnd we'd say you're 86 years old.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nSo he'd become 86 years old.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:46.000\n86 years old with an Italian accent, Italian accent and you're blind in one eye.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:51.000\nYou're hearing your aunt call you from another room and there's a baby crying.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nAnd we just throw things at him.\n\n19:53.000 --> 20:00.000\nAnd he'd add, he'd do everything you asked him to do one and combine them.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nAnd until we fell apart.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nYeah.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:10.000\nYeah, I only, I mean, I didn't mean to bring him up in a bad light when I brought him up\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nimmediately.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:16.000\nI was, I was, it was the connection between in politics and in comedy certainty being the enemy.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:25.000\nAnd it was curious what you, when you, when you watch today's comedy, like this,\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:32.000\nour country loves its comedy and we're a very successful country and we're, and our comedy is very successful and it's institutional.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:38.000\nAnd to what extent, you know, you, you very quickly gravitated towards controversy in your comedy.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nYou went out of your way.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:45.000\nYou win it when you could have easily taken the path most traveled.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:50.000\nYou tended to end up on projects that were causing letters and to be written.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nThat wasn't the, you know, the intention at all.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nThere was no such intention.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:59.000\nI don't think you were Geraldo Rivera, but you know, you wanted people to have a discussion.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nWhat got that laugh?\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:03.000\nI said, I said, I said, it's not like you were Geraldo Rivera or something.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:07.000\nI'm not saying you're like a controversy junkie.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.000\nLike you, like you wanted to make headlines with your shenanigans.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:16.000\nNo, we were, I learned, I mentioned my father going away.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nWhen my father went away, my mother was selling all the furniture.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nShe had to get out of the house.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nShe couldn't live there in shame anymore.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:31.000\nAnd it was like two nights after he, they had taken him away.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:39.000\nAnd as the house is full of people that were looking at the furniture, especially my, killed me to see somebody thinking of buying my father's red leather chair,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:48.000\nfrom which he controlled the dial and the radio and so forth, like our chiefs all those years later.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:59.000\nBut somebody, an adult buying this stuff, I couldn't bear to start with, puts his hand on my shoulder and says, well, you're the man of the house now.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:06.000\nUnder those circumstances, you're looking at a kid in that situation and you're telling me he's the man of the house.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:12.000\nSomehow I got a sense of the foolishness of the human condition.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:19.000\nThat was just in its own stupid, ugly way, hilarious.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nAnd I got it.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nAnd that's what we rode out of.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:28.000\nThere wasn't any subject that we ever dealt with that wasn't in the neighborhood.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:32.000\nThey weren't talking about down the street, across the street.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:38.000\nWomen went through, women went through men and parents and their kids, the kids in school.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:45.000\nAll the things we did were just out of what we were reading about or hearing about or living through.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:55.000\nWhen you were doing all in the family and some of the more, some of the topics you dealt with and that were very controversial compared to what else was going on in the air,\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:59.000\ndid you get a lot of interference from the network or studio at the time?\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:03.000\nDid they have any say on the set like during the week of rehearsals?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:07.000\nNo, they, yeah.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:14.000\nIt took me three years to get the show on because ABC, who bought it the first time,\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:18.000\nlaughed like hell but wouldn't put it on.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nThere were two pilots for all in the family.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nThere were three.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:26.000\nThere were two pilots and then on the air show.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:33.000\nThe two pilots had Gene Stapleton and Carol O'Connor, the two leads and different young couple.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:46.000\nI kept thinking I could improve the young couple and happily it took three years and three, you know, three makings, tapings before I got Rob Reiner.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:58.000\nOh, so he wasn't your, you described, you were friends with Carl Reiner and you described little Rob Reiner being hilarious on the floor because he had been raised around comics.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:08.000\nMy oldest daughter, they're both 68 years old and my oldest daughter and he were playing together and he was teaching how to play jacks.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:19.000\nAnd because he had been eight years old or seven years old hanging around his father and his father's Jewish friend, comedians, he was talking like this.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:28.000\nThat's the kind of way you do it, you punch the bowl and then you pick them up anyway.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nAs you said, he wasn't doing impressions of anybody.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:34.000\nIn particular, he had just adopted a comedian's personality.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:38.000\nHe grew up around Sid Caesar's whole cast.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:43.000\nBut he wasn't just parroting them, he had affected their language.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:46.000\nIt rubbed off.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nI wanted to talk.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:58.000\nWell, what I was leading you down the road of was just to get the master Jedi to make a quick commentary about today's comedy, but I'm not going to lead you to that whatever.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nWho cares?\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:16.000\nI guess I was just a little curious about somebody for whom politics and comedy were both inseparable because when you look at today, when everything seems decidedly noncontroversial in terms of comedy.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nWell, none of you are watching South Park.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nWell, South Park is amazing.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nDo you watch South Park?\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nI do watch it.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nI watch it when I can.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nThere's so very much.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nHe officiated Trey Parker's wedding.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nReally?\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nI just read.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nAmazing.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nYou sat in their writer's room, right?\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nFantastic.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nHe does bar mitzvahs.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nHe does Quintanillas.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:44.000\nI can be at anybody's house tomorrow morning.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nCompetitive rates?\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nYour career begins always.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nWe've touched on your dad.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:57.000\nIt's amazing in your book how you parse it out.\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:05.000\nEven in your book, you're stirred by this and confused by your relationship with your father.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nCan we find out who it is?\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nYeah.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:09.000\nYeah.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nWho is it?\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nI gotta find out.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nPlease be Rob Reiner.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI have six kids and I always sell them.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nPlease be Rob Reiner.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nWell, if Rod Serling wrote this, that's your dad.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:23.000\nWho is Brianna Lear?\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nOh!\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nIt's Jerry Lewis' lawyer.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nI'm sorry, bud.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nIt's Jerry Lewis' lawyer.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:38.000\nNo, it is a daughter at Vassar who just got something she sought.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.000\nOh, great.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nShe could be happier about it.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:47.000\nYou said you have six kids, you said?\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nI have six kids.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:52.000\nMy kids range from 21 to 68.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nWow.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nYeah, you have a daughter.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nTry that on for some.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nYeah!\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:02.000\nYou have a daughter that's 50 years older than you.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:08.000\nAnd I did that with small hands.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:15.000\nSo for those young people planning to have kids, it's good to have them 50 years apart,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:19.000\nbut the older one doesn't pick on the little one as much.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:22.000\nIt's less bullying.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:28.000\nThey're all, may I say, they're all very close.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nWho's the worst one?\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:33.000\nI'm the worst one.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:37.000\nSo your career starts as, like, your childhood is sort of like,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nyour feelings about your dad are so prominent.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:44.000\nAnd the thing that you later reveal after you've talked about your exploits for a while\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:48.000\nand you touch back on it and you say in the book,\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:51.000\nthere's a word I haven't been using and that word is fraud.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:54.000\nLike, I talked about the trouble that my dad got into.\n\n27:54.000 --> 28:03.000\nYour dad's, like, sort of inauthenticity was a huge factor in your life that was very confusing to you.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nYou loved the guy.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:11.000\nSo then he goes away, you, like, let's put a pin in World War II for a second,\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nwhich you find.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:16.000\nIt's impossible to interview you and I'm a terrible interviewer.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nAnd you were impossible.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nYou'd have to take it just any chunk.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nI was talking about civil liberties for six hours,\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:28.000\nbut your writing career, I mean, you initially, you wanted to be a publicist.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nYou wanted to be...\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nOne uncle used to flick me a quarter when he saw me.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:39.000\nAnd I just got a picture of him today from his granddaughter,\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:43.000\nsomeplace in Maine where she went for whatever reason.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nShe went to her mother's.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nHer grandmother just died.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:51.000\nAnd she was going through all this stuff and she came across some pictures of this.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nUncle used to flick me a quarter.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:56.000\nWhat was he flicking you a quarter for?\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:59.000\nWhat had you done that was so great?\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:02.000\nHe just liked me and flicked me a quarter.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nThat was my role model.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nAn uncle who could flick a quarter.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nI wanted to grow up to be a guy who could do that.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI have a niece right now.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nYou can still flick a quarter?\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nCan we get a quarter here?\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:19.000\nSee, I have a niece, but I don't think a quarter would work anymore.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:22.000\nWell, I guess it added zinc or something.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nSomebody give this man a quarter.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:29.000\nI remember sitting on a fire escape with my mother and my father and my sister\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:34.000\non a hot summer's night and the conversation for 20 minutes\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:38.000\nwas whether they could afford to give me a dime or a quarter.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nI can't remember what that was.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:44.000\nTo go get a pint of ice cream at the drugstore.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:48.000\nThat's how much a dime or a quarter.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nYou got ice cream from the drugstore?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nYes, from the drugstore.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nThat's the best place.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nBefore there was ice cream.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nI used to in high school.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:02.000\nI would go to Thrifty's drugstore and get ice cream when I was a kid.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nSo you cannot...\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nDon't interrupt my ice cream story.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:09.000\nYou're entry into writing...\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nYou were talking about the war.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:14.000\nI put a pin in the war because we'll be here all night.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:17.000\nWe'll go back to it in a second,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:21.000\nbut you come out of the war interested in the world of publicity.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:27.000\nYou end up writing just as if it was a moving job.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:33.000\nIt was a way to keep from going broke.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:36.000\nThe audacity of you...\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nWas it Danny Thomas?\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nWhat was your first gig?\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nWho was the guy that you called?\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nDanny Thomas.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nDo you want to tell that story really quickly?\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:50.000\nNo, take your time.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nI'm on panels and people say,\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nhow do you break into the business?\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nListen to this method.\n\n30:56.000 --> 31:05.000\nI read in Variety the reporter that Danny Thomas' agent was William Morris's office.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.000\nI had an idea for Danny Thomas.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:12.000\nCalled his office at 12.30 or so,\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:15.000\nhopefully hoping that he would be at lunch.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nGot his secretary on the phone.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nHe was at lunch.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nAnd he was talking as fast as I could.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nI said, I'm normally here.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:26.000\nI just spent three days with Danny Thomas.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nI'm writing a big story for the New York Times.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nI'm at the airport. I'm going back now.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nI hope they're calling my plane.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nI've got to talk to him. I have two questions.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nI'm going to write on the plane and file it when I get there.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nShe gave me his number.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:44.000\nSo I called his number and he answered the phone.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nHe was alone in the house with his accompanist.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:51.000\nI even remember the guy's name. Wally Popp was his name.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:55.000\nAnd he was going to appear at Siro's,\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:58.000\na very famous nightclub on the strip,\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:01.000\nthe very next night at a Friars frolic.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:04.000\nIt was a show business event.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:07.000\nEverybody there would know his material.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:10.000\nHe said, and he was looking for something in his,\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nyou know, that went back a few years,\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:15.000\nthat they hadn't heard.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nAnd I said, well, this is brand new.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nThey haven't heard it.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:23.000\nHe said, it has to be short. I said, it's very short.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nWhatever I have to say.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nHe said, all right, get your ass over here.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.000\nSo I said, well, this is like, you know, quarter of one.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:34.000\nI said, well, we'll be there. I can be there by four o'clock.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nHe said, he's mad.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nAnd he says, you say you're calling from Hollywood.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nI'm in Beverly Hills. I'm 20 minutes away.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nWhat do you mean four o'clock?\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nBut we hadn't written this thing.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:49.000\nSo he said,\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nif you're not over here by three or whatever the hell he said,\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nwe got there.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nHe read it. He liked it.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nIt told very easily.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\nAnd he did it the next night and he killed.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nAnd we were in the kitchen at Syros,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\npeeking out through a curtain,\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nand saw him just.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:10.000\nAnd I got a call the next morning.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:13.000\nCould we be in the, do we write television?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nI said, yes, we write television.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nHey, everybody, why not?\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nIt was new.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\nNorman, I'm sorry. How old are you at this time?\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:26.000\nI'm 29.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\n29 or 28.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nAmazing.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:33.000\nHe had already, you know, fought in World War II.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nVoluntarily.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nWas any Thomas, was he already on,\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nwas it Father Most Best, right?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nWas that on or no? Was that later?\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nNo, it's later.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:48.000\nFather Most Best was later.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nHe was a nightclub comic.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:53.000\nHe was a nightclub raconteurist like nobody else.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nHe told long stories.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nAnd I like his style.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:01.000\nLots of them, biographical.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:04.000\nThere was nobody else like Danny Thomas.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nWe could tell a story for eight minutes\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nand get a thousand laughs along the way.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:11.000\nSo we wrote this story for him.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nSo that audacity,\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:16.000\nwhich you have this remarkable combination\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nof audacity and acquiescence,\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:21.000\nwhich I have a question about in a second,\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nI swear, it's going to be great.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:27.000\nWait till you hear this question.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:31.000\nBut in those moments,\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nyour career beginning like that\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\njust because by sheer force of will\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nand through, let's call it dishonesty,\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nI mean, it's a negative word,\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:42.000\nbut like you were lying to Danny Thomas.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:43.000\nYou lied to him.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nYou lied to his agent.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:45.000\nYou lied to him on the phone.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nYou were a con artist in that moment.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:52.000\nAnd you, and you're, you're, you're, oh, no, Norman.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:57.000\nWell, how do you reconcile that with this,\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:00.000\nwith this already irreconcilable relationship\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nwith the spirit of your dad?\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:07.000\nI was, I was all about doing good for Danny Thomas.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nRight. You did. So, okay. So then\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nI had something for him.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nHe couldn't get anywhere else in the world.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nWell, that was going to be my,\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nmy unforgettable question that I was about to ask is,\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:18.000\nis this odd, this unique blend of audacity\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:22.000\nplus acquiescence is my suspicion was that\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:25.000\nit's actually a surplus of personal security\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:28.000\nthat you know you're so good that you don't mind\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nlistening to other people's needs.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nAnd there's a little piece,\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:34.000\nI've done a few interviews over the years.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:38.000\nThis is the first time anybody called the attention to that.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nYou're absolutely right to call attention to it.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:43.000\nBut it is the first time I'm thinking about it.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:48.000\nI lied to the secretaries telling her who I was.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:52.000\nAnd I lied to him.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nWell, I didn't really lie to him,\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:58.000\nbut I didn't say yes or no as to whether I had written it.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:01.000\nBut let's call it that lie.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:05.000\nNow I have to make, I have to make my peace with that.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nWell, gosh, no, it wasn't a crime.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:08.000\nYou did.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:10.000\nYou did fight.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nDan, what did you do?\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nI, I broke Norman Lear.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:15.000\nOh my god.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.000\nYou know, I've said like,\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nIt's robbing a sham, Lear.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nWhat did you do, Dan?\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:20.000\nDan.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:23.000\nYour stories about your dad make it sound\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nlike your dad was just bad at something\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nthat you turned out to be very good at.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:34.000\nLike you, like you, my father was selling fake blood.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nRight.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nHe was, he was, you use the word fraud later\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nand it's like hard to sticks in your throat\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:40.000\nto say the word fraud.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nYeah.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nBecause I'd rather call him a scoundrel.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nRight.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nAnd so, well, I guess.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nOr a rascal.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nThat's a good one.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:48.000\nI love a rascal.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nOkay.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:50.000\nWell, we don't have to.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:51.000\nI mean, I'm not Freud.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nI'm not going to like, I just, I just, yeah,\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nI guess my answer is you hadn't thought about it.\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nLike, like, like how that sort of applies\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:01.000\nwhen you're going like, yeah, well, I'm at a gas station.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nThat's why I'll be, I'll be three hours.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:04.000\nOkay.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nI have to write this thing, which is like,\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nI've done that a lot too.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:11.000\nAnd I, I, I guess I wonder like for you was,\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:14.000\nis writing, is it a magical thing that people are\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nboring to do or is it a means to an end\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nand you could do anything you want\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nbecause you're a God?\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nIt's a loaded question.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:28.000\nNo matter what you answer, you sound like a prick.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:31.000\nI say, I sound like a what?\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nIf you, if you took either of those options,\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nyou'd sound like a prick.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nI guess I, I, I created a trap there.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:39.000\nI just mean, is writing, is writing this,\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\ndid writing become, did you, did you,\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nyou, you didn't, you didn't, you weren't,\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:48.000\nin order to write, you have to be a prick.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:51.000\nThank God.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nWell, yeah, if you have met Vince Gilligan,\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nhe ruins it for everybody, right?\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nOh, Vince is so nice.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nHe's really nice.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:02.000\nHe is.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nSuper nice guy.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nReally nice.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nI hope to work with him.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nI think my, I think my question is,\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nis writing in the blood or is writing a,\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\njust another thing you can learn to do,\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nlike juggling or?\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:18.000\nNo, I think writing is its own,\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:23.000\nyeah, yeah, a writer pays attention to life,\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:28.000\nnot with the conscience of forethought,\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:34.000\nbut differently from another, the average person.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nBecause I, because I've spent a lot of years\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nwhen I wasn't writing and a lot of years when I wasn't,\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nI was paying more attention to everything\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nwhen I was writing.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nAnd, and I'm doing that now.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.000\nWe're doing a new show.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nThis is Brent Miller sitting here.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:52.000\nWe're doing a new show together.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:55.000\nAnd next to him is Keomey.\n\n38:55.000 --> 39:00.000\nAnd when you call me, she says hello.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:03.000\nYeah, well, I'll give props to Steve Levy\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nwho hunted Keomey down.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:06.000\nIs it Keomey?\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:07.000\nYes.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:10.000\nYeah, I said on this stage it was a fantasy\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:13.000\nto have you up here and Steve Levy went\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nand made it a reality so I could show\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:16.000\nwhat a bad interviewer I am.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:19.000\nIt would have been fine as a fantasy,\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nbut here we are.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:24.000\nYes, this, well, you're doing a thing for Netflix\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:25.000\nthat sounds really interesting.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nIt's sort of, I don't know if you're offended\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nby the word reboot, but you're revisiting\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:34.000\nOne Day at a Time with Rita Moreno.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:35.000\nRita Moreno?\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nRita Moreno.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:38.000\nOh my God.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:41.000\nWe're doing a Cuban-American version\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nof One Day at a Time.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:47.000\nAnd she is the older generation,\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:51.000\nJustina Machado, who's just great,\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nis playing the daughter.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nAnd I forget the name of the young actress\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nwho plays the granddaughter.\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nThree generations of Cuban-Americans,\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:02.000\nand they're gorgeous and brilliant.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nYeah, and plus black people,\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nlike we're, you know, we saved them already\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nwith TV, right?\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:12.000\nBut speaking of which,\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:15.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nWhat are you doing right now?\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nOh my God.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:20.000\nOh my God.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nI'm so sorry, Norman Lear.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:25.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nOne of these examples of audacity\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:31.000\nplus acquiescence.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nOne of these examples of audacity\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nplus acquiescence is this,\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:41.000\nit's briefly touched on in the documentary I saw.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nWhat is the documentary called?\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nMy bumper sticker reads\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\njust another version of you.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nThat's the title.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:51.000\nAnd that's the title.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:52.000\nJust look at his bumper when you want to remember it.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nOkay, I'm looking at it right now.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nJust Google Norman Lear, you piece of shit.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:57.000\nBring in the car.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:00.000\nBring in the car.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:03.000\nBring in the car.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nIn between Good Times and the Jeffersons,\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nthere's this anecdote.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:10.000\nThe Good Times was,\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:14.000\nwas it literally like the first black family on television?\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nIn a sitcom, at least?\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:19.000\nLiterally in any version.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:20.000\nYeah.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:23.000\nAnd so there's,\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nit kind of like,\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nyou got this,\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nyou have that amazing feat which is breaking the syndrome\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nof people are watching television\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nand they're taking their cues,\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nthe national psyche is,\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:36.000\nit can change.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nWe have a responsibility to change it.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nThere's this amazing feat\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nin terms of a writer's accountability\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nto the public trust.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nAnd then at the same time,\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nthere's a guy on it whose catchphrase is dynamite\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nand there's conflict, therefore, on the set.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nThe documentary touches just on this.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:55.000\nIt can't be an easy set of highway cones to thread.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:58.000\nThen there's this anecdote\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:02.000\nabout three black panthers\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nshow up and come to your office and say,\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nthey want to talk to the garbage man.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nThey want to talk to Norman Lear, the garbage man.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nAnd they storm into your office and say,\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\ngood times is bullshit.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nHow do you have this guy?\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nThey read you the riot act.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nNow pause here and anybody listening,\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nput yourself in this situation.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nHow acquiescent are you going to be?\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nYou in that moment,\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nmaybe not in that moment,\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nlike it's forest gump,\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nbut you credit that moment\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nas starting us down the road\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\ntoward the Jeffersons.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nSo you're still listening.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nYou've already proven that you're the king of television\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nat that point and people are barging into your office\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nto call you a garbage man.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nAnd you listened to them and took their feedback\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nand made another great show.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nThat was great from another perspective.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nWhat were the panthers,\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nbecause they were living in the projects,\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nbecause they were downtrodden?\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nThey just wanted to talk about\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nwhy their big\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nbilly ache was,\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\nwhy does the guy have to hold down\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nthree jobs since occasionally\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nin an episode\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nit almost seems like he's\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nlooking for a fourth.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nHe's so hungry to make some money\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nto support his family.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nAnd why can't there be an affluent\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nfamily on,\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nblack family on television?\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nThey didn't get as fired,\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nwhy can't there be that?\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nBut they were\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\npissed off that the only family\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nthat existed,\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nthe guy had to hold down three jobs.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nAnd you didn't say, hey, you didn't get mad,\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nyou have a point.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nWhen they came in looking for the garbage man,\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nI did take him over to the window\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nand pulled the curtain aside\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nand said, look down there.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nWe were on the third floor.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nSee down there, you see those cans and so on.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nThe garbage man\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\ncan't be far from there.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nSo they said, oh, okay,\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nokay, okay.\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nBut Jefferson spun off of\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nAll in the Family,\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nwhere did, yeah,\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nGeorge was on All in the Family, right?\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nThey lived next door.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nAll in the Family,\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nLionel was\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nhis good friend\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nand they moved in,\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nthe Jefferson's moved in\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nnext door to the bunkers.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nOn Maud,\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nEsther Rowe\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nplayed the maid on Maud.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nAnd\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nshe was just dynamite.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nYou know.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nAnd\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nit's pronounced dynamite.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nOn Maud,\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nwe introduced her husband, John Amos,\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nand the network said\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nthere's a show in those two people.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nBecause, I mean,\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nI was born in 73,\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nso I was like a little kid growing up\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\non some of your shows,\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nand then there was syndication and stuff\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nand such and all from the very beginning.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nBut, like,\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nthose, this might be...\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nI'm 51 years in this, man.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nHoly shit.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nHe looks to me like a friend\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nof my dad's.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nWell, that's...\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nWe drink more than you do.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nIt's been a long weekend.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nBut, like,\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nthe beauty of the shows is that\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nit's, first and foremost,\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nthe writing. I mean, obviously,\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nwhat the content of the shows was.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nBut, also, you have these wonderful casts\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nthat I don't, like, you don't see that a lot.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nLike, the cast of Good Time to Jefferson\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nis all in the family.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nLike, the acting that went on.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nAlso, some of the most memorable theme songs\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nin the world.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nWe all know every word to those\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nfor the rest of our lives. Were you involved\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nin how you selected\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nthe themes?\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nI selected them. I certainly wasn't involved\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nin your creation.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nBut you said this is the one.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nBut I'd like to sing them all for you now.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nThey were...\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nI mean, you...\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nYour shows are all characterized\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nby something that...\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nI mean, they're like plays.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nI mean, you...\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nWe did them in front of a live audience\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nlike a play. They were written\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nto play like a play.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nAnd when we talk about multi-cam\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nas a format, you know,\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nwe talk about canned laughter.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nAnd we talk about the cheesiness\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nand the sanitized artifice of it all.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nBut then we continue to go\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nto that bat. At least I do.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nI always say,\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nwell, I mean, we haven't\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nbeen doing what Norman Lear did.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nWe don't have any right\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nto shit on the multi-cam\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nformat until we go back to\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\ndoing what you were doing.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nI'm curious, do you have any\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\ntheories, thoughts,\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nrants, screeds about why is it\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nthat we saw you nail it and then\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nturned our backs so willingly?\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nIt was working. It was working\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nas a business model. Your shows were hits.\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nThey were also...\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nThey didn't have...\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nThey allowed for 10-second\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\ngaps of...

01:39:20.000\nVelma.\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nBut I met these two girls at a bar\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nin Southampton, Northampton,\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000\nwhatever that

Daphne and Velma.\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nAnd they were exactly what they were\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nin this thing, but totally non-ironically,\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000\nthere was just two girls sitting there.\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nAnyway, long story.\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000\nI like...\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000\nI've grown to accept Daphne,\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000\nlike...\n\n01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nin my old age, but...\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000\nIsn't she right in your wheelhouse?\n\n01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000\nWell, you'd think so, but...\n\n01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nI mean, I really did...\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nI watched that show,\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000\nand I really was quite taken with Velma,\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nand, you know,\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000\nI really liked her,\n\n01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000\nand so she kind of distracted.\n\n01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000\nAnd then Marianne,\n\n01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000\nMarianne from Gilligan's Island Complex,\n\n01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000\nit's like Ginger was a redhead\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000\nand she was supposed to push your buttons,\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000\nbut it's like when it's so...\n\n01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000\nbut it's like Marianne had dimension,\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000\nso, you know, you kind of like,\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000\nwell, then it's like, it's a trick,\n\n01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000\nit's

01:40:46.000\nyou're not beautiful, I hate you.\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000\nLike, girl, you're pressing.\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000\nI wonder what Norman Lear would think\n\n01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nor share with Schwartz.\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nHe was like, fuck that hack.\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000\nI kind of want to ask him about Erwin Allen, too.\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000\nYeah, like people who were prolific,\n\n01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000\nbut...\n\n01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000\nmaybe, yeah.\n\n01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000\nYeah, I'm curious,\n\n01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000\nwould you ever catch Norman Lear\n\n01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nlike just talking shit\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000\nabout hacks and stuff,\n\n01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000\nthat he just like so...\n\n01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nHe talked shit about later Jerry Lewis.\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nLike, he's like, he was funny,\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000\nthen he fucking lost his shit,\n\n01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000\nand he wasn't funny anymore.\n\n01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000\nI think he would, you know, shoot straight on that.\n\n01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000\nCan I tell a story about that,\n\n01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000\nthat I learned from that book?\n\n01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000\nYeah.\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000\nHim and his partner,\n\n01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000\nlast name Emerson,\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000\nhe mentioned him up here,\n\n01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nI can't remember his name.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000\nThat's great, Dan.\n\n01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nThey were working on the...\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000\nfor Martin and Lewis,\n\n01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000\nand\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000\nthey went from...\n\n01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000\ntheir first paycheck was,\n\n01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000\nthey were splitting 700 bucks,\n\n01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000\nwhich was a big deal to them.\n\n01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000\nIt was a lot of money, it was a windfall,\n\n01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000\nand then by the time they were done,\n\n01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000\nlike three seasons of that show,\n\n01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000\nthey were making like 10,000 an episode or something.\n\n01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000\nSo you can imagine, I mean, if 700 was a big deal.\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000\nSo, and then\n\n01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000\nthey...\n\n01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nthe whole page ad that was taken out,\n\n01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000\nI think by the producers of the show,\n\n01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000\nthat's just said,\n\n01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000\nyou know, you guys have been the unsung heroes of comedy\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000\nfor a long time, we just wanted to acknowledge,\n\n01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000\nsort of probably in variety, or whatever existed then,\n\n01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000\nit...\n\n01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000\nyou guys are great,\n\n01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000\nand mentioned them by name, and said,\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000\nlike, hey,\n\n01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nLear and Emerson,\n\n01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000\nlike, you guys are...\n\n01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000\nyou guys are great, you've been writing great comedy,\n\n01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000\nthank you for writing for Martin and Lewis,\n\n01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000\nand then it was like a month later,\n\n01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000\nJerry Lewis unceremoniously\n\n01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000\nfired them,\n\n01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000\nand Lear points out in the\n\n01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000\nbook that in all of his\n\n01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000\nmillion interviews and books\n\n01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000\nand documentaries and things,\n\n01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000\nLewis has never\n\n01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000\nacknowledged that anything has ever been written\n\n01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000\nfor him.\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000\nSo there's a dot connection there,\n\n01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nwhere it's like, is that what the...\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000\nthe society\n\n01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000\nstarted saying, like, oh,\n\n01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000\nyou guys write for you,\n\n01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000\nand then they got fired.\n\n01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000\nBut Jerry Lewis's movies,\n\n01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nthe ones that he didn't write, where he had\n\n01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000\nwriters, those are fucking hilarious,\n\n01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000\nbecause he's one of the greatest physical comedians\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000\nof all time, then when he's writer,\n\n01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000\ndirector, producer, actor, everything,\n\n01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000\nthey're garbage.\n\n01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000\nI mean, there'll be a funny scene or two,\n\n01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nbut...\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nAnd I was trying to stitch that to, like, look,\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000\nif I see a talk show, a late night talk show,\n\n01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000\nand it's like, tonight's guest is the vice president\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000\nof the United States, and we're gonna play tug-of-war.\n\n01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000\nGap, gap.\n\n01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000\nIs that comedy?\n\n01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000\nI wanted to ask someone who\n\n01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000\nspent his career, like, right...\n\n01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000\nI wanted to, because I just wanted to hear him go,\n\n01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000\nno, thank you.\n\n01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000\nBecause it makes me angry.\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000\nI don't like institutional Apple on the desk\n\n01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nfucking fun is funny.\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000\nI was so intimidated by\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000\njust his aura and presence, and the fact\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nthat he's also just really magnanimous,\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nnice, like...\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nYou laid back.\n\n01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000\nYou chicken and stride.\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nUh, I should...\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000\nThat was an...\n\n01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000\nThis whole thing that happened earlier\n\n01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nwas an amazing moment for me, because\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000\nthose shows... Did you know he was gonna be here tonight, by the way?\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000\nUh, I got tipped to it\n\n01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000\nthis afternoon, so I came just to be around it,\n\n01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000\nbut it's just... You have to understand that that guy...\n\n01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000\nUh...\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nO's me ten bucks.\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000\nSure.
