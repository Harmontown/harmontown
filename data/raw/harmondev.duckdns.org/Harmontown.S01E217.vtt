00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm Andy Dick. I'm your guest comptroller.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome to Harmontown.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:42.000 --> 00:58.000
Please, please, let's welcome our mayor, Dan Harmon.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Thank you. Thank you, Andy Dick, guest comptroller Andy Dick.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Thank you.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
But not, you know, not really because Jeff is here.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
But he was so late that Jeff was like, start without me.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
And I was like, well, Andy do it. And Andy was like, I'll do it.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
And then Jeff was like, I'm a block away. And Andy was like, too late.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
So now Jeff's in the bathroom and we're starting the show.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And thank you very much. I think you'd make a great comptroller.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Thank you. Any time. Any time.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
You know what the job entails? Like keeping me on topic.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
For instance, like I tend to go off on tangents.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
And then sometimes I need to recall what I was talking about.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, Andy, you're doing great.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Get up here. Are you? Get up here.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, I need a little notepad then.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Who's going to keep me on track?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Well, maybe just maybe your joy will make you remember what I'm talking about.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Who says I'm joyous?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
So for instance, do you know about October birthdays, Andy?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
No, I don't.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Well, I found out, did I talk about this?

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
If your birthday's in early October, like you have one of the more popular birthdays.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
It's not spread out. Like it's not like one three hundred sixty-fifth of everyone has each birthday.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Like there's very popular birthdays.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And October 5th is the ultimate. It is the most popular birthday.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
And the reason why they think that is, is because 274 days earlier is New Year's Eve.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Pretty interesting. Pretty fun.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So then you go like, okay, so what is the...

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
That's already really interesting because New Year's Eve, it really makes you think what we do that night,

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
we lament who we are and we make all these plans for turning over a new leaf.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
And then we do this shit that fucks up our whole life that night, that very night.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
We do some of the craziest shit.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Like I'm sure the DUI numbers are through the roof that night, right? That's an easy guess.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Like I'm probably not wrong about that.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Probably like a lot of lives get ruined on New Year's Eve while people are like,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
finally 2017, it's going to be different.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah, it is. You're going to be pregnant or dead.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
And then you think, not that being pregnant is a bad thing, by the way.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, it is now. We have horrible overpopulation. Shame on you.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Also, who's this person going to be? Picasso? We made all the good people. We're fucked.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
You're just making another omen in a world with an omen surplus.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
We got enough Damians.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
But then you start, okay, what's the least popular birthday?

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
It's May 22nd and then you go 274 days from back and that's August 22nd.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
So is it just too hot to fuck? That was Cody's theory.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
It's just too hot. It's not a holiday, of course.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
It's the opposite of a holiday. It's just a hot day and the fans blowing on you

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
and you feel like you're in a shitty urban cowboy movie.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
Ah, shit.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm doing this wrong. Jeff texted me, tell Andy to bring Spencer out.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Hashtag Comptrolled.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
But then I brought him out. I should have told you to bring him out.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Do you want to try bringing him out? You don't have to. You can stay out.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I can go back.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Just pretend to go back. Just stay there.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
How would you have brought him out?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, the way I'm told.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
So you would have me say, and now, what's his title?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Game Master.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
And now, give it up for Game Master Spencer.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
What? No.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Thank you. Thank you.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
So what do you do over there? I mean, you look like you're...

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm fact checking.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Oh wait, you're right. About the birthday thing. The birthday is hot.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So someone having a birthday?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
No, about October. You know, all that stuff.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
If you were wrong, I would say something, but you're right.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh, you were looking it up.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
You weren't looking up. Are you periscoping?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I'm trying to get it up.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Got me. Yes, I'm trying to get it up.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
He's periscoping during our show.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm trying to.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
He's trying to periscope our show. Is that okay?

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
It's like an airplane flying up next to another airplane and siphoning gas out of it.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Like one of those refueling planes, but it's unfueling.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
No, but it's more like you're a fucking juggernaut and I'm just a little drone going,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
just trying to get a little of your juice.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
So are we disagree on tank size?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Like you're right.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
No, I'm like a little mosquito. Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Okay, you're right. I'm a part of it.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
No, it doesn't, to answer your question, is not really, there's no, you can periscope.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I asked him earlier.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Obviously, that's why I knew what he was doing.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Okay, what do we got here?

06:46.000 --> 06:56.000
Jeff's texting a gift of Stephen Colbert going like this.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Let me just talk about this for a second, if I might.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
So King Ralph, huh? What a movie.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
All right, I'll talk about that later.

07:08.000 --> 07:25.000
All right, and I had a, I tried to watch The Conjuring with Cody.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
You don't have to play to my periscope.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I want them to feel welcome.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
I tried to watch The Conjuring with Cody and she had taken a bunch of muscle relaxers

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
and we weren't really getting a lot of sleep

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
and the dogs were barking a lot at raccoons in the backyard

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
and what happened was, we watched The Conjuring and it was scary

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and we were asleep but we couldn't sleep all night

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
and there was always shit happening

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
and she was like on something and we're both drunk

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
but then in the middle of the night she got up to go to the bathroom

08:02.000 --> 08:11.000
because she couldn't see, she was just walking around like this

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
like holding her hands out, being careful, which was like how ghosts walk

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
and then I woke up and she saw me see her and she went,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I'm not a ghost, I'm not a ghost!

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Which is a really funny thing to have to say to somebody

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
and it's even funnier to be right that that's the thing to say

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
like she knew I thought she was a ghost, I'm not a ghost, I realize I look like a ghost.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
That's pretty self-aware

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
and it makes me think that's what must be happening to ghosts

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
like they're probably dying and walking around the land of the living

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
is like being on Viking in at three in the morning

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
like they're all probably just going like this because they're like,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
what the fuck is going on?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
and then we're like, oh, that's like a scare gesture

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
and they're like, no, I can't see without my ghost glasses

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
and they're saying, I am a ghost!

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, they're going, I'm not alive, I'm not alive!

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And you're like, that's scary!

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
But it comes out, boo!

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Poor ghosts.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Do you know who Amanda Knox is?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I just watched it, watched the whole thing.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
My favorite part was the guy that said,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
when it turned out like no one had done any DNA testing or whatever

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
and the guy's like, dude, I wish when the Americans started to question

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
our process forensically, it made me very upset.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
In the year 1308, this country was the birthplace of the American

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
or the Western justice system or something like that.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
In 1308, in America, they were drawing buffalo on the walls of caves.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I thought it was so adorable!

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
I love the idea that we were Native Americans

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
or cavemen, he might think, that we were like cavemen.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And I also love the idea that he doesn't understand

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
that you don't want to go to the older country for the forensics.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
He's like, are you kidding me, we invented eyeglasses!

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Of course we know whose blood splatter that was.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
No, you need lasers for that.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
You silly, silly feudal man.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
It's weird to think that he really thinks that way.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
I know, and it really goes to show you that he wouldn't have like a built-in shame.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And then you go like, oh wait, what's so great about,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
we really adapted that concept that out with the old and with the new

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
to such an extreme that we suffer for it to this day.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
We have no foundational culture, but at the same time,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
we don't have a class system that's so entrenched that a lot of people are going,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
excuse me, we don't, but in very, very European ways,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
class is like something totally like still,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
I think it's just baked into the system.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
And over here, I always look at it like America is the Las Vegas of the planet.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
So it's like a ton of bad shit happening all on the sidewalk,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
everyone shaking their head, like no culture, just blinking neon,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
just everyone trying to out-goach everybody,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
because fuck you, I won, you lost, oh, I'm up today, I'm down tomorrow.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And it's like, yeah, like in every way,

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
every metaphor that would apply, and then everyone else is like, this can't last.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
It's about to blow up and just waiting very patiently.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
And for them, the definition of patience is 400 years,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
you'll still be a flash of the pan if you're gone.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
And I'm like, we're on that schedule.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
They're going to be right, these blue bloods.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
They're going to be like, remember when the Americans were around?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
They could be right.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
Hey, about Amanda Knox, what did you think of her boyfriend?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I don't remember his.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
Sara Serretti or Serati, did you guys see the little documentary?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I love documentaries.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
It was in the news, I watched it in the news about this girl named Amanda Knox,

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
who was accused of killing her roommate while she was doing a study abroad thing

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
in Italy, and they said she killed her roommate.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I guess nobody knows about it.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
What about her boyfriend?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Well, this doesn't really matter.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Did you guys see it?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
It's on Netflix, some of you did.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
It's a one time, it's a documentary.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I loved it because it's one of those, they do so well with those where

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
I'm like, oh God, that bitch is guilty.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
They make her seem so crazy in the beginning.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
And then within the first two minutes, she's making little meatballs with Romney.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Oh, that's so creepy.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
She's so gross.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
She has the first word and she says, look, the thing is, I'm different.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I act weird, I talk weird, I react to things weird.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
And that had me in because I've always been terrified of,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
my 911 call is going to be the one where they play and they go, listen to him.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Why is he, what do you mean my girlfriend's head came off?

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
You say decapitated and I'm going to be like, what the fuck do you say?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Write a script for my 911 call.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
And then they're going to be like, hmm, testy.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
And I'm just like, I know, and then they're going to open up one of many boxes in my house

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
that will make me look like, whether I killed someone or not,

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Jail's not a bad place for me to be.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Like, not a bad idea.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
All the alcohol and all the pickles.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, you're, you don't just, I hope nothing bad ever happens in your house.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh God, man, just, yeah, just break into my house, open any third box.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
If you really are an enemy of mine and you want to see me go down.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
What about the first two? What's in there?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, just taxes.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
That stuff won't, you know, that's fine, you know, I didn't lose a billion dollars

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
and then write it off for 22 years.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
But then the next one is like, is that a sex doll?

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
And how old is it?

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
In both senses of the word.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
Here are the two weird things to me about that movie, Amanda Knox,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
and about her is that in the beginning when they, they really kind of make her

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
look a little crazy.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
She's got wide eyes and she says a very strange phrase, something about,

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
look, either I, and they set her up real nice, lit nice on a stool.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm like, well, she's not in jail.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
That's my first thing is she in a jail outfit right now.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
She's not.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
So I know she did not go to jail, but she did.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
You have to watch it.

14:47.000 --> 14:57.000
So, and she says either I am a crazy sociopathic psycho killer or I am you.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
I'm like.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Instead of innocent.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
But that doesn't make sense.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
What does that mean?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Because I am secretly a crazy psychopathic killer.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Right.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
That doesn't mean you're innocent.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I don't know what you meant at all by that.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It's almost like she, that's what I'm like.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
She's guilty.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
And then her boyfriend just turned on her right away.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
It's all spoiler alert stuff.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Because we're also familiar with here in the States because we have the world's

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
largest prison population and all of our TV shows are about the process of putting them

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
in prison.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
And we're fascinated with it.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
And so most people in this audience, I think could, could probably get through an

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
interrogation.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
But, but a lot of the stories like the Memphis, South Memphis 17 or whatever the hell they

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
like.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Like a lot of, and the making of a murderer thing too.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
A lot of those stories have people who are either, either they're young or they're maybe

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
a little, a little on the, on the lighter side of the, of the intelligence.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
God, what, how will you say this diplomatically?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
What path am I going to take through that minefield?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
They're either young or they're dumb.

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
Or they're, or they just haven't, they've never, ever considered the concept of like

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
just like, oh, this is what the cops want.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
They're like, I feel like I'm not saying we're all super strong people that could get through

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
an interrogation.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm just saying we would know when they sat us down in that chair that we, we have, if

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
we don't call our lawyer, we're absolutely fucked until the moment we do.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
And that, and that every moment until then they're only, they're going to do whatever they can

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
to make us say that we did something.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And this guy is some Italian guy.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
It was like really kind of just adorably hunky and like, and, and, and he, and it's just,

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
it makes you sad that he goes into one side of that black box and he comes out the other

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
like just going, yeah, she did it and fine.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Now can I go to bed?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
And then, and then there's also like, I remember what happened.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
He said, he turned on her right away when, when, when the cops scared him into thinking

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
that maybe she, that she turned on him.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
And then because, but he had these weird thoughts about everything because when she got home

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
that, that morning to, to her apartment where the girl was already dead, she took a shower.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
And there was, and there was, and there was someone else's shit in the toilet that they,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
no one ever tested the shit.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
All right, just watch it.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Just watch it.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
If you're like me, you'll be like the, well, you'll walk away like no one ever tested the

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
turd.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It was like this grody, that was the thing.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
It's like no woman made that turd.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
And like, I don't know if it's sexist, like, oh, they're so dainty.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm just saying like, they're fucking like, they have some standards.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
Like they, it was like a, that was a gross like fig turd, like that like landed outside

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
the water.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I was like, I don't care who you murdered.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
You'd be like, you'd be like, in the bowl.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Just, I'm not leaving this.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
This is not going to be my legacy as the person that killed this person.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
I want a corpse and a knife and some fingerprints, maybe a little DNA, but not this fucking.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I showed a photo of the shit.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
This fucking gross date from a bad Mediterranean.

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
But the big turn to me, and this is the part I found the most fascinating was at the very

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
end, he, he wanted to get back together with her.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
He loved her.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
In prison.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
And she had a change of heart.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
She's like, no, I don't.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Yeah.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
I would think that he would leave her forever and ever, right?

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
Did you know this was before the Billy Bush was a household name?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
The household.

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
Like, I mean, he was, he was more of a, more of a guilty pleasure, shitty hot tub room

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
name before that.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
But he, like, like, like Billy Bush, like is in that documentary.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Did you notice like you can hear his voice?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I think, unless I'm totally mistaken, I'm thinking of the other guy.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
I think it was Billy Bush.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
You can hear his voice going like she's, because he's just being fed like world is like, yeah,

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
there's a Foxy Noxie and she's like sitting down in the gallery or the whatever they call

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
it behind her table.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
And then he just goes, he's like, I don't know, doesn't look like a Foxy to me.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
It looks like maybe she had a rough night.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Maybe she needs a little more mascara.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Maybe they don't provide that in Paris jails or something.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Like it was just like, I think it was him.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I think it was his voice.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Anyways.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
All right.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Who cares?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Like that guy needs to be taken down a peg.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
That was not him, by the way.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And I'm the jury's out with him.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Did you just fact check me?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I know for a fact.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
I remember that guy and they showed him and it wasn't unless it was, I should, can somebody

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
fact check that because maybe, but I remember the guy, I can picture him and, but, but Billy's

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
weird because I happen to be following him on Snapchat.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Billy, Billy Bush.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I only follow five people.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Do you only follow five people?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Like you only follow five star.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
No, my kids and Billy fucking.

19:52.000 --> 20:03.000
It was before this whole Trump thing is because I'm fast and weirdly fascinated by him because

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I've been interviewed by him many times.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
If I get, if I show up, I think he's at E if I remember.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
He always vies to do my interview.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm gonna, I'm doing it.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm like, oh, this guy really likes me.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
It's all sweet.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
But then I started thinking, or does he, is he trying to get me?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
You know what I mean?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Corner me like a rat.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Poke my cage.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
What is he doing?

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
And so I've been, I've been watching him like privately because his snaps are private,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
supposedly.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
And I, and I've been trying to like assess to see if he's a real person, if he's being,

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
if, if there's a guy, if there's actually a guy in the media out there that actually likes me.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
That's all.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
So I've been watching and watching and watching and watching.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Oh no.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
You were following him because you thought he might be one of the good ones.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Jerry's still out because.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
You know, but the sad thing is it's just him.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
He's the only candidate.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
That's what said, you didn't have like Michael Osiello on there.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
No, no, no, no, no.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
There's people that I know kind of like me.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Oh, you're like Osiello's in.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
This one's the one I'm like, I just don't get it.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Is he tricking me and pretending to like me?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Well, I think this is a good segue because the cost of celebrity.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
You weather it in this rough industry town.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
What if you were a passionate haunted house curator?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
We've, we've had my neighbor on before.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
You guys know Beth Boots and she was here too.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
But she's not coming up tonight.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
So now boo boo.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Oh shit.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Well, I don't, I didn't mean boo like please boo for me.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
But I understand that you didn't understand that.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
But I also, when did you guys start doing things to make me happy?

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
You fucking millennial shit faces.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I thought you came here to watch me fail.

21:53.000 --> 22:00.000
So now all of a sudden you're going to boo on command, you little Nazis.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But Beth has been up here in the low.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
Most recently she was up here with her kid Timmer who is a, a really a died in the wall

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
card carrying four years and for four years for a 16 year old.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
That's like, that's like beyond dog years.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
That's like a long time that he's been doing his haunted house.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
And so we said, I said, let's keep tabs on him.

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
So he's, he's, he's here tonight with, with some of his haunted house workers.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Let's bring out Timmer Bootson and company.

22:30.000 --> 22:48.000
So Dan, you told me that these were the stranger things kids.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
Cause I didn't want you to think we were getting Columbines.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
I wanted you to come to the show.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
So Timmer, do you want to introduce your, your terrifying friends?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I don't know who they are.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Oh, okay.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, the stranger things kids.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
All right.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
This, that's our dress.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
That's Carson.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
That's Masimo.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Say hi.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
All right.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Well, I don't think we'll forget those names any time soon.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
Do they have specialties like, does anyone in charge of the pumpkin bucket by the door

23:29.000 --> 23:36.000
and then another person's in charge of taping the plastic bags to the, to the CD player?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
They all do that job.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Okay.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
They all do that.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Your mom sent some photos.

23:40.000 --> 23:50.000
Well, first of all, how is the, your mom sent some photos, but that's a different interview.

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
That's not, that's not the reaction that, I mean, I, that was my joke.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
But when you react like that, you make it bad.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Just laugh.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
You shouldn't, you shouldn't, you shouldn't.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
It turned into married with children for a second.

24:05.000 --> 24:12.000
Look, it was a show in the nineties and the, the, the, the, the, the canned laughter went

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
from genuine laughter to just people going, whoo.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
Every time he said he didn't want to fuck his wife and it was like, it was messed up.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Timmer, can I, can I call you Tim?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Sure.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Should you have been named Tim?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Sorry.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Sorry.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah, probably.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
So it'd be easier for people like you to pronounce.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yeah.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Yeah.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I mean, it's all about me and my comfort.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Yes.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Except, except this time of year when you were fucking haunted houses.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
No, I'm kidding.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
So how is the, how is the, how is it going this year compared to last year's?

24:49.000 --> 24:57.000
Much better because we have more actors and we have, we, it's, it's bigger.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
Have you, in what ways over the, over the four years since you started getting into haunted

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
house?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Because I know, I know one answer is going to be, you start earlier and earlier in the

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
year, right?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Because this year you started in May working on this year's haunted house.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
And what other ways, is it getting bigger, like geographically?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Like, is it taking up more space?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
Last year it still took up space, but this year there's more twists and turns.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
And your mom said, it's just more of an efficient use of land.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
That's all.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Like you said.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
It's just more of an efficient use of land.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
That's all.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Right.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Right.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
So yeah, I know.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
You have this breakthrough of landscape management.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
What, what, how did you figure out how to use it better than last time?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
It's a real question.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Um, I don't know.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I just use my brain.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
So this time around you're just like, oh man, I'm better.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Yeah.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
All right.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I've grown a lot since last year.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, I give up.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
That's true.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I mean, your whole brain is changing.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I mean, four years ago it's just robots.

26:03.000 --> 26:12.000
That's getting to be robots and don't get me started.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
No one wants you to get started.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
So that's the, that's the frustration of this age.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Isn't it?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You're not allowed to get started.

26:20.000 --> 26:29.000
And yet you, you've started the, so I'm told by parents, the, the, but, but, but you,

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
you, so I, so the pictures that, that, that I got sent, uh, there's a, it looks like a

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
lot of like, like, like I'm watching it under construction, I guess in these pictures,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
but it really looks like a, there's a post-apocalyptic theme.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Hence the gas masks.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Do you, is there a reason you chose a post-apocalypse theme?

26:46.000 --> 26:57.000
Well, have you guys been watching the debates lately?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's been our show.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Excellent.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Excellent work.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Amazing.

27:05.000 --> 27:13.000
Uh, so, but, but as it looks like a lot of like, like, it's a lot of, a lot of hefty bags,

27:13.000 --> 27:20.000
like black plastic bags or, but, and PVC pipe and black electric tape.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
And that's like, is that like just a framework or is it, is it like, are you walking through

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
a world of black plastic?

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yeah.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Pretty much it's the frame.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
And then those are the walls.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And then we put props in it.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yeah.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Yeah.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
It's more than that racist.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
There's white bags as well.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Oh.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Oh.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
That's nice.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean, I can't, what, what am I going to do with that?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I'm too old to laugh, too young to help.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Like, I don't know.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Uh.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
So how long, how long, how long is the average consumers experience when they come to your

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
haunted house?

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
Like from, from gate to gate, from running away in terror to running up and going.

28:03.000 --> 28:10.000
I think about three to five minutes depending on how scared you are.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
Do you, do, do, do, do, what does a mistake people make who don't want to be scared in

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
a haunted house?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Do they go slower or faster?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Uh, they probably go slower cause.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
So they get scared more.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
They drag out, they create their own nightmare.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Pretty much.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.520
It's just like, um, uh, when you're a monkey and you grab the, uh, sugar or the salt cubes

28:30.520 --> 28:35.640
and that one, uh, 70s nature film and they, they won't let go of the salt.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.000
So they're trapped there forever and they die of thirst.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Sure.

28:39.000 --> 28:49.000
Or it's like, like, uh, like a, I don't know, like other things in nature where your struggle,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
quicksand, I think they call it.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
It makes your, do you believe in quicksand?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Do you think it's real?

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
Uh, I mean, I've never been asked that question before, but I've seen it in movies.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Me too.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Only in movies.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
I've never seen like a nature documentary where Anthony Hopkins is like, the elephant

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
doesn't count.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
It's some quicksand.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Well, I like a lot of things in life.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
It's probably real.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
It's not real.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
It's not real.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
It's definitely real.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It's definitely real.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
I'm gonna listen to him.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Yeah.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
It's real.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I got stuck.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Yeah.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I got stuck too.

29:20.000 --> 29:28.640
I fact-checked it in my world because I was stuck up to my ball sack in quicksand when

29:28.640 --> 29:29.640
I was little.

29:29.640 --> 29:30.640
Quicksand is real.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.640
Is it real?

29:31.640 --> 29:35.000
It's like trying to listen to my parents one telling me Santa's real.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
One's telling me, no, it's not.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Santa's real.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Quicksand is real.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.080
Santa's not real, but quicksand.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.080
Think about it.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.080
It's a real thing.

29:44.080 --> 29:52.080
Is there anything other than fear that you would love to cause with your haunted house?

29:52.080 --> 29:53.080
Wow.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.080
Equality.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.080
Can you elaborate?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.080
Just say that.

29:56.080 --> 30:02.480
Like, is there any other message writing in there like with the post-apocalypse theme

30:02.480 --> 30:06.360
and you're, you know, it's like, should people, are you hoping like maybe people will walk

30:06.360 --> 30:08.920
out going like, man, that scared the shit out of me.

30:08.920 --> 30:15.720
And also like, did you notice that chaos is not as much a part of our life as it needs

30:15.720 --> 30:16.720
to be?

30:16.720 --> 30:26.000
Well, I guess that's why Halloween's once a year so I could show you all the hell you

30:26.000 --> 30:29.120
can go through in life and then you can be lucky for the rest of the year.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.120
Oh, that's nice.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.120
Yeah.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
All right.

30:32.120 --> 30:37.920
Well, let's have a hand for Timur and his friends and go to their haunted house.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.800
You want people to go, right?

30:40.800 --> 30:41.800
Yeah.

30:41.800 --> 30:48.720
I mean, I got, because I saw on the, I think of the Facebook, like, you know, one of our

30:48.720 --> 30:53.760
fans, Jane, who was coordinating some, I don't know, there was, I heard about a bunch of

30:53.760 --> 30:55.080
people coming to your haunted house.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.000
I don't know if they've done it yet or if they're going to do it.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.720
Oh yeah, you have a big fan base.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.520
We had about two or three people there.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.520
Okay.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.520
Yeah.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.520
That seems about right.

31:04.520 --> 31:09.200
Well, so we can, we can, we can invite people without worrying of overwhelming you.

31:09.200 --> 31:14.280
It's 4302 Ambrose Avenue where, and yeah, the website's better to give.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.280
It's ambrosehauntedmaze.com.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.280
Yeah.

31:18.280 --> 31:24.440
Every night from seven.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.680
And it says, face your fears.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.680
Face your fears.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.680
All right.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.680
All right.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.680
You guys go face your fears of school day tomorrow.

31:31.680 --> 31:35.400
Thank you.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.400
It's Monday.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.520
All right.

31:39.520 --> 31:47.920
Well, Andy, the time has come for you to, I think, abandon your, your wings as a guest

31:47.920 --> 31:56.280
cop trawler and become a guest.

31:56.280 --> 32:03.160
Our next guest has been guest comp trawling and to, to, to mixed results and, and, and

32:03.160 --> 32:07.360
oh, here's our, all right, Jeff just wants to be a guest.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.160
I'm going to sit out here.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.160
Okay.

32:10.160 --> 32:15.200
Let's mix it up because Andy, Andy, you're doing such a good job of comp trawling.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.520
Am I, am I being periscoped right now?

32:18.520 --> 32:24.080
There was so cool that you had spooky one direction on that was nice.

32:24.080 --> 32:28.400
Do you think that they, that they murdered Zayn?

32:28.400 --> 32:31.640
Is that why, is that why Zayn wasn't out here?

32:31.640 --> 32:34.920
You're outside my pop cultural vocabulary.

32:34.920 --> 32:38.560
I, I, I Googled it while I was back there.

32:38.560 --> 32:44.640
I typed in one direction, who, and it auto filled in, who left?

32:44.640 --> 32:45.640
Oh.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.640
It was Zayn.

32:46.640 --> 32:53.760
I heard if you play their hit, email, email my Twitter backwards, it says Zayn is dead.

32:53.760 --> 32:59.760
But you have to reverse the file in SoundCloud in order to hear it.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.680
Where did Andy go?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.240
And now Andy just, Andy's just evaporated.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
Oh, there he is.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.880
I just have to pee.

33:06.880 --> 33:07.880
Okay.

33:07.880 --> 33:08.880
Go pee.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.880
All right.

33:09.880 --> 33:10.880
Go pee.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.880
All right.

33:11.880 --> 33:18.880
Well, thanks for, thanks for coming and, uh, uh, I'm really happy about that.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.880
Oh, no.

33:20.880 --> 33:26.160
Hi, I'm filling in Brandy.

33:26.160 --> 33:31.280
Dino Stamatopolous, uh, the, uh, inmates are running the, uh, the asylum.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.280
Oh, really?

33:33.280 --> 33:36.880
Dino, is this your guitar?

33:36.880 --> 33:37.880
That's my guitar.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.880
Are you going to sing a song for us later?

33:39.880 --> 33:40.880
Shhh.

33:40.880 --> 33:41.880
It's a surprise.

33:41.880 --> 33:42.880
Well, no, it's not.

33:42.880 --> 33:43.880
It's a fucking guitar.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.880
No, I'm going to fuck.

33:44.880 --> 33:45.880
Well, I think you don't know what I'm going to do with it.

33:45.880 --> 33:46.880
I'm going to fuck that guitar.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.880
Yeah.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.880
Well, it's going to fuck me.

33:49.880 --> 33:50.880
I forgot.

33:50.880 --> 33:51.880
I forgot.

33:51.880 --> 33:56.040
So it's mentioned something about the haunted house that Beth mentioned, which is that there

33:56.040 --> 34:00.880
are so many more twists and turns this year that people are really getting lost.

34:00.880 --> 34:05.120
How old, how old were those boys?

34:05.120 --> 34:07.880
And why was Andy here with them?

34:07.880 --> 34:12.880
Also, when they left, Andy left right after they did.

34:12.880 --> 34:19.880
So much so funny.

34:19.880 --> 34:23.880
I mean, I could put.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.880
Now where's Dino?

34:24.880 --> 34:25.880
Where's Dino?

34:25.880 --> 34:29.880
Why do you have a duffel bag full of skeletons?

34:29.880 --> 34:30.880
Where's Dino?

34:30.880 --> 34:33.880
What did you do or say to those children back there?

34:33.880 --> 34:34.880
I didn't see them.

34:34.880 --> 34:35.880
I went pee.

34:35.880 --> 34:36.880
Okay.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
Just now?

34:37.880 --> 34:38.880
All right.

34:38.880 --> 34:42.880
We can't really verify your story until we check the tape.

34:42.880 --> 34:43.880
All right.

34:43.880 --> 34:50.440
So I know that this has been talked about a lot by everybody, but that's part of why

34:50.440 --> 34:55.360
I'm outraged about it, because it hasn't changed.

34:55.360 --> 35:01.440
Why did we make this shift with fortune cookies, where they're just advice cookies.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.480
They're just platitude cookies.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.560
And you don't even have to change it much to make a...

35:07.560 --> 35:11.560
100 compliments, like you are a wise person, and it's like, oh great, I'll take it to the

35:11.560 --> 35:12.560
bank.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
I got one at one time.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.960
I got one at one time and said, people like you at a party.

35:15.960 --> 35:16.960
Yeah, exactly.

35:16.960 --> 35:17.960
I'm like, that's not fortune.

35:17.960 --> 35:18.960
That's not a fortune.

35:18.960 --> 35:22.800
Okay, so take that one and just change it to, people are going to like you at a party.

35:22.800 --> 35:23.800
Great fortune.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.800
Oh no, no.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.800
One person might not like you at a party.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.320
Oh yeah, I mean, even at some...

35:28.320 --> 35:29.320
Like Gremlins me.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.920
Like fucking be the creepy guy at the fucking Mogwes store.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.920
Beware.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.320
You know, you're gonna get invited to a party.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.760
I don't know if you should go.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.760
Like peep somebody by there might not like you, and you'd be like, ooh, there's steaks

35:40.760 --> 35:42.320
to my shitty life.

35:42.320 --> 35:47.240
I was like, fantasize there'd be a fortune cookie, you open it up and the fortune just

35:47.240 --> 35:50.760
said, duck.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.880
That's a fucking good fortune cookie.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.480
But it says that all over the menu.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.480
Yeah.

35:55.480 --> 35:59.360
That's true.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.560
So they feel like they'd be trying to...

36:01.560 --> 36:03.760
I'll have the peaking duck.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.640
All right, well, so have you ever seen King Ralph?

36:07.640 --> 36:09.640
I don't...

36:09.640 --> 36:11.120
What's that one?

36:11.120 --> 36:12.120
It's...

36:12.120 --> 36:15.720
Okay, so I was describing it to Cody because we were talking about Trump and I was like,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.520
I don't know if people think it's like a King Ralph thing.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.520
Is that why they like him?

36:18.520 --> 36:19.520
She's like, what's King Ralph?

36:19.520 --> 36:25.440
I said, you know, there was a movie that John Goodman is a guy and lives in Vegas or Cleveland

36:25.440 --> 36:26.440
or something and he...

36:26.440 --> 36:30.960
Vegas or Cleveland.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.600
Interchangeable cities.

36:33.600 --> 36:39.680
The entire royal family is wiped out in a freak accident, leaving him as the only heir,

36:39.680 --> 36:40.680
so he's King Ralph.

36:40.680 --> 36:44.080
And then she's like, wait, that sounds like the greatest movie ever.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.080
And I'm like, yeah, it does.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
Why haven't I ever watched that?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.080
And then we watched it.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.000
It was like, oh my God, it was so boring.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.680
How can you make a movie about the entire royal family getting murdered in the first

36:53.680 --> 36:57.040
three minutes and like having John Goodman become the King of England?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.040
How do you...

36:58.040 --> 37:01.960
Isn't that the same premise of designated survivor or whatever?

37:01.960 --> 37:02.960
Designated survivor.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.800
Keepers of England.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
He becomes the King...

37:05.800 --> 37:06.800
Oh, man.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.800
Keepers of England.

37:07.800 --> 37:08.800
Oh, man.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.800
He becomes the...

37:09.800 --> 37:10.800
The designated survivor.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.800
They put him in like a secret cabinet somewhere.

37:12.800 --> 37:13.800
Yeah, they put the guy that...

37:13.800 --> 37:16.440
Well, he's just like the secretary of agriculture or something?

37:16.440 --> 37:17.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.440
Yeah, but that's not...

37:18.440 --> 37:19.440
I mean, like we don't live in...

37:19.440 --> 37:21.400
Well, I mean, no, that's fun, sure.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.680
So is Dave with Kevin Klein.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.760
He's the president's double and then he becomes president.

37:25.760 --> 37:29.760
Like, these are interesting and then you go and like, oh man, if this guy was president,

37:29.760 --> 37:34.040
oh, and it's like, it's the King of England, I guess the problem is the King doesn't really

37:34.040 --> 37:36.960
do anything and that's not a controversial statement.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.480
It's like specifically designed to not be a active office.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.400
And then so then you're like, what's at stake?

37:42.400 --> 37:46.200
But then also it's just weird because I think the only thing that...

37:46.200 --> 37:48.960
Because the Royals are a family, that's the whole point of them.

37:48.960 --> 37:52.720
So since you have to kill them all in order to have them be King, he's just wandering

37:52.720 --> 37:58.120
around Buckingham Palace going, this needs a bowling alley and like it's not like there's

37:58.120 --> 38:02.800
an old lady going, I never, because she's dead.

38:02.800 --> 38:06.720
There's just a bunch of people going, well, you're King.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.720
But does he...

38:07.720 --> 38:08.720
Research bowling alley.

38:08.720 --> 38:14.440
But does he use his like, like, like meathead, like lower class morality to kind of shake

38:14.440 --> 38:17.040
things up for good or what happens?

38:17.040 --> 38:21.960
Kind of, but it's like so low stakes, it's like, like he becomes King and then he falls

38:21.960 --> 38:27.360
in love with a stripper and like, but she's not a stripper because it's really fucked

38:27.360 --> 38:28.360
up.

38:28.360 --> 38:33.200
And then it's like, they go straight from, I can't believe this guy's the King of England

38:33.200 --> 38:39.360
too, if he does something improper, then the stewards or the tutors will be able to sweep

38:39.360 --> 38:45.320
in and it's like, what do you mean if he does something improper, he's a fucking fat guy

38:45.320 --> 38:48.880
from Las Vegas?

38:48.880 --> 38:53.040
But then you'll be able to invoke the law of abdication?

38:53.040 --> 38:54.040
It doesn't make...

38:54.040 --> 38:57.040
You spend the whole time going, what the hell's going on?

38:57.040 --> 38:59.680
You're talking about a movie that you don't want any of us to see.

38:59.680 --> 39:06.000
Yeah, but I just thought it was amazing that the plot for King Ralph exists in the annals

39:06.000 --> 39:11.200
of our bad movie, and it's like, it's a good idea, I mean, it would be interesting to watch

39:11.200 --> 39:14.880
a guy be King of England, but it's really boring.

39:14.880 --> 39:19.080
Like, it's not a bad idea, do you want to see like King Spencer?

39:19.080 --> 39:20.080
Yeah.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.080
Yeah.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.800
Spencer's the King of England, like, I could fill 90 minutes.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.800
Designated Spencer.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
Yeah.

39:27.800 --> 39:34.760
People are really getting lost in that haunted house, okay, I warn you about that.

39:34.760 --> 39:35.760
Probably all these tutors.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.240
I want to get back to...

39:38.240 --> 39:41.400
On the front, you know, they go like, click, click, click as you come in with one of those

39:41.400 --> 39:42.800
clickers, and there's just...

39:42.800 --> 39:50.720
When they check the till at the end, there's two people in play, and they've run a thing,

39:50.720 --> 39:56.280
the plastic's all intact, so I think there's two people still in there facing their fears.

39:56.280 --> 40:03.920
But you find it weird, at the end of the haunted house, there's these snacks that taste like

40:03.920 --> 40:04.920
people.

40:04.920 --> 40:05.920
All right.

40:05.920 --> 40:09.920
They taste like two people.

40:09.920 --> 40:15.040
Oh yeah, I don't know, they taste like two people.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.640
It tastes like two missing people.

40:17.640 --> 40:23.120
Well, let's bring out Dino so that we can talk to him.

40:23.120 --> 40:30.120
Yeah, Dino!

40:30.120 --> 40:34.520
Right for the vodka.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.800
Fucking night!

40:36.800 --> 40:38.520
He knows what he likes.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.480
Andy, have you been, man?

40:41.480 --> 40:42.480
Where are you going?

40:42.480 --> 40:44.280
Every time I look over here, you're milling about...

40:44.280 --> 40:45.960
I thought I was coming up there.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.160
You're staying right where you are.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.160
Andy was doing good.

40:49.160 --> 40:52.560
I was standing over there, and I was watching.

40:52.560 --> 40:53.560
Would you be happier out here, Andy?

40:53.560 --> 40:57.120
No, no, I like this for a little bit, but I do like...

40:57.120 --> 40:59.320
I feel comfortable with Dino.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.320
Oh, okay.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.320
Get over here.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.320
Why don't we switch places?

41:02.320 --> 41:03.320
I can stay here.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
Switch places.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.320
I'll switch, I'll switch.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
Jeff loves it right here.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
No, no, no.

41:07.320 --> 41:08.320
I won't.

41:08.320 --> 41:17.440
I have to say, I was sitting over there watching you, and it was like I was watching my kid

41:17.440 --> 41:23.160
be in like a soccer team for the first time, like, oh, yeah, hit it!

41:23.160 --> 41:26.960
And when you got your first laugh, I was so proud of you.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.280
What was it when it was his first laugh?

41:28.280 --> 41:30.160
I don't know.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.280
His mom took the picture.

41:32.280 --> 41:38.600
All right, well, so you guys, again, just to re-mention it, you have a fair audio podcast

41:38.600 --> 41:39.600
called Skull Juice.

41:39.600 --> 41:40.600
Skull Juice, yeah.

41:40.600 --> 41:48.040
Front Rose, love us.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.520
But also, Dino, you have a band.

41:51.520 --> 41:54.200
I have a band called Sorry About Everything.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.200
Don't, don't throw it.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.200
It's a punk band.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.200
It's okay.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.200
I'm not really apologizing.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.720
I'm cocky about it.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.720
It's easier than comedy.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.800
Look, I'm not getting any laughs.

42:04.800 --> 42:10.080
And you know I want to be like you, so I don't know if I told you yet, but I started a band.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.080
Called?

42:11.080 --> 42:12.080
You're welcome.

42:12.080 --> 42:21.680
When, uh, when I got my first Emmy for the Ben Stiller show, Andy and I actually wrote

42:21.680 --> 42:22.680
a lot of the sketches.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.640
You know that's how he said first, Emmy.

42:24.640 --> 42:25.640
True.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.640
Well, I mean, I don't know, I'm not dead yet.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.640
It's my one Emmy, but, you know.

42:31.640 --> 42:34.000
I thought you have multiple Emmys.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
No, I only have one Emmy.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
I tell people you have five.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Thank you, baby.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Let's go with that.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Let's go with that.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.120
You know, you, you call your one Emmy, your first Emmy.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.120
I love that.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.120
That's a good idea.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.120
I ain't dead yet.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.120
What an optimist I love.

42:45.120 --> 42:46.120
Yeah.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.040
But you know, I'm a pessimist too.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.120
I call my, my mom, my...

42:50.120 --> 42:51.120
First mom.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.120
My, yeah, my soon-to-be-deceased mother.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.120
Yeah.

42:54.120 --> 42:58.560
Because you're a pessimist?

42:58.560 --> 43:00.920
You want her to be dead.

43:00.920 --> 43:01.920
She's listening.

43:01.920 --> 43:05.040
No, a pessimist means I don't want her to be dead.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.040
I don't know.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.800
I don't know what I'm talking about.

43:07.800 --> 43:08.800
She's not listening.

43:08.800 --> 43:09.800
Your mom's not going to listen.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.800
No.

43:10.800 --> 43:11.800
My mom will never listen to this.

43:11.800 --> 43:12.800
I'll make sure she does.

43:12.800 --> 43:13.800
She doesn't even listen to you when you talk at Thanksgiving.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.800
Right.

43:14.800 --> 43:15.800
Yeah.

43:15.800 --> 43:16.800
She's like this guy.

43:16.800 --> 43:17.800
Your mother...

43:17.800 --> 43:18.800
Scares the shit out of me.

43:18.800 --> 43:19.800
Yeah.

43:19.800 --> 43:20.800
Yeah.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.800
She's terrifying too.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.800
Well, because she wants to fuck you really badly.

43:22.800 --> 43:23.800
Probably.

43:23.800 --> 43:24.800
That's right.

43:24.800 --> 43:29.800
That's like, that's like a wolf man wanting to fuck you.

43:29.800 --> 43:34.800
Who doesn't want to fuck you?

43:34.800 --> 43:38.800
Why don't you want me to fuck you?

43:38.800 --> 43:39.800
All right.

43:39.800 --> 43:40.800
Sorry.

43:40.800 --> 43:41.800
You have.

43:41.800 --> 43:42.800
I have.

43:42.800 --> 43:43.800
I fucked you.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.800
I fucked you for ten years by not talking to you.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.800
You dreamed about either filetting Dino or Dino filetting you?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.800
I don't want to talk about it.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.800
It's on your Feral Audio podcast.

43:53.800 --> 43:54.800
Oh, it is.

43:54.800 --> 43:55.800
We spoke about it, of the three of us.

43:55.800 --> 43:56.800
Yeah.

43:56.800 --> 43:57.800
He doesn't want to talk about it on somebody else's podcast.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.800
Because it was a Louis C.K. dreamed about wanting to fuck Dino.

44:00.800 --> 44:01.800
Or fucking Dino?

44:01.800 --> 44:02.800
No.

44:02.800 --> 44:06.800
I was just spooning in my dream, spooning, and it was just like a jerk.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.800
I think Louis and I were...

44:08.800 --> 44:14.800
Did you guys ever have a dream where you were a lady?

44:14.800 --> 44:17.800
And you were getting copulated with upon by a gentleman?

44:17.800 --> 44:18.800
I did.

44:18.800 --> 44:19.800
Oh, really?

44:19.800 --> 44:20.800
Yeah.

44:20.800 --> 44:24.800
I had a dream that I was in my kitchen sink when I was a kid.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.800
In your sink as a lady?

44:26.800 --> 44:27.800
Yeah.

44:27.800 --> 44:28.800
That's the one lady like.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.800
I know.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.800
It was animalistic and passionate.

44:30.800 --> 44:34.800
And there was this very Mario from Mario Brothers looking guy,

44:34.800 --> 44:37.800
just giving it to me missionary style.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.800
And I was in the sink.

44:39.800 --> 44:40.800
And then the die-hard guy came in.

44:40.800 --> 44:41.800
You're all 80s.

44:41.800 --> 44:43.800
It's ridiculous.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.800
Were you shrunken down to fit inside a sink?

44:46.800 --> 44:47.800
No.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.800
First of all, I was a younger kid.

44:49.800 --> 44:53.800
So in my mind, the sink was bigger.

44:53.800 --> 44:54.800
Right.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.800
And then also, if I'm thinking I'm a lady, I don't know.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.800
I was in the sink.

44:59.800 --> 45:03.800
It was like, the sink is big enough for a butt, a human butt.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.800
So you're like, I wasn't like, contained in the sink.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.800
Like, it was like, the littles or something.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.800
Or I'm like, sliding down a spoon.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.800
If there's a guy fucking me.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.800
If your butt's in the sink, how does somebody fuck you while your butt is down in the recess?

45:16.800 --> 45:18.800
Well, I mean, I'm a kid, I don't really.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.800
You're such a stickler.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.800
I'm a visual sinker, Dino.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.800
How big was Mario?

45:24.800 --> 45:26.800
He was like a, he was like a.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.800
His feet on the ground?

45:28.800 --> 45:31.800
No, I mean, that's the thing is he was like, he was a compact man.

45:31.800 --> 45:32.800
Yeah.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.800
He was probably like, he would have had to have been on like a.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.800
The mushroom.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.800
Yeah.

45:36.800 --> 45:41.800
The way that he was giving it to me on the height of counter that I was on with.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.800
He had to have been on my foot.

45:43.800 --> 45:44.800
Yeah.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.800
I just think it's.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.800
But the dream is just point of view.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.800
I mean, I don't have to deal with that stuff.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.800
And I was like, probably, I don't know.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.800
Well, I would have to say like, this is after puberty.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.800
And like, I'm going to say like 13, maybe I had that dream.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.800
He probably would look like a nice lady at that age.

46:00.800 --> 46:10.800
I remember my friends when I was like 12, somehow it came up and they'd like, Dino, you'd make a good looking girl.

46:10.800 --> 46:15.800
And I was like mad, but now I'd kill for that a compliment.

46:15.800 --> 46:16.800
Yeah.

46:16.800 --> 46:17.800
Yeah.

46:17.800 --> 46:22.800
When I was 13, I would have loved to have heard that your mom wanted to fuck me.

46:22.800 --> 46:26.800
No, you wouldn't.

46:26.800 --> 46:28.800
I'm sure I mentioned this before in Harmontown.

46:28.800 --> 46:29.800
Maybe not.

46:29.800 --> 46:30.800
I had a dream one time.

46:30.800 --> 46:33.800
I think I told you about this, Dan, where I was going down on a girl in my dream.

46:33.800 --> 46:37.800
And then at some point she had a dick, but it was my dick.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.800
So now I'm sucking my.

46:39.800 --> 46:40.800
Of course.

46:40.800 --> 46:41.800
I'm sucking my own dick.

46:41.800 --> 46:47.800
And the whole time I'm thinking like, I want to do a good job, but I don't want to come in my own mouth.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.800
I mean, you've never had.

46:50.800 --> 46:54.800
Have you had, have you had dreams where you'd suck your own cock?

46:54.800 --> 46:55.800
I always do.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.800
It's like, it's like flying dreams in that.

46:58.800 --> 46:59.800
No.

46:59.800 --> 47:00.800
What do you mean in your dream?

47:00.800 --> 47:01.800
You bend in half.

47:01.800 --> 47:02.800
Yeah.

47:02.800 --> 47:03.800
I'm like just sucking in.

47:03.800 --> 47:04.800
It's great.

47:04.800 --> 47:05.800
Really?

47:05.800 --> 47:06.800
And you contorted?

47:06.800 --> 47:07.800
Yeah.

47:07.800 --> 47:10.800
And then I come in my own face and I call myself a cunt.

47:10.800 --> 47:11.800
I can't tell if you're doing a bit.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.800
I don't know if you're doing a bit.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.800
Let's bring the kids back out.

47:15.800 --> 47:21.800
I mean, let's bring out spooky one direction.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.800
I mean, this is what you'll get at skull juice kids.

47:24.800 --> 47:31.800
No, I've never, I've never, I mean, I couldn't even dream of doing a sit-up when that's like 11,000 sit-ups.

47:31.800 --> 47:32.800
Yeah, but it's a dream.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.800
I couldn't dream of flying either.

47:34.800 --> 47:35.800
Well, I could fly.

47:35.800 --> 47:36.800
You could fly now?

47:36.800 --> 47:37.800
Flying dreams lately.

47:37.800 --> 47:38.800
Oh, right.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.800
Well, I know it's even more of a feat.

47:40.800 --> 47:47.800
I keep having these dreams where I'll just be running down the sidewalk and then I'll just like, I'll realize, wait, I can fly.

47:47.800 --> 47:49.800
And then I'll just like start flying.

47:49.800 --> 47:54.800
I say that it's a very, very positive like emotional or psychological state to be in.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.800
Flying dream is like the most...

47:57.800 --> 47:59.800
You can control that with lucid dreaming.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
You're liberated.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.800
There's no spiritual gravity.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.800
That's a very healthy space to be in.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.800
You always wake up happy.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.800
Yeah, no, I've been going to sleep pretty happy.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.800
But also like sucking your own cock, you wake up happy too.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.800
I'm sure it's great.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.800
Oh, man.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.800
That's all I got to say.

48:17.800 --> 48:20.800
Somebody raised their hand and now I'm terrified.

48:27.800 --> 48:31.800
I am a double major in literature and film because of Dino.

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
Because of me?

48:32.800 --> 48:33.800
Yes.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.800
I don't even know what literature is.

48:35.800 --> 48:37.800
Never read in my life.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.800
That's why he has to be a double.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.800
It was literally...Moral Oral was the reason that I got my double major.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.800
You know, I wrote Moral Oral but I never read it after I wrote it.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.800
That is super fine.

48:51.800 --> 48:58.800
No, literally I used Moral Oral to fight.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.800
I went to a business school.

49:00.800 --> 49:05.800
So you couldn't do a double major in anything that wasn't both business and something else.

49:05.800 --> 49:09.800
And so I wanted to do a media and literature major.

49:09.800 --> 49:13.800
And Moral Oral was the reason that I was the first person who was able to do that.

49:13.800 --> 49:14.800
Wow. Well, thanks.

49:14.800 --> 49:15.800
Yeah.

49:15.800 --> 49:16.800
Thank you.

49:16.800 --> 49:17.800
Very nice.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.800
Give me that microphone back.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.800
No, that's very nice.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.800
Do you have more to say?

49:22.800 --> 49:23.800
Oh, boy.

49:23.800 --> 49:24.800
Don't bore him.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.800
You're a Moral Oral fan.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.800
You got a lot of pressure now.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.800
No, no, I'm just saying like...

49:32.800 --> 49:33.800
Oh, yeah, we get it.

49:33.800 --> 49:34.800
You love me.

49:34.800 --> 49:35.800
Thank you.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.800
What's your name?

49:37.800 --> 49:38.800
Alex.

49:38.800 --> 49:39.800
Yeah, Alex.

49:39.800 --> 49:40.800
That's very nice.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.800
That's my starburns name, you know.

49:42.800 --> 49:43.800
I have a double major.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.800
You have a double major?

49:44.800 --> 49:45.800
Thank you.

49:45.800 --> 49:46.800
Thank you.

49:46.800 --> 49:49.800
But we weren't talking about sucking your own dick.

49:49.800 --> 49:50.800
He raised his hand.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.800
How else do you think about a double major?

49:52.800 --> 49:57.800
We were talking about it with one of your heroes, but unless it's me, it doesn't make

49:57.800 --> 49:58.800
sense.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.800
Alex, have you ever...

49:59.800 --> 50:00.800
Eric, give it back.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.800
Give it back.

50:01.800 --> 50:02.800
Give it back.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.800
Have you ever dreamed about sucking your own dick?

50:05.800 --> 50:08.800
Have you ever dreamed about sucking my dick?

50:08.800 --> 50:09.800
Yes, you have.

50:09.800 --> 50:10.800
Yes, and yes.

50:10.800 --> 50:11.800
All right.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.800
Okay.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.800
See, for me, the real double whammy is having a flying dream about sucking my own dick.

50:15.800 --> 50:16.800
Oh, my God.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.800
That would be amazing.

50:17.800 --> 50:18.800
That would be too much.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.800
That seems very non-aerodynamic.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.800
That's the dream you have right before you die.

50:22.800 --> 50:23.800
Exactly.

50:23.800 --> 50:27.800
You're flying along with a superman, and you're like, oh, I'm turned on, and you double

50:27.800 --> 50:30.800
over to suck your dick, and you become just a rock and fall.

50:30.800 --> 50:33.800
You become Sonic the Hedgehog, don't you?

50:33.800 --> 50:40.800
So are you now periscoping because you always make fun of me and you say you're Facebook

50:40.800 --> 50:41.800
Live-ing?

50:41.800 --> 50:43.800
Yeah, I switched over to Facebook Live.

50:43.800 --> 50:44.800
Yeah, why don't you yell at them?

50:44.800 --> 50:47.800
Do you know this person, or did you just enlist this person to hold your periscope?

50:47.800 --> 50:50.800
He's just a super nice guy, right, sir?

50:50.800 --> 50:51.800
Super nice guy.

50:51.800 --> 50:52.800
Super nice guy.

50:52.800 --> 50:53.800
Periscope yourself.

50:53.800 --> 50:54.800
Guys.

50:54.800 --> 50:55.800
Ugh.

50:55.800 --> 50:56.800
Facebook Live.

50:56.800 --> 50:57.800
Facebook Live.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.800
Wait, so you just put it back on us.

50:59.800 --> 51:00.800
Thank you.

51:00.800 --> 51:05.800
Do you think, I mean, would it feel, would it, we always make that joke, like, oh, if

51:05.800 --> 51:06.800
we could, if a guy could get-

51:06.800 --> 51:08.800
It would be the best bowl job in the world.

51:08.800 --> 51:09.800
And would it-

51:09.800 --> 51:10.800
Do you know exactly, it's like masturbating.

51:10.800 --> 51:11.800
You know exactly-

51:11.800 --> 51:12.800
And would we be like, I'm like-

51:12.800 --> 51:17.800
Someone once described giving someone else a hand job as brushing someone else's teeth.

51:17.800 --> 51:18.800
What?

51:18.800 --> 51:23.800
You're just holding the fucking phone.

51:23.800 --> 51:26.800
Don't want me, you cunt.

51:26.800 --> 51:31.800
Yeah, but you, you bring up the exact, I mean, this is in support of my, my counterpoint,

51:31.800 --> 51:36.800
which is that we can touch ourselves with our hands, and, and that's precisely why it's

51:36.800 --> 51:39.800
actually a lot more interesting when someone else touches us.

51:39.800 --> 51:42.800
It's interesting, but not as good.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.800
Well, they, they don't know how to do it before work.

51:46.800 --> 51:47.800
You know, like-

51:47.800 --> 51:49.800
You're like, oh, phony, phony.

51:49.800 --> 51:53.800
But, but that's kind of what makes them so good at it.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.800
I don't know, on a Saturday afternoon, like it's just like, hey-

51:56.800 --> 51:59.800
I guess maybe you're into like, oh wow, yeah, this is bad.

51:59.800 --> 52:00.800
It's like not me.

52:00.800 --> 52:05.800
But bad is clumsy and clumsy is feeling around and figuring it out and figuring it out is

52:05.800 --> 52:10.800
fun and like, like, like, like utility is just like, like, okay, yeah, I know how to sneeze.

52:10.800 --> 52:11.800
I don't have that kind of time.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.800
I'm on the go.

52:12.800 --> 52:13.800
I know, but it's-

52:13.800 --> 52:15.800
But well, so I'm just wondering, I mean, like, I don't-

52:15.800 --> 52:16.800
You're on the go.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.800
When I have a lot of drinking to do.

52:18.800 --> 52:23.800
When another person is touching me sexually, I'm not sitting there thinking, this is great,

52:23.800 --> 52:25.800
but I wish they, I wish they'd get out of here.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.800
That's the difference between me and you.

52:27.800 --> 52:29.800
So I could, so I could just like take over.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.800
Unless things are going so horribly bad, either emotionally or physically, that it's like,

52:33.800 --> 52:38.800
that's when you know, if you're like, oh my God, I'd rather, rather be alone right now.

52:38.800 --> 52:44.800
But, but, but usually, even, even a person you're not terribly fond of, or, or isn't

52:44.800 --> 52:50.800
even that great at it, like it's still better than, than another night of Minecraft breaks.

52:50.800 --> 52:57.800
Louis once told me he woke up from, he woke up from like a sleep and his hand was asleep

52:57.800 --> 53:00.800
and he hadn't been with a girl for a long time, so he just put it on his dick.

53:00.800 --> 53:01.800
Right.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.800
To make it feel like someone different.

53:02.800 --> 53:03.800
Yeah.

53:03.800 --> 53:04.800
Yeah.

53:04.800 --> 53:08.800
It's like the, the dirty Sanchez, the stranger, the, the, make your hand go to sleep.

53:08.800 --> 53:09.800
Yeah.

53:09.800 --> 53:10.800
I was sitting with, what's his name?

53:10.800 --> 53:11.800
His dad.

53:11.800 --> 53:16.800
C.C. DeVille from Poison. I was at the Viper Room in C.C. DeVille from Poison.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.800
I don't know how this came up, but he's like, yeah, Jeff, you ever tried the stranger?

53:19.800 --> 53:20.800
Oh God.

53:20.800 --> 53:21.800
I mean, this is what I'm saying.

53:21.800 --> 53:22.800
Like, what are we doing?

53:22.800 --> 53:23.800
What is this?

53:23.800 --> 53:24.800
Is this a normal thing?

53:24.800 --> 53:25.800
Yeah.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.800
No, on sixth grade playgrounds.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.800
Yes, it's a normal thing on sixth grade playgrounds.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.800
The stranger.

53:29.800 --> 53:30.800
It's like, that's what I said.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.800
The dirty Sanchez, it's like, this is just, what is this?

53:32.800 --> 53:33.800
All right, I didn't know.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
We're just talking about.

53:34.800 --> 53:35.800
I didn't know.

53:35.800 --> 53:36.800
I don't yell at me.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.800
I didn't know.

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
I'm not yelling.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.800
No, it's not, it's not a thing that people actually do.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.800
Here's some rules again.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.800
C.C. DeVille says he did it.

53:45.800 --> 53:46.800
He's lying.

53:46.800 --> 53:47.800
He's making a bad joke.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.800
He said he got me through more than one lonely night, Jeff.

53:49.800 --> 53:53.800
He was trying to make you laugh because he was insecure that he was hanging out with a comic.

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
Oh, all right.

53:54.800 --> 53:55.800
He was trying to be funny.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.800
Are you saying that C.C. is a liar?

53:57.800 --> 53:58.800
Yeah.

53:58.800 --> 53:59.800
I'm going to bring him on the show.

53:59.800 --> 54:01.800
We're going to get to the bottom of this.

54:01.800 --> 54:02.800
Great.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.800
Well, can he not bring three friends and gas masks?

54:05.800 --> 54:09.800
Oh, we got to the bottom of it.

54:09.800 --> 54:16.800
And can there just be less fucking shit to fucking take care of?

54:16.800 --> 54:19.800
This is one of the worst comic talks ever, right?

54:19.800 --> 54:22.800
I think Mercury is in retrograde.

54:22.800 --> 54:23.800
Mercury is in retrograde.

54:23.800 --> 54:26.800
But you seem a little more edgy than I've seen you.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.800
I've been in a bad mood most of the night.

54:28.800 --> 54:29.800
I've had a really good week.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.800
I've been having a really good couple of weeks.

54:31.800 --> 54:33.800
Was it the text about Andy getting here?

54:33.800 --> 54:34.800
Or did that put you in a bad mood?

54:34.800 --> 54:35.800
No, everything.

54:35.800 --> 54:36.800
What was that text?

54:36.800 --> 54:38.800
Ever since I woke up in a bad mood.

54:38.800 --> 54:39.800
What was that text?

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
We'll talk about it.

54:41.800 --> 54:45.800
I woke up in a bad mood.

54:45.800 --> 54:46.800
We can read those.

54:46.800 --> 54:47.800
Do you want to read that conversation?

54:47.800 --> 54:48.800
That might be kind of funny.

54:48.800 --> 54:51.800
Well, let's go in order, Dan.

54:51.800 --> 54:52.800
Why did you wake up in a bad mood?

54:52.800 --> 54:53.800
I don't know.

54:53.800 --> 54:56.800
Well, I think it's just because it's been an extraordinarily fun weekend.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.800
We had a great, like, Star Wars Halloween party.

54:59.800 --> 55:00.800
We hung out.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.800
Like, it's just been good in general.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.800
I've just been very happy dreaming of flying

55:04.800 --> 55:07.800
and having a great time hanging out with Cody and stuff.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.800
And weekends especially are like guilt-free, hangout time.

55:10.800 --> 55:12.800
And now tomorrow's Monday.

55:12.800 --> 55:13.800
And I just woke up in a bad mood.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.800
So I was like, oh, tomorrow's Monday.

55:15.800 --> 55:16.800
I'm going to do the show tonight.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.800
And then I'm going to get out of that.

55:18.800 --> 55:19.800
And I'm going to be tired.

55:19.800 --> 55:20.800
And I'm still going to have work to do.

55:20.800 --> 55:21.800
And I'm going to get up in the morning.

55:21.800 --> 55:22.800
And it's just like...

55:22.800 --> 55:23.800
I hate that you live for the weekend.

55:23.800 --> 55:25.800
You used to not be like that.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.800
Do you look forward to doing a lot?

55:28.800 --> 55:31.800
Do you look forward to doing this show?

55:31.800 --> 55:32.800
It's fine.

55:32.800 --> 55:36.800
But I enjoy doing the show.

55:36.800 --> 55:37.800
But when...

55:37.800 --> 55:40.800
And I don't want to have deadlines anymore.

55:40.800 --> 55:41.800
And then what do you do on Monday?

55:41.800 --> 55:44.800
I don't really know what's up in your life these days.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.800
Well, I don't even...

55:45.800 --> 55:47.800
That's part of the reason I'm in a bad mood

55:47.800 --> 55:51.800
is because it's shit that I can't even vent about.

55:51.800 --> 55:53.800
Are you doing a new show right now?

55:53.800 --> 55:55.800
It's shit I can't even go into detail about.

55:55.800 --> 55:56.800
You can't even talk about it.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.800
Because it's either violating an NDA

55:58.800 --> 56:00.800
or it's pissing somebody off or all this shit.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.800
And I just want out of that situation

56:02.800 --> 56:04.800
where I can just be myself and be like...

56:04.800 --> 56:05.800
I can just go,

56:05.800 --> 56:08.800
Good day, bad day, bad day, here's why.

56:08.800 --> 56:09.800
Good day, here's why.

56:09.800 --> 56:10.800
But I can't...

56:10.800 --> 56:12.800
I'm not bitching about it.

56:12.800 --> 56:13.800
I'm certainly not.

56:13.800 --> 56:17.800
Did you enjoy the Star Burns Halloween Party?

56:17.800 --> 56:18.800
Yes.

56:18.800 --> 56:19.800
Where Dana's band performed?

56:19.800 --> 56:20.800
Yes, I loved it.

56:20.800 --> 56:21.800
Very much.

56:21.800 --> 56:23.800
That's part of why I'm so cranky this morning.

56:23.800 --> 56:24.800
Because it was a fun weekend.

56:24.800 --> 56:26.800
I was living my life the way I wish it always was.

56:26.800 --> 56:30.800
You were literally dressed as Ferris Bueller who had a day off.

56:30.800 --> 56:31.800
Yes.

56:31.800 --> 56:32.800
Yes.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.800
All right.

56:34.800 --> 56:37.800
So, and then today, this shit starts.

56:37.800 --> 56:38.800
All right.

56:38.800 --> 56:39.800
Well, so...

56:39.800 --> 56:40.800
Okay, here's...

56:40.800 --> 56:41.800
I started it.

56:41.800 --> 56:42.800
Wait, which thread is it?

56:42.800 --> 56:43.800
Is it...

56:43.800 --> 56:45.800
It says...

56:45.800 --> 56:48.800
Dustin, Steve, Dan and Dina.

56:48.800 --> 56:49.800
Dustin, Steve and Dina.

56:49.800 --> 56:50.800
Steve and Dina.

56:50.800 --> 56:51.800
Okay, good, good.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.800
Should Spencer read Spencer part?

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
So you guys want to just take it?

56:54.800 --> 56:56.800
Why am I not in this group text?

56:56.800 --> 56:59.800
Because we're trying to fool you.

56:59.800 --> 57:02.800
If Andy texts you guys about when the show starts tomorrow,

57:02.800 --> 57:04.800
tell him seven.

57:04.800 --> 57:05.800
Okay.

57:05.800 --> 57:06.800
Fair.

57:06.800 --> 57:07.800
That's okay.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.800
I'm okay with that.

57:09.800 --> 57:10.800
So far, so good.

57:10.800 --> 57:11.800
That's me.

57:11.800 --> 57:12.800
I like...

57:12.800 --> 57:15.800
Because you want me to do that, right?

57:15.800 --> 57:16.800
Yes.

57:16.800 --> 57:17.800
So then Steve Levy texts.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.800
I'm slightly retarded.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
This is yesterday at 8 p.m.

57:21.800 --> 57:25.800
So Dina texts that, Steve Levy texts, ha, ha, okay.

57:25.800 --> 57:26.800
And then Dan...

57:26.800 --> 57:27.800
And I text...

57:27.800 --> 57:29.800
Because I'm learning to use stickers.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.800
Feel the burn.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
And...

57:31.800 --> 57:34.800
Like it's just a feel the burn sticker.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.800
Because it's the first one I learned to use.

57:36.800 --> 57:40.800
And then someone put a Mario hat sticker over that.

57:40.800 --> 57:41.800
And then I put a pumpkin over that.

57:41.800 --> 57:46.800
And then someone put a Mario mustache and a nose over that.

57:46.800 --> 57:48.800
Anyway, there's a lot of stickers after that.

57:48.800 --> 57:49.800
Yeah.

57:49.800 --> 57:53.800
And then today I wrote with an exclamation mark.

57:53.800 --> 57:55.800
Remember seven.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.800
Because this is after I texted Andy and I said...

57:57.800 --> 57:58.800
But in the meantime...

57:58.800 --> 57:59.800
Be there at seven.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.800
I texted at Ken Bone.

58:01.800 --> 58:05.800
Remember seven exclamation points.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.800
And Steve Levy said, got it.

58:07.800 --> 58:11.800
And then today at 3.21 p.m. Dino said...

58:11.800 --> 58:16.800
Can I sing a song tonight so I can plug our band's show on November 4th?

58:16.800 --> 58:18.800
I didn't write November 4th, but I'm adding that.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.800
Is your band here?

58:19.800 --> 58:20.800
Is your band here?

58:20.800 --> 58:21.800
I.O.'s here.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.800
Oh, then yes, I hope you do.

58:23.800 --> 58:24.800
And I texted, do.

58:24.800 --> 58:25.800
Yep.

58:25.800 --> 58:28.800
Because I texted yep, but it auto corrected it to do for some reason.

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
Brown booze.

58:29.800 --> 58:30.800
Do, yep.

58:30.800 --> 58:34.800
And then Steve Levy, I think, put a sticker over that of a horse with a mohawk playing guitar.

58:34.800 --> 58:35.800
That's animated.

58:35.800 --> 58:36.800
See, I don't have that.

58:36.800 --> 58:37.800
I don't have the right I.O.S.

58:37.800 --> 58:40.800
And I said thanks and who's drinking at the drawing room now?

58:40.800 --> 58:44.800
And I texted a Henry Winkler as the Fonz giving a thumbs up.

58:44.800 --> 58:51.800
Because I, because I had texted do and then yep, and then I typed yep into the sticker

58:51.800 --> 58:56.800
thing and came up with stickers when you get, when you're saying yep.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.800
And so it's a Fonz going like that.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.800
So far, so far, things are pretty friendly.

59:01.800 --> 59:02.800
Everything, everyone's getting along.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.800
Pretty friendly so far.

59:04.800 --> 59:05.800
This is act one.

59:05.800 --> 59:06.800
Yeah.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.800
There's a lot of stuff about my guitar and which one I should bring that we don't have

59:09.800 --> 59:10.800
to get into.

59:10.800 --> 59:11.800
Why not?

59:11.800 --> 59:14.800
It's going to be a very strange turn.

59:14.800 --> 59:17.800
Well, I don't know about strange, but it's about you.

59:17.800 --> 59:18.800
It's about you.

59:18.800 --> 59:19.800
Is it mean?

59:19.800 --> 59:20.800
It's about you.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.800
Is it going to be mean?

59:21.800 --> 59:22.800
Should I leave now?

59:22.800 --> 59:23.800
No.

59:23.800 --> 59:24.800
Don't.

59:24.800 --> 59:25.800
Don't leave now.

59:25.800 --> 59:29.800
But don't, but, but if you, but if you stay, don't, don't interrupt.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.800
There's this.

59:31.800 --> 59:33.800
So then, so then Dino says.

59:33.800 --> 59:38.800
I say, Dustin or Steve, is it better to bring an acoustic or can I plug in an electric?

59:38.800 --> 59:40.800
And then, and then, and then you.

59:40.800 --> 59:43.800
I put a period and then I panicked and.

59:43.800 --> 59:47.800
Added a question mark, which, which makes it look like you're looking at your watch waiting

59:47.800 --> 59:48.800
for an answer.

59:48.800 --> 59:51.800
But I just didn't want you to think I was dumb.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.800
Steve, Steve Levy texted acoustic is better.

59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.300
And then you said, okay, Steve Levy said, if I had to guess, and then Dustin, who's in

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.800
the conversation the whole time says.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800
Acoustic.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800
Acoustic.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800
What is this sticker witchery?

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800
Why have I fallen off as a millennial?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.800
And then I texted a grumpy old man in a ball pit.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.800
That's hilarious.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800
In a ball pit.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800
Yeah.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800
It's a grumpy, it's a grumpy old person in a.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.800
It looks like a lady.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.800
Because that's a Dustin.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:26.800
I typed in like, get with it old man into like a sticker thing.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.800
And then, and then, and then I said, that's you.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.800
And I wrote ha ha ha.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.800
Exclamation mark.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800
Cause I don't do LOL.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800
And then Dustin wrote, this is insane.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.800
And then, okay.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800
So now I think we should skip over a lot of this.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800
It becomes a lot of stickers.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.800
Cause people are now learning.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.800
Oh, Frankenstein's there.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800
Yeah.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.800
Gina says, look like I need to renew my telephone.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.800
And there's like a cheese pizza dancing around it with a wizard cap.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.800
And then I put Steve Levy's head.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.800
And then Steve Levy says, Dino, Andy just asked me what time the show is.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.800
Do I really say seven?

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.800
I don't like lying.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Okay.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800
So act two.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.800
Right.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.800
So Dustin says, yes, three exclamation points.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.800
He will probably still be 30 late.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800
So Steve says, okay.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:18.800
And I say, because I love my Levy, I say, but why not tell the truth and let him either

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.800
become a better person or go fuck himself?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.800
And then, and then I, and then I, and then I realized I'm using the wrong language.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.800
And I say, or forget even better person.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.800
It's like he's late.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800
He misses the show.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800
Who cares?

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800
You know?

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800
Yeah.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800
And Dustin.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800
Andy, I think fair.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.800
So all fair.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.800
It's a bad habit.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800
Not a bad person.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.800
Steve Levy says, I'll split the difference and tell him we get to the green room at 730.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.800
I said, that seems truthy enough.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.800
Dino says he wants.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.800
Oh, sorry.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800
Go ahead.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800
He wants to be lied to.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.800
He told me, which is true.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.800
Right.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.800
And Dustin says, Dino is his wrangler.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.800
And I said, fine, leave us out of it.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800
Yeah.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.800
And I, and I pictured it with that tone of voice too.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800
Yeah.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.800
And then, and then Dustin says, I'll text him.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.800
And I said, my Levy, no like he lie.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.800
That's my only stake in this.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.800
I love my son.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.800
Steve Levy says, I already told him we all meet in the green room at 730.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.800
Dustin says, and everyone on this thread is a bad person besides Levy.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:28.800
And I wrote, I told him seven, but I knew he'd ask you too.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.800
And then Dustin sends a gif of the Lion King cub.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.800
Starting out happy, but getting sad.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800
But then looking confused and sad, I think.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.800
And then, and then, and then a, and then a, is that a middle finger to Levy or just a number one?

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800
I don't know.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800
I'm too old.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.800
So then Dino says, it's not a lie if he likes it.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.800
Just like it's not abuse if I like it.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.800
Jesus, you pussies.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.800
So then, and then Steve sends the emoticon, the emoji that's a guy like.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.800
Yeah, the scaredy closed teeth guy.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.800
Yeah, that's what I use when people tell me stuff where I'm supposed to give a smiley,

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.800
but I use it to simulate like my kind of like autistic tendencies.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.800
I just like, do you want me to like tell you what I'm fishing, what you're fishing for?

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.800
So by the way, I'm writing all this while I'm driving.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.800
So I'm not really reading everything correctly.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.800
So I say, so now Levy lies and he'll, and he'll be late.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.800
And Steve Levy says, I didn't lie.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.800
And I say, I just go by high maintenance and low maintenance.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.800
So one, I don't expect you guys to ever let us complicate such a simple matter for you ever again.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.800
And two, Andy can't be on the show anymore.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.800
Even the guy in the wheelchair just says, I'm in a wheelchair and has a guy that helps him.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.800
We don't have to pretend he has legs and shit.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.800
I haven't even done anything yet.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.800
Well, you did a whole life's work of things.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.800
So then I say, fine, more songs for me.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800
Exactly, I say.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.800
And then Dustin says, understood and agreed.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.800
And you also, the only podcaster has never been later canceled the show.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800
He says a bunch of stuff that's nice about me.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.800
And then I say, I've never been later canceled.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.800
And he says also true redacted. And then he says, thank you and whatever.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800
And all this.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.800
And remember, the only thing I did is what time.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.800
And then they said, we all meet at 7 30 in the green room.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.800
And you've been late for the last 30 years.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.800
What time did you get here tonight?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800
7 30.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.800
And I was late for the first day.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800
No one else is here.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.800
And here.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.800
7 30 in the green.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800
We're not done.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.800
Oh, there's more.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.800
You know, tries the last word and says, I will say this.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800
I will say this.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.800
A guy in a wheelchair appreciates a ramp.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.800
And Andy appreciates being tricked into being on time.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800
Yes.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800
You had my back the whole time.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.800
Thank you.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.800
Maybe I should have said that from the beginning.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.800
And I said, you were saying the whole time you didn't fail to make it clear.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.800
Nor has Andy ever failed to make it clear that Andy needs everyone around him to become either dishonest or insane.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.800
It's just not as easy for some of us to cross that threshold.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:20.800
That's Levy's ramp and building it profits me more.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.800
And then you say, I forget that we don't need all that stuff right now.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.800
I think the only person I like in the story is Andy Dick.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.800
He's the only victim.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.800
It was an argument about accessibility.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800
Thank you.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800
Thanks for having my back the whole time.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800
Did I?

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800
Yes.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800
Oh, okay.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800
I can't remember.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800
That was years ago.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800
He was here at 7.30 a lot.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.800
But I was here afterward.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.800
I just got off a plane and I drove straight to the drawing room because you guys said that you were both there.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.800
Or that you guys were talking about being there.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800
I get there.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Dino showed me these texts and I said, it sounds like Dan might be in a kind of a grumpy mood today.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.800
Like I didn't sound like the good mood Dan that you've been in like for the last little while.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800
Yeah.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.800
So I was right about that.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.800
Yep.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.800
But that was just because you have the Sunday night blues because it's a school night.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800
Yeah.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.800
So everything I'm filtering through like fuck everybody.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.800
And it sounds like you really were just mad at me.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800
No, I'm not just mad at you.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800
Well, you were.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800
And I apologize.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800
I even apologize.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.800
I was yelling at Dino for like telling us how to treat you.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800
I know.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.800
That is weird.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.800
I wasn't.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800
I was like, don't fucking.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800
I mean, I appreciate it.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
Don't get me wrong.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
But it is weird.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.800
And I'd be lying if I said 90% of the shit doesn't start on.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800
We're like an old married couple.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800
We're like really.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800
You're so protective and sweet.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.800
I don't think we're a married couple.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.800
I don't think you're like my child and grandmother at the same time.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.800
And most of the shit starts on Twitter with strangers because I'm like in the middle of

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.800
something with fucking strangers because I'll like.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.800
Now we're getting to the bottom of it.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.800
I'll tweet a link to an article and I'll be like, this guy did a good job writing this

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.800
and being thought and making people happy with trying to give us a different angle on

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800
it.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.800
And there's always one person that's just like some guy like like tweeted and responded

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.800
with like, oh yeah, it's a really interesting except he forgot to mention they're all racist.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.800
And I was like, so read it again.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.800
You never fucking read it.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.800
And then he's like, I did read it again.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.800
After reading again, I think a big boo boo boo.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.800
And I was just like fucking with that.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.800
I was arguing with that guy all day like in my head.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.800
I was just like, you're a fucking piece of shit.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.800
Like how can you use the word racist the way racist use the word race?

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.800
Like you're fucking like being like what was it?

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.800
It was an article about how the reason why the country is like going into the shitter is

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:34.800
because we long ago like we fucking like we just constructed it this way.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.800
There's all these rural people perceive all the people in all the cities as being like

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.800
out of our fucking minds with no idea how reality works and vice versa.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.800
And it was just this article written from a typical midwesterner who became a comedy

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.800
writer who's like, look, I would be one of those people if I hadn't successfully fled

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:58.800
to one of the, you know, hunger games metropolises where I started dressing funny and understanding

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.800
that edamame tastes good. I'm putting words in his mouth. It was from that perspective.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.800
It was very thoughtful and very like funny and very concise.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.800
It was just kind of like breaking down our mythology as a nation and how that is why it comes to this.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.800
That is why when we scratch our heads and go like, oh shit, we got to, you know,

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.800
this is how a bunch of like fucking factory working white people all of a sudden see

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.800
themselves as underdogs and it's not all of a sudden and this is all happens.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.800
And it's just like, yeah, but you forgot they're racist.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.800
I'm like, that's going to solve everything. That's fucking great.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.800
So they were born racist? Is there a fucking vapor in the, like, that's as dumb as

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.800
inciting with the split as anything else. It's never going to solve anything.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.800
I just like hate that shit. You know that guy didn't read the fucking article.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.800
All he's doing is expressing a fucking need to be attention.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.800
It's like, he couldn't, oh, I'm not going to be a sycophant and just say, oh, it's a great article

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.800
and I'm not going to read it. That's for sure. I'm going to scan the headline

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.800
and then I'm going to fucking barf this shit up because I want to be smart today.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.800
I was like, everyone wants to be smart. Fucking grow up, you dick. I got shit to do.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.800
Don't fucking like, everybody else just didn't say anything or didn't read it

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.800
or didn't, you don't have to fucking do shit. You don't have to fucking respond.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.800
You don't have to respond. Stop responding. You don't have to respond.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.800
Blinking cursors cost nothing when you're making a web API.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.800
That's why they provided for you. They don't actually think you have anything of value to say.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.800
And you don't a lot. You don't. Just say you're happy or sad.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:33.800
Use your I statements. I am sad, glad, happy, scared, jealous.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.800
I hope. I fear. No one can argue with their feelings.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.800
They will love you if you feel it and express it.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.800
But then you say shit. Forty-five percent of the police,

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:53.800
if they ever said it, you don't know anything.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:58.800
You're not a scientist. You're not Nova. You're just racist or not racist.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.800
You're just a fucking dickhead. Stop knowing shit and just feel something.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.800
Just say, I'm scared. Everyone will be like, oh my God, he's scared.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:21.800
You make a good point. Remind me never, never.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:29.800
Just remind me never to ask you for any favor ever.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:37.800
Did that trick trip your bad mood or that triggered you to get into the state?

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.800
I got shit that I'm not doing that I need to be doing so I feel like a bad person.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.800
So I wake up hating myself. I wake up going, fuck, I fucked up again.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.800
I got shit to do. You need more blowjob dreams.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:11:03.800
Real quick, I just have this ability to not engage in people that might upset me like that.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.800
Yeah, you're probably like the king of this.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:15.800
I just don't engage. I think, is it possible that as a tactic to put things off

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.800
and not do whatever this secret thing is you're going to be doing tomorrow,

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:27.800
do you engage with that because you know there's no point in that and cookie collecting and everything else.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:37.800
Yes, yes, yes. I play games that are designed to suck my time and that is a thing I used to suck my passion.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.800
You're so overworked that Steve Levy is afraid, like this is a story from the other day,

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.800
he was afraid to come up to you and just sign a few papers and he's like, sorry Dan,

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.800
can you just sign a few things and you were sitting back and playing a video game

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.800
and he's like, do you mind signing a few of these and you said, well I'm not going to lean over.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:06.800
Like he put them right there and they had to move them like three inches closer.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.800
Oh my God.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:22.800
Citizen Kane, you're much like pundits who read rap lyrics aloud on CNN.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.800
You're leaving out my self-awareness.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.800
I'm willing to hear that and we talked about it, but I had to go for the laugh.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.800
I know, but it's like, but then someone goes like, what a gross monster you are.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.800
I'm like, well, yeah, but it was funny.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:43.800
I asked him in the car later, I'm like, that was kind of supposed to be a joke, right?

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.800
And he's like, yeah, it's a joke.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.800
I was very serious about refusing to lean forward.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.800
I have a political stance about it.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.800
No, I was like, what the sincere part of it was that I was letting him know,

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.800
because he was saying, is this a bad time?

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.800
And I was like, well, I'm not going to say it's a bad time because I'm playing a video game,

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.800
but I will be just honest and say, I don't want to fucking like,

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.800
honestly, I'm like being a big fat pig right now.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.800
And I can't say that I'm fighting inner city crime.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.800
So it's not a bad time.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.800
I'm not feeding the hungry.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.800
I just am so fat and so sad and tired.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.800
Here's what's going to happen and here's what's not going to happen.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.800
I wasn't like Scott Rudin throwing an ashtray and going like, stop making me lean forward.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.800
From now on, no leaning.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.800
I'm so glad most of us are sad and tired.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.800
Jeff, you can learn a few things from this.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.800
Mr. Everything's Great.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.800
It is.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.800
You know my secret?

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.800
All that core work of leaning over and sucking my own dick.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.800
Yeah, that's the price I pay.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800
I'm not going to leave for it.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.800
So even in my dreams, I never get to suck my own dick.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.800
It starts with a simple action and then your dreams get bigger.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.800
You're like, Dan, will you suck your own dick?

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.800
Well, I'm not going to lean over.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800
I'm going to have to.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.800
I don't know what else I can do for me.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.800
The dick is going to have to move the mountain to Muhammad.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800
I like a typical midwesterner.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.800
I then take that information and I go,

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.800
and probably if you sucked it too much, it'd stop meaning anything.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.800
That's kind of the Wisconsin why I'm not living in California argument.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.800
Yeah, wow.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.800
Those guys are going to fall in the ocean.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.800
You can't go out to a place where the freeways are four lanes wide,

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800
where everyone speaks Spanish.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800
You're going to die out there.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.800
I'll stay right here and freeze to death.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.800
I'm happy.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.800
I can't feel my fingers because I'm deliriously happy.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:55.800
You got a big shrugger.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.800
You got a big shrugger in the front row.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.800
It just took my attention a little bit.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.800
It's probably a skull juice fan.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800
Dan, what can we do?

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.800
Maybe the answer is nothing because you have to...

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800
To cheer me up.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800
If you've got this burden, I know how that feels.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.800
I get panicked if I have to go pick up my dry cleaning in the morning.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.800
I have a bad night's sleep.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.800
I think we have to just sell the studio.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.800
We just got to go away.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800
No, you don't understand.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.800
All the shit that you're thinking of running the studio stuff,

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.800
it's the shit that's up to actually me.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.800
It's my old life where I'm like,

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800
oh, I'm supposed to be a Jedi.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.800
Here's where I pick up a lightsaber and do the thing I'm supposed to be good at.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.800
My therapist said,

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.800
I told her the story of how I was block-rating.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800
That's one thing.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.800
She was like,

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.800
so in other words, the old Dan,

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.800
that guy doesn't work anymore.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800
You can't just say,

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.800
I'll take that and I'll be back.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.800
I'm going to write it.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.800
That guy was dying season six of Community.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.800
That's why the season wasn't much better than five or three or anything like that.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.800
And yet I was still setting records sleeping on my couch

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800
because it was like,

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.800
why is this show so hard?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.800
That fuel tank was empty of like,

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.800
oh, I'm a torture genius and all this stuff.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.800
And the guy who's delegating to people

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.800
and collaborating with people during normal working hours

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.800
and then spending his time at home in bed being happy watching Netflix,

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.800
that guy is fine and doing well

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.800
and has a bunch of things to do,

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.800
but that guy works it all into his schedule.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.800
But then the fucking dumb asshole that was like,

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.800
I'll write this one.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.800
I'm like, you're never fucking idiot.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.800
Every time I either run into you

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.800
or hear about what's going on with you,

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.800
you have 9,000 projects going on right now.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.800
I give a lot of stuff.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.800
For me, any one of those things would be enough

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800
to make me have bad sleep.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.800
Yeah, so I...

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.800
I mean, I'm a lazy guy because like,

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.800
literally, if I have to...

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.800
all I have to do is get in the plane tomorrow

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.800
and go do improvisation somewhere

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.800
where I don't have to carry any gear

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.800
or do any rehearsal or know anything

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.800
and can be half drunk.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.800
I still have anxiety dreams about missing the plane.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.800
I actually have anxiety when I wake up

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.800
and I'm like, God, I have to be at the drawing room at 12.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.800
Seriously.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.800
Are you serious?

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800
Yeah, like, I'm like, I got to get there by 12.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800
Because they miss you, you think, or what?

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.800
I just need... I love being there.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.800
But why do you feel like you have to be there?

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.800
Because 12 was when they threw out all the people

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800
that got there at 6

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.800
who would do a coke on their own.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.800
Yeah, I mean, it's a good... it's a sweet spot time.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.800
It's really...

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.800
By policy, because now there's so many after hours.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.800
I don't know if it's about them,

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.800
although I do feel like they like me.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.800
They do love you. They love you.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.800
But the old days of the old alcoholics

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:47.800
that used to go in there,

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.800
some of them have dropped dead.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.800
Some of them have left town.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.800
Yeah, I remember going to the funeral

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.800
of the first one that dropped dead.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.800
It was heavy because I was like,

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.800
okay, you know, we talked a lot

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.800
and I had some funny stories.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:02.800
Who are you talking about?

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800
It's this guy you won't even remember.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800
He was at the rustic... not that old.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.800
I felt like about my age back then.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.800
Yeah, and he would always come in

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.800
and drink a glass of wine

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.800
and tell funny stories

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.800
and I remember having a lot of funny stories about him

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.800
and I thought, I'll go there

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.800
and tell his family, you know.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.800
And I go to the funeral

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.800
and everyone's crying

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.800
and his body's there

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.800
and then I hear,

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.800
oh yeah, he just drank too much

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.800
and all my stories are from the rustic inn,

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.800
the bar.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.800
So I felt like I'd have to walk up and say,

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.800
yeah, I was his drinking buddy, you know.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.800
The guy, I helped kill him.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.800
So I just kind of like,

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800
just backed up and walked out of the church

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.800
and went home.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800
I didn't meet anyone.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.800
But you stopped going to the rustic

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.800
and now you go to the drying room.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.800
Yeah, not because of him though, but...

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.800
How many people from the bar's funerals

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.800
have you not even gone to,

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.800
but just known have happened?

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.800
Oh, well yeah, I guess at this point,

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.800
like 10, 12, yeah.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.800
I only went to the first one though.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.800
But I guess if we hung out at a laundromat,

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.800
we'd have 12 laundromat funerals.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800
There's one guy that I've been going to...

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.800
Especially if people drank the laundry detergent.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.800
We can't be blamed for that.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.800
I just turned 43,

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.800
but I think I've been going to the drying room,

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.800
like a rustic, like near when I was on a fake ID.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800
That's how long.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.800
And there was a guy that I thought was going to be dead

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.800
in a year or two back then.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.800
And he's still alive, but this guy has a glass eye.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.800
And one of the bartenders was there one time

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.800
where he sneezed and his glass eye flew out of his head,

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.800
went bouncing across the bar and landed like in the well.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.800
And she found it and he was like looking around for it.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.800
And that was his good eye.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800
She gave it to him in a cocktail napkin.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.800
He put it in his mouth, like cleaned it up with his saliva,

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800
stuck it back in his head.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800
And he's still with us to this day.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.800
He's like, he's gonna...

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800
Really?

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.800
Wow.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.800
97% of him.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.800
Do you know there's a guitar here?

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.800
Do you want to...

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.800
Sure.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.800
Do you want to get sucked by it?

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.800
Do I want to what?

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.800
You said I was going to fuck you earlier.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.800
Oh, right.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.800
That was a joke.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.800
But I mean...

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.800
If she wants to fuck me, she can.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.800
I don't care.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.800
Oh, I didn't know.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.800
It was a little lady.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.800
What's her name, Dina?

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.800
Dustin, you said you were going to help me here.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.800
What happens?

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800
Dustin Marshall, everybody.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.800
Thanks, Dustin.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800
What are the best, Dustin Marshall?

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.800
The only time I've ever seen Dustin not wearing his headphones

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.800
is when he's doing the podcast.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.800
You think this would be a podcast like Headphone Central?

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.800
No?

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.800
No, it needs to be connected with what's really going on.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.800
I don't think they're this long.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800
I got you.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.800
Or maybe Andy could be going.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.800
Spencer, while this is happening...

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.800
Spencer, do you play an instrument, Spencer?

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.800
Have you ever picked up a guitar or a piano or anything?

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.800
Oh, yeah, I play everything.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.800
Now, do you ever have any lessons?

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.800
Did you ever try it?

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.800
Andy wants to hold it.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.800
Yeah, I teach lessons.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800
Did you ever have lessons?

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800
No, I didn't need them.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.800
I was just an instant genius.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.800
Spencer, I don't like your attitude right now.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.800
A lot of people don't.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.800
It's intimidating.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.800
No, she doesn't...

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.800
I'm getting a lot of pushback right now.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.800
However, Spencer, I think we filled that time perfectly.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800
I hope so.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800
We'll find out.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.800
Spencer and I have a new podcast called Nothing Gets Accomplished.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.800
Everybody stays real safe.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.800
I wish I had a stand.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800
You want a stand?

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800
No, it's nice.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800
Andy's being very nice.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.800
Does it stand right next to you?

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.800
No, no, Andy wants to do this.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.800
So, okay, all right.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.800
So, this is a song that...

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.800
My band, so we have a band, we have a show on...

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800
The reason I don't have a stand

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.800
is because I feel like now I could turn my head.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.800
Okay.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.800
I'm on it.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.800
Wait, can't we just...

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.800
What if I hold the mic that Andy's holding?

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.800
Yeah, there's a clue in here.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.800
We got it, we got it.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.800
Whoo!

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.800
It was not working out.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.800
Oh, yeah.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.800
All right, so...

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.800
Don't really laugh at this.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.800
Here goes, bye.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.800
On November 4th...

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.800
I keep saying November 4th,

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.800
but I don't know where it is.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.800
Do you know where it is?

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.800
No.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.800
I'll try and say it after.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.800
Before you start singing,

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800
I was going...

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.800
I have one question for Dan Harmon.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.800
Oh, perfect.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.800
I've been wanting to ask...

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.800
This isn't awkward.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.800
All night.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.800
No, it's not.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.800
I know.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800
It's...

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.800
I just...

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.800
The only one that feels awkward, I think,

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.800
is me, because this is such a great party

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.800
and atmosphere, and he drinks,

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.800
and you're drinking, and you're...

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.800
All right.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.800
Everyone's drinking,

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800
and I see 40 answers.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800
We should talk about that a little bit.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800
Well, there's no...

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.800
I don't really need to talk about it,

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.800
because I think about it all day and night,

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.800
but I have a question, Dan Harmon.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.800
Maybe I've asked you before,

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.800
but if I did, I don't remember the answer.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.800
Will...

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.800
Do you think that I will be able to,

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.800
at some point,

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.800
responsibly drink again?

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.800
We talked about this last podcast.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.800
I don't remember the answer.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.800
No!

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.800
Ow!

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800
I didn't ask you.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.800
I got punished by just...

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800
By God.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800
I think I have my answer.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.800
Got my answer.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.800
That's a reminder that I don't remember the words.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800
I wouldn't...

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.800
I need to fix that.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.800
Do you need the words?

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.800
No, I don't need words.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800
No.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800
Well, let's talk...

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800
Why don't you listen to Dino's song?

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800
No, let's talk about this.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.800
This is more interesting.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.800
And then you can tell me after the song.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800
Alright, well, then I'm going to change it.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.800
I'm going to sing a song about drinking.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.800
I'm going to do it.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.800
Oh, I never should have gone brown.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.800
I think I saw you on the way down.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.800
Turn my smile upside down.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.800
Never should have gone brown.

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.800
Don't clap.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.800
It really fucking throws me off.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.800
I'm glad you said that.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.800
Because I feel so grumpy and I...

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.800
I thought no one's going to want to take orders from me.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800
What do you want me to do?

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.800
No, I wanted to say don't clap.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800
Because they're doing it for the best possible world.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.800
They think, well, no, they're very nice.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.800
They think I'm a musician, though.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.800
But then it's...

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.800
I'm like, I don't know what to do with that.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.800
It spreads through the ironic cancer of everyone going like,

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.800
well, if they're clapping, I should...

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800
I want to do the right thing, too.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.800
And then it's like, oh, isn't everyone's clapping?

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.800
Yeah, and then they throw down their chairs and dance.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.800
I don't want that.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800
That's why the worst thing, like, you go to karaoke

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.800
and sometimes they have a tambourine.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.800
No, just fucking...

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.800
The tambourine is a harder instrument to play

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.800
than you think it is.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.800
It's loud and you have to have time

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800
and you don't fucking have time.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.800
So put the goddamn tambourine down.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.800
All right, is there another microphone stand?

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.800
Oh, this'll be really spontaneous.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.800
Oh, they don't even know.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.800
Don't worry about it.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.800
He just wants you to not worry about it.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800
Thank you.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.800
Thank you, Jeff Davis.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800
Thank you.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:07.800
Oh, I never should have gone brown

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.800
Think I saw you on the way down

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.800
Turn my smile upside down

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.800
What's going on?

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.800
I'm not a musician.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.800
Jeff's doing physical comedy.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.800
I was like the guy in the recording booth.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.800
The guy was like...

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.800
We've got to get more mids in the front.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.800
We've got enough bottom end on this.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.800
Dino, let's take it again. Just try and relax a bit.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.800
Okay, yeah.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.800
All right, we're rolling.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800
Let's go.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800
Is it on?

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.800
One, two...

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.800
Oh, I never should have gone brown.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.800
Let's take it one more time from the top.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.800
I feel you've pushed a little hard on that one, Dino.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.800
I know, I know. I'm trying to get that...

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.800
Can I get the four hertz mega thingy?

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.800
Okay, what number are you on?

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.800
Take three, take three, rolling.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.800
Oh, I never should have gone brown.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.800
It's supposed to be a sad song and I'm laughing.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.800
Oh, I never should have gone...

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.800
Are you sick of that line yet?

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:29.800
Guess what? I never should have gone.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.800
And I know everyone's thinking Dino's a racist.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.800
He's talking about black women.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.800
This is not...

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800
All right, take 11, take 11.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800
Coming up, take out.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.800
I love black women. I would kill for one.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.800
I just gotta quit saying nigger once in a while.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.800
Oh, I never should have gone brown.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.800
Did you see me on the way down?

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:57.800
Turn my smile upside down.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.800
Never should have gone brown.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.800
Never should have drunk from that cup.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.800
Turn my frown right side up.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.800
Do I regret it? Yup.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.800
Never should have drunk from that cup.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.800
When I was young, didn't need booze.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.800
Wasn't accustomed to watch myself lose.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.800
Back then I had the luxury to choose.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:34.800
Oh, brown booze.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.800
Oh, brown booze.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.800
Brown booze, brown booze, brown booze.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.800
Brown booze, brown booze.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.800
Brown, brown, brown booze.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.800
Brown booze, brown booze.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.800
Brown booze, brown booze, brown booze.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800
Brown booze.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.800
Okay, that's enough.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.800
Brown booze.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.800
I deserve to be your clown.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.800
Think I saw you.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.800
I look purple.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.800
I was on the rocks out of town.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.800
Never should have gone brown.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:29.800
Andy Dick on the slide whistle.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.800
That is the best version of that.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.800
I think we've got a fucking hit, mate.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.800
We've got a fucking hit.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.800
God damn it, I love that thing so much.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.800
You really think that's it, right?

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.800
I think it's pretty.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:59.800
I would say that's the funniest slide whistle has been in a hundred years.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.800
That was a very good slide whistle solo.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.800
I agree, I agree.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.800
And also we shouted down a spontaneous...

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:11.800
Yeah, a clapping thing.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.800
That was the best.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.800
Maybe it was perfunctory at the beginning,

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.800
but then when it was right and natural, that's when it came together,

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.800
and it was a slide whistle that was the key to that fucking door.

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.800
I know, if I can't be thrown off by that motherfucking thing,

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.800
I gotta be thrown off by that thing.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.800
We brought it home and we broke all our own rules

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.800
in the fourth quadrant of a perfectly circular story.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800
Dan?

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800
Come on.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800
Don't worry, Andy.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.800
I'll explain it to you later.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800
You still seem grumpy.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.800
That wasn't enough to lift your spirits?

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.800
Well, I'm in the phase now where I regret my grumpiness.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:49.800
I'm like, I'm steeping in shame and kind of running over the evening.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.800
I think this is the best Harmontown ever.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:58.800
Don't clap, it's throwing me off.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.800
We're in that third quadrant where you tell people not to clap,

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.800
you're telling yourself you shouldn't have been what you're doing,

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.800
and then there'll be some sort of release at some point, right?

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.800
You'll become the master of both worlds.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.800
Yeah, I just forgot in that text conversation

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.800
how many people would get thrown out of the bus,

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:18.800
including apparently the differently abled, like...

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.800
You should hear our skull juice.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.800
We make fun of blind people.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.800
It's hilarious.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.800
That's fine.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.800
I don't think there's anything that should be verboten.

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.800
I just like for my own personal tastes of how I'd like to be perceived.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.800
Your taste should be verboten.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.800
My tastes are verboten.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.800
Dino, Dino, so in that song,

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.800
because I know you drink and you drink vodka,

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.800
so with that song,

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:45.800
you feel like maybe you should never have gone brown.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800
Yeah, I drank...

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.800
Well, the first time I went brown, I literally...

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800
Like tequila was.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.800
I have a story about it.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800
I have a story about it.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800
It was Scotch.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.800
The first time I went brown, I was at Little Dom's,

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.800
and I wasn't joking at all during any of this.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.800
I got up to leave and stumbled and fell,

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800
and everyone said,

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:03.800
are you all right to get home?

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.800
And I said, no, no, don't worry, I'm not walking.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:14.800
And you weren't trying to be funny.

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.800
I wasn't, but I was like W.C. Fields.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.800
I wish I was writing for that guy.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:25.800
So you and Dan and Dino are both like straight up vodka drinkers.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:28.800
But sometimes, Dino, you will drink brown liquor still.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.800
When I feel sick, I feel like that's medication for me.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.800
I used to drink brown liquor.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.800
I was a Glenn Levitt man,

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.800
but I started drinking vodka after I became friends with you.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.800
That's right.

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:43.800
Just a trivia fact.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.800
I mean, it's not really...

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.800
It's not like a weird thing.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.800
It's pretty...

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.800
It shouldn't be trivia.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:48.800
It should be.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.800
You should put it on a fucking billboard.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:52.800
And...

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.800
You have a like...

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.800
Kettle One calls you up on your birthday.

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.800
Yeah.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.800
And they don't send me...

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.800
They really do.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.800
Oh, man, they love them.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.800
And they don't even know I'm alive.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.800
Andy, a serious question.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.800
I know you've been sober for a good long time now.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.800
Does this kind of conversation bum you out?

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.800
No, I'm just waiting patiently for the answer.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.800
It's never going to happen.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.800
No, I'm asking Dan.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.800
Oh, do you...

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.800
Look, I mean, I think, like Dino says, we talked about...

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.800
Like, Dino and I, the only responsible answer we can take...

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:20.800
No, I wouldn't try it.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.800
I don't think so.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:22.800
You're so great right now.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.800
I think there's a biology to it.

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.800
No, you don't know how I feel.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.800
I don't feel great.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.800
And I got sick all week,

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.800
and I used to think I would get sick because I'd be a drinker.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.800
I was a drinker.

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.800
Yeah, well, you get sick no matter what.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.800
Yeah, so...

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.800
It's called being a human.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.800
So why can't I, you know, especially after two years, you know,

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.800
try to drink responsibly alone?

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.800
Because you've tried it before and it gets on a hand.

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.800
And because this is a research thing about how it works and stuff,

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.800
and there's just some unfortunate people in my heart

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.800
fucking bleeds for them, and I...

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.800
And we're having the best time doing this podcast.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:58.800
You are.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.800
You're not?

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.800
You don't like it?

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.800
Yes, I do.

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.800
But I have more fun.

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.800
This is the most fun I have.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.800
Ron Funches can't drink because he has an alcohol allergy.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.800
Like, he's barely ever gotten drunk.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.800
Who?

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.800
This guy I know named Ron Funches.

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:14.800
Don't get jealous of him.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.800
I'm going to talk about him for a second.

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.800
Like...

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.800
He can't drink because he has an alcohol allergy.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.800
He found that out in high school taking his first drink.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:28.800
He never got to have fun on booze, but...

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.800
Well, what does that mean? He has an allergy.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.800
He probably just got super fucking drunk.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.800
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.800
It means his throat closed up and he almost died.

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.800
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.800
And all his friends were going,

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.800
you pussy, you pussy, because he didn't know it

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.800
because it wasn't a thing that was understood.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.800
Is he Asian?

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.800
No, he's black.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.800
Okay.

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.800
If he was Asian...

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.800
I feel like Andy...

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.800
There's people in the world that can't drink.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.800
The world isn't fair genetically.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.800
This should be a new drinking game.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.800
Give excuses why someone shouldn't drink.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.800
And then every time Andy says,

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.800
gives another excuse why he should,

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.800
we should all drink.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.800
I don't think Andy is allergic to alcohol.

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.800
I think that you're allergic...

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.800
My throat does not close up.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.800
You're allergic to being ignored is where you are.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.800
Your soul closes up.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.800
Everything closes up.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.800
I've seen it.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.800
You're one of those folks.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.800
You asked me.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.800
That's my honest appraisal.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.800
But you've only caught me at the tail end

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.800
when things are super shitty.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.800
Yes, you're right.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.800
I think he caught you at the tail head also.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.800
No, I don't think so.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.800
My thing was going to be,

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.800
one drink you're not allergic to,

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.800
it's the fourth drink that you're allergic to,

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.800
and then you become Mr. Hyde.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.800
You stop being the Andy that we like,

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.800
and then you start becoming...

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.800
Perfect, so I'll drink three.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.800
I don't want to engage just logically for that reason.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.800
Now we're looking towards a solution.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.800
That's what I want.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.800
This is what I want.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.800
This is more constructive.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.800
I think I could do things like that.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:08.800
I'm so proud of you right now,

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:09.800
because I know that you were doing a bit,

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.800
that you know how funny it is,

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.800
and I know it's coming from an actual pain of how much you wish

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.800
that you could have a drink.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.800
I used to smoke, and sometimes I miss smoking,

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800
and different people do different shit,

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.800
and some of those people can do things,

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.800
and I meet people who can smoke one cigarette at a party

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.800
once a month when they've had three cocktails,

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.800
and then you meet other people who have a hollow leg

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.800
with drinking, and other people who have...

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.800
You meet people who have high cholesterol,

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800
no matter how much oat brand they eat,

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800
and it's just not fucking fair.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.800
But it's not about getting all fucked up or anything.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.800
You know that feeling that you have after one glass of wine,

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.800
or a couple of vodka's, or whatever it is,

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.800
and then there's just more...

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.800
It's a warm drink.

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:43.800
I know, you miss it, but I'm just saying.

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.800
It's the reason why you drink,

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800
the same reason I would drink, and I love it.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.800
But then once that...

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800
But that's why I'm proud of you,

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:50.800
because you miss it that much,

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:51.800
and you're able to have self-awareness,

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.800
and you know you're doing a bit right now called...

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.800
I'm not doing a bit.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.800
I know you're not lying.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.800
I'm just saying you're drawing humor from the fact that you have...

01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800
He's not even smiling.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.800
That you have that craving.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.800
This is deadly, sir.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.800
It's frightening.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.800
I thought I could come to you.

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.800
I thought you would have an answer.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:08.800
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.800
The answer I'm looking for,

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.800
something about where I can drink again.

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.800
But Andy, is this a bad time to plug my band's show?

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.800
Where's it at, by the way?

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.800
It's at the California Institute of Abnormals.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.800
Oh, it is?

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.800
In Culver City?

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800
In Burbank.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800
Oh, that place, oh yeah.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800
Yeah, 11...

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800
How do you say this number?

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.800
11334?

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.800
It's a big number.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.800
I played there once.

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.800
Oh, yeah?

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.800
Oh, shit.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.800
Is it good?

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.800
Pretty cool venue.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:37.800
Yeah, it's from the Olympics.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:41.800
Burbank Boulevard, North Hollywood, California, 91601.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.800
Never should have gone brown.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.800
See, it's catchy.

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:48.800
When's the show?

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.800
His band is...

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.800
What time?

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:51.800
When's the show?

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:52.800
What time?

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.800
November 4th.

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800
And his band is...

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800
No, November 5th.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.800
Sorry, Saturday.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.800
No.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800
Saturday, November 5th.

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.800
We probably go on around, I don't know, like 10, something like that.

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.800
He's got great musicians.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.800
He's got this great female and his guitar players.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.800
She's right here.

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:08.800
I.O. is right here.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:09.800
Yeah, she doesn't want to stand up.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.800
The drummer is great.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:11.800
Everybody's so great.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.800
Every of this, like you've got talented musicians.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.800
I got the best musicians ever.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.800
And I'm the worst.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.800
I can't say...

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:19.800
You are the worst.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.800
Yeah.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.800
But you're so adorable and you write great lyrics.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.800
Yeah, you're so adorable.

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.800
You are.

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.800
It's a great show.

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.800
And can I...

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.800
Yeah, you can come and play Slide Whistle.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:32.800
Okay.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.800
Oh, are you kidding me?

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:34.800
Yes.

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.800
Yeah, you can play Slide Whistle.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800
Thank you.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800
For one song.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800
Yeah, I know.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.800
A real long one.

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:40.800
Okay.

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.800
We'll do our Grateful Dead version.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:43.800
Version.

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.800
Okay, because I hate the Grateful Dead.

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.800
I hate the Grateful Dead, too.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:46.800
Fuck the Dead.

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.800
You know what?

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.800
The thing about you guys that makes you such a dynamic, like, podcasting duo...

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.800
Tell us more.

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:54.800
Oh, wait.

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.800
You didn't tell us once.

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.800
It's the fact that your opposites in many ways, like Dino, your dark-haired...

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.800
Andy, you're quite blond.

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.800
Andy has a huge cock.

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:04.800
Dino...

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.800
Dino's cock is known as the quarter inch of chaos.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.800
Chaos!

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:20.800
I mean, Dino, you drink, and you have a hollow leg, and Andy, you stop drinking.

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:23.800
But also, one of you has a beard, and one of you is very well-shaven.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.800
Which is which?

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.800
I'm just saying, Dan, it's time to shoehorn one of our ads into a garbage dump.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.800
I really fell for it.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.800
Is it opposites underwear?

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.800
It's that razor thing.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:41.800
Dollar Shave Club, they give you razors.

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.800
They deliver them to you a third of the cost.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.800
If you go there right now, Dollar Shave Club slash Harmontown.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.800
The first month is free, and my burden is done.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.800
I don't have to do any reason to deal with the drug store hassle again!

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.800
Deal with the fortress of the razors!

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:57.800
Holy shit, Spencer's here!

01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:58.800
Dollar Shave Club!

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.800
Wait, is that Breffi from the Doris to Forrest?

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.800
I can't help it!

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.800
No, I don't think so.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.800
I can't do any of those voices anymore.

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.800
I'm just so excited I never have to deal with that razor for the kid.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.800
Hi, Spencer.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.800
Hey, guys.

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.800
I'd like to talk about Dollar Shave Club 2.

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.800
Because I'm a little baby razor.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.800
Baby razor, what do you have to say?

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.800
Well, I'm glad you asked.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.800
Yo, baby razor in the house.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.800
I shave more than a mouse, because they don't have a lot of hair,

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.800
or a lot of surface area.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.800
On their bodies.

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.800
I'm gonna shave so much.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.800
I got body dotties.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:52.800
I went to Dollar Shave Club dot com slash Harmontown.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.800
They sent me a box that brought my shaving around.

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.800
I got some cream and some blades, and I ran them down my face,

01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:01.800
and didn't get aids.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.800
That's not a selling point.

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.800
You can see how the alternative would be a...

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.800
Dollar Shave Club promises you won't get aids.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.800
100% aids.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800
At least for the first time.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800
Or your money back.

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.800
I don't even have to check on that.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.800
Yeah, we checked the...

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.800
There's the fact-checking department.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.800
Yeah, they said that's fine.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.800
They can back that up.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.800
You won't get...

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.800
They'll give you your money back if...

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.800
If you get aids from the...

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.800
Yo, let me see if I can do this better.

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:54.800
Because I'm sleepier, so I can take longer to rhyme words.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.800
My name is Sleepy Rapper.

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.800
I am like a flapper.

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.800
I'm from the 20s, and I am free.

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.800
I wanna shave with me.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:11.800
With me?

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.800
That took so long to get there.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:21.800
You had eight full seconds to think of a better rhyme.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.800
What a shave with me.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.800
First I run the blade down the left cheek,

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:29.800
Then I go up my albums, I will take a peek.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.800
I go around the chain, uh-oh,

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.800
I didn't get cut though,

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.800
Cause I went to save club though.

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.800
If this episode isn't called, I wanna shave with me.

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.800
I'm gonna be really mad.

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.800
Dollar saved with me,

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.800
I got a dollar saved club,

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.800
Saving eyes can be.

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.800
First, my face had too much hair,

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.800
And I got a box and I went over there,

01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:57.800
And I took the blade,

01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:59.800
And I put the cream on my face,

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.800
Now I'm running around,

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.800
Now I'm running around,

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.800
Smooth smooth-ass face,

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.800
Smooth face,

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.800
No matter what race,

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.800
If I'm Asian or Caucasian,

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.800
Or if I'm brown and Mexican,

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.800
I got a smooth face,

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.800
No matter what my race,

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.800
No matter what my gender,

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.800
No matter what my race,

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.800
Cause it's a poly, polymorphous word.

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.800
With race, with race, with race, with race.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.800
Well, alright, alright.

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:40.800
Well, give me some acoustic guitar to go with.

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.800
I'm really good at this.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.800
Yo.

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.800
Yo.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.800
Yo.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.800
Dollar saved club is the thing for me,

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.800
I got a box last week and I'm saving as can be.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.800
Got a straight razor or a jillet,

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.800
Probably not.

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.800
I don't use those brands I bet,

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:18.440
But if you put their cream on your cheeks, you can walk around for seven weeks without

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:22.040
any hair growing, but that's not guaranteed.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:28.240
But if you get age, all your money will be retrieved few.

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:37.800
Go to dollarshaveclub.com slash Armand Town, your first month is free.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:43.840
I think it's a pretty bold stance that it's the only online razor company that guarantees

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.960
you won't get age from their products.

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:50.960
I mean, oh, I thought they would guarantee you'd never get AIDS ever.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.800
Well, they're still working on that.

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:55.800
Okay.

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.160
Right now, they're just guaranteeing that their products are AIDS-free.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160
Yeah, that's not that good, but okay.

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.360
Maybe I'll buy them.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.960
I mean, Gillette, those other razor companies, they test on animals, like that's where you

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:10.960
get the AIDS.

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:14.520
I'm not sure, and I think Gillette actually guarantees you get AIDS, right?

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:21.160
Gillette says roll the dice.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.920
That's why their slogan is the best a man can get.

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.400
They're like, look, you're in God's crosshairs when you wake up in the morning.

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.480
You think we're going to make that better for you or a fucking razor company?

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.080
This is it.

01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.040
This is the life you didn't choose.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.080
We make things that cut people and make people bleed, and so fucking, what do you want from

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.080
us?

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:47.840
You should be honored to know us, the only people in the razor business that aren't making

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:48.840
weapons.

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.560
We're not saying Gillette gives you AIDS.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.480
We're saying they don't care if you get it or not.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.160
No, we do care a lot, but we can't prevent you getting it.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.160
Oh, are you Gillette?

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:00.160
Yeah, I'm Gillette.

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160
I'm the Gillette spokesman.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.840
Who are you, Andy?

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:08.240
Do you think Gillette, when they test the razors on animals and do we know that they

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:09.240
do?

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:21.360
That they shave a whole monkey, and then what would a bald, fully bald monkey look like

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.360
me?

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:29.200
I happen to know the answer to this, Andy.

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:33.480
They only have to shave three, eight inch strips off of a monkey.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.760
By their balls or what?

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.760
Which part?

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:37.760
Any part.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.120
Does the shaver get to pick?

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:41.120
The shaver gets to pick?

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.000
I'm looking for a job.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.240
Why not work for Dollar Shave Club?

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.520
Well, they don't have AIDS there.

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.560
What's the fun?

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.200
Is your guys' shave company the one that...

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.200
Are you reaching for America right now?

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.200
Right now?

01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:59.320
Yes.

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:06.160
When I hear at the end, I think I've heard them say, do you know why we are able to provide

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.360
razors so cheaply?

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.640
And then the answer is, because we own the factory.

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.640
Is that right?

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.640
Is that right?

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:14.640
Is that the same company?

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.640
I think that's a different company.

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.040
Yeah, what a weird brag.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.280
I don't know.

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.280
That's their thing.

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.280
Is that the same one?

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.280
We exploit everyone.

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.280
I don't think so.

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.600
I think that's a company that I don't want to say.

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600
So there's competing...

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.600
I guess there are.

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.960
Nowadays competing companies because beards are so...

01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:34.880
I have a question that's not on our copy.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:40.720
It's very male-centric with the executive blade and for guys who get this movie.

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720
Is it for ladies, too?

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.720
Oh, yeah.

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.720
Are there other...

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.920
A woman uses a Dollar Shave...

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:46.920
Oh, yeah.

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.920
You do.

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.760
Have you ever gotten AIDS?

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:58.760
They're satisfied customers.

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:01.160
Oh, no.

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.160
Dollar Shave?

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.160
Absolutely.

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.160
And they're 11th, AIDS-free month.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.160
I will say that.

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.240
I mean, you change like shit, but you don't get AIDS.

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.320
Can I say this in a meta, in a...

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.320
Just be meta for...

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.120
Are we not meta enough right now?

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.040
At the risk of alienating our relationship with a sponsor, just to speak outside the

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:26.840
box as a person who... Their copy is so... It's not very... They don't have a lot of

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:31.540
information out there that's really brings the fucking nitty-gritty.

01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:33.040
They really do just say...

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.040
Do what you want.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.040
We'll say what you want.

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.040
I'm sure there's like...

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.560
Meundies is like, look, here's the deal and it lays everything out.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.640
They've thought about this.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.440
Why should I order underwear from a box and I just want the Dollar Shave people?

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440
No, they're confident.

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:47.440
Or, okay.

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.440
Or lazy.

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440
But they're confident.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440
Then why are they buying underwear?

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440
Who's the guy out there?

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.840
What's your name madam out there who uses Dollar Shave club razors?

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:55.840
I'm Michelle.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.840
Michelle?

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:57.840
And you order these online?

01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.840
I do.

01:48:58.840 --> 01:48:59.840
Because of Harmontown or previously?

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.840
It's been a year or two.

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:01.840
Really?

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:02.840
Where do you shave exactly?

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.840
No, I have a reason.

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:04.840
Can you unzip my pants, Andy?

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:05.840
Oh boy.

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:06.840
No, no, seriously.

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.840
Dina, Dina, don't trump her.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.840
Let's...

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:09.840
All right, hear it.

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:17.840
But you enjoy... are they good?

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.560
I've never used one.

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.040
You think after three weeks or more of doing ads for these people that I would be kind

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.240
of a member of the Dollar Shave club?

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.840
Oh, they haven't sent you anything?

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.840
They haven't sent me shit.

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:31.840
They sent it to Dan.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:35.240
I have a box they sent to me, but what am I going to do here?

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.960
Well, give some to Jeff.

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.880
If I shave, I'm going to look like the worst advertisement for humanity, let alone a shaving

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.880
club.

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:42.880
Well, you come get my box.

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:43.880
I will say this.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.800
Since we started doing these ads, Gillette sent me a bag of AIDS, and I thought...

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.520
Now that's a good Ad for Dollar Shave Club.

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.360
Now we've done our bit.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360
We should just start...

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.960
Yeah, let's just start swiftboating Gillette.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:04.400
Why couldn't that be the last sentence in this fucking podcast?

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:10.160
We'll get back to your drinking momentarily.

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.640
It's all going to be okay.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.640
Don't shame me.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.640
He was giving a creative note.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.640
He was saying that would have been a good ending.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.480
Gillette gave me a bag of AIDS.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:23.840
Good night, everybody.

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.640
We'll meet you at the lawsuit.

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.640
Our next show...

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.520
I'm not saying that Gillette...

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.920
They just said Gillette on the return address, it could have been anybody.

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.120
It could have been Penn Gillette.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:44.200
It could have been people from Dollar Shave Club, in the same way that the Republican

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:49.960
headquarter has got firebombed, probably by Republicans.

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:55.400
I'm not saying Dollar Shave Club goes out and sabotages Gillette by sending you AIDS

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.160
in the mail, but the jury is still out on that.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:05.160
What do you feel about the very well understood and very impressive democratic response of

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:11.000
flooding in money and going, here's democratic money to repair your place?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.400
That also doesn't make it seem like Democrats didn't fire...

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.400
You know what I mean?

01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:16.400
If that's your...

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.680
Doesn't it seem like that's that effort to go...

01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:22.880
I know it's like, yes, because we're the party that believes in charity.

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.680
I don't want to say charity, but look, your place got firebombed.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.840
Here's some money, but that kind of does make it seem, doesn't it?

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:36.040
I'm not saying the people that are sending money bombed at the...

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.040
You're right.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.040
I am drunk.

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.040
I don't understand.

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.240
Doesn't it make it seem like Democrats bombed it when all of the Democrats go, and here's

01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.240
some money?

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.120
It's kind of like, that would be a such a fuck you move.

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.440
There's a set fire to the place, and then go, why don't you get yourself a new fucking

01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.440
place too?

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.440
Yeah.

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.440
Go ahead.

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.440
Go ahead.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:58.880
That's 69 and 10 o'clock, hey, we did it, everyone!

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:01.200
The telethon is over!

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.520
Deena, give us one more song.

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.000
I know, we're closing it out.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.280
Closing it out with some more music.

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.280
All right.

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.120
Also come to New York Comedy Festival.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:14.240
Yeah, and Australia.

01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:15.240
Just come to Australia.

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:17.240
Just come to Australia.

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:18.760
We're doing it.

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.760
We're doing...

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:25.200
Our dates up on any website where you can see where we are traveling because now we're doing these road gigs all the time

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:30.920
No, we we we got to get more we got to get more explicit about the Australian

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:35.280
I don't want to call Australian tour. Are we touring Australia? Or are we just going to the city?

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.800
Doing a couple places under

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:45.640
Yeah, Sydney opera house. We're playing the city in my band to open up for you. Sure. It's Sydney opera house

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:49.640
We're also doing four nights already sold out Hollywood Bowl

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:53.840
No, I made that up fucking words

That's it down cuz I'm in love with the guy. I'm not that gay, but I'm in love with the guy

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:47.640

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:51.520
That's it down

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:59.400
I met him in a restaurant. I thought he was a girl, but I was pleasantly surprised my curiosity was stirred

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.080
I talked to a transvestite and she told me where he worked

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:04.760
Oh

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.760

Don't stand up for all those things you stood before

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.480
Don't stand up for any of that bullshit anymore

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:18.640
Don't stand up. Look, there's a nice chair. I found

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.040
That's it down

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:33.040
Well my adolescent days I return it to my blood and my blood is filling up my veins to change the way I love I

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:36.400
Was 12 years old when I started playing rough

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:45.840
Girls were scarce and we were scared when I covered up our love for them our lust for us was bared

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:52.760
I suppose those feelings stuck. I guess they were always there. I

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:58.880
Made him do bad things. I made him be my slave and I would punish him when he misbehaved

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.680
Then he and I would switch cuz it was all just a game

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.080

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.640
