{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.000\nI'm Andy Dick. I'm your guest comptroller.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:36.000\nWelcome to Harmontown.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:42.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:58.000\nPlease, please, let's welcome our mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:02.000\nThank you. Thank you, Andy Dick, guest comptroller Andy Dick.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nThank you.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:10.000\nBut not, you know, not really because Jeff is here.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:14.000\nBut he was so late that Jeff was like, start without me.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nAnd I was like, well, Andy do it. And Andy was like, I'll do it.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:24.000\nAnd then Jeff was like, I'm a block away. And Andy was like, too late.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:28.000\nSo now Jeff's in the bathroom and we're starting the show.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nAnd thank you very much. I think you'd make a great comptroller.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:37.000\nThank you. Any time. Any time.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:41.000\nYou know what the job entails? Like keeping me on topic.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:44.000\nFor instance, like I tend to go off on tangents.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nAnd then sometimes I need to recall what I was talking about.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:50.000\nOh, Andy, you're doing great.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nGet up here. Are you? Get up here.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nOh, I need a little notepad then.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:01.000\nWho's going to keep me on track?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.000\nWell, maybe just maybe your joy will make you remember what I'm talking about.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nWho says I'm joyous?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:12.000\nSo for instance, do you know about October birthdays, Andy?\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:18.000\nWell, I found out, did I talk about this?\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:25.000\nIf your birthday's in early October, like you have one of the more popular birthdays.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:31.000\nIt's not spread out. Like it's not like one three hundred sixty-fifth of everyone has each birthday.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nLike there's very popular birthdays.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nAnd October 5th is the ultimate. It is the most popular birthday.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:43.000\nAnd the reason why they think that is, is because 274 days earlier is New Year's Eve.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nPretty interesting. Pretty fun.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nSo then you go like, okay, so what is the...\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:55.000\nThat's already really interesting because New Year's Eve, it really makes you think what we do that night,\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:04.000\nwe lament who we are and we make all these plans for turning over a new leaf.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nAnd then we do this shit that fucks up our whole life that night, that very night.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nWe do some of the craziest shit.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\nLike I'm sure the DUI numbers are through the roof that night, right? That's an easy guess.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nLike I'm probably not wrong about that.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:23.000\nProbably like a lot of lives get ruined on New Year's Eve while people are like,\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:27.000\nfinally 2017, it's going to be different.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:32.000\nYeah, it is. You're going to be pregnant or dead.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nAnd then you think, not that being pregnant is a bad thing, by the way.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nWell, it is now. We have horrible overpopulation. Shame on you.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:45.000\nAlso, who's this person going to be? Picasso? We made all the good people. We're fucked.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:51.000\nYou're just making another omen in a world with an omen surplus.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:57.000\nWe got enough Damians.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nBut then you start, okay, what's the least popular birthday?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:09.000\nIt's May 22nd and then you go 274 days from back and that's August 22nd.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:14.000\nSo is it just too hot to fuck? That was Cody's theory.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nIt's just too hot. It's not a holiday, of course.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:22.000\nIt's the opposite of a holiday. It's just a hot day and the fans blowing on you\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nand you feel like you're in a shitty urban cowboy movie.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:32.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:40.000\nAh, shit.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nI'm doing this wrong. Jeff texted me, tell Andy to bring Spencer out.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nHashtag Comptrolled.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nBut then I brought him out. I should have told you to bring him out.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nDo you want to try bringing him out? You don't have to. You can stay out.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nI can go back.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nJust pretend to go back. Just stay there.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:04.000\nHow would you have brought him out?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nWell, the way I'm told.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:14.000\nSo you would have me say, and now, what's his title?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nGame Master.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd now, give it up for Game Master Spencer.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:29.000\nWhat? No.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:36.000\nSo what do you do over there? I mean, you look like you're...\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nI'm fact checking.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:43.000\nOh wait, you're right. About the birthday thing. The birthday is hot.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nSo someone having a birthday?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nNo, about October. You know, all that stuff.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nIf you were wrong, I would say something, but you're right.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nOh, you were looking it up.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nYou weren't looking up. Are you periscoping?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nI'm trying to get it up.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nGot me. Yes, I'm trying to get it up.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nHe's periscoping during our show.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:03.000\nI'm trying to.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nHe's trying to periscope our show. Is that okay?\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:14.000\nIt's like an airplane flying up next to another airplane and siphoning gas out of it.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:18.000\nLike one of those refueling planes, but it's unfueling.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:23.000\nNo, but it's more like you're a fucking juggernaut and I'm just a little drone going,\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\njust trying to get a little of your juice.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nSo are we disagree on tank size?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nLike you're right.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nNo, I'm like a little mosquito. Yeah.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nOkay, you're right. I'm a part of it.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:40.000\nNo, it doesn't, to answer your question, is not really, there's no, you can periscope.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nI asked him earlier.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nObviously, that's why I knew what he was doing.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nOkay, what do we got here?\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:56.000\nJeff's texting a gift of Stephen Colbert going like this.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nLet me just talk about this for a second, if I might.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:05.000\nSo King Ralph, huh? What a movie.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nAll right, I'll talk about that later.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:25.000\nAll right, and I had a, I tried to watch The Conjuring with Cody.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.000\nYou don't have to play to my periscope.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nI want them to feel welcome.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:37.000\nI tried to watch The Conjuring with Cody and she had taken a bunch of muscle relaxers\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nand we weren't really getting a lot of sleep\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nand the dogs were barking a lot at raccoons in the backyard\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:51.000\nand what happened was, we watched The Conjuring and it was scary\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nand we were asleep but we couldn't sleep all night\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nand there was always shit happening\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nand she was like on something and we're both drunk\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nbut then in the middle of the night she got up to go to the bathroom\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:11.000\nbecause she couldn't see, she was just walking around like this\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:16.000\nlike holding her hands out, being careful, which was like how ghosts walk\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nand then I woke up and she saw me see her and she went,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nI'm not a ghost, I'm not a ghost!\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nWhich is a really funny thing to have to say to somebody\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nand it's even funnier to be right that that's the thing to say\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nlike she knew I thought she was a ghost, I'm not a ghost, I realize I look like a ghost.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nThat's pretty self-aware\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nand it makes me think that's what must be happening to ghosts\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\nlike they're probably dying and walking around the land of the living\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nis like being on Viking in at three in the morning\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nlike they're all probably just going like this because they're like,\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nwhat the fuck is going on?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nand then we're like, oh, that's like a scare gesture\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:55.000\nand they're like, no, I can't see without my ghost glasses\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:59.000\nand they're saying, I am a ghost!\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:04.000\nYeah, they're going, I'm not alive, I'm not alive!\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd you're like, that's scary!\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nBut it comes out, boo!\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nPoor ghosts.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nDo you know who Amanda Knox is?\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nI just watched it, watched the whole thing.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nMy favorite part was the guy that said,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nwhen it turned out like no one had done any DNA testing or whatever\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:31.000\nand the guy's like, dude, I wish when the Americans started to question\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:35.000\nour process forensically, it made me very upset.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:39.000\nIn the year 1308, this country was the birthplace of the American\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nor the Western justice system or something like that.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:47.000\nIn 1308, in America, they were drawing buffalo on the walls of caves.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nI thought it was so adorable!\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:57.000\nI love the idea that we were Native Americans\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nor cavemen, he might think, that we were like cavemen.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd I also love the idea that he doesn't understand\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nthat you don't want to go to the older country for the forensics.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nHe's like, are you kidding me, we invented eyeglasses!\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nOf course we know whose blood splatter that was.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nNo, you need lasers for that.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nYou silly, silly feudal man.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nIt's weird to think that he really thinks that way.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nI know, and it really goes to show you that he wouldn't have like a built-in shame.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nAnd then you go like, oh wait, what's so great about,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:36.000\nwe really adapted that concept that out with the old and with the new\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nto such an extreme that we suffer for it to this day.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nWe have no foundational culture, but at the same time,\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nwe don't have a class system that's so entrenched that a lot of people are going,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nexcuse me, we don't, but in very, very European ways,\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nclass is like something totally like still,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nI think it's just baked into the system.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:02.000\nAnd over here, I always look at it like America is the Las Vegas of the planet.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:06.000\nSo it's like a ton of bad shit happening all on the sidewalk,\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\neveryone shaking their head, like no culture, just blinking neon,\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\njust everyone trying to out-goach everybody,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nbecause fuck you, I won, you lost, oh, I'm up today, I'm down tomorrow.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nAnd it's like, yeah, like in every way,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nevery metaphor that would apply, and then everyone else is like, this can't last.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:28.000\nIt's about to blow up and just waiting very patiently.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nAnd for them, the definition of patience is 400 years,\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nyou'll still be a flash of the pan if you're gone.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\nAnd I'm like, we're on that schedule.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nThey're going to be right, these blue bloods.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:42.000\nThey're going to be like, remember when the Americans were around?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nThey could be right.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:50.000\nHey, about Amanda Knox, what did you think of her boyfriend?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nI don't remember his.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:57.000\nSara Serretti or Serati, did you guys see the little documentary?\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nI love documentaries.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nIt was in the news, I watched it in the news about this girl named Amanda Knox,\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:10.000\nwho was accused of killing her roommate while she was doing a study abroad thing\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:14.000\nin Italy, and they said she killed her roommate.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nI guess nobody knows about it.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nWhat about her boyfriend?\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nWell, this doesn't really matter.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nDid you guys see it?\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nIt's on Netflix, some of you did.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nIt's a one time, it's a documentary.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nI loved it because it's one of those, they do so well with those where\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:36.000\nI'm like, oh God, that bitch is guilty.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:42.000\nThey make her seem so crazy in the beginning.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnd then within the first two minutes, she's making little meatballs with Romney.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nOh, that's so creepy.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nShe's so gross.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:56.000\nShe has the first word and she says, look, the thing is, I'm different.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nI act weird, I talk weird, I react to things weird.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:02.000\nAnd that had me in because I've always been terrified of,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:06.000\nmy 911 call is going to be the one where they play and they go, listen to him.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:12.000\nWhy is he, what do you mean my girlfriend's head came off?\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:16.000\nYou say decapitated and I'm going to be like, what the fuck do you say?\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nWrite a script for my 911 call.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nAnd then they're going to be like, hmm, testy.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nAnd I'm just like, I know, and then they're going to open up one of many boxes in my house\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.000\nthat will make me look like, whether I killed someone or not,\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:34.000\nJail's not a bad place for me to be.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nLike, not a bad idea.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nAll the alcohol and all the pickles.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nYeah, you're, you don't just, I hope nothing bad ever happens in your house.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:48.000\nOh God, man, just, yeah, just break into my house, open any third box.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nIf you really are an enemy of mine and you want to see me go down.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nWhat about the first two? What's in there?\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nYeah, just taxes.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:00.000\nThat stuff won't, you know, that's fine, you know, I didn't lose a billion dollars\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.000\nand then write it off for 22 years.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nBut then the next one is like, is that a sex doll?\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nAnd how old is it?\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:15.000\nIn both senses of the word.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:22.000\nHere are the two weird things to me about that movie, Amanda Knox,\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:26.000\nand about her is that in the beginning when they, they really kind of make her\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nlook a little crazy.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nShe's got wide eyes and she says a very strange phrase, something about,\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:36.000\nlook, either I, and they set her up real nice, lit nice on a stool.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nI'm like, well, she's not in jail.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nThat's my first thing is she in a jail outfit right now.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nShe's not.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nSo I know she did not go to jail, but she did.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nYou have to watch it.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:57.000\nSo, and she says either I am a crazy sociopathic psycho killer or I am you.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nI'm like.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nInstead of innocent.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:07.000\nBecause I am secretly a crazy psychopathic killer.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nRight.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nThat doesn't mean you're innocent.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:13.000\nI don't know what you meant at all by that.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nIt's almost like she, that's what I'm like.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nShe's guilty.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:22.000\nAnd then her boyfriend just turned on her right away.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nIt's all spoiler alert stuff.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:28.000\nBecause we're also familiar with here in the States because we have the world's\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:32.000\nlargest prison population and all of our TV shows are about the process of putting them\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nin prison.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:34.000\nAnd we're fascinated with it.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:39.000\nAnd so most people in this audience, I think could, could probably get through an\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\ninterrogation.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:45.000\nBut, but a lot of the stories like the Memphis, South Memphis 17 or whatever the hell they\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nlike.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nLike a lot of, and the making of a murderer thing too.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:53.000\nA lot of those stories have people who are either, either they're young or they're maybe\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:58.000\na little, a little on the, on the lighter side of the, of the intelligence.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nGod, what, how will you say this diplomatically?\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nWhat path am I going to take through that minefield?\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nThey're either young or they're dumb.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:13.000\nOr they're, or they just haven't, they've never, ever considered the concept of like\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\njust like, oh, this is what the cops want.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.000\nThey're like, I feel like I'm not saying we're all super strong people that could get through\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nan interrogation.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:24.000\nI'm just saying we would know when they sat us down in that chair that we, we have, if\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nwe don't call our lawyer, we're absolutely fucked until the moment we do.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd that, and that every moment until then they're only, they're going to do whatever they can\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nto make us say that we did something.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nAnd this guy is some Italian guy.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:41.000\nIt was like really kind of just adorably hunky and like, and, and, and he, and it's just,\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nit makes you sad that he goes into one side of that black box and he comes out the other\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nlike just going, yeah, she did it and fine.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nNow can I go to bed?\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nAnd then, and then there's also like, I remember what happened.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:58.000\nHe said, he turned on her right away when, when, when the cops scared him into thinking\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:01.000\nthat maybe she, that she turned on him.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:06.000\nAnd then because, but he had these weird thoughts about everything because when she got home\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:13.000\nthat, that morning to, to her apartment where the girl was already dead, she took a shower.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:17.000\nAnd there was, and there was, and there was someone else's shit in the toilet that they,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nno one ever tested the shit.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nAll right, just watch it.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nJust watch it.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:24.000\nIf you're like me, you'll be like the, well, you'll walk away like no one ever tested the\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.000\nturd.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nIt was like this grody, that was the thing.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nIt's like no woman made that turd.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nAnd like, I don't know if it's sexist, like, oh, they're so dainty.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nI'm just saying like, they're fucking like, they have some standards.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:41.000\nLike they, it was like a, that was a gross like fig turd, like that like landed outside\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nthe water.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nI was like, I don't care who you murdered.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nYou'd be like, you'd be like, in the bowl.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nJust, I'm not leaving this.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:51.000\nThis is not going to be my legacy as the person that killed this person.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:56.000\nI want a corpse and a knife and some fingerprints, maybe a little DNA, but not this fucking.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nI showed a photo of the shit.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nThis fucking gross date from a bad Mediterranean.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:09.000\nBut the big turn to me, and this is the part I found the most fascinating was at the very\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:16.000\nend, he, he wanted to get back together with her.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nHe loved her.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nIn prison.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.000\nYeah.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nAnd she had a change of heart.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nShe's like, no, I don't.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nYeah.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:27.000\nI would think that he would leave her forever and ever, right?\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:31.000\nDid you know this was before the Billy Bush was a household name?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nThe household.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:39.000\nLike, I mean, he was, he was more of a, more of a guilty pleasure, shitty hot tub room\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nname before that.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:44.000\nBut he, like, like, like Billy Bush, like is in that documentary.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nDid you notice like you can hear his voice?\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nI think, unless I'm totally mistaken, I'm thinking of the other guy.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nI think it was Billy Bush.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.000\nYou can hear his voice going like she's, because he's just being fed like world is like, yeah,\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:59.000\nthere's a Foxy Noxie and she's like sitting down in the gallery or the whatever they call\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.000\nit behind her table.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:05.000\nAnd then he just goes, he's like, I don't know, doesn't look like a Foxy to me.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nIt looks like maybe she had a rough night.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nMaybe she needs a little more mascara.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nMaybe they don't provide that in Paris jails or something.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:12.000\nLike it was just like, I think it was him.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nI think it was his voice.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nAnyways.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nAll right.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nWho cares?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nLike that guy needs to be taken down a peg.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nThat was not him, by the way.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nAnd I'm the jury's out with him.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nDid you just fact check me?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nI know for a fact.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:27.000\nI remember that guy and they showed him and it wasn't unless it was, I should, can somebody\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:33.000\nfact check that because maybe, but I remember the guy, I can picture him and, but, but Billy's\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.000\nweird because I happen to be following him on Snapchat.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nBilly, Billy Bush.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:43.000\nI only follow five people.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nDo you only follow five people?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nLike you only follow five star.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:52.000\nNo, my kids and Billy fucking.\n\n19:52.000 --> 20:03.000\nIt was before this whole Trump thing is because I'm fast and weirdly fascinated by him because\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nI've been interviewed by him many times.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nIf I get, if I show up, I think he's at E if I remember.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nHe always vies to do my interview.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nI'm gonna, I'm doing it.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nI'm like, oh, this guy really likes me.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nIt's all sweet.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:21.000\nBut then I started thinking, or does he, is he trying to get me?\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nCorner me like a rat.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nPoke my cage.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nWhat is he doing?\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:33.000\nAnd so I've been, I've been watching him like privately because his snaps are private,\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nsupposedly.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:40.000\nAnd I, and I've been trying to like assess to see if he's a real person, if he's being,\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nif, if there's a guy, if there's actually a guy in the media out there that actually likes me.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nThat's all.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nSo I've been watching and watching and watching and watching.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nOh no.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:53.000\nYou were following him because you thought he might be one of the good ones.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nJerry's still out because.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nYou know, but the sad thing is it's just him.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nHe's the only candidate.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:03.000\nThat's what said, you didn't have like Michael Osiello on there.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nThere's people that I know kind of like me.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nOh, you're like Osiello's in.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.000\nThis one's the one I'm like, I just don't get it.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:13.000\nIs he tricking me and pretending to like me?\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:17.000\nWell, I think this is a good segue because the cost of celebrity.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\nYou weather it in this rough industry town.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:26.000\nWhat if you were a passionate haunted house curator?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nWe've, we've had my neighbor on before.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nYou guys know Beth Boots and she was here too.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nBut she's not coming up tonight.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nSo now boo boo.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nOh shit.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nWell, I don't, I didn't mean boo like please boo for me.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nBut I understand that you didn't understand that.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nBut I also, when did you guys start doing things to make me happy?\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:51.000\nYou fucking millennial shit faces.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nI thought you came here to watch me fail.\n\n21:53.000 --> 22:00.000\nSo now all of a sudden you're going to boo on command, you little Nazis.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nBut Beth has been up here in the low.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:07.000\nMost recently she was up here with her kid Timmer who is a, a really a died in the wall\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:11.000\ncard carrying four years and for four years for a 16 year old.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nThat's like, that's like beyond dog years.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nThat's like a long time that he's been doing his haunted house.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:20.000\nAnd so we said, I said, let's keep tabs on him.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:26.000\nSo he's, he's, he's here tonight with, with some of his haunted house workers.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nLet's bring out Timmer Bootson and company.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:48.000\nSo Dan, you told me that these were the stranger things kids.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:54.000\nCause I didn't want you to think we were getting Columbines.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:58.000\nI wanted you to come to the show.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:02.000\nSo Timmer, do you want to introduce your, your terrifying friends?\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nI don't know who they are.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nOh, okay.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nWell, the stranger things kids.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nAll right.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nYeah.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nThis, that's our dress.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:14.000\nThat's Carson.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nThat's Masimo.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nSay hi.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nAll right.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:23.000\nWell, I don't think we'll forget those names any time soon.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:29.000\nDo they have specialties like, does anyone in charge of the pumpkin bucket by the door\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:36.000\nand then another person's in charge of taping the plastic bags to the, to the CD player?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nThey all do that job.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nOkay.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nThey all do that.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nYour mom sent some photos.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:50.000\nWell, first of all, how is the, your mom sent some photos, but that's a different interview.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:56.000\nThat's not, that's not the reaction that, I mean, I, that was my joke.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:59.000\nBut when you react like that, you make it bad.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nJust laugh.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nYou shouldn't, you shouldn't, you shouldn't.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:05.000\nIt turned into married with children for a second.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:12.000\nLook, it was a show in the nineties and the, the, the, the, the, the canned laughter went\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nfrom genuine laughter to just people going, whoo.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:19.000\nEvery time he said he didn't want to fuck his wife and it was like, it was messed up.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:22.000\nTimmer, can I, can I call you Tim?\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.000\nSure.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nShould you have been named Tim?\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nSorry.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nSorry.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nYeah, probably.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:34.000\nSo it'd be easier for people like you to pronounce.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nYeah.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nYeah.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nI mean, it's all about me and my comfort.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nYes.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nExcept, except this time of year when you were fucking haunted houses.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:43.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:49.000\nSo how is the, how is the, how is it going this year compared to last year's?\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:57.000\nMuch better because we have more actors and we have, we, it's, it's bigger.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:03.000\nHave you, in what ways over the, over the four years since you started getting into haunted\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nhouse?\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:07.000\nBecause I know, I know one answer is going to be, you start earlier and earlier in the\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:08.000\nyear, right?\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nBecause this year you started in May working on this year's haunted house.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:13.000\nAnd what other ways, is it getting bigger, like geographically?\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:16.000\nLike, is it taking up more space?\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nYeah.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:22.000\nLast year it still took up space, but this year there's more twists and turns.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:28.000\nAnd your mom said, it's just more of an efficient use of land.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nThat's all.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nLike you said.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nIt's just more of an efficient use of land.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nThat's all.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nRight.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nRight.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nSo yeah, I know.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:41.000\nYou have this breakthrough of landscape management.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:45.000\nWhat, what, how did you figure out how to use it better than last time?\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nIt's a real question.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nUm, I don't know.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nI just use my brain.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nSo this time around you're just like, oh man, I'm better.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nYeah.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nAll right.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nI've grown a lot since last year.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nWell, I give up.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nThat's true.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nI mean, your whole brain is changing.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nYeah.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nI mean, four years ago it's just robots.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:12.000\nThat's getting to be robots and don't get me started.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nNo one wants you to get started.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nSo that's the, that's the frustration of this age.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nIsn't it?\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nYou're not allowed to get started.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:29.000\nAnd yet you, you've started the, so I'm told by parents, the, the, but, but, but you,\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:35.000\nyou, so I, so the pictures that, that, that I got sent, uh, there's a, it looks like a\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:39.000\nlot of like, like, like I'm watching it under construction, I guess in these pictures,\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nbut it really looks like a, there's a post-apocalyptic theme.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nHence the gas masks.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nDo you, is there a reason you chose a post-apocalypse theme?\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:57.000\nWell, have you guys been watching the debates lately?\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nIt's been our show.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nExcellent.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nExcellent work.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nAmazing.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:13.000\nUh, so, but, but as it looks like a lot of like, like, it's a lot of, a lot of hefty bags,\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:20.000\nlike black plastic bags or, but, and PVC pipe and black electric tape.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:24.000\nAnd that's like, is that like just a framework or is it, is it like, are you walking through\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\na world of black plastic?\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nYeah.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nPretty much it's the frame.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nAnd then those are the walls.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nAnd then we put props in it.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:32.000\nYeah.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.000\nYeah.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.000\nIt's more than that racist.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\nThere's white bags as well.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nOh.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nOh.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nThat's nice.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nYeah.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\nYeah.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:48.000\nI mean, I can't, what, what am I going to do with that?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nI'm too old to laugh, too young to help.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nLike, I don't know.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nUh.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:57.000\nSo how long, how long, how long is the average consumers experience when they come to your\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nhaunted house?\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:03.000\nLike from, from gate to gate, from running away in terror to running up and going.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:10.000\nI think about three to five minutes depending on how scared you are.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:15.000\nDo you, do, do, do, do, what does a mistake people make who don't want to be scared in\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:16.000\na haunted house?\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nDo they go slower or faster?\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nUh, they probably go slower cause.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nSo they get scared more.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nYeah.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nThey drag out, they create their own nightmare.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nPretty much.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:30.520\nIt's just like, um, uh, when you're a monkey and you grab the, uh, sugar or the salt cubes\n\n28:30.520 --> 28:35.640\nand that one, uh, 70s nature film and they, they won't let go of the salt.\n\n28:35.640 --> 28:38.000\nSo they're trapped there forever and they die of thirst.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nSure.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:49.000\nOr it's like, like, uh, like a, I don't know, like other things in nature where your struggle,\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nquicksand, I think they call it.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nIt makes your, do you believe in quicksand?\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nDo you think it's real?\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:59.000\nUh, I mean, I've never been asked that question before, but I've seen it in movies.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\nYeah.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nMe too.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nOnly in movies.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:05.000\nI've never seen like a nature documentary where Anthony Hopkins is like, the elephant\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\ndoesn't count.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nIt's some quicksand.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nWell, I like a lot of things in life.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nIt's probably real.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nYeah.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nIt's not real.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nIt's not real.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nIt's definitely real.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nIt's definitely real.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nI'm gonna listen to him.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nYeah.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:17.000\nIt's real.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\nI got stuck.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:19.000\nYeah.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.000\nI got stuck too.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:28.640\nI fact-checked it in my world because I was stuck up to my ball sack in quicksand when\n\n29:28.640 --> 29:29.640\nI was little.\n\n29:29.640 --> 29:30.640\nQuicksand is real.\n\n29:30.640 --> 29:31.640\nIs it real?\n\n29:31.640 --> 29:35.000\nIt's like trying to listen to my parents one telling me Santa's real.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nOne's telling me, no, it's not.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.000\nSanta's real.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nQuicksand is real.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:42.080\nSanta's not real, but quicksand.\n\n29:42.080 --> 29:43.080\nThink about it.\n\n29:43.080 --> 29:44.080\nIt's a real thing.\n\n29:44.080 --> 29:52.080\nIs there anything other than fear that you would love to cause with your haunted house?\n\n29:52.080 --> 29:53.080\nWow.\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:54.080\nEquality.\n\n29:54.080 --> 29:55.080\nCan you elaborate?\n\n29:55.080 --> 29:56.080\nJust say that.\n\n29:56.080 --> 30:02.480\nLike, is there any other message writing in there like with the post-apocalypse theme\n\n30:02.480 --> 30:06.360\nand you're, you know, it's like, should people, are you hoping like maybe people will walk\n\n30:06.360 --> 30:08.920\nout going like, man, that scared the shit out of me.\n\n30:08.920 --> 30:15.720\nAnd also like, did you notice that chaos is not as much a part of our life as it needs\n\n30:15.720 --> 30:16.720\nto be?\n\n30:16.720 --> 30:26.000\nWell, I guess that's why Halloween's once a year so I could show you all the hell you\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:29.120\ncan go through in life and then you can be lucky for the rest of the year.\n\n30:29.120 --> 30:30.120\nOh, that's nice.\n\n30:30.120 --> 30:31.120\nYeah.\n\n30:31.120 --> 30:32.120\nAll right.\n\n30:32.120 --> 30:37.920\nWell, let's have a hand for Timur and his friends and go to their haunted house.\n\n30:37.920 --> 30:40.800\nYou want people to go, right?\n\n30:40.800 --> 30:41.800\nYeah.\n\n30:41.800 --> 30:48.720\nI mean, I got, because I saw on the, I think of the Facebook, like, you know, one of our\n\n30:48.720 --> 30:53.760\nfans, Jane, who was coordinating some, I don't know, there was, I heard about a bunch of\n\n30:53.760 --> 30:55.080\npeople coming to your haunted house.\n\n30:55.080 --> 30:57.000\nI don't know if they've done it yet or if they're going to do it.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.720\nOh yeah, you have a big fan base.\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:01.520\nWe had about two or three people there.\n\n31:01.520 --> 31:02.520\nOkay.\n\n31:02.520 --> 31:03.520\nYeah.\n\n31:03.520 --> 31:04.520\nThat seems about right.\n\n31:04.520 --> 31:09.200\nWell, so we can, we can, we can invite people without worrying of overwhelming you.\n\n31:09.200 --> 31:14.280\nIt's 4302 Ambrose Avenue where, and yeah, the website's better to give.\n\n31:14.280 --> 31:17.280\nIt's ambrosehauntedmaze.com.\n\n31:17.280 --> 31:18.280\nYeah.\n\n31:18.280 --> 31:24.440\nEvery night from seven.\n\n31:24.440 --> 31:26.680\nAnd it says, face your fears.\n\n31:26.680 --> 31:27.680\nFace your fears.\n\n31:27.680 --> 31:28.680\nAll right.\n\n31:28.680 --> 31:29.680\nAll right.\n\n31:29.680 --> 31:31.680\nYou guys go face your fears of school day tomorrow.\n\n31:31.680 --> 31:35.400\nThank you.\n\n31:35.400 --> 31:37.400\nIt's Monday.\n\n31:37.400 --> 31:39.520\nAll right.\n\n31:39.520 --> 31:47.920\nWell, Andy, the time has come for you to, I think, abandon your, your wings as a guest\n\n31:47.920 --> 31:56.280\ncop trawler and become a guest.\n\n31:56.280 --> 32:03.160\nOur next guest has been guest comp trawling and to, to, to mixed results and, and, and\n\n32:03.160 --> 32:07.360\noh, here's our, all right, Jeff just wants to be a guest.\n\n32:07.360 --> 32:09.160\nI'm going to sit out here.\n\n32:09.160 --> 32:10.160\nOkay.\n\n32:10.160 --> 32:15.200\nLet's mix it up because Andy, Andy, you're doing such a good job of comp trawling.\n\n32:15.200 --> 32:18.520\nAm I, am I being periscoped right now?\n\n32:18.520 --> 32:24.080\nThere was so cool that you had spooky one direction on that was nice.\n\n32:24.080 --> 32:28.400\nDo you think that they, that they murdered Zayn?\n\n32:28.400 --> 32:31.640\nIs that why, is that why Zayn wasn't out here?\n\n32:31.640 --> 32:34.920\nYou're outside my pop cultural vocabulary.\n\n32:34.920 --> 32:38.560\nI, I, I Googled it while I was back there.\n\n32:38.560 --> 32:44.640\nI typed in one direction, who, and it auto filled in, who left?\n\n32:44.640 --> 32:45.640\nOh.\n\n32:45.640 --> 32:46.640\nIt was Zayn.\n\n32:46.640 --> 32:53.760\nI heard if you play their hit, email, email my Twitter backwards, it says Zayn is dead.\n\n32:53.760 --> 32:59.760\nBut you have to reverse the file in SoundCloud in order to hear it.\n\n32:59.760 --> 33:01.680\nWhere did Andy go?\n\n33:01.680 --> 33:04.240\nAnd now Andy just, Andy's just evaporated.\n\n33:04.240 --> 33:05.240\nOh, there he is.\n\n33:05.240 --> 33:06.880\nI

Brandy.\n\n33:26.160 --> 33:31.280\nDino Stamatopolous, uh, the, uh, inmates are running the, uh, the asylum.\n\n33:31.280 --> 33:33.280\nOh, really?\n\n33:33.280 --> 33:36.880\nDino, is this your guitar?\n\n33:36.880 --> 33:37.880\nThat's my guitar.\n\n33:37.880 --> 33:39.880\nAre you going to sing a song for us later?\n\n33:39.880 --> 33:40.880\nShhh.\n\n33:40.880 --> 33:41.880\nIt's a surprise.\n\n33:41.880 --> 33:42.880\nWell, no, it's not.\n\n33:42.880 --> 33:43.880\nIt's a fucking guitar.\n\n33:43.880 --> 33:44.880\nNo, I'm going to fuck.\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:45.880\nWell, I think you don't know what I'm going to do with it.\n\n33:45.880 --> 33:46.880\nI'm going to fuck that guitar.\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:47.880\nYeah.\n\n33:47.880 --> 33:49.880\nWell, it's going to fuck me.\n\n33:49.880 --> 33:50.880\nI forgot.\n\n33:50.880 --> 33:51.880\nI forgot.\n\n33:51.880 --> 33:56.040\nSo it's mentioned something about the haunted house that Beth mentioned, which is that there\n\n33:56.040 --> 34:00.880\nare so many more twists and turns this year that people are really getting lost.\n\n34:00.880 --> 34:05.120\nHow old, how old were those boys?\n\n34:05.120 --> 34:07.880\nAnd why was Andy here with them?\n\n34:07.880 --> 34:12.880\nAlso, when they left, Andy left right after they did.\n\n34:12.880 --> 34:19.880\nSo much so funny.\n\n34:19.880 --> 34:23.880\nI mean, I could put.\n\n34:23.880 --> 34:24.880\nNow where's Dino?\n\n34:24.880 --> 34:25.880\nWhere's Dino?\n\n34:25.880 --> 34:29.880\nWhy do you have a duffel bag full of skeletons?\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:30.880\nWhere's Dino?\n\n34:30.880 --> 34:33.880\nWhat did you do or say to those children back there?\n\n34:33.880 --> 34:34.880\nI didn't see them.\n\n34:34.880 --> 34:35.880\nI went pee.\n\n34:35.880 --> 34:36.880\nOkay.\n\n34:36.880 --> 34:37.880\nJust now?\n\n34:37.880 --> 34:38.880\nAll right.\n\n34:38.880 --> 34:42.880\nWe can't really verify your story until we check the tape.\n\n34:42.880 --> 34:43.880\nAll right.\n\n34:43.880 --> 34:50.440\nSo I know that this has been talked about a lot by everybody, but that's part of why\n\n34:50.440 --> 34:55.360\nI'm outraged about it, because it hasn't changed.\n\n34:55.360 --> 35:01.440\nWhy did we make this shift with fortune cookies, where they're just advice cookies.\n\n35:01.440 --> 35:04.480\nThey're just platitude cookies.\n\n35:04.480 --> 35:07.560\nAnd you don't even have to change it much to make a...\n\n35:07.560 --> 35:11.560\n100 compliments, like you are a wise person, and it's like, oh great, I'll take it to the\n\n35:11.560 --> 35:12.560\nbank.\n\n35:12.560 --> 35:13.560\nI got one at one time.\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:15.960\nI got one at one time and said, people like you at a party.\n\n35:15.960 --> 35:16.960\nYeah, exactly.\n\n35:16.960 --> 35:17.960\nI'm like, that's not fortune.\n\n35:17.960 --> 35:18.960\nThat's not a fortune.\n\n35:18.960 --> 35:22.800\nOkay, so take that one and just change it to, people are going to like you at a party.\n\n35:22.800 --> 35:23.800\nGreat fortune.\n\n35:23.800 --> 35:24.800\nOh no, no.\n\n35:24.800 --> 35:26.800\nOne person might not like you at a party.\n\n35:26.800 --> 35:28.320\nOh yeah, I mean, even at some...\n\n35:28.320 --> 35:29.320\nLike Gremlins me.\n\n35:29.320 --> 35:31.920\nLike fucking be the creepy guy at the fucking Mogwes store.\n\n35:31.920 --> 35:32.920\nBeware.\n\n35:32.920 --> 35:35.320\nYou know, you're gonna get invited to a party.\n\n35:35.320 --> 35:36.760\nI don't know if you should go.\n\n35:36.760 --> 35:40.760\nLike peep somebody by there might not like you, and you'd be like, ooh, there's steaks\n\n35:40.760 --> 35:42.320\nto my shitty life.\n\n35:42.320 --> 35:47.240\nI was like, fantasize there'd be a fortune cookie, you open it up and the fortune just\n\n35:47.240 --> 35:50.760\nsaid, duck.\n\n35:50.760 --> 35:52.880\nThat's a fucking good fortune cookie.\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:54.480\nBut it says that all over the menu.\n\n35:54.480 --> 35:55.480\nYeah.\n\n35:55.480 --> 35:59.360\nThat's true.\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:01.560\nSo they feel like they'd be trying to...\n\n36:01.560 --> 36:03.760\nI'll have the peaking duck.\n\n36:03.760 --> 36:07.640\nAll right, well, so have you ever seen King Ralph?\n\n36:07.640 --> 36:09.640\nI don't...\n\n36:09.640 --> 36:11.120\nWhat's that one?\n\n36:11.120 --> 36:12.120\nIt's...\n\n36:12.120 --> 36:15.720\nOkay, so I was describing it to Cody because we were talking about Trump and I was like,\n\n36:15.720 --> 36:17.520\nI don't know if people think it's like a King Ralph thing.\n\n36:17.520 --> 36:18.520\nIs that why they like him?\n\n36:18.520 --> 36:19.520\nShe's like, what's King Ralph?\n\n36:19.520 --> 36:25.440\nI said, you know, there was a movie that John Goodman is a guy and lives in Vegas or Cleveland\n\n36:25.440 --> 36:26.440\nor something and he...\n\n36:26.440 --> 36:30.960\nVegas or Cleveland.\n\n36:30.960 --> 36:33.600\nInterchangeable cities.\n\n36:33.600 --> 36:39.680\nThe entire royal family is wiped out in a freak accident, leaving him as the only heir,\n\n36:39.680 --> 36:40.680\nso he's King Ralph.\n\n36:40.680 --> 36:44.080\nAnd then she's like, wait, that sounds like the greatest movie ever.\n\n36:44.080 --> 36:45.080\nAnd I'm like, yeah, it does.\n\n36:45.080 --> 36:46.080\nWhy haven't I ever watched that?\n\n36:46.080 --> 36:47.080\nAnd then we watched it.\n\n36:47.080 --> 36:49.000\nIt was like, oh my God, it was so boring.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:53.680\nHow can you make a movie about the entire royal family getting murdered in the first\n\n36:53.680 --> 36:57.040\nthree minutes and like having John Goodman become the King of England?\n\n36:57.040 --> 36:58.040\nHow do you...\n\n36:58.040 --> 37:01.960\nIsn't that the same premise of designated survivor or whatever?\n\n37:01.960 --> 37:02.960\nDesignated survivor.\n\n37:02.960 --> 37:04.800\nKeepers of England.\n\n37:04.800 --> 37:05.800\nHe becomes the King...\n\n37:05.800 --> 37:06.800\nOh, man.\n\n37:06.800 --> 37:07.800\nKeepers of England.\n\n37:07.800 --> 37:08.800\nOh, man.\n\n37:08.800 --> 37:09.800\nHe becomes the...\n\n37:09.800 --> 37:10.800\nThe designated survivor.\n\n37:10.800 --> 37:12.800\nThey put him in like a secret cabinet somewhere.\n\n37:12.800 --> 37:13.800\nYeah, they put the guy that...\n\n37:13.800 --> 37:16.440\nWell, he's just like the secretary of agriculture or something?\n\n37:16.440 --> 37:17.440\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n37:17.440 --> 37:18.440\nYeah, but that's not...\n\n37:18.440 --> 37:19.440\nI mean, like we don't live in...\n\n37:19.440 --> 37:21.400\nWell, I mean, no, that's fun, sure.\n\n37:21.400 --> 37:23.680\nSo is Dave with Kevin Klein.\n\n37:23.680 --> 37:25.760\nHe's the president's double and then he becomes president.\n\n37:25.760 --> 37:29.760\nLike, these are interesting and then you go and like, oh man, if this guy was president,\n\n37:29.760 --> 37:34.040\noh, and it's like, it's the King of England, I guess the problem is the King doesn't really\n\n37:34.040 --> 37:36.960\ndo anything and that's not a controversial statement.\n\n37:36.960 --> 37:40.480\nIt's like specifically designed to not be a active office.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:42.400\nAnd then so then you're like, what's at stake?\n\n37:42.400 --> 37:46.200\nBut then also it's just weird because I think the only thing that...\n\n37:46.200 --> 37:48.960\nBecause the Royals are a family, that's the whole point of them.\n\n37:48.960 --> 37:52.720\nSo since you have to kill them all in order to have them be King, he's just wandering\n\n37:52.720 --> 37:58.120\naround Buckingham Palace going, this needs a bowling alley and like it's not like there's\n\n37:58.120 --> 38:02.800\nan old lady going, I never, because she's dead.\n\n38:02.800 --> 38:06.720\nThere's just a bunch of people going, well, you're King.\n\n38:06.720 --> 38:07.720\nBut does he...\n\n38:07.720 --> 38:08.720\nResearch bowling alley.\n\n38:08.720 --> 38:14.440\nBut does he use his like, like, like meathead, like lower class morality to kind of shake\n\n38:14.440 --> 38:17.040\nthings up for good or what happens?\n\n38:17.040 --> 38:21.960\nKind of, but it's like so low stakes, it's like, like he becomes King and then he falls\n\n38:21.960 --> 38:27.360\nin love with a stripper and like, but she's not a stripper because it's really fucked\n\n38:27.360 --> 38:28.360\nup.\n\n38:28.360 --> 38:33.200\nAnd then it's like, they go straight from, I can't believe this guy's the King of England\n\n38:33.200 --> 38:39.360\ntoo, if he does something improper, then the stewards or the tutors will be able to sweep\n\n38:39.360 --> 38:45.320\nin and it's like, what do you mean if he does something improper, he's a fucking fat guy\n\n38:45.320 --> 38:48.880\nfrom Las Vegas?\n\n38:48.880 --> 38:53.040\nBut then you'll be able to invoke the law of abdication?\n\n38:53.040 --> 38:54.040\nIt doesn't make...\n\n38:54.040 --> 38:57.040\nYou spend the whole time going, what the hell's going on?\n\n38:57.040 --> 38:59.680\nYou're talking about a movie that you don't want any of us to see.\n\n38:59.680 --> 39:06.000\nYeah, but I just thought it was amazing that the plot for King Ralph exists in the annals\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:11.200\nof our bad movie, and it's like, it's a good idea, I mean, it would be interesting to watch\n\n39:11.200 --> 39:14.880\na guy be King of England, but it's really boring.\n\n39:14.880 --> 39:19.080\nLike, it's not a bad idea, do you want to see like King Spencer?\n\n39:19.080 --> 39:20.080\nYeah.\n\n39:20.080 --> 39:21.080\nYeah.\n\n39:21.080 --> 39:24.800\nSpencer's the King of England, like, I could fill 90 minutes.\n\n39:24.800 --> 39:26.800\nDesignated Spencer.\n\n39:26.800 --> 39:27.800\nYeah.\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:34.760\nPeople are really getting lost in that haunted house, okay, I warn you about that.\n\n39:34.760 --> 39:35.760\nProbably all these tutors.\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:38.240\nI want to get back to...\n\n39:38.240 --> 39:41.400\nOn the front, you know, they go like, click, click, click as you come in with one of those\n\n39:41.400 --> 39:42.800\nclickers, and there's just...\n\n39:42.800 --> 39:50.720\nWhen they check the till at the end, there's two people in play, and they've run a thing,\n\n39:50.720 --> 39:56.280\nthe plastic's all intact, so I think there's two people still in there facing their fears.\n\n39:56.280 --> 40:03.920\nBut you find it weird, at the end of the haunted house, there's these snacks that taste like\n\n40:03.920 --> 40:04.920\npeople.\n\n40:04.920 --> 40:05.920\nAll right.\n\n40:05.920 --> 40:09.920\nThey taste like two people.\n\n40:09.920 --> 40:15.040\nOh yeah, I don't know, they taste like two people.\n\n40:15.040 --> 40:17.640\nIt tastes like two missing people.\n\n40:17.640 --> 40:23.120\nWell, let's bring out Dino so that we can talk to him.\n\n40:23.120 --> 40:30.120\nYeah, Dino!\n\n40:30.120 --> 40:34.520\nRight for the vodka.\n\n40:34.520 --> 40:36.800\nFucking night!\n\n40:36.800 --> 40:38.520\nHe knows what he likes.\n\n40:38.520 --> 40:41.480\nAndy, have you been, man?\n\n40:41.480 --> 40:42.480\nWhere are you going?\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:44.280\nEvery time I look over here, you're milling about...\n\n40:44.280 --> 40:45.960\nI thought I was coming up there.\n\n40:45.960 --> 40:47.160\nYou're staying right where you are.\n\n40:47.160 --> 40:48.160\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n40:48.160 --> 40:49.160\nAndy was doing good.\n\n40:49.160 --> 40:52.560\nI was standing over there, and I was watching.\n\n40:52.560 --> 40:53.560\nWould you be happier out here, Andy?\n\n40:53.560 --> 40:57.120\nNo, no, I like this for a little bit, but I do like...\n\n40:57.120 --> 40:59.320\nI feel comfortable with Dino.\n\n40:59.320 --> 41:00.320\nOh, okay.\n\n41:00.320 --> 41:01.320\nGet over here.\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:02.320\nWhy don't we switch places?\n\n41:02.320 --> 41:03.320\nI can stay here.\n\n41:03.320 --> 41:04.320\nSwitch places.\n\n41:04.320 --> 41:05.320\nI'll switch, I'll switch.\n\n41:05.320 --> 41:06.320\nJeff loves it right here.\n\n41:06.320 --> 41:07.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n41:07.320 --> 41:08.320\nI won't.\n\n41:08.320 --> 41:17.440\nI have to say, I was sitting over there watching you, and it was like I was watching my kid\n\n41:17.440 --> 41:23.160\nbe in like a soccer team for the first time, like, oh, yeah, hit it!\n\n41:23.160 --> 41:26.960\nAnd when you got your first laugh, I was so proud of you.\n\n41:26.960 --> 41:28.280\nWhat was it when it was his first laugh?\n\n41:28.280 --> 41:30.160\nI don't know.\n\n41:30.160 --> 41:32.280\nHis mom took the picture.\n\n41:32.280 --> 41:38.600\nAll right, well, so you guys, again, just to re-mention it, you have a fair audio podcast\n\n41:38.600 --> 41:39.600\ncalled Skull Juice.\n\n41:39.600 --> 41:40.600\nSkull Juice, yeah.\n\n41:40.600 --> 41:48.040\nFront Rose, love us.\n\n41:48.040 --> 41:51.520\nBut also, Dino, you have a band.\n\n41:51.520 --> 41:54.200\nI have a band called Sorry About Everything.\n\n41:54.200 --> 41:56.200\nDon't, don't throw it.\n\n41:56.200 --> 41:57.200\nIt's a punk band.\n\n41:57.200 --> 41:58.200\nIt's okay.\n\n41:58.200 --> 41:59.200\nI'm not really apologizing.\n\n41:59.200 --> 42:00.720\nI'm cocky about it.\n\n42:00.720 --> 42:01.720\nIt's easier than comedy.\n\n42:01.720 --> 42:04.800\nLook, I'm not getting any laughs.\n\n42:04.800 --> 42:10.080\nAnd you know I want to be like you, so I don't know if I told you yet, but I started a band.\n\n42:10.080 --> 42:11.080\nCalled?\n\n42:11.080 --> 42:12.080\nYou're welcome.\n\n42:12.080 --> 42:21.680\nWhen, uh, when I got my first Emmy for the Ben Stiller show, Andy and I actually wrote\n\n42:21.680 --> 42:22.680\na lot of the sketches.\n\n42:22.680 --> 42:24.640\nYou know that's how he said first, Emmy.\n\n42:24.640 --> 42:25.640\nTrue.\n\n42:25.640 --> 42:28.640\nWell, I mean, I don't know, I'm not dead yet.\n\n42:28.640 --> 42:31.640\nIt's my one Emmy, but, you know.\n\n42:31.640 --> 42:34.000\nI thought you have multiple Emmys.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nNo, I only have one Emmy.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nI tell people you have five.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:37.000\nThank you, baby.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:38.000\nLet's go with that.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:39.000\nLet's go with that.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.120\nYou know, you, you call your one Emmy, your first Emmy.\n\n42:41.120 --> 42:42.120\nI love that.\n\n42:42.120 --> 42:43.120\nThat's a good idea.\n\n42:43.120 --> 42:44.120\nI ain't dead yet.\n\n42:44.120 --> 42:45.120\nWhat an optimist I love.\n\n42:45.120 --> 42:46.120\nYeah.\n\n42:46.120 --> 42:48.040\nBut you know, I'm a pessimist too.\n\n42:48.040 --> 42:50.120\nI call my, my mom, my...\n\n42:50.120 --> 42:51.120\nFirst mom.\n\n42:51.120 --> 42:53.120\nMy, yeah, my soon-to-be-deceased mother.\n\n42:53.120 --> 42:54.120\nYeah.\n\n42:54.120 --> 42:58.560\nBecause you're a pessimist?\n\n42:58.560 --> 43:00.920\nYou want her to be dead.\n\n43:00.920 --> 43:01.920\nShe's listening.\n\n43:01.920 --> 43:05.040\nNo, a pessimist means I don't want her to be dead.\n\n43:05.040 --> 43:06.040\nI don't know.\n\n43:06.040 --> 43:07.800\nI don't know what I'm talking about.\n\n43:07.800 --> 43:08.800\nShe's not listening.\n\n43:08.800 --> 43:09.800\nYour mom's not going to listen.\n\n43:09.800 --> 43:10.800\nNo.\n\n43:10.800 --> 43:11.800\nMy mom will never listen to this.\n\n43:11.800 --> 43:12.800\nI'll make sure she does.\n\n43:12.800 --> 43:13.800\nShe doesn't even listen to you when you talk at Thanksgiving.\n\n43:13.800 --> 43:14.800\nRight.\n\n43:14.800 --> 43:15.800\nYeah.\n\n43:15.800 --> 43:16.800\nShe's like this guy.\n\n43:16.800 --> 43:17.800\nYour mother...\n\n43:17.800 --> 43:18.800\nScares the shit out of me.\n\n43:18.800 --> 43:19.800\nYeah.\n\n43:19.800 --> 43:20.800\nYeah.\n\n43:20.800 --> 43:21.800\nShe's terrifying too.\n\n43:21.800 --> 43:22.800\nWell, because she wants to fuck you really badly.\n\n43:22.800 --> 43:23.800\nProbably.\n\n43:23.800 --> 43:24.800\nThat's right.\n\n43:24.800 --> 43:29.800\nThat's like, that's like a wolf man wanting to fuck you.\n\n43:29.800 --> 43:34.800\nWho doesn't want to fuck you?\n\n43:34.800 --> 43:38.800\nWhy don't you want me to fuck you?\n\n43:38.800 --> 43:39.800\nAll right.\n\n43:39.800 --> 43:40.800\nSorry.\n\n43:40.800 --> 43:41.800\nYou have.\n\n43:41.800 --> 43:42.800\nI have.\n\n43:42.800 --> 43:43.800\nI fucked you.\n\n43:43.800 --> 43:46.800\nI fucked you for ten years by not talking to you.\n\n43:46.800 --> 43:49.800\nYou dreamed about either filetting Dino or Dino filetting you?\n\n43:49.800 --> 43:51.800\nI don't want to talk about it.\n\n43:51.800 --> 43:53.800\nIt's on your Feral Audio podcast.\n\n43:53.800 --> 43:54.800\nOh, it is.\n\n43:54.800 --> 43:55.800\nWe spoke about it, of the three of us.\n\n43:55.800 --> 43:56.800\nYeah.\n\n43:56.800 --> 43:57.800\nHe doesn't want to talk about it on somebody else's podcast.\n\n43:57.800 --> 44:00.800\nBecause it was a Louis C.K. dreamed about wanting to fuck Dino.\n\n44:00.800 --> 44:01.800\nOr fucking Dino?\n\n44:01.800 --> 44:02.800\nNo.\n\n44:02.800 --> 44:06.800\nI was just spooning in my dream, spooning, and it was just like a jerk.\n\n44:06.800 --> 44:08.800\nI think Louis and I were...\n\n44:08.800 --> 44:14.800\nDid you guys ever have a dream where you were a lady?\n\n44:14.800 --> 44:17.800\nAnd you were getting copulated with upon by a gentleman?\n\n44:17.800 --> 44:18.800\nI did.\n\n44:18.800 --> 44:19.800\nOh, really?\n\n44:19.800 --> 44:20.800\nYeah.\n\n44:20.800 --> 44:24.800\nI had a dream that I was in my kitchen sink when I was a kid.\n\n44:24.800 --> 44:26.800\nIn your sink as a lady?\n\n44:26.800 --> 44:27.800\nYeah.\n\n44:27.800 --> 44:28.800\nThat's the one lady like.\n\n44:28.800 --> 44:29.800\nI know.\n\n44:29.800 --> 44:30.800\nIt was animalistic and passionate.\n\n44:30.800 --> 44:34.800\nAnd there was this very Mario from Mario Brothers looking guy,\n\n44:34.800 --> 44:37.800\njust giving it to me missionary style.\n\n44:37.800 --> 44:39.800\nAnd I was in the sink.\n\n44:39.800 --> 44:40.800\nAnd then the die-hard guy came in.\n\n44:40.800 --> 44:41.800\nYou're all 80s.\n\n44:41.800 --> 44:43.800\nIt's ridiculous.\n\n44:43.800 --> 44:46.800\nWere you shrunken down to fit inside a sink?\n\n44:46.800 --> 44:47.800\nNo.\n\n44:47.800 --> 44:49.800\nFirst of all, I was a younger kid.\n\n44:49.800 --> 44:53.800\nSo in my mind, the sink was bigger.\n\n44:53.800 --> 44:54.800\nRight.\n\n44:54.800 --> 44:57.800\nAnd then also, if I'm thinking I'm a lady, I don't know.\n\n44:57.800 --> 44:59.800\nI was in the sink.\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:03.800\nIt was like, the sink is big enough for a butt, a human butt.\n\n45:03.800 --> 45:06.800\nSo you're like, I wasn't like, contained in the sink.\n\n45:06.800 --> 45:09.800\nLike, it was like, the littles or something.\n\n45:09.800 --> 45:11.800\nOr I'm like, sliding down a spoon.\n\n45:11.800 --> 45:13.800\nIf there's a guy fucking me.\n\n45:13.800 --> 45:16.800\nIf your butt's in the sink, how does somebody fuck you while your butt is down in the recess?\n\n45:16.800 --> 45:18.800\nWell, I mean, I'm a kid, I don't really.\n\n45:18.800 --> 45:20.800\nYou're such a stickler.\n\n45:20.800 --> 45:22.800\nI'm a visual sinker, Dino.\n\n45:22.800 --> 45:24.800\nHow big was Mario?\n\n45:24.800 --> 45:26.800\nHe was like a, he was like a.\n\n45:26.800 --> 45:28.800\nHis feet on the ground?\n\n45:28.800 --> 45:31.800\nNo, I mean, that's the thing is he was like, he was a compact man.\n\n45:31.800 --> 45:32.800\nYeah.\n\n45:32.800 --> 45:34.800\nHe was probably like, he would have had to have been on like a.\n\n45:34.800 --> 45:35.800\nThe mushroom.\n\n45:35.800 --> 45:36.800\nYeah.\n\n45:36.800 --> 45:41.800\nThe way that he was giving it to me on the height of counter that I was on with.\n\n45:41.800 --> 45:43.800\nHe had to have been on my foot.\n\n45:43.800 --> 45:44.800\nYeah.\n\n45:44.800 --> 45:45.800\nI just think it's.\n\n45:45.800 --> 45:47.800\nBut the dream is just point of view.\n\n45:47.800 --> 45:49.800\nI mean, I don't have to deal with that stuff.\n\n45:49.800 --> 45:51.800\nAnd I was like, probably, I don't know.\n\n45:51.800 --> 45:53.800\nWell, I would have to say like, this is after puberty.\n\n45:53.800 --> 45:57.800\nAnd like, I'm going to say like 13, maybe I had that dream.\n\n45:57.800 --> 46:00.800\nHe probably would look like a nice lady at that age.\n\n46:00.800 --> 46:10.800\nI remember my friends when I was like 12, somehow it came up and they'd like, Dino, you'd make a good looking girl.\n\n46:10.800 --> 46:15.800\nAnd I was like mad, but now I'd kill for that a compliment.\n\n46:15.800 --> 46:16.800\nYeah.\n\n46:16.800 --> 46:17.800\nYeah.\n\n46:17.800 --> 46:22.800\nWhen I was 13, I would have loved to have heard that your mom wanted to fuck me.\n\n46:22.800 --> 46:26.800\nNo, you wouldn't.\n\n46:26.800 --> 46:28.800\nI'm sure I mentioned this before in Harmontown.\n\n46:28.800 --> 46:29.800\nMaybe not.\n\n46:29.800 --> 46:30.800\nI had a dream one time.\n\n46:30.800 --> 46:33.800\nI think I told you about this, Dan, where I was going down on a girl in my dream.\n\n46:33.800 --> 46:37.800\nAnd then at some point she had a dick, but it was my dick.\n\n46:37.800 --> 46:39.800\nSo now I'm sucking my.\n\n46:39.800 --> 46:40.800\nOf course.\n\n46:40.800 --> 46:41.800\nI'm sucking my own dick.\n\n46:41.800 --> 46:47.800\nAnd the whole time I'm thinking like, I want to do a good job, but I don't want to come in my own mouth.\n\n46:47.800 --> 46:50.800\nI mean, you've never had.\n\n46:50.800 --> 46:54.800\nHave you had, have you had dreams where you'd suck your own cock?\n\n46:54.800 --> 46:55.800\nI always do.\n\n46:55.800 --> 46:58.800\nIt's like, it's like flying dreams in that.\n\n46:58.800 --> 46:59.800\nNo.\n\n46:59.800 --> 47:00.800\nWhat do you mean in your dream?\n\n47:00.800 --> 47:01.800\nYou bend in half.\n\n47:01.800 --> 47:02.800\nYeah.\n\n47:02.800 --> 47:03.800\nI'm like just sucking in.\n\n47:03.800 --> 47:04.800\nIt's great.\n\n47:04.800 --> 47:05.800\nReally?\n\n47:05.800 --> 47:06.800\nAnd you contorted?\n\n47:06.800 --> 47:07.800\nYeah.\n\n47:07.800 --> 47:10.800\nAnd then I come in my own face and I call myself a cunt.\n\n47:10.800 --> 47:11.800\nI can't tell if you're doing a bit.\n\n47:11.800 --> 47:13.800\nI don't know if you're doing a bit.\n\n47:13.800 --> 47:15.800\nLet's bring the kids back out.\n\n47:15.800 --> 47:21.800\nI mean, let's bring out spooky one direction.\n\n47:21.800 --> 47:24.800\nI mean, this is what you'll get at skull juice kids.\n\n47:24.800 --> 47:31.800\nNo, I've never, I've never, I mean, I couldn't even dream of doing a sit-up when that's like 11,000 sit-ups.\n\n47:31.800 --> 47:32.800\nYeah, but it's a dream.\n\n47:32.800 --> 47:34.800\nI couldn't dream of flying either.\n\n47:34.800 --> 47:35.800\nWell, I could fly.\n\n47:35.800 --> 47:36.800\nYou could fly now?\n\n47:36.800 --> 47:37.800\nFlying dreams lately.\n\n47:37.800 --> 47:38.800\nOh, right.\n\n47:38.800 --> 47:40.800\nWell, I know it's even more of a feat.\n\n47:40.800 --> 47:47.800\nI keep having these dreams where I'll just be running down the sidewalk and then I'll just like, I'll realize, wait, I can fly.\n\n47:47.800 --> 47:49.800\nAnd then I'll just like start flying.\n\n47:49.800 --> 47:54.800\nI say that it's a very, very positive like emotional or psychological state to be in.\n\n47:54.800 --> 47:57.800\nFlying dream is like the most...\n\n47:57.800 --> 47:59.800\nYou can control that with lucid dreaming.\n\n47:59.800 --> 48:00.800\nYou're liberated.\n\n48:00.800 --> 48:02.800\nThere's no spiritual gravity.\n\n48:02.800 --> 48:04.800\nThat's a very healthy space to be in.\n\n48:04.800 --> 48:06.800\nYou always wake up happy.\n\n48:06.800 --> 48:08.800\nYeah, no, I've been going to sleep pretty happy.\n\n48:08.800 --> 48:11.800\nBut also like sucking your own cock, you wake up happy too.\n\n48:11.800 --> 48:13.800\nI'm sure it's great.\n\n48:13.800 --> 48:15.800\nOh, man.\n\n48:15.800 --> 48:17.800\nThat's all I got to say.\n\n48:17.800 --> 48:20.800\nSomebody raised their hand and now I'm terrified.\n\n48:27.800 --> 48:31.800\nI am a double major in literature and film because of Dino.\n\n48:31.800 --> 48:32.800\nBecause of me?\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:33.800\nYes.\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:35.800\nI don't even know what literature is.\n\n48:35.800 --> 48:37.800\nNever read in my life.\n\n48:37.800 --> 48:39.800\nThat's why he has to be a double.\n\n48:39.800 --> 48:43.800\nIt was literally...Moral Oral was the reason that I got my double major.\n\n48:43.800 --> 48:47.800\nYou know, I wrote Moral Oral but I never read it after I wrote it.\n\n48:49.800 --> 48:51.800\nThat is super fine.\n\n48:51.800 --> 48:58.800\nNo, literally I used Moral Oral to fight.\n\n48:58.800 --> 49:00.800\nI went to a business school.\n\n49:00.800 --> 49:05.800\nSo you couldn't do a double major in anything that wasn't both business and something else.\n\n49:05.800 --> 49:09.800\nAnd so I wanted to do a media and literature major.\n\n49:09.800 --> 49:13.800\nAnd Moral Oral was the reason that I was the first person who was able to do that.\n\n49:13.800 --> 49:14.800\nWow. Well, thanks.\n\n49:14.800 --> 49:15.800\nYeah.\n\n49:15.800 --> 49:16.800\nThank you.\n\n49:16.800 --> 49:17.800\nVery nice.\n\n49:17.800 --> 49:19.800\nGive me that microphone back.\n\n49:19.800 --> 49:20.800\nNo, that's very nice.\n\n49:20.800 --> 49:22.800\nDo you have more to say?\n\n49:22.800 --> 49:23.800\nOh, boy.\n\n49:23.800 --> 49:24.800\nDon't bore him.\n\n49:24.800 --> 49:26.800\nYou're a Moral Oral fan.\n\n49:26.800 --> 49:29.800\nYou got a lot of pressure now.\n\n49:29.800 --> 49:32.800\nNo, no, I'm just saying like...\n\n49:32.800 --> 49:33.800\nOh, yeah, we get it.\n\n49:33.800 --> 49:34.800\nYou love me.\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:35.800\nThank you.\n\n49:35.800 --> 49:37.800\nWhat's your name?\n\n49:37.800 --> 49:38.800\nAlex.\n\n49:38.800 --> 49:39.800\nYeah, Alex.\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:40.800\nThat's very nice.\n\n49:40.800 --> 49:42.800\nThat's my starburns name, you know.\n\n49:42.800 --> 49:43.800\nI have a double major.\n\n49:43.800 --> 49:44.800\nYou have a double major?\n\n49:44.800 --> 49:45.800\nThank you.\n\n49:45.800 --> 49:46.800\nThank you.\n\n49:46.800 --> 49:49.800\nBut we weren't talking about sucking your own dick.\n\n49:49.800 --> 49:50.800\nHe raised his hand.\n\n49:50.800 --> 49:52.800\nHow else do you think about a double major?\n\n49:52.800 --> 49:57.800\nWe were talking about it with one of your heroes, but unless it's me, it doesn't make\n\n49:57.800 --> 49:58.800\nsense.\n\n49:58.800 --> 49:59.800\nAlex, have you ever...\n\n49:59.800 --> 50:00.800\nEric, give it back.\n\n50:00.800 --> 50:01.800\nGive it back.\n\n50:01.800 --> 50:02.800\nGive it back.\n\n50:02.800 --> 50:05.800\nHave you ever dreamed about sucking your own dick?\n\n50:05.800 --> 50:08.800\nHave you ever dreamed about sucking my dick?\n\n50:08.800 --> 50:09.800\nYes, you have.\n\n50:09.800 --> 50:10.800\nYes, and yes.\n\n50:10.800 --> 50:11.800\nAll right.\n\n50:11.800 --> 50:12.800\nOkay.\n\n50:12.800 --> 50:15.800\nSee, for me, the real double whammy is having a flying dream about sucking my own dick.\n\n50:15.800 --> 50:16.800\nOh, my God.\n\n50:16.800 --> 50:17.800\nThat would be amazing.\n\n50:17.800 --> 50:18.800\nThat would be too much.\n\n50:18.800 --> 50:20.800\nThat seems very non-aerodynamic.\n\n50:20.800 --> 50:22.800\nThat's the dream you have right before you die.\n\n50:22.800 --> 50:23.800\nExactly.\n\n50:23.800 --> 50:27.800\nYou're flying along with a superman, and you're like, oh, I'm turned on, and you double\n\n50:27.800 --> 50:30.800\nover to suck your dick, and you become just a rock and fall.\n\n50:30.800 --> 50:33.800\nYou become Sonic the Hedgehog, don't you?\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:40.800\nSo are you now periscoping because you always make fun of me and you say you're Facebook\n\n50:40.800 --> 50:41.800\nLive-ing?\n\n50:41.800 --> 50:43.800\nYeah, I switched over to Facebook Live.\n\n50:43.800 --> 50:44.800\nYeah, why don't you yell at them?\n\n50:44.800 --> 50:47.800\nDo you know this person, or did you just enlist this person to hold your periscope?\n\n50:47.800 --> 50:50.800\nHe's just a super nice guy, right, sir?\n\n50:50.800 --> 50:51.800\nSuper nice guy.\n\n50:51.800 --> 50:52.800\nSuper nice guy.\n\n50:52.800 --> 50:53.800\nPeriscope yourself.\n\n50:53.800 --> 50:54.800\nGuys.\n\n50:54.800 --> 50:55.800\nUgh.\n\n50:55.800 --> 50:56.800\nFacebook Live.\n\n50:56.800 --> 50:57.800\nFacebook Live.\n\n50:57.800 --> 50:59.800\nWait, so you just put it back on us.\n\n50:59.800 --> 51:00.800\nThank you.\n\n51:00.800 --> 51:05.800\nDo you think, I mean, would it feel, would it, we always make that joke, like, oh, if\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:06.800\nwe could, if a guy could get-\n\n51:06.800 --> 51:08.800\nIt would be the best bowl job in the world.\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:09.800\nAnd would it-\n\n51:09.800 --> 51:10.800\nDo you know exactly, it's like masturbating.\n\n51:10.800 --> 51:11.800\nYou know exactly-\n\n51:11.800 --> 51:12.800\nAnd would we be like, I'm like-\n\n51:12.800 --> 51:17.800\nSomeone once described giving someone else a hand job as brushing someone else's teeth.\n\n51:17.800 --> 51:18.800\nWhat?\n\n51:18.800 --> 51:23.800\nYou're just holding the fucking phone.\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:26.800\nDon't want me, you cunt.\n\n51:26.800 --> 51:31.800\nYeah, but you, you bring up the exact, I mean, this is in support of my, my counterpoint,\n\n51:31.800 --> 51:36.800\nwhich is that we can touch ourselves with our hands, and, and that's precisely why it's\n\n51:36.800 --> 51:39.800\nactually a lot more interesting when someone else touches us.\n\n51:39.800 --> 51:42.800\nIt's interesting, but not as good.\n\n51:42.800 --> 51:46.800\nWell, they, they don't know how to do it before work.\n\n51:46.800 --> 51:47.800\nYou know, like-\n\n51:47.800 --> 51:49.800\nYou're like, oh, phony, phony.\n\n51:49.800 --> 51:53.800\nBut, but that's kind of what makes them so good at it.\n\n51:53.800 --> 51:56.800\nI don't know, on a Saturday afternoon, like it's just like, hey-\n\n51:56.800 --> 51:59.800\nI guess maybe you're into like, oh wow, yeah, this is bad.\n\n51:59.800 --> 52:00.800\nIt's like not me.\n\n52:00.800 --> 52:05.800\nBut bad is clumsy and clumsy is feeling around and figuring it out and figuring it out is\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:10.800\nfun and like, like, like, like utility is just like, like, okay, yeah, I know how to sneeze.\n\n52:10.800 --> 52:11.800\nI don't have that kind of time.\n\n52:11.800 --> 52:12.800\nI'm on the go.\n\n52:12.800 --> 52:13.800\nI know, but it's-\n\n52:13.800 --> 52:15.800\nBut well, so I'm just wondering, I mean, like, I don't-\n\n52:15.800 --> 52:16.800\nYou're on the go.\n\n52:16.800 --> 52:18.800\nWhen I have a lot of drinking to do.\n\n52:18.800 --> 52:23.800\nWhen another person is touching me sexually, I'm not sitting there thinking, this is great,\n\n52:23.800 --> 52:25.800\nbut I wish they, I wish they'd get out of here.\n\n52:25.800 --> 52:27.800\nThat's the difference between me and you.\n\n52:27.800 --> 52:29.800\nSo I could, so I could just like take over.\n\n52:29.800 --> 52:33.800\nUnless things are going so horribly bad, either emotionally or physically, that it's like,\n\n52:33.800 --> 52:38.800\nthat's when you know, if you're like, oh my God, I'd rather, rather be alone right now.\n\n52:38.800 --> 52:44.800\nBut, but, but usually, even, even a person you're not terribly fond of, or, or isn't\n\n52:44.800 --> 52:50.800\neven that great at it, like it's still better than, than another night of Minecraft breaks.\n\n52:50.800 --> 52:57.800\nLouis once told me he woke up from, he woke up from like a sleep and his hand was asleep\n\n52:57.800 --> 53:00.800\nand he hadn't been with a girl for a long time, so he just put it on his dick.\n\n53:00.800 --> 53:01.800\nRight.\n\n53:01.800 --> 53:02.800\nTo make it feel like someone different.\n\n53:02.800 --> 53:03.800\nYeah.\n\n53:03.800 --> 53:04.800\nYeah.\n\n53:04.800 --> 53:08.800\nIt's like the, the dirty Sanchez, the stranger, the, the, make your hand go to sleep.\n\n53:08.800 --> 53:09.800\nYeah.\n\n53:09.800 --> 53:10.800\nI was sitting with, what's his name?\n\n53:10.800 --> 53:11.800\nHis dad.\n\n53:11.800 --> 53:16.800\nC.C. DeVille from Poison. I was at the Viper Room in C.C. DeVille from Poison.\n\n53:16.800 --> 53:19.800\nI don't know how this came up, but he's like, yeah, Jeff, you ever tried the stranger?\n\n53:19.800 --> 53:20.800\nOh God.\n\n53:20.800 --> 53:21.800\nI mean, this is what I'm saying.\n\n53:21.800 --> 53:22.800\nLike, what are we doing?\n\n53:22.800 --> 53:23.800\nWhat is this?\n\n53:23.800 --> 53:24.800\nIs this a normal thing?\n\n53:24.800 --> 53:25.800\nYeah.\n\n53:25.800 --> 53:26.800\nNo, on sixth grade playgrounds.\n\n53:26.800 --> 53:28.800\nYes, it's a normal thing on sixth grade playgrounds.\n\n53:28.800 --> 53:29.800\nThe stranger.\n\n53:29.800 --> 53:30.800\nIt's like, that's what I said.\n\n53:30.800 --> 53:32.800\nThe dirty Sanchez, it's like, this is just, what is this?\n\n53:32.800 --> 53:33.800\nAll right, I didn't know.\n\n53:33.800 --> 53:34.800\nWe're just talking about.\n\n53:34.800 --> 53:35.800\nI didn't know.\n\n53:35.800 --> 53:36.800\nI don't yell at me.\n\n53:36.800 --> 53:37.800\nI didn't know.\n\n53:37.800 --> 53:38.800\nI'm not yelling.\n\n53:38.800 --> 53:41.800\nNo, it's not, it's not a thing that people actually do.\n\n53:41.800 --> 53:43.800\nHere's some rules again.\n\n53:43.800 --> 53:45.800\nC.C. DeVille says he did it.\n\n53:45.800 --> 53:46.800\nHe's lying.\n\n53:46.800 --> 53:47.800\nHe's making a bad joke.\n\n53:47.800 --> 53:49.800\nHe said he got me through more than one lonely night, Jeff.\n\n53:49.800 --> 53:53.800\nHe was trying to make you laugh because he was insecure that he was hanging out with a comic.\n\n53:53.800 --> 53:54.800\nOh, all right.\n\n53:54.800 --> 53:55.800\nHe was trying to be funny.\n\n53:55.800 --> 53:57.800\nAre you saying that C.C. is a liar?\n\n53:57.800 --> 53:58.800\nYeah.\n\n53:58.800 --> 53:59.800\nI'm going to bring him on the show.\n\n53:59.800 --> 54:01.800\nWe're going to get to the bottom of this.\n\n54:01.800 --> 54:02.800\nGreat.\n\n54:02.800 --> 54:05.800\nWell, can he not bring three friends and gas masks?\n\n54:05.800 --> 54:09.800\nOh, we got to the bottom of it.\n\n54:09.800 --> 54:16.800\nAnd can there just be less fucking shit to fucking take care of?\n\n54:16.800 --> 54:19.800\nThis is one of the worst comic talks ever, right?\n\n54:19.800 --> 54:22.800\nI think Mercury is in retrograde.\n\n54:22.800 --> 54:23.800\nMercury is in retrograde.\n\n54:23.800 --> 54:26.800\nBut you seem a little more edgy than I've seen you.\n\n54:26.800 --> 54:28.800\nI've been in a bad mood most of the night.\n\n54:28.800 --> 54:29.800\nI've had a really good week.\n\n54:29.800 --> 54:31.800\nI've been having a really good couple of weeks.\n\n54:31.800 --> 54:33.800\nWas it the text about Andy getting here?\n\n54:33.800 --> 54:34.800\nOr did that put you in a bad mood?\n\n54:34.800 --> 54:35.800\nNo, everything.\n\n54:35.800 --> 54:36.800\nWhat was that text?\n\n54:36.800 --> 54:38.800\nEver since I woke up in a bad mood.\n\n54:38.800 --> 54:39.800\nWhat was that text?\n\n54:39.800 --> 54:41.800\nWe'll talk about it.\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:45.800\nI woke up in a bad mood.\n\n54:45.800 --> 54:46.800\nWe can read those.\n\n54:46.800 --> 54:47.800\nDo you want to read that conversation?\n\n54:47.800 --> 54:48.800\nThat might be kind of funny.\n\n54:48.800 --> 54:51.800\nWell, let's go in order, Dan.\n\n54:51.800 --> 54:52.800\nWhy did you wake up in a bad mood?\n\n54:52.800 --> 54:53.800\nI don't know.\n\n54:53.800 --> 54:56.800\nWell, I think it's just because it's been an extraordinarily fun weekend.\n\n54:56.800 --> 54:59.800\nWe had a great, like, Star Wars Halloween party.\n\n54:59.800 --> 55:00.800\nWe hung out.\n\n55:00.800 --> 55:02.800\nLike, it's just been good in general.\n\n55:02.800 --> 55:04.800\nI've just been very happy dreaming of flying\n\n55:04.800 --> 55:07.800\nand having a great time hanging out with Cody and stuff.\n\n55:07.800 --> 55:10.800\nAnd weekends especially are like guilt-free, hangout time.\n\n55:10.800 --> 55:12.800\nAnd now tomorrow's Monday.\n\n55:12.800 --> 55:13.800\nAnd I just woke up in a bad mood.\n\n55:13.800 --> 55:15.800\nSo I was like, oh, tomorrow's Monday.\n\n55:15.800 --> 55:16.800\nI'm going to do the show tonight.\n\n55:16.800 --> 55:18.800\nAnd then I'm going to get out of that.\n\n55:18.800 --> 55:19.800\nAnd I'm going to be tired.\n\n55:19.800 --> 55:20.800\nAnd I'm still going to have work to do.\n\n55:20.800 --> 55:21.800\nAnd I'm going to get up in the morning.\n\n55:21.800 --> 55:22.800\nAnd it's just like...\n\n55:22.800 --> 55:23.800\nI hate that you live for the weekend.\n\n55:23.800 --> 55:25.800\nYou used to not be like that.\n\n55:25.800 --> 55:28.800\nDo you look forward to doing a lot?\n\n55:28.800 --> 55:31.800\nDo you look forward to doing this show?\n\n55:31.800 --> 55:32.800\nIt's fine.\n\n55:32.800 --> 55:36.800\nBut I enjoy doing the show.\n\n55:36.800 --> 55:37.800\nBut when...\n\n55:37.800 --> 55:40.800\nAnd I don't want to have deadlines anymore.\n\n55:40.800 --> 55:41.800\nAnd then what do you do on Monday?\n\n55:41.800 --> 55:44.800\nI don't really know what's up in your life these days.\n\n55:44.800 --> 55:45.800\nWell, I don't even...\n\n55:45.800 --> 55:47.800\nThat's part of the reason I'm in a bad mood\n\n55:47.800 --> 55:51.800\nis because it's shit that I can't even vent about.\n\n55:51.800 --> 55:53.800\nAre you doing a new show right now?\n\n55:53.800 --> 55:55.800\nIt's shit I can't even go into detail about.\n\n55:55.800 --> 55:56.800\nYou can't even talk about it.\n\n55:56.800 --> 55:58.800\nBecause it's either violating an NDA\n\n55:58.800 --> 56:00.800\nor it's pissing somebody off or all this shit.\n\n56:00.800 --> 56:02.800\nAnd I just want out of that situation\n\n56:02.800 --> 56:04.800\nwhere I can just be myself and be like...\n\n56:04.800 --> 56:05.800\nI can just go,\n\n56:05.800 --> 56:08.800\nGood day, bad day, bad day, here's why.\n\n56:08.800 --> 56:09.800\nGood day, here's why.\n\n56:09.800 --> 56:10.800\nBut I can't...\n\n56:10.800 --> 56:12.800\nI'm not bitching about it.\n\n56:12.800 --> 56:13.800\nI'm certainly not.\n\n56:13.800 --> 56:17.800\nDid you enjoy the Star Burns Halloween Party?\n\n56:17.800 --> 56:18.800\nYes.\n\n56:18.800 --> 56:19.800\nWhere Dana's band performed?\n\n56:19.800 --> 56:20.800\nYes, I loved it.\n\n56:20.800 --> 56:21.800\nVery much.\n\n56:21.800 --> 56:23.800\nThat's part of why I'm so cranky this morning.\n\n56:23.800 --> 56:24.800\nBecause it was a fun weekend.\n\n56:24.800 --> 56:26.800\nI was living my life the way I wish it always was.\n\n56:26.800 --> 56:30.800\nYou were literally dressed as Ferris Bueller who had a day off.\n\n56:30.800 --> 56:31.800\nYes.\n\n56:31.800 --> 56:32.800\nYes.\n\n56:32.800 --> 56:34.800\nAll right.\n\n56:34.800 --> 56:37.800\nSo, and then today, this shit starts.\n\n56:37.800 --> 56:38.800\nAll right.\n\n56:38.800 --> 56:39.800\nWell, so...\n\n56:39.800 --> 56:40.800\nOkay, here's...\n\n56:40.800 --> 56:41.800\nI started it.\n\n56:41.800 --> 56:42.800\nWait, which thread is it?\n\n56:42.800 --> 56:43.800\nIs it...\n\n56:43.800 --> 56:45.800\nIt says...\n\n56:45.800 --> 56:48.800\nDustin, Steve, Dan and Dina.\n\n56:48.800 --> 56:49.800\nDustin, Steve and Dina.\n\n56:49.800 --> 56:50.800\nSteve and Dina.\n\n56:50.800 --> 56:51.800\nOkay, good, good.\n\n56:51.800 --> 56:53.800\nShould Spencer read Spencer part?\n\n56:53.800 --> 56:54.800\nSo you guys want to just take it?\n\n56:54.800 --> 56:56.800\nWhy am I not in this group text?\n\n56:56.800 --> 56:59.800\nBecause we're trying to fool you.\n\n56:59.800 --> 57:02.800\nIf Andy texts you guys about when the show starts tomorrow,\n\n57:02.800 --> 57:04.800\ntell him seven.\n\n57:04.800 --> 57:05.800\nOkay.\n\n57:05.800 --> 57:06.800\nFair.\n\n57:06.800 --> 57:07.800\nThat's okay.\n\n57:07.800 --> 57:09.800\nI'm okay with that.\n\n57:09.800 --> 57:10.800\nSo far, so good.\n\n57:10.800 --> 57:11.800\nThat's me.\n\n57:11.800 --> 57:12.800\nI like...\n\n57:12.800 --> 57:15.800\nBecause you want me to do that, right?\n\n57:15.800 --> 57:16.800\nYes.\n\n57:16.800 --> 57:17.800\nSo then Steve Levy texts.\n\n57:17.800 --> 57:19.800\nI'm slightly retarded.\n\n57:19.800 --> 57:21.800\nThis is yesterday at 8 p.m.\n\n57:21.800 --> 57:25.800\nSo Dina texts that, Steve Levy texts, ha, ha, okay.\n\n57:25.800 --> 57:26.800\nAnd then Dan...\n\n57:26.800 --> 57:27.800\nAnd I text...\n\n57:27.800 --> 57:29.800\nBecause I'm learning to use stickers.\n\n57:29.800 --> 57:30.800\nFeel the burn.\n\n57:30.800 --> 57:31.800\nAnd...\n\n57:31.800 --> 57:34.800\nLike it's just a feel the burn sticker.\n\n57:34.800 --> 57:36.800\nBecause it's the first one I learned to use.\n\n57:36.800 --> 57:40.800\nAnd then someone put a Mario hat sticker over that.\n\n57:40.800 --> 57:41.800\nAnd then I put a pumpkin over that.\n\n57:41.800 --> 57:46.800\nAnd then someone put a Mario mustache and a nose over that.\n\n57:46.800 --> 57:48.800\nAnyway, there's a lot of stickers after that.\n\n57:48.800 --> 57:49.800\nYeah.\n\n57:49.800 --> 57:53.800\nAnd then today I wrote with an exclamation mark.\n\n57:53.800 --> 57:55.800\nRemember seven.\n\n57:55.800 --> 57:57.800\nBecause this is after I texted Andy and I said...\n\n57:57.800 --> 57:58.800\nBut in the meantime...\n\n57:58.800 --> 57:59.800\nBe there at seven.\n\n57:59.800 --> 58:01.800\nI texted at Ken Bone.\n\n58:01.800 --> 58:05.800\nRemember seven exclamation points.\n\n58:05.800 --> 58:07.800\nAnd Steve Levy said, got it.\n\n58:07.800 --> 58:11.800\nAnd then today at 3.21 p.m. Dino said...\n\n58:11.800 --> 58:16.800\nCan I sing a song tonight so I can plug our band's show on November 4th?\n\n58:16.800 --> 58:18.800\nI didn't write November 4th, but I'm adding that.\n\n58:18.800 --> 58:19.800\nIs your band here?\n\n58:19.800 --> 58:20.800\nIs your band here?\n\n58:20.800 --> 58:21.800\nI.O.'s here.\n\n58:21.800 --> 58:23.800\nOh, then yes, I hope you do.\n\n58:23.800 --> 58:24.800\nAnd I texted, do.\n\n58:24.800 --> 58:25.800\nYep.\n\n58:25.800 --> 58:28.800\nBecause I texted yep, but it auto corrected it to do for some reason.\n\n58:28.800 --> 58:29.800\nBrown booze.\n\n58:29.800 --> 58:30.800\nDo, yep.\n\n58:30.800 --> 58:34.800\nAnd then Steve Levy, I think, put a sticker over that of a horse with a mohawk playing guitar.\n\n58:34.800 --> 58:35.800\nThat's animated.\n\n58:35.800 --> 58:36.800\nSee, I don't have that.\n\n58:36.800 --> 58:37.800\nI don't have the right I.O.S.\n\n58:37.800 --> 58:40.800\nAnd I said thanks and who's drinking at the drawing room now?\n\n58:40.800 --> 58:44.800\nAnd I texted a Henry Winkler as the Fonz giving a thumbs up.\n\n58:44.800 --> 58:51.800\nBecause I, because I had texted do and then yep, and then I typed yep into the sticker\n\n58:51.800 --> 58:56.800\nthing and came up with stickers when you get, when you're saying yep.\n\n58:56.800 --> 58:59.800\nAnd so it's a Fonz going like that.\n\n58:59.800 --> 59:01.800\nSo far, so far, things are pretty friendly.\n\n59:01.800 --> 59:02.800\nEverything, everyone's getting along.\n\n59:02.800 --> 59:04.800\nPretty friendly so far.\n\n59:04.800 --> 59:05.800\nThis is act one.\n\n59:05.800 --> 59:06.800\nYeah.\n\n59:06.800 --> 59:09.800\nThere's a lot of stuff about my guitar and which one I should bring that we don't have\n\n59:09.800 --> 59:10.800\nto get into.\n\n59:10.800 --> 59:11.800\nWhy not?\n\n59:11.800 --> 59:14.800\nIt's going to be a very strange turn.\n\n59:14.800 --> 59:17.800\nWell, I don't know about strange, but it's about you.\n\n59:17.800 --> 59:18.800\nIt's about you.\n\n59:18.800 --> 59:19.800\nIs it mean?\n\n59:19.800 --> 59:20.800\nIt's about you.\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:21.800\nIs it going to be mean?\n\n59:21.800 --> 59:22.800\nShould I leave now?\n\n59:22.800 --> 59:23.800\nNo.\n\n59:23.800 --> 59:24.800\nDon't.\n\n59:24.800 --> 59:25.800\nDon't leave now.\n\n59:25.800 --> 59:29.800\nBut don't, but, but if you, but if you stay, don't, don't interrupt.\n\n59:29.800 --> 59:31.800\nThere's this.\n\n59:31.800 --> 59:33.800\nSo then, so then Dino says.\n\n59:33.800 --> 59:38.800\nI say, Dustin or Steve, is it better to bring an acoustic or can I plug in an electric?\n\n59:38.800 --> 59:40.800\nAnd then, and then, and then you.\n\n59:40.800 --> 59:43.800\nI put a period and then I panicked and.\n\n59:43.800 --> 59:47.800\nAdded a question mark, which, which makes it look like you're looking at your watch waiting\n\n59:47.800 --> 59:48.800\nfor an answer.\n\n59:48.800 --> 59:51.800\nBut I just didn't want you to think I was dumb.\n\n59:51.800 --> 59:54.800\nSteve, Steve Levy texted acoustic is better.\n\n59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.300\nAnd then you said, okay, Steve Levy said, if I had to guess, and then Dustin, who's in\n\n01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.800\nthe conversation the whole time says.\n\n01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800\nAcoustic.\n\n01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800\nAcoustic.\n\n01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800\nWhat is this sticker witchery?\n\n01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800\nWhy have I fallen off as a millennial?\n\n01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.800\nAnd then I texted a grumpy old man in a ball pit.\n\n01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.800\nThat's hilarious.\n\n01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800\nIn a ball pit.\n\n01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800\nYeah.\n\n01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800\nIt's a grumpy, it's a grumpy old person in a.\n\n01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.800\nIt looks like a lady.\n\n01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.800\nBecause that's a Dustin.\n\n01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:26.800\nI typed in like, get with it old man into like a sticker thing.\n\n01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.800\nAnd then, and then, and then I said, that's you.\n\n01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.800\nAnd I wrote ha ha ha.\n\n01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.800\nExclamation mark.\n\n01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800\nCause I don't do LOL.\n\n01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800\nAnd then Dustin wrote, this is insane.\n\n01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.800\nAnd then, okay.\n\n01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800\nSo now I think we should skip over a lot of this.\n\n01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800\nIt becomes a lot of stickers.\n\n01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.800\nCause people are now learning.\n\n01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.800\nOh, Frankenstein's there.\n\n01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800\nYeah.\n\n01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.800\nGina says, look like I need to renew my telephone.\n\n01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.800\nAnd there's like a cheese pizza dancing around it with a wizard cap.\n\n01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.800\nAnd then I put Steve Levy's head.\n\n01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.800\nAnd then Steve Levy says, Dino, Andy just asked me what time the show is.\n\n01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.800\nDo I really say seven?\n\n01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.800\nI don't like lying.\n\n01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800\nOkay.\n\n01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800\nSo act two.\n\n01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.800\nRight.\n\n01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.800\nSo Dustin says, yes, three exclamation points.\n\n01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.800\nHe will probably still be 30 late.\n\n01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800\nSo Steve says, okay.\n\n01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:18.800\nAnd I say, because I love my Levy, I say, but why not tell the truth and let him either\n\n01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.800\nbecome a better person or go fuck himself?\n\n01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.800\nAnd then, and then I, and then I, and then I realized I'm using the wrong language.\n\n01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.800\nAnd I say, or forget even better person.\n\n01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.800\nIt's like he's late.\n\n01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800\nHe misses the show.\n\n01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800\nWho cares?\n\n01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800\nYou know?\n\n01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800\nYeah.\n\n01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800\nAnd Dustin.\n\n01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800\nAndy, I think fair.\n\n01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.800\nSo all fair.\n\n01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.800\nIt's a bad habit.\n\n01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800\nNot a bad person.\n\n01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.800\nSteve Levy says, I'll split the difference and tell him we get to the green room at 730.\n\n01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.800\nI said, that seems truthy enough.\n\n01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.800\nDino says he wants.\n\n01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.800\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800\nGo ahead.\n\n01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800\nHe wants to be lied to.\n\n01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.800\nHe told me, which is true.\n\n01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.800\nRight.\n\n01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.800\nAnd Dustin says, Dino is his wrangler.\n\n01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.800\nAnd I said, fine, leave us out of it.\n\n01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800\nYeah.\n\n01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.800\nAnd I, and I pictured it with that tone of voice too.\n\n01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800\nYeah.\n\n01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.800\nAnd then, and then Dustin says, I'll text him.\n\n01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.800\nAnd I said, my Levy, no like he lie.\n\n01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.800\nThat's my only stake in this.\n\n01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.800\nI love my son.\n\n01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.800\nSteve Levy says, I already told him we all meet in the green room at 730.\n\n01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.800\nDustin says, and everyone on this thread is a bad person besides Levy.\n\n01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:28.800\nAnd I wrote, I told him seven, but I knew he'd ask you too.\n\n01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.800\nAnd then Dustin sends a gif of the Lion King cub.\n\n01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.800\nStarting out happy, but getting sad.\n\n01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800\nBut then looking confused and sad, I think.\n\n01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.800\nAnd then, and then, and then a, and then a, is that a middle finger to Levy or just a number one?\n\n01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800\nI'm too old.\n\n01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.800\nSo then Dino says, it's not a lie if he likes it.\n\n01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.800\nJust like it's not abuse if I like it.\n\n01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.800\nJesus, you pussies.\n\n01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.800\nSo then, and then Steve sends the emoticon, the emoji that's a guy like.\n\n01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.800\nYeah, the scaredy closed teeth guy.\n\n01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.800\nYeah, that's what I use when people tell me stuff where I'm supposed to give a smiley,\n\n01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.800\nbut I use it to simulate like my kind of like autistic tendencies.\n\n01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.800\nI just like, do you want me to like tell you what I'm fishing, what you're fishing for?\n\n01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.800\nSo by the way, I'm writing all this while I'm driving.\n\n01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.800\nSo I'm not really reading everything correctly.\n\n01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.800\nSo I say, so now Levy lies and he'll, and he'll be late.\n\n01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.800\nAnd Steve Levy says, I didn't lie.\n\n01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.800\nAnd I say, I just go by high maintenance and low maintenance.\n\n01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.800\nSo one, I don't expect you guys to ever let us complicate such a simple matter for you ever again.\n\n01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.800\nAnd two, Andy can't be on the show anymore.\n\n01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.800\nEven the guy in the wheelchair just says, I'm in a wheelchair and has a guy that helps him.\n\n01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.800\nWe don't have to pretend he has legs and shit.\n\n01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.800\nI haven't even done anything yet.\n\n01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.800\nWell, you did a whole life's work of things.\n\n01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.800\nSo then I say, fine, more songs for me.\n\n01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800\nExactly, I say.\n\n01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.800\nAnd then Dustin says, understood and agreed.\n\n01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.800\nAnd you also, the only podcaster has never been later canceled the show.\n\n01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800\nHe says a bunch of stuff that's nice about me.\n\n01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.800\nAnd then I say, I've never been later canceled.\n\n01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.800\nAnd he says also true redacted. And then he says, thank you and whatever.\n\n01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800\nAnd all this.\n\n01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.800\nAnd remember, the only thing I did is what time.\n\n01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.800\nAnd then they said, we all meet at 7 30 in the green room.\n\n01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.800\nAnd you've been late for the last 30 years.\n\n01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.800\nWhat time did you get here tonight?\n\n01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800\n7 30.\n\n01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.800\nAnd I was late for the first day.\n\n01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800\nNo one else is here.\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.800\nAnd here.\n\n01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.800\n7 30 in the green.\n\n01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800\nWe're not done.\n\n01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.800\nOh, there's more.\n\n01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.800\nYou know, tries the last word and says, I will say this.\n\n01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800\nI will say this.\n\n01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.800\nA guy in a wheelchair appreciates a ramp.\n\n01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.800\nAnd Andy appreciates being tricked into being on time.\n\n01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800\nYes.\n\n01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800\nYou had my back the whole time.\n\n01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.800\nThank you.\n\n01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.800\nMaybe I should have said that from the beginning.\n\n01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.800\nAnd I said, you were saying the whole time you didn't fail to make it clear.\n\n01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.800\nNor has Andy ever failed to make it clear that Andy needs everyone around him to become either dishonest or insane.\n\n01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.800\nIt's just not as easy for some of us to cross that threshold.\n\n01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:20.800\nThat's Levy's ramp and building it profits me more.\n\n01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.800\nAnd then you say, I forget that we don't need all that stuff right now.\n\n01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.800\nI think the only person I like in the story is Andy Dick.\n\n01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.800\nHe's the only victim.\n\n01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.800\nIt was an argument about accessibility.\n\n01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800\nThank you.\n\n01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800\nThanks for having my back the whole time.\n\n01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800\nDid I?\n\n01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800\nYes.\n\n01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800\nOh, okay.\n\n01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800\nI can't remember.\n\n01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800\nThat was years ago.\n\n01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800\nHe was here at 7.30 a lot.\n\n01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.800\nBut I was here afterward.\n\n01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.800\nI just got off a plane and I drove straight to the drawing room because you guys said that you were both there.\n\n01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.800\nOr that you guys were talking about being there.\n\n01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800\nI get there.\n\n01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.800\nDino showed me these texts and I said, it sounds like Dan might be in a kind of a grumpy mood today.\n\n01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.800\nLike I didn't sound like the good mood Dan that you've been in like for the last little while.\n\n01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800\nYeah.\n\n01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.800\nSo I was right about that.\n\n01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.800\nYep.\n\n01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.800\nBut that was just because you have the Sunday night blues because it's a school night.\n\n01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800\nYeah.\n\n01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.800\nSo everything I'm filtering through like fuck everybody.\n\n01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.800\nAnd it sounds like you really were just mad at me.\n\n01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800\nNo, I'm not just mad at you.\n\n01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800\nWell, you were.\n\n01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800\nAnd I apologize.\n\n01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800\nI even apologize.\n\n01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.800\nI was yelling at Dino for like telling us how to treat you.\n\n01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800\nI know.\n\n01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.800\nThat is weird.\n\n01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.800\nI wasn't.\n\n01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800\nI was like, don't fucking.\n\n01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800\nI mean, I appreciate it.\n\n01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800\nBut it is weird.\n\n01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.800\nAnd I'd be lying if I said 90% of the shit doesn't start on.\n\n01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800\nWe're like an old married couple.\n\n01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800\nWe're like really.\n\n01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800\nYou're so protective and sweet.\n\n01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.800\nI don't think we're a married couple.\n\n01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.800\nI don't think you're like my child and grandmother at the same time.\n\n01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.800\nAnd most of the shit starts on Twitter with strangers because I'm like in the middle of\n\n01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.800\nsomething with fucking strangers because I'll like.\n\n01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.800\nNow we're getting to the bottom of it.\n\n01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.800\nI'll tweet a link to an article and I'll be like, this guy did a good job writing this\n\n01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.800\nand being thought and making people happy with trying to give us a different angle on\n\n01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800\nit.\n\n01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.800\nAnd there's always one person that's just like some guy like like tweeted and responded\n\n01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.800\nwith like, oh yeah, it's a really interesting except he forgot to mention they're all racist.\n\n01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.800\nAnd I was like, so read it again.\n\n01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.800\nYou never fucking read it.\n\n01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.800\nAnd then he's like, I did read it again.\n\n01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.800\nAfter reading again, I think a big boo boo boo.\n\n01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.800\nAnd I was just like fucking with that.\n\n01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.800\nI was arguing with that guy all day like in my head.\n\n01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.800\nI was just like, you're a fucking piece of shit.\n\n01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.800\nLike how can you use the word racist the way racist use the word race?\n\n01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.800\nLike you're fucking like being like what was it?\n\n01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.800\nIt was an article about how the reason why the country is like going into the shitter is\n\n01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:34.800\nbecause we long ago like we fucking like we just constructed it this way.\n\n01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.800\nThere's all these rural people perceive all the people in all the cities as being like\n\n01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.800\nout of our fucking minds with no idea how reality works and vice versa.\n\n01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.800\nAnd it was just this article written from a typical midwesterner who became a comedy\n\n01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.800\nwriter who's like, look, I would be one of those people if I hadn't successfully fled\n\n01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:58.800\nto one of the, you know, hunger games metropolises where I started dressing funny and understanding\n\n01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.800\nthat edamame tastes good. I'm putting words in his mouth. It was from that perspective.\n\n01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.800\nIt was very thoughtful and very like funny and very concise.\n\n01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.800\nIt was just kind of like breaking down our mythology as a nation and how that is why it comes to this.\n\n01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.800\nThat is why when we scratch our heads and go like, oh shit, we got to, you know,\n\n01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.800\nthis is how a bunch of like fucking factory working white people all of a sudden see\n\n01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.800\nthemselves as underdogs and it's not all of a sudden and this is all happens.\n\n01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.800\nAnd it's just like, yeah, but you forgot they're racist.\n\n01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.800\nI'm like, that's going to solve everything. That's fucking great.\n\n01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.800\nSo they were born racist? Is there a fucking vapor in the, like, that's as dumb as\n\n01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.800\ninciting with the split as anything else. It's never going to solve anything.\n\n01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.800\nI just like hate that shit. You know that guy didn't read the fucking article.\n\n01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.800\nAll he's doing is expressing a fucking need to be attention.\n\n01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.800\nIt's like, he couldn't, oh, I'm not going to be a sycophant and just say, oh, it's a great article\n\n01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.800\nand I'm not going to read it. That's for sure. I'm going to scan the headline\n\n01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.800\nand then I'm going to fucking barf this shit up because I want to be smart today.\n\n01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.800\nI was like, everyone wants to be smart. Fucking grow up, you dick. I got shit to do.\n\n01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.800\nDon't fucking like, everybody else just didn't say anything or didn't read it\n\n01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.800\nor didn't, you don't have to fucking do shit. You don't have to fucking respond.\n\n01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.800\nYou don't have to respond. Stop responding. You don't have to respond.\n\n01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.800\nBlinking cursors cost nothing when you're making a web API.\n\n01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.800\nThat's why they provided for you. They don't actually think you have anything of value to say.\n\n01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.800\nAnd you don't a lot. You don't. Just say you're happy or sad.\n\n01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:33.800\nUse your I statements. I am sad, glad, happy, scared, jealous.\n\n01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.800\nI hope. I fear. No one can argue with their feelings.\n\n01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.800\nThey will love you if you feel it and express it.\n\n01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.800\nBut then you say shit. Forty-five percent of the police,\n\n01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:53.800\nif they ever said it, you don't know anything.\n\n01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:58.800\nYou're not a scientist. You're not Nova. You're just racist or not racist.\n\n01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.800\nYou're just a fucking dickhead. Stop knowing shit and just feel something.\n\n01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.800\nJust say, I'm scared. Everyone will be like, oh my God, he's scared.\n\n01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:21.800\nYou make a good point. Remind me never, never.\n\n01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:29.800\nJust remind me never to ask you for any favor ever.\n\n01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:37.800\nDid that trick trip your bad mood or that triggered you to get into the state?\n\n01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.800\nI got shit that I'm not doing that I need to be doing so I feel like a bad person.\n\n01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.800\nSo I wake up hating myself. I wake up going, fuck, I fucked up again.\n\n01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.800\nI got shit to do. You need more blowjob dreams.\n\n01:10:51.800 --> 01:11:03.800\nReal quick, I just have this ability to not engage in people that might upset me like that.\n\n01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.800\nYeah, you're probably like the king of this.\n\n01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:15.800\nI just don't engage. I think, is it possible that as a tactic to put things off\n\n01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.800\nand not do whatever this secret thing is you're going to be doing tomorrow,\n\n01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:27.800\ndo you engage with that because you know there's no point in that and cookie collecting and everything else.\n\n01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:37.800\nYes, yes, yes. I play games that are designed to suck my time and that is a thing I used to suck my passion.\n\n01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.800\nYou're so overworked that Steve Levy is afraid, like this is a story from the other day,\n\n01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.800\nhe was afraid to come up to you and just sign a few papers and he's like, sorry Dan,\n\n01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.800\ncan you just sign a few things and you were sitting back and playing a video game\n\n01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.800\nand he's like, do you mind signing a few of these and you said, well I'm not going to lean over.\n\n01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:06.800\nLike he put them right there and they had to move them like three inches closer.\n\n01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.800\nOh my God.\n\n01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:22.800\nCitizen Kane, you're much like pundits who read rap lyrics aloud on CNN.\n\n01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.800\nYou're leaving out my self-awareness.\n\n01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.800\nI'm willing to hear that and we talked about it, but I had to go for the laugh.\n\n01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.800\nI know, but it's like, but then someone goes like, what a gross monster you are.\n\n01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.800\nI'm like, well, yeah, but it was funny.\n\n01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:43.800\nI asked him in the car later, I'm like, that was kind of supposed to be a joke, right?\n\n01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.800\nAnd he's like, yeah, it's a joke.\n\n01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.800\nI was very serious about refusing to lean forward.\n\n01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.800\nI have a political stance about it.\n\n01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.800\nNo, I was like, what the sincere part of it was that I was letting him know,\n\n01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.800\nbecause he was saying, is this a bad time?\n\n01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.800\nAnd I was like, well, I'm not going to say it's a bad time because I'm playing a video game,\n\n01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.800\nbut I will be just honest and say, I don't want to fucking like,\n\n01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.800\nhonestly, I'm like being a big fat pig right now.\n\n01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.800\nAnd I can't say that I'm fighting inner city crime.\n\n01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.800\nSo it's not a bad time.\n\n01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.800\nI'm not feeding the hungry.\n\n01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.800\nI just am so fat and so sad and tired.\n\n01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.800\nHere's what's going to happen and here's what's not going to happen.\n\n01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.800\nI wasn't like Scott Rudin throwing an ashtray and going like, stop making me lean forward.\n\n01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.800\nFrom now on, no leaning.\n\n01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.800\nI'm so glad most of us are sad and tired.\n\n01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.800\nJeff, you can learn a few things from this.\n\n01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.800\nMr. Everything's Great.\n\n01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.800\nIt is.\n\n01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.800\nYou know my secret?\n\n01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.800\nAll that core work of leaning over and sucking my own dick.\n\n01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.800\nYeah, that's the price I pay.\n\n01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800\nI'm not going to leave for it.\n\n01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.800\nSo even in my dreams, I never get to suck my own dick.\n\n01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.800\nIt starts with a simple action and then your dreams get bigger.\n\n01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.800\nYou're like, Dan, will you suck your own dick?\n\n01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.800\nWell, I'm not going to lean over.\n\n01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800\nI'm going to have to.\n\n01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.800\nI don't know what else I can do for me.\n\n01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.800\nThe dick is going to have to move the mountain to Muhammad.\n\n01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800\nI like a typical midwesterner.\n\n01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.800\nI then take that information and I go,\n\n01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.800\nand probably if you sucked it too much, it'd stop meaning anything.\n\n01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.800\nThat's kind of the Wisconsin why I'm not living in California argument.\n\n01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.800\nYeah, wow.\n\n01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.800\nThose guys are going to fall in the ocean.\n\n01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.800\nYou can't go out to a place where the freeways are four lanes wide,\n\n01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800\nwhere everyone speaks Spanish.\n\n01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800\nYou're going to die out there.\n\n01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.800\nI'll stay right here and freeze to death.\n\n01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.800\nI'm happy.\n\n01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.800\nI can't feel my fingers because I'm deliriously happy.\n\n01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:55.800\nYou got a big shrugger.\n\n01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.800\nYou got a big shrugger in the front row.\n\n01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.800\nIt just took my attention a little bit.\n\n01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.800\nIt's probably a skull juice fan.\n\n01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800\nDan, what can we do?\n\n01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.800\nMaybe the answer is nothing because you have to...\n\n01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800\nTo cheer me up.\n\n01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800\nIf you've got this burden, I know how that feels.\n\n01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.800\nI get panicked if I have to go pick up my dry cleaning in the morning.\n\n01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.800\nI have a bad night's sleep.\n\n01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.800\nI think we have to just sell the studio.\n\n01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.800\nWe just got to go away.\n\n01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800\nNo, you don't understand.\n\n01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.800\nAll the shit that you're thinking of running the studio stuff,\n\n01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.800\nit's the shit that's up to actually me.\n\n01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.800\nIt's my old life where I'm like,\n\n01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800\noh, I'm supposed to be a Jedi.\n\n01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.800\nHere's where I pick up a lightsaber and do the thing I'm supposed to be good at.\n\n01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.800\nMy therapist said,\n\n01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.800\nI told her the story of how I was block-rating.\n\n01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800\nThat's one thing.\n\n01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.800\nShe was like,\n\n01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.800\nso in other words, the old Dan,\n\n01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.800\nthat guy doesn't work anymore.\n\n01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800\nYou can't just say,\n\n01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.800\nI'll take that and I'll be back.\n\n01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.800\nI'm going to write it.\n\n01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.800\nThat guy was dying season six of Community.\n\n01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.800\nThat's why the season wasn't much better than five or three or anything like that.\n\n01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.800\nAnd yet I was still setting records sleeping on my couch\n\n01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800\nbecause it was like,\n\n01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.800\nwhy is this show so hard?\n\n01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.800\nThat fuel tank was empty of like,\n\n01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.800\noh, I'm a torture genius and all this stuff.\n\n01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.800\nAnd the guy who's delegating to people\n\n01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.800\nand collaborating with people during normal working hours\n\n01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.800\nand then spending his time at home in bed being happy watching Netflix,\n\n01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.800\nthat guy is fine and doing well\n\n01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.800\nand has a bunch of things to do,\n\n01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.800\nbut that guy works it all into his schedule.\n\n01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.800\nBut then the fucking dumb asshole that was like,\n\n01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.800\nI'll write this one.\n\n01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.800\nI'm like, you're never fucking idiot.\n\n01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.800\nEvery time I either run into you\n\n01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.800\nor hear about what's going on with you,\n\n01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.800\nyou have 9,000 projects going on right now.\n\n01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.800\nI give a lot of stuff.\n\n01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.800\nFor me, any one of those things would be enough\n\n01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800\nto make me have bad sleep.\n\n01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.800\nYeah, so I...\n\n01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.800\nI mean, I'm a lazy guy because like,\n\n01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.800\nliterally, if I have to...\n\n01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.800\nall I have to do is get in the plane tomorrow\n\n01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.800\nand go do improvisation somewhere\n\n01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.800\nwhere I don't have to carry any gear\n\n01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.800\nor do any rehearsal or know anything\n\n01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.800\nand can be half drunk.\n\n01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.800\nI still have anxiety dreams about missing the plane.\n\n01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.800\nI actually have anxiety when I wake up\n\n01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.800\nand I'm like, God, I have to be at the drawing room at 12.\n\n01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.800\nSeriously.\n\n01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.800\nAre you serious?\n\n01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800\nYeah, like, I'm like, I got to get there by 12.\n\n01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800\nBecause they miss you, you think, or what?\n\n01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.800\nI just need... I love being there.\n\n01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.800\nBut why do you feel like you have to be there?\n\n01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.800\nBecause 12 was when they threw out all the people\n\n01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800\nthat got there at 6\n\n01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.800\nwho would do a coke on their own.\n\n01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.800\nYeah, I mean, it's a good... it's a sweet spot time.\n\n01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.800\nIt's really...\n\n01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.800\nBy policy, because now there's so many after hours.\n\n01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.800\nI don't know if it's about them,\n\n01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.800\nalthough I do feel like they like me.\n\n01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.800\nThey do love you. They love you.\n\n01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.800\nBut the old days of the old alcoholics\n\n01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:47.800\nthat used to go in there,\n\n01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.800\nsome of them have dropped dead.\n\n01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.800\nSome of them have left town.\n\n01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.800\nYeah, I remember going to the funeral\n\n01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.800\nof the first one that dropped dead.\n\n01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.800\nIt was heavy because I was like,\n\n01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.800\nokay, you know, we talked a lot\n\n01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.800\nand I had some funny stories.\n\n01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:02.800\nWho are you talking about?\n\n01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800\nIt's this guy you won't even remember.\n\n01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800\nHe was at the rustic... not that old.\n\n01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.800\nI felt like about my age back then.\n\n01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.800\nYeah, and he would always come in\n\n01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.800\nand drink a glass of wine\n\n01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.800\nand tell funny stories\n\n01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.800\nand I remember having a lot of funny stories about him\n\n01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.800\nand I thought, I'll go there\n\n01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.800\nand tell his family, you know.\n\n01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.800\nAnd I go to the funeral\n\n01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.800\nand everyone's crying\n\n01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.800\nand his body's there\n\n01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.800\nand then I hear,\n\n01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.800\noh yeah, he just drank too much\n\n01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.800\nand all my stories are from the rustic inn,\n\n01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.800\nthe bar.\n\n01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.800\nSo I felt like I'd have to walk up and say,\n\n01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.800\nyeah, I was his drinking buddy, you know.\n\n01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.800\nThe guy, I helped kill him.\n\n01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.800\nSo I just kind of like,\n\n01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800\njust backed up and walked out of the church\n\n01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.800\nand went home.\n\n01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800\nI didn't meet anyone.\n\n01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.800\nBut you stopped going to the rustic\n\n01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.800\nand now you go to the drying room.\n\n01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.800\nYeah, not because of him though, but...\n\n01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.800\nHow many people from the bar's funerals\n\n01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.800\nhave you not even gone to,\n\n01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.800\nbut just known have happened?\n\n01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.800\nOh, well yeah, I guess at this point,\n\n01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.800\nlike 10, 12, yeah.\n\n01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.800\nI only went to the first one though.\n\n01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.800\nBut I guess if we hung out at a laundromat,\n\n01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.800\nwe'd have 12 laundromat funerals.\n\n01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800\nThere's one guy that I've been going to...\n\n01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.800\nEspecially if people drank the laundry detergent.\n\n01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.800\nWe can't be blamed for that.\n\n01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.800\nI just turned 43,\n\n01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.800\nbut I think I've been going to the drying room,\n\n01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.800\nlike a rustic, like near when I was on a fake ID.\n\n01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800\nThat's how long.\n\n01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.800\nAnd there was a guy that I thought was going to be dead\n\n01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.800\nin a year or two back then.\n\n01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.800\nAnd he's still alive, but this guy has a glass eye.\n\n01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.800\nAnd one of the bartenders was there one time\n\n01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.800\nwhere he sneezed and his glass eye flew out of his head,\n\n01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.800\nwent bouncing across the bar and landed like in the well.\n\n01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.800\nAnd she found it and he was like looking around for it.\n\n01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.800\nAnd that was his good eye.\n\n01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800\nShe gave it to him in a cocktail napkin.\n\n01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.800\nHe put it in his mouth, like cleaned it up with his saliva,\n\n01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800\nstuck it back in his head.\n\n01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800\nAnd he's still with us to this day.\n\n01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.800\nHe's like, he's gonna...\n\n01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800\nReally?\n\n01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.800\nWow.\n\n01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.800\n97% of him.\n\n01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.800\nDo you know there's a guitar here?\n\n01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.800\nDo you want to...\n\n01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.800\nSure.\n\n01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.800\nDo you want to get sucked by it?\n\n01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.800\nDo I want to what?\n\n01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.800\nYou said I was going to fuck you earlier.\n\n01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.800\nOh, right.\n\n01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.800\nThat was a joke.\n\n01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.800\nBut I mean...\n\n01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.800\nIf she wants to fuck me, she can.\n\n01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.800\nI don't care.\n\n01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.800\nOh, I didn't know.\n\n01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.800\nIt was a little lady.\n\n01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.800\nWhat's her name, Dina?\n\n01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.800\nDustin, you said you were going to help me here.\n\n01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.800\nWhat happens?\n\n01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800\nDustin Marshall, everybody.\n\n01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.800\nThanks, Dustin.\n\n01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800\nWhat are the best, Dustin Marshall?\n\n01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.800\nThe only time I've ever seen Dustin not wearing his headphones\n\n01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.800\nis when he's doing the podcast.\n\n01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.800\nYou think this would be a podcast like Headphone Central?\n\n01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.800\nNo?\n\n01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.800\nNo, it needs to be connected with what's really going on.\n\n01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.800\nI don't think they're this long.\n\n01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800\nI got you.\n\n01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.800\nOr maybe Andy could be going.\n\n01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.800\nSpencer, while this is happening...\n\n01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.800\nSpencer, do you play an instrument, Spencer?\n\n01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.800\nHave you ever picked up a guitar or a piano or anything?\n\n01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.800\nOh, yeah, I play everything.\n\n01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.800\nNow, do you ever have any lessons?\n\n01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.800\nDid you ever try it?\n\n01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.800\nAndy wants to hold it.\n\n01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.800\nYeah, I teach lessons.\n\n01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800\nDid you ever have lessons?\n\n01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800\nNo, I didn't need them.\n\n01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.800\nI was just an instant genius.\n\n01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.800\nSpencer, I don't like your attitude right now.\n\n01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.800\nA lot of people don't.\n\n01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.800\nIt's intimidating.\n\n01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.800\nNo, she doesn't...\n\n01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.800\nI'm getting a lot of pushback right now.\n\n01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.800\nHowever, Spencer, I think we filled that time perfectly.\n\n01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800\nI hope so.\n\n01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800\nWe'll find out.\n\n01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.800\nSpencer and I have a new podcast called Nothing Gets Accomplished.\n\n01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.800\nEverybody stays real safe.\n\n01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.800\nI wish I had a stand.\n\n01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800\nYou want a stand?\n\n01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800\nNo, it's nice.\n\n01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800\nAndy's being very nice.\n\n01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.800\nDoes it stand right next to you?\n\n01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.800\nNo, no, Andy wants to do this.\n\n01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.800\nSo, okay, all right.\n\n01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.800\nSo, this is a song that...\n\n01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.800\nMy band, so we have a band, we have a show on...\n\n01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800\nThe reason I don't have a stand\n\n01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.800\nis because I feel like now I could turn my head.\n\n01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.800\nOkay.\n\n01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.800\nI'm on it.\n\n01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.800\nWait, can't we just...\n\n01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.800\nWhat if I hold the mic that Andy's holding?\n\n01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.800\nYeah, there's a clue in here.\n\n01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.800\nWe got it, we got it.\n\n01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.800\nWhoo!\n\n01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.800\nIt was not working out.\n\n01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.800\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.800\nAll right, so...\n\n01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.800\nDon't really laugh at this.\n\n01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.800\nHere goes, bye.\n\n01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.800\nOn November 4th...\n\n01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.800\nI keep saying November 4th,\n\n01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.800\nbut I don't know where it is.\n\n01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.800\nDo you know where it is?\n\n01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.800\nNo.\n\n01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.800\nI'll try and say it after.\n\n01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.800\nBefore you start singing,\n\n01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800\nI was going...\n\n01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.800\nI have one question for Dan Harmon.\n\n01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.800\nOh, perfect.\n\n01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.800\nI've been wanting to ask...\n\n01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.800\nThis isn't awkward.\n\n01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.800\nAll night.\n\n01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.800\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.800\nI know.\n\n01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800\nIt's...\n\n01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.800\nI just...\n\n01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.800\nThe only one that feels awkward, I think,\n\n01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.800\nis me, because this is such a great party\n\n01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.800\nand atmosphere, and he drinks,\n\n01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.800\nand you're drinking, and you're...\n\n01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.800\nAll right.\n\n01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.800\nEveryone's drinking,\n\n01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800\nand I see 40 answers.\n\n01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800\nWe should talk about that a little bit.\n\n01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800\nWell, there's no...\n\n01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.800\nI don't really need to talk about it,\n\n01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.800\nbecause I think about it all day and night,\n\n01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.800\nbut I have a question, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.800\nMaybe I've asked you before,\n\n01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.800\nbut if I did, I don't remember the answer.\n\n01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.800\nWill...\n\n01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.800\nDo you think that I will be able to,\n\n01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.800\nat some point,\n\n01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.800\nresponsibly drink again?\n\n01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.800\nWe talked about this last podcast.\n\n01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.800\nI don't remember the answer.\n\n01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.800\nNo!\n\n01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.800\nOw!\n\n01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800\nI didn't ask you.\n\n01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.800\nI got punished by just...\n\n01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800\nBy God.\n\n01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800\nI think I have my answer.\n\n01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.800\nGot my answer.\n\n01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.800\nThat's a reminder that I don't remember the words.\n\n01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800\nI wouldn't...\n\n01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.800\nI need to fix that.\n\n01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.800\nDo you need the words?\n\n01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.800\nNo, I don't need words.\n\n01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800\nNo.\n\n01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800\nWell, let's talk...\n\n01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800\nWhy don't you listen to Dino's song?\n\n01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800\nNo, let's talk about this.\n\n01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.800\nThis is more interesting.\n\n01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.800\nAnd then you can tell me after the song.\n\n01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800\nAlright, well, then I'm going to change it.\n\n01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.800\nI'm going to sing a song about drinking.\n\n01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.800\nI'm going to do it.\n\n01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.800\nOh, I never should have gone brown.\n\n01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.800\nI think I saw you on the way down.\n\n01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.800\nTurn my smile upside down.\n\n01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.800\nNever should have gone brown.\n\n01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.800\nDon't clap.\n\n01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.800\nIt really fucking throws me off.\n\n01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.800\nI'm glad you said that.\n\n01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.800\nBecause I feel so grumpy and I...\n\n01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.800\nI thought no one's going to want to take orders from me.\n\n01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\n01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.800\nNo, I wanted to say don't clap.\n\n01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800\nBecause they're doing it for the best possible world.\n\n01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.800\nThey think, well, no, they're very nice.\n\n01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.800\nThey think I'm a musician, though.\n\n01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.800\nBut then it's...\n\n01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.800\nI'm like, I don't know what to do with that.\n\n01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.800\nIt spreads through the ironic cancer of everyone going like,\n\n01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.800\nwell, if they're clapping, I should...\n\n01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800\nI want to do the right thing, too.\n\n01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.800\nAnd then it's like, oh, isn't everyone's clapping?\n\n01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.800\nYeah, and then they throw down their chairs and dance.\n\n01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.800\nI don't want that.\n\n01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800\nThat's why the worst thing, like, you go to karaoke\n\n01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.800\nand sometimes they have a tambourine.\n\n01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.800\nNo, just fucking...\n\n01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.800\nThe tambourine is a harder instrument to play\n\n01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.800\nthan you think it is.\n\n01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.800\nIt's loud and you have to have time\n\n01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800\nand you don't fucking have time.\n\n01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.800\nSo put the goddamn tambourine down.\n\n01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.800\nAll right, is there another microphone stand?\n\n01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.800\nOh, this'll be really spontaneous.\n\n01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.800\nOh, they don't even know.\n\n01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.800\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.800\nHe just wants you to not worry about it.\n\n01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800\nThank you.\n\n01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.800\nThank you, Jeff Davis.\n\n01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800\nThank you.\n\n01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:07.800\nOh, I never should have gone brown\n\n01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.800\nThink I saw you on the way down\n\n01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.800\nTurn my smile upside down\n\n01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.800\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.800\nI'm not a musician.\n\n01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.800\nJeff's doing physical comedy.\n\n01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.800\nI was like the guy in the recording booth.\n\n01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.800\nThe guy was like...\n\n01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.800\nWe've got to get more mids in the front.\n\n01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.800\nWe've got enough bottom end on this.\n\n01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.800\nDino, let's take it again. Just try and relax a bit.\n\n01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.800\nOkay, yeah.\n\n01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.800\nAll right, we're rolling.\n\n01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800\nLet's go.\n\n01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800\nIs it on?\n\n01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.800\nOne, two...\n\n01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.800\nOh, I never should have gone brown.\n\n01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.800\nLet's take it one more time from the top.\n\n01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.800\nI feel you've pushed a little hard on that one, Dino.\n\n01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.800\nI know, I know. I'm trying to get that...\n\n01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.800\nCan I get the four hertz mega thingy?\n\n01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.800\nOkay, what number are you on?\n\n01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.800\nTake three, take three, rolling.\n\n01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.800\nOh, I never should have gone brown.\n\n01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.800\nIt's supposed to be a sad song and I'm laughing.\n\n01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.800\nOh, I never should have gone...\n\n01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.800\nAre you sick of that line yet?\n\n01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:29.800\nGuess what? I never should have gone.\n\n01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.800\nAnd I know everyone's thinking Dino's a racist.\n\n01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.800\nHe's talking about black women.\n\n01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.800\nThis is not...\n\n01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800\nAll right, take 11, take 11.\n\n01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800\nComing up, take out.\n\n01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.800\nI love black women. I would kill for one.\n\n01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.800\nI just gotta quit saying nigger once in a while.\n\n01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.800\nOh, I never should have gone brown.\n\n01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.800\nDid you see me on the way down?\n\n01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:57.800\nTurn my smile upside down.\n\n01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.800\nNever should have gone brown.\n\n01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.800\nNever should have drunk from that cup.\n\n01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.800\nTurn my frown right side up.\n\n01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.800\nDo I regret it? Yup.\n\n01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.800\nNever should have drunk from that cup.\n\n01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.800\nWhen I was young, didn't need booze.\n\n01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.800\nWasn't accustomed to watch myself lose.\n\n01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.800\nBack then I had the luxury to choose.\n\n01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:34.800\nOh, brown booze.\n\n01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.800\nOh, brown booze.\n\n01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.800\nBrown booze, brown booze, brown booze.\n\n01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.800\nBrown booze, brown booze.\n\n01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.800\nBrown, brown, brown booze.\n\n01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.800\nBrown booze, brown booze.\n\n01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.800\nBrown booze, brown booze, brown booze.\n\n01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800\nBrown booze.\n\n01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.800\nOkay, that's enough.\n\n01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.800\nBrown booze.\n\n01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.800\nI deserve to be your clown.\n\n01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.800\nThink I saw you.\n\n01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.800\nI look purple.\n\n01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.800\nI was on the rocks out of town.\n\n01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.800\nNever should have gone brown.\n\n01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:29.800\nAndy Dick on the slide whistle.\n\n01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.800\nThat is the best version of that.\n\n01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.800\nI think we've got a fucking hit, mate.\n\n01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.800\nWe've got a fucking hit.\n\n01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.800\nGod damn it, I love that thing so much.\n\n01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.800\nYou really think that's it, right?\n\n01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.800\nI think it's pretty.\n\n01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:59.800\nI would say that's the funniest slide whistle has been in a hundred years.\n\n01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.800\nThat was a very good slide whistle solo.\n\n01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.800\nI agree, I agree.\n\n01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.800\nAnd also we shouted down a spontaneous...\n\n01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:11.800\nYeah, a clapping thing.\n\n01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.800\nThat was the best.\n\n01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.800\nMaybe it was perfunctory at the beginning,\n\n01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.800\nbut then when it was right and natural, that's when it came together,\n\n01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.800\nand it was a slide whistle that was the key to that fucking door.\n\n01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.800\nI know, if I can't be thrown off by that motherfucking thing,\n\n01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.800\nI gotta be thrown off by that thing.\n\n01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.800\nWe brought it home and we broke all our own rules\n\n01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.800\nin the fourth quadrant of a perfectly circular story.\n\n01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800\nDan?\n\n01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800\nCome on.\n\n01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800\nDon't worry, Andy.\n\n01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.800\nI'll explain it to you later.\n\n01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800\nYou still seem grumpy.\n\n01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.800\nThat wasn't enough to lift your spirits?\n\n01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.800\nWell, I'm in the phase now where I regret my grumpiness.\n\n01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:49.800\nI'm like, I'm steeping in shame and kind of running over the evening.\n\n01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.800\nI think this is the best Harmontown ever.\n\n01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:58.800\nDon't clap, it's throwing me off.\n\n01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.800\nWe're in that third quadrant where you tell people not to clap,\n\n01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.800\nyou're telling yourself you shouldn't have been what you're doing,\n\n01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.800\nand then there'll be some sort of release at some point, right?\n\n01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.800\nYou'll become the master of both worlds.\n\n01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.800\nYeah, I just forgot in that text conversation\n\n01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.800\nhow many people would get thrown out of the bus,\n\n01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:18.800\nincluding apparently the differently abled, like...\n\n01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.800\nYou should hear our skull juice.\n\n01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.800\nWe make fun of blind people.\n\n01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.800\nIt's hilarious.\n\n01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.800\nThat's fine.\n\n01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.800\nI don't think there's anything that should be verboten.\n\n01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.800\nI just like for my own personal tastes of how I'd like to be perceived.\n\n01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.800\nYour taste should be verboten.\n\n01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.800\nMy tastes are verboten.\n\n01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.800\nDino, Dino, so in that song,\n\n01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.800\nbecause I know you drink and you drink vodka,\n\n01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.800\nso with that song,\n\n01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:45.800\nyou feel like maybe you should never have gone brown.\n\n01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800\nYeah, I drank...\n\n01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.800\nWell, the first time I went brown, I literally...\n\n01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800\nLike tequila was.\n\n01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.800\nI have a story about it.\n\n01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800\nI have a story about it.\n\n01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800\nIt was Scotch.\n\n01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.800\nThe first time I went brown, I was at Little Dom's,\n\n01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.800\nand I wasn't joking at all during any of this.\n\n01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.800\nI got up to leave and stumbled and fell,\n\n01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800\nand

means his throat closed up and he almost died.\n\n01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.800\nI didn't know what the fuck was going on.\n\n01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.800\nAnd all his friends were going,\n\n01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.800\nyou pussy, you pussy, because he didn't know it\n\n01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.800\nbecause it wasn't a thing that was understood.\n\n01:34:41.800 -->

01:34:49.800\nI feel like Andy...\n\n01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.800\nThere's people in the world that can't drink.\n\n01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.800\nThe world isn't fair genetically.\n\n01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.800\nThis should be a new drinking game.\n\n01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.800\nGive excuses why someone shouldn't drink.\n\n01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.800\nAnd then every time Andy says,\n\n01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.800\ngives another excuse why he should,\n\n01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.800\nwe should all drink.\n\n01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.800\nI don't think Andy is allergic to alcohol.\n\n01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.800\nI think that you're allergic...\n\n01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.800\nMy throat does not close up.\n\n01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.800\nYou're allergic to being ignored is where you are.\n\n01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.800\nYour soul closes up.\n\n01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.800\nEverything closes up.\n\n01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.800\nI've seen it.\n\n01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.800\nYou're one of those folks.\n\n01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.800\nYou asked me.\n\n01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.800\nThat's my honest appraisal.\n\n01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.800\nBut you've only caught me at the tail end\n\n01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.800\nwhen things are super shitty.\n\n01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.800\nYes, you're right.\n\n01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.800\nI think he caught you at the tail head also.\n\n01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.800\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.800\nMy thing was going to be,\n\n01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.800\none drink you're not allergic to,\n\n01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.800\nit's the fourth drink that you're allergic to,\n\n01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.800\nand then you become Mr. Hyde.\n\n01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.800\nYou stop being the Andy that we like,\n\n01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.800\nand then you start becoming...\n\n01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.800\nPerfect, so I'll drink three.\n\n01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.800\nI don't want to engage just logically for that reason.\n\n01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.800\nNow we're looking towards a solution.\n\n01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.800\nThat's what I want.\n\n01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.800\nThis is what I want.\n\n01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.800\nThis is more constructive.\n\n01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.800\nI think I could do things like that.\n\n01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:08.800\nI'm so proud of you right now,\n\n01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:09.800\nbecause I know that you were doing a bit,\n\n01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.800\nthat you know how funny it is,\n\n01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.800\nand I know it's coming from an actual pain of how much you wish\n\n01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.800\nthat you could have a drink.\n\n01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.800\nI used to smoke, and sometimes I miss smoking,\n\n01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800\nand different people do different shit,\n\n01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.800\nand some of those people can do things,\n\n01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.800\nand I meet people who can smoke one cigarette at a party\n\n01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.800\nonce a month when they've had three cocktails,\n\n01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.800\nand then you meet other people who have a hollow leg\n\n01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.800\nwith drinking, and other people who have...\n\n01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.800\nYou meet people who have high cholesterol,\n\n01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800\nno matter how much oat brand they eat,\n\n01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800\nand it's just not fucking fair.\n\n01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.800\nBut it's not about getting all fucked up or anything.\n\n01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.800\nYou know that feeling that you have after one glass of wine,\n\n01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.800\nor a couple of vodka's, or whatever it is,\n\n01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.800\nand then there's just more...\n\n01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.800\nIt's a warm drink.\n\n01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:43.800\nI know, you miss it, but I'm just saying.\n\n01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.800\nIt's the reason why you drink,\n\n01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800\nthe same reason I would drink, and I love it.\n\n01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.800\nBut then once that...\n\n01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800\nBut that's why I'm proud of you,\n\n01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:50.800\nbecause you miss it that much,\n\n01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:51.800\nand you're able to have self-awareness,\n\n01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.800\nand you know you're doing a bit right now called...\n\n01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.800\nI'm not doing a bit.\n\n01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.800\nI know you're not lying.\n\n01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.800\nI'm just saying you're drawing humor from the fact that you have...\n\n01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800\nHe's not even smiling.\n\n01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.800\nThat you have that craving.\n\n01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.800\nThis is deadly, sir.\n\n01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.800\nIt's frightening.\n\n01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.800\nI thought I could come to you.\n\n01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.800\nI thought you would have an answer.\n\n01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:08.800\nYes, I'm sorry.\n\n01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.800\nThe answer I'm looking for,\n\n01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.800\nsomething about where I can drink again.\n\n01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.800\nBut Andy, is this a bad time to plug my band's show?\n\n01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.800\nWhere's it at, by the way?\n\n01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.800\nIt's at the California Institute of Abnormals.\n\n01:37:21.800 -->

Dino, your dark-haired...\n\n01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.800\nAndy, you're quite blond.\n\n01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.800\nAndy has a huge cock.\n\n01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:04.800\nDino...\n\n01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.800\nDino's cock is known as the quarter inch of chaos.\n\n01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.800\nChaos!\n\n01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:20.800\nI mean, Dino, you drink, and you have a hollow leg, and Andy, you stop drinking.\n\n01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:23.800\nBut also, one of you has a beard, and one of you is very well-shaven.\n\n01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.800\nWhich is which?\n\n01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.800\nI'm just saying, Dan, it's time to shoehorn one of our ads into a garbage dump.\n\n01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.800\nI really fell for it.\n\n01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.800\nIs it opposites underwear?\n\n01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.800\nIt's that razor thing.\n\n01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:41.800\nDollar Shave Club, they give you razors.\n\n01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.800\nThey deliver them to

just so excited I never have to deal with that razor for the kid.\n\n01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.800\nHi, Spencer.\n\n01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.800\nHey, guys.\n\n01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.800\nI'd like to talk about Dollar Shave Club 2.\n\n01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.800\nBecause I'm a little baby razor.\n\n01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.800\nBaby razor, what do you have to say?\n\n01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.800\nWell, I'm glad you asked.\n\n01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.800\nYo, baby razor in the house.\n\n01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.800\nI shave more than a mouse, because they don't have a lot of hair,\n\n01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.800\nor a lot of surface area.\n\n01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.800\nOn their bodies.\n\n01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.800\nI'm gonna shave so much.\n\n01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.800\nI got body dotties.\n\n01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:52.800\nI went to Dollar Shave Club dot com slash Harmontown.\n\n01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.800\nThey sent me a box that brought my shaving around.\n\n01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.800\nI got some cream and some blades, and I ran them down my face,\n\n01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:01.800\nand didn't get aids.\n\n01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.800\nThat's not a selling point.\n\n01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.800\nYou can see how the alternative would be a...\n\n01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.800\nDollar Shave Club promises you won't get aids.\n\n01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.800\n100% aids.\n\n01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800\nAt least for the first time.\n\n01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800\nOr your money back.\n\n01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.800\nI don't even have to check on that.\n\n01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.800\nYeah, we checked the...\n\n01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.800\nThere's the fact-checking department.\n\n01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.800\nYeah, they said that's fine.\n\n01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.800\nThey can back that up.\n\n01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.800\nYou won't get...\n\n01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.800\nThey'll give you your money back if...\n\n01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.800\nIf you get aids from the...\n\n01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.800\nYo, let me see if I can do this better.\n\n01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:54.800\nBecause I'm sleepier, so I can take longer to rhyme words.\n\n01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.800\nMy name is Sleepy Rapper.\n\n01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.800\nI am like a flapper.\n\n01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.800\nI'm from the 20s, and I am free.\n\n01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.800\nI wanna shave with me.\n\n01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:11.800\nWith me?\n\n01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.800\nThat took so long to get there.\n\n01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:21.800\nYou had eight full seconds to think of a better rhyme.\n\n01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.800\nWhat a shave with me.\n\n01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.800\nFirst I run the blade down the left cheek,\n\n01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:29.800\nThen I go up my albums, I will take a peek.\n\n01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.800\nI go around the chain, uh-oh,\n\n01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.800\nI didn't get cut though,\n\n01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.800\nCause I went to save club though.\n\n01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.800\nIf this episode isn't called, I wanna shave with me.\n\n01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.800\nI'm gonna be really mad.\n\n01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.800\nDollar saved with me,\n\n01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.800\nI got a dollar saved club,\n\n01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.800\nSaving eyes can be.\n\n01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.800\nFirst, my face had too much hair,\n\n01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.800\nAnd I got a box and I went over there,\n\n01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:57.800\nAnd I took the blade,\n\n01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:59.800\nAnd I put the cream on my face,\n\n01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.800\nNow I'm running around,\n\n01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.800\nNow I'm running around,\n\n01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.800\nSmooth smooth-ass face,\n\n01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.800\nSmooth face,\n\n01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.800\nNo matter what race,\n\n01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.800\nIf I'm Asian or Caucasian,\n\n01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.800\nOr if I'm brown and Mexican,\n\n01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.800\nI got a smooth face,\n\n01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.800\nNo matter what my race,\n\n01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.800\nNo matter what my gender,\n\n01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.800\nNo matter what my race,\n\n01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.800\nCause it's a poly, polymorphous word.\n\n01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.800\nWith race, with race, with race, with race.\n\n01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.800\nWell, alright, alright.\n\n01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:40.800\nWell, give me some acoustic guitar to go with.\n\n01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.800\nI'm really good at this.\n\n01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:47.800\nYo.\n\n01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.800\nYo.\n\n01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.800\nYo.\n\n01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.800\nDollar saved club is the thing for me,\n\n01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.800\nI got a box last week and I'm saving as can be.\n\n01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.800\nGot a straight razor or a jillet,\n\n01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.800\nProbably not.\n\n01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.800\nI don't use those brands I bet,\n\n01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:18.440\nBut if you put their cream on your cheeks, you can walk around for seven weeks without\n\n01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:22.040\nany hair growing, but that's not guaranteed.\n\n01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:28.240\nBut if you get age, all your money will be retrieved few.\n\n01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:37.800\nGo to dollarshaveclub.com slash Armand Town, your first month is free.\n\n01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:43.840\nI think it's a pretty bold stance that it's the only online razor company that guarantees\n\n01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.960\nyou won't get age from their products.\n\n01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:50.960\nI mean, oh, I thought they would guarantee you'd never get AIDS ever.\n\n01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.800\nWell, they're still working on that.\n\n01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:55.800\nOkay.\n\n01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.160\nRight now, they're just guaranteeing that their products are AIDS-free.\n\n01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160\nYeah, that's not that good, but okay.\n\n01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.360\nMaybe I'll buy them.\n\n01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.960\nI mean, Gillette, those other razor companies, they test on animals, like that's where you\n\n01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:10.960\nget the AIDS.\n\n01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:14.520\nI'm not sure, and I think Gillette actually guarantees you get AIDS, right?\n\n01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:21.160\nGillette says roll the dice.\n\n01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.920\nThat's why their slogan is the best a man can get.\n\n01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.400\nThey're like, look, you're in God's crosshairs when you wake up in the morning.\n\n01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.480\nYou think we're going to make that better for you or a fucking razor company?\n\n01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.080\nThis is it.\n\n01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.040\nThis is the life you didn't choose.\n\n01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.080\nWe make things that cut people and make people bleed, and so fucking, what do you want from\n\n01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.080\nus?\n\n01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:47.840\nYou should be honored to know us, the only people in the razor business that aren't making\n\n01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:48.840\nweapons.\n\n01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.560\nWe're not saying Gillette gives you AIDS.\n\n01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.480\nWe're saying they don't care if you get it or not.\n\n01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.160\nNo, we do care a lot, but we can't prevent you getting it.\n\n01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.160\nOh, are you Gillette?\n\n01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:00.160\nYeah, I'm Gillette.\n\n01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160\nI'm the Gillette spokesman.\n\n01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.840\nWho are you, Andy?\n\n01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:08.240\nDo you think Gillette, when they test the razors on animals and do we know that they\n\n01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:09.240\ndo?\n\n01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:21.360\nThat they shave a whole monkey, and then what would a bald, fully bald monkey look like\n\n01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.360\nme?\n\n01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:29.200\nI happen to know the answer to this, Andy.\n\n01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:33.480\nThey only have to shave three, eight inch strips off of a monkey.\n\n01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.760\nBy their balls or what?\n\n01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.760\nWhich part?\n\n01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:37.760\nAny part.\n\n01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.120\nDoes the shaver get to pick?\n\n01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:41.120\nThe shaver gets to pick?\n\n01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.000\nI'm looking for a job.\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.240\nWhy not work for Dollar Shave Club?\n\n01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.520\nWell, they don't have AIDS there.\n\n01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.560\nWhat's the fun?\n\n01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.200\nIs your guys' shave company the one that...\n\n01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.200\nAre you reaching for America right now?\n\n01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.200\nRight now?\n\n01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:59.320\nYes.\n\n01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:06.160\nWhen I hear at the end, I think I've heard them say, do you know why we are able to provide\n\n01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.360\nrazors so cheaply?\n\n01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.640\nAnd then the answer is, because we own the factory.\n\n01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.640\nIs that right?\n\n01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.640\nIs that right?\n\n01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:14.640\nIs that the same company?\n\n01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.640\nI think that's a different company.\n\n01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.040\nYeah, what a weird brag.\n\n01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.280\nThat's their thing.\n\n01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.280\nIs that the same one?\n\n01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.280\nWe exploit everyone.\n\n01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.280\nI don't think so.\n\n01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.600\nI think that's a company that I don't want to say.\n\n01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600\nSo there's competing...\n\n01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.600\nI guess there are.\n\n01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.960\nNowadays competing companies because beards are so...\n\n01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:34.880\nI have a question that's not on our copy.\n\n01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:40.720\nIt's very male-centric with the executive blade and for guys who get this movie.\n\n01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720\nIs it for ladies, too?\n\n01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.720\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.720\nAre there other...\n\n01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.920\nA woman uses a Dollar Shave...\n\n01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:46.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.920\nYou do.\n\n01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.760\nHave you ever gotten AIDS?\n\n01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:58.760\nThey're satisfied customers.\n\n01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:01.160\nOh, no.\n\n01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.160\nDollar Shave?\n\n01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.160\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.160\nAnd they're 11th, AIDS-free month.\n\n01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.160\nI will say that.\n\n01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.240\nI mean, you change like shit, but you don't get AIDS.\n\n01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.320\nCan I say this in a meta, in a...\n\n01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.320\nJust be meta for...\n\n01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.120\nAre we not meta enough right now?\n\n01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.040\nAt the risk of alienating our relationship with a sponsor, just to speak outside the\n\n01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:26.840\nbox as a person who... Their copy is so... It's not very... They don't have a lot of\n\n01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:31.540\ninformation out there that's really brings the fucking nitty-gritty.\n\n01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:33.040\nThey really do just say...\n\n01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.040\nDo what you want.\n\n01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.040\nWe'll say what you want.\n\n01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.040\nI'm sure there's like...\n\n01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.560\nMeundies is like, look, here's the deal and it lays everything out.\n\n01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.640\nThey've thought about this.\n\n01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.440\nWhy should I order underwear from a box and I just want the Dollar Shave people?\n\n01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440\nNo, they're confident.\n\n01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:47.440\nOr, okay.\n\n01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.440\nOr lazy.\n\n01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440\nBut they're confident.\n\n01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440\nThen why are they buying underwear?\n\n01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440\nWho's the guy out there?\n\n01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.840\nWhat's your name madam out there who uses Dollar Shave club razors?\n\n01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:55.840\nI'm Michelle.\n\n01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.840\nMichelle?\n\n01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:57.840\nAnd you order these online?\n\n01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.840\nI do.\n\n01:48:58.840 --> 01:48:59.840\nBecause of Harmontown or previously?\n\n01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.840\nIt's been a year or two.\n\n01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:01.840\nReally?\n\n01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:02.840\nWhere do you shave exactly?\n\n01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:03.840\nNo, I have a reason.\n\n01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:04.840\nCan you unzip my pants, Andy?\n\n01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:05.840\nOh boy.\n\n01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:06.840\nNo, no, seriously.\n\n01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.840\nDina, Dina, don't trump her.\n\n01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.840\nLet's...\n\n01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:09.840\nAll right, hear it.\n\n01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:17.840\nBut you enjoy... are they good?\n\n01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.560\nI've never used one.\n\n01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.040\nYou think after three weeks or more of doing ads for these people that I would be kind\n\n01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.240\nof a member of the Dollar Shave club?\n\n01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.840\nOh, they haven't sent you anything?\n\n01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.840\nThey haven't sent me shit.\n\n01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:31.840\nThey sent it to Dan.\n\n01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:35.240\nI have a box they sent to me, but what am I going to do here?\n\n01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.960\nWell, give some to Jeff.\n\n01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.880\nIf I shave, I'm going to look like the worst advertisement for humanity, let alone a shaving\n\n01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.880\nclub.\n\n01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:42.880\nWell, you come get my box.\n\n01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:43.880\nI will say this.\n\n01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.800\nSince we started doing these ads, Gillette sent me a bag of AIDS, and I thought...\n\n01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.520\nNow that's a good Ad for Dollar Shave Club.\n\n01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.360\nNow we've done our bit.\n\n01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360\nWe should just start...\n\n01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.960\nYeah, let's just start swiftboating Gillette.\n\n01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:04.400\nWhy couldn't that be the last sentence in this fucking podcast?\n\n01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:10.160\nWe'll get back to your drinking momentarily.\n\n01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.640\nIt's all going to be okay.\n\n01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.640\nDon't shame me.\n\n01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.640\nHe was giving a creative note.\n\n01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.640\nHe was saying that would have been a good ending.\n\n01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.480\nGillette gave me a bag of AIDS.\n\n01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:23.840\nGood night, everybody.\n\n01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.640\nWe'll meet you at the lawsuit.\n\n01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.640\nOur next show...\n\n01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.520\nI'm not saying that Gillette...\n\n01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.920\nThey just said Gillette on the return address, it could have been anybody.\n\n01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.120\nIt could have been Penn Gillette.\n\n01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:44.200\nIt could have been people from Dollar Shave Club, in the same way that the Republican\n\n01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:49.960\nheadquarter has got firebombed, probably by Republicans.\n\n01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:55.400\nI'm not saying Dollar Shave Club goes out and sabotages Gillette by sending you AIDS\n\n01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.160\nin the mail, but the jury is still out on that.\n\n01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:05.160\nWhat do you feel about the very well understood and very impressive democratic response of\n\n01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:11.000\nflooding in money and going, here's democratic money to repair your place?\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.400\nThat also doesn't make it seem like Democrats didn't fire...\n\n01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.400\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:16.400\nIf that's your...\n\n01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.680\nDoesn't it seem like that's that effort to go...\n\n01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:22.880\nI know it's like, yes, because we're the party that believes in charity.\n\n01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.680\nI don't want to say charity, but look, your place got firebombed.\n\n01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.840\nHere's some money, but that kind of does make it seem, doesn't it?\n\n01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:36.040\nI'm not saying the people that are sending money bombed at the...\n\n01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.040\nYou're right.\n\n01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.040\nI am drunk.\n\n01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.040\nI don't understand.\n\n01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.240\nDoesn't it make it seem like Democrats bombed it when all of the Democrats go, and here's\n\n01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.240\nsome money?\n\n01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.120\nIt's kind of like, that would be a such a fuck you move.\n\n01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.440\nThere's a set fire to the place, and then go, why don't you get yourself a new fucking\n\n01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.440\nplace too?\n\n01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.440\nYeah.\n\n01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.440\nGo ahead.\n\n01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.440\nGo

I thought he was a girl, but I was pleasantly surprised my curiosity was stirred\n\n01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.080\nI talked to a transvestite and she told me where he worked\n\n01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:04.760\nOh\n\n01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.760\nThat's it down\n\n01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:10.560\nDon't stand up for all those things you stood before\n\n01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.480\nDon't stand up for any of that bullshit anymore\n\n01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:18.640\nDon't stand up.

I guess they were always there. I\n\n01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:58.880\nMade him do bad things. I made him be my slave and I would punish him when he misbehaved\n\n01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.680\nThen he and I would switch cuz it was all just a game\n\n01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.080\nDad sit down\n\n01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.960\nDon't stand up for all those things stood before\n\n01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.400\nDon't stand up for any of that bullshit anymore\n\n01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.600\nDon't stand up.
