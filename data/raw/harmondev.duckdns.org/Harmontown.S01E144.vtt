WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the Nerds Outdater, Harmontown is now in session.

00:14.000 --> 00:26.000
Please welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Harmonious Monk himself, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
Now I never wanna see somebody from where you get me.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
That was nice, did the Beatles give us some music?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.920
Do you know who that is?

00:44.920 --> 00:46.920
Titanic Sinclair.

00:46.920 --> 00:52.480
That's our friend Titanic Sinclair from Fibble Dibbles.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.800
From Frisbee Golf and the fuck around trio.

00:57.800 --> 01:08.720
Hardcore Harmontown fans will remember the Titanic and Mars Visigoth.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
What's the name?

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
Mars Argo.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
Mars Visigoth.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.760
That was a really early stuff.

01:15.760 --> 01:20.920
The lovely Mars Argo and Titanic were on our show when they released that song.

01:20.920 --> 01:25.160
It became an unintentional internet sensation because it used the iPhone's default ring

01:25.160 --> 01:27.560
tone as like a melody.

01:27.560 --> 01:32.560
And some people were just like, I hope you die in fire.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
What's up?

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
That was the USS Hooper.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.560
Ah!

01:35.560 --> 01:36.560
Adam Goldberg.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.160
Adam Goldberg's back.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.520
Was that the earliest we've been Goldberg'd in the show?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.320
Well, he wanted us to know.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.320
He wanted us to know.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.320
I'm back, baby.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.320
Adam, come on.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.040
Get up here and give us a...

01:51.040 --> 01:53.080
Hello, brother.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.560
Oh!

01:54.560 --> 01:56.620
Wait.

01:56.620 --> 02:08.880
Thin eyes Goldberg.

02:08.880 --> 02:13.200
Goldberg came up, he pressed the flesh, he did a little dance, so that was really nice.

02:13.200 --> 02:20.840
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, but no presence makes it grow unfound faster than...

02:20.840 --> 02:26.880
Sounds like a group sequel.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.560
You do hear, Adam, the conflicted response of what we invite you up.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.560
They love it.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.240
I would call it right down the middle of happiness and sadness.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.240
Sounds like we're life-lives.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.240
Well, I'm happy.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.240
I missed you.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.240
I thought you were...

02:39.240 --> 02:40.240
I thought you were...

02:40.240 --> 02:41.240
I assumed you had gone.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.240
You're a young man.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.240
People go through phases.

02:43.240 --> 02:48.760
Maybe you exited the phase of total masochism and sadism.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.560
Yeah, I was right.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.240
That middle line between happiness and sadness, as someone said.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
I don't...

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
Right.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.240
Jeff?

02:57.240 --> 02:58.240
Was it...

02:58.240 --> 02:59.240
I'm thinking it was a J.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
So, what have you been up to?

03:00.240 --> 03:02.600
Yeah, give us the Goldberg news.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.240
What's going down?

03:04.240 --> 03:07.240
Business is good at my web company, Adam Goldberg's web company.

03:07.240 --> 03:12.680
I'm not going to bring shame onto that web company by associating myself with it, which

03:12.680 --> 03:17.560
is a self-hating thing to say, but it turns out, you know, the Minecraft server that's

03:17.560 --> 03:22.000
dedicated to Harmontown, they burned me alive.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.360
I was burned in effigy.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
So, that's what happened to me.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.680
I was having a nice life.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.800
I was in a wrestling-based RPG.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.240
I was getting drunk for Passover.

03:30.240 --> 03:36.240
I was doing as one does, and then it turns out people burned a symbol of me alive to

03:36.240 --> 03:44.240
represent how much they want to play Minecraft with you, which is weird.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.840
So they made, like, out of blocks.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.840
They made it.

03:46.840 --> 03:52.440
Yeah, wooden Adam Goldberg to represent a guy from a podcast, and then they sent me on

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
virtual fire.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.440
Did it resemble you?

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
Did they make a little...

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
I didn't go there.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.440
I'm not...

03:57.440 --> 03:59.520
I don't think I'd be very welcome on a server that would burn a picture of me.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.600
So, how did you find out this information?

04:01.600 --> 04:06.680
They posted it publicly, and I just... not a lot of upvotes, and the weird thing is,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.120
a lot of people didn't attend.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.120
It's like...

04:09.120 --> 04:14.520
Like, there was a huge thing to have a Goldberg roast, not like a fun comedic roast, which

04:14.520 --> 04:16.600
only happens when I throw one for myself.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.000
An actual Salem roast.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.920
Yeah, an actual... burn the representation of a guy who talks, and that's bad, so Jesus

04:25.920 --> 04:26.920
Christ.

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
How you been, Deno?

04:27.920 --> 04:28.920
I've been good.

04:28.920 --> 04:29.920
Did you see the...

04:29.920 --> 04:31.640
I don't even know, can't follow you on Twitter.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
Did you see the Justin...

04:32.640 --> 04:37.640
I blocked you.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.000
I blocked Adam.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Not on Instagram, though.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.240
While we're talking about ratios, that was just the aggressive side of passive.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.880
That middle line between aggressive...

04:48.880 --> 04:52.240
All right, well, let's see how tonight goes, and then...

04:52.240 --> 04:53.240
All right.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.240
I'm not...

04:54.240 --> 04:55.240
Are you on the fence now?

04:55.240 --> 04:59.480
Of course, I've been regretful since the day I blocked you.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.280
I knew I did it in anger.

05:01.280 --> 05:05.560
I legitimately wanted to know what point you were making when you said, now that everyone's...

05:05.560 --> 05:09.080
When millennials were eight years old, they said everyone was going to be a millennial

05:09.080 --> 05:12.200
now that they've grown up, everyone's eight years old.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.280
Do you feel like everyone's eight years old, and what does that mean?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.200
Well, that's not...

05:17.200 --> 05:18.320
That wasn't what I...

05:18.320 --> 05:20.120
We didn't say everyone...

05:20.120 --> 05:21.120
We said...

05:21.120 --> 05:22.120
Well, what?

05:22.120 --> 05:23.960
The children were the future, or whatever.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.800
When millennials were children, we said they were the future, and now that they're grown

05:26.800 --> 05:29.520
up, sure enough, we're all eight years old.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.520
Get it?

05:30.520 --> 05:31.520
No.

05:31.520 --> 05:37.320
Because they're thumb-sucking, team-playing, Superman fans.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.040
As opposed to...

05:39.040 --> 05:46.640
As opposed to awesome, sardonic, needlessly rebellious, aging Gen Xers, who understand

05:46.640 --> 05:52.520
back pain and being outnumbered 10 to 1 by the generations before and after us, and who

05:52.520 --> 05:57.800
admire people who kill themselves instead of people who become president.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
Yeah, that was weird.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.120
Justin was weird last week.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.600
That was a lot of, is he, was he going to, is he...

06:03.600 --> 06:05.840
Justin will never, ever, ever.

06:05.840 --> 06:12.360
Justin would put a gun in his mouth, and his ego would shoot it across the room.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.800
The ego would just eat the bullet.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.120
Yeah, the bullet would just get absorbed.

06:18.120 --> 06:23.200
He would do a bit with the gun, having a silly voice, and that would be...

06:23.200 --> 06:28.040
I don't want to lay down the gauntlet, though, and if you are thinking about it, share those

06:28.040 --> 06:29.360
thoughts with people.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.400
Tell other people, because you would be surprised how many people get to that point in your

06:33.400 --> 06:38.720
life where it's darker than it is light, you know, and you're on the line between sadness

06:38.720 --> 06:40.480
and happiness, and you're not seeing...

06:40.480 --> 06:41.480
Oh, no!

06:41.480 --> 06:44.960
I'm trying to be joyful about it, and not be depressing, but it's...

06:44.960 --> 06:45.960
Adam, you've never...

06:45.960 --> 06:49.040
I've seen you a whole lot of shit, and there are other people going through exactly what

06:49.040 --> 06:54.320
you've gone through who want to show you the better side of an existence, and if you say

06:54.320 --> 06:58.200
no to that existence, you're not going to see all the greatness that's going to unfurl

06:58.200 --> 06:59.200
for you.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.200
Hmm.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.720
But, but, yes, but also you should...

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
Yeah, life!

07:02.720 --> 07:05.400
A scattered applause for the concept of life.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.560
Listen, let's enjoy a rare Adam Goldberg applause break.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.520
That was, that was, that was very interesting.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.520
Why is the guy...

07:13.520 --> 07:16.800
Why is the guy I call shitty so shitty?

07:16.800 --> 07:17.800
Why is this...

07:17.800 --> 07:19.800
Oops, it's trying to cover that up.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.200
Why, you just, you just stepped in your own applause breaks.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.640
That was, that was very well said, but I, as a guy who's researched this, because when

07:26.640 --> 07:30.640
I was responding to people on Tumblr, I started to worry, but I wanted to do it right and

07:30.640 --> 07:31.640
not wrong.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.640
I didn't want anything to blow back.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.520
I mean, talking to kids who are sometimes saying like, I have these thoughts.

07:35.520 --> 07:41.640
So I, so I did a lot of Googling as a responsible person does, and, and, and I, the other thing

07:41.640 --> 07:46.320
that, that people, that people should know who have these thoughts is that, you know,

07:46.320 --> 07:50.920
the, I think the big mistake that people currently not having those thoughts make when counseling

07:50.920 --> 07:56.680
them is using logic to try to like, no one wants to be argued out of these, these feelings.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.040
Like they want to be able to share them without repercussion.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.760
You can't think your way to clarity because the brain is the brain.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.320
It kind of, it takes all the processing power that you would use to make really logical

08:08.320 --> 08:09.320
arguments.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.320
And it's why...

08:10.320 --> 08:11.320
Yeah.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.320
It's why I invalidated it.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.880
It just puts a wall between you and it's, there is no, this is going to sound like a

08:15.880 --> 08:19.480
bad quote out of context, but there's no logical reason not to kill yourself.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.440
That logic is not what's on the table.

08:22.440 --> 08:27.120
It's not A plus B plus C equals there are legitimate reasons to live.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.800
It's not something that's going to be intuited logically.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.800
It's not.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.800
Yeah.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.800
You're not waiting to hear someone say, but you're so special.

08:33.800 --> 08:34.800
Oh, there it is.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.800
There it is.

08:35.800 --> 08:36.800
I'm special.

08:36.800 --> 08:37.800
I'm just gonna...

08:37.800 --> 08:40.440
You feel a horrible, gnawing pain and it feels so bad that a lot of us can't relate to it

08:40.440 --> 08:44.600
because it's, if you just back into a level of pain that you would have to feel before

08:44.600 --> 08:48.200
you were thinking about not existing as an alternative to it.

08:48.200 --> 08:54.880
Now those thoughts are, we all, they move through the species like a cloud and individuals

08:54.880 --> 08:58.680
have to bear the burden of them and those people need to find someone that they can

08:58.680 --> 09:00.680
trust and talk about them.

09:00.680 --> 09:01.680
So there you go.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.680
Okay.

09:02.680 --> 09:07.480
So yes, life is wonderful and you'll have so many children and you'll be so happy, but

09:07.480 --> 09:09.680
also don't not kill yourself for that reason.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.240
Don't, don't, don't wait for that epiphany.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.400
It's not, it's a wonderful life.

09:13.400 --> 09:18.080
It's a shitty life, but also like, like, like, just talk about it a little bit.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
Oh, you'll like this one.

09:19.080 --> 09:24.760
And in the Muppets continuity, Kermit the Frog caused 9-11.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.320
There's a movie about where Kermit the Frog sees what his life would have been like if

09:28.320 --> 09:32.240
he was never born and he goes to New York and the World Trade Center is standing and

09:32.240 --> 09:34.560
the movie came out in 2002.

09:34.560 --> 09:39.840
So by their logic, if Kermit had gotten, had just gone back into the swamp and not become

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
a Muppet.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.840
Adam Goldberg, everybody.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.840
Okay.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.840
That's a good one.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.840
All right.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.840
Thank you.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.840
He's back.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
He's on a high.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.840
He is, he is back and he means it, man.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.840
This time he's got an attitude.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.840
Check it out, Freddie.

09:50.840 --> 10:03.840
Um, I, well, I don't, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't

10:03.840 --> 10:08.440
want to, I don't want to dwell on it, but I don't understand why, why does that mean

10:08.440 --> 10:09.560
he caused it?

10:09.560 --> 10:13.560
Well, it shows what it would be like if he wasn't born.

10:13.560 --> 10:18.400
It shows what it would be like if he, the ultimate reality without having to pass full

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
towers.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.400
Ah, okay.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.400
Got it.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.400
Got it.

10:22.400 --> 10:27.400
I missed the part where I was supposed to care about the content of the Muppet and Muppets.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
Muppets.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
Flush.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
Muppets.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.400
Superman.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.400
Mickey Mouse.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.280
You, you don't like the Muppets?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.680
You don't like the Muppets?

10:37.680 --> 10:40.120
Yeah, I'm sick of being told how precious they are.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.480
Prove it, prove it, prove it.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.120
It's been 48 years.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.120
Show me again how precious they are.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.560
I remember the 70s.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.120
Show me why that's been the case.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.320
I remember, I remember.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.320
You didn't like it back then?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.720
No, I liked it back then.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.320
Oh, but you're saying it doesn't matter to you now?

10:56.320 --> 11:01.920
I'm saying it, that does not earn you like 50 years of fucking like, like, oh, look at

11:01.920 --> 11:02.920
us.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.480
Why am I looking at you?

11:06.480 --> 11:07.480
Why?

11:07.480 --> 11:11.480
Do something.

11:11.480 --> 11:16.960
And what are you doing that Carrot Topped hasn't done and been reviled for?

11:16.960 --> 11:20.600
Like, what are you, what are you, you're standing there looking weird?

11:20.600 --> 11:29.240
This is such a weird thing to be so angry about.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.840
I would never have thought that in a million years.

11:32.840 --> 11:38.600
I've known you for so long, I didn't realize this is, you really have a lot of fucking,

11:38.600 --> 11:43.600
just very thinly masked of hate and just bail for it.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.120
Well, I got drunk last night and I was, I was, I really, I really started bashing on

11:47.120 --> 11:52.040
Superman and, and instead of doing inadvertently looking back at it, I just looked like a guerrilla

11:52.040 --> 11:56.480
marketing ad for Batman versus Superman because, because I'm really just saying the same things

11:56.480 --> 12:00.160
that they're saying in the Superman versus Batman trailer, it's just, it sounds, it's

12:00.160 --> 12:08.200
just some guy going like, he's too powerful, I don't like him, a man shouldn't be a god.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.620
But I, I, I just, I like, I think, okay, so I've been talking to a lot of Superman fans

12:12.620 --> 12:18.440
on Twitter and, and of course, as, you know, communication leads to understanding and stuff.

12:18.440 --> 12:24.000
Any kind of hatred is, is, we know by now, it's, it's, you know, you just don't know,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
it's ignorance.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.560
You talk to the right people, let the right thoughts seep in and, you know, like Superman

12:28.560 --> 12:34.480
does seem like, as I've labeled him a histrionic alien demagogue, like he is a, he is a crybaby

12:34.480 --> 12:40.440
pajama man from outer space that, that it seems like enjoying involves prostrating yourself

12:40.440 --> 12:45.020
in front of and going like, oh, should Superman have this pillow when he's crying or this

12:45.020 --> 12:46.020
pillow?

12:46.020 --> 12:47.680
And it's like, what about us?

12:47.680 --> 12:50.800
And that's what, who are you supposed to identify with if not Lex Luthor?

12:50.800 --> 12:54.040
Didn't you come to some sort of like, like understanding of Superman, we had that guy

12:54.040 --> 12:57.200
up and he explained that it was all, the, the origin of it, oh, he's right here in the

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
front.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
What's your name again?

12:59.200 --> 13:00.200
Eric.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
Eric, it was you.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
Eric, the Superman fan.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.200
Okay.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.720
Who explained, yeah, that, that like the Muppets and like Mickey Mouse, the, that, that Superman

13:06.720 --> 13:11.640
has a, has a very inspiring story to its backstory, you know, the, the, the, the, its origin,

13:11.640 --> 13:18.080
that the, what was it, two Jewish brothers during, during the, one was shot to death.

13:18.080 --> 13:23.720
Oh, by, by, for, oh, burglar.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
Okay.

13:24.720 --> 13:29.520
So why didn't he create Batman?

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
He wasn't shot by kryptonite?

13:30.520 --> 13:31.520
No.

13:31.520 --> 13:37.760
Uh, the, the, the, I'm mad for that reason, the, the, the, uh, yeah, two, two young Jewish

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
kids.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
And what year was it?

13:39.760 --> 13:44.960
It was like the, the, so like, like, like America wasn't even not anti-Semitic yet.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.240
Like, like, like, like America was like, Hey, yeah, Jews, they're the worst, right?

13:49.240 --> 13:55.480
Um, somebody who's got cash for the war, who needs bullets and steel?

13:55.480 --> 14:01.480
Um, the, uh, the, so, so they, it's a, it's a myth of empowerment from, from two minds

14:01.480 --> 14:04.880
that didn't like, you know, they felt like they were at the, at the, that's a, that's

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
very inspiring.

14:05.880 --> 14:10.000
But I'd rather read a comic book called two Jewish kids make a comic book.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.240
Like the comic book that they created is about a hysterical pajama man who in the, in light

14:18.240 --> 14:22.040
of all the superheroes that we've created, Iron Man, who's kryptonite is alcoholism.

14:22.040 --> 14:27.120
And not even because anything bad happened to him, he's just, he just loves booze.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
He just loves it.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.120
And that's his kryptonite.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.280
He's just like, mm, I love it.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.400
I love drinking and technology.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.960
It's fucking, that's great.

14:33.960 --> 14:38.120
I mean, that appeals to you for obvious reasons.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
Yeah.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.560
Well, isn't Superman supposed to appeal people, people for obvious reasons?

14:42.560 --> 14:45.580
What, what, what reason would you have to have Superman appeal to you other than a sense

14:45.580 --> 14:52.000
of powerlessness and beta male kind of, I'm sorry, Eric, Eric, Eric, get back up here.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Eric.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.120
I just said that I was, I had turned a corner on this.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.120
I'm sorry.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.560
Well, his first two villains though, he fought a corrupt landlord who was charging too much

15:01.560 --> 15:02.560
rent.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.320
He actually threw him out a window and it was 1938 during like great depression times.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.680
And then the second guy I ever thought was, um, this guy was beating his wife and he jumped

15:09.680 --> 15:12.080
in front of them and he was like, you want to fight somebody like who's stronger than

15:12.080 --> 15:13.560
you want to feel that, see how that feels.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.560
And he like, all right.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.560
He was high-roaded.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.560
High-roaded.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.560
Stop all that rape.

15:17.560 --> 15:22.560
So, so he was like a champion of the common man.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.560
Yeah, right.

15:23.560 --> 15:32.320
And one episode he fought the Federal Reserve and went, he was, he was the first to come

15:32.320 --> 15:34.840
down against the, uh, the gold standard.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.840
Yeah.

15:35.840 --> 15:40.320
Well, every decade he exists, he becomes what masculinity, like the height of masculinity.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.320
Yeah.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.320
Yeah.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.120
Exactly, and right now the height of masculinity is kind of like challenging your own privilege.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.560
And that's why in the movie, he's like, well, should I be doing this?

15:48.560 --> 15:49.760
Maybe Batman should be the guy.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.320
Like maybe I should have people that are policing me like a justice league.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.320
All right.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.320
That sounds good.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.320
I'm in.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
I'm in.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.520
So it's Tumblr as Lex Luthor now telling what to do.

15:58.520 --> 16:03.280
I've got a lot of residual nineties, Superman hatred that's not really, somebody, somebody

16:03.280 --> 16:06.760
tweeted very, very appropriately at me like, oh, Superman hatred.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.280
That's so like, like lazy Gen X cynicism.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.280
That's right.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.520
I'm a product of my generation.

16:12.520 --> 16:16.800
The nineties were a dark time for comic books and we killed him in the nineties because

16:16.800 --> 16:17.800
of it.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
Yeah.

16:18.800 --> 16:19.800
And it was lame.

16:19.800 --> 16:20.800
It was silly.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.280
He came back with long hair and it was silly and a giant gun, which was awesome.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
He had a giant gun.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.280
Yeah.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.800
The panel says, um, you know, they call me a Boy Scout and Boy Scouts are always prepared.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.800
And then he's a shotgun.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
What is he?

16:32.800 --> 16:33.800
He did a gun.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.800
Exactly.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.800
Yeah.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.800
What did his gun shoot?

16:36.800 --> 16:43.560
I don't know, his gun shot his eyeballs, which are also guns.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
Yeah.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.560
His existence.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.640
So this gun shot his existence.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.640
Eric, did you like the Christopher Reeve movie?

16:51.640 --> 16:52.640
So much.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
Yeah.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.720
Christopher Reeves is such a great, you know, now that we've seen, it's remarkable how now

16:57.720 --> 17:04.280
we see how, how great, yeah, and how actor dependent the role of Superman in cinema is.

17:04.280 --> 17:11.400
Like you really need somebody that can get away with that Boy Scout innocence, but invulnerability.

17:11.400 --> 17:19.040
Like, like, like he has to have a sexuality exuding like an attractiveness from a heteronormative

17:19.040 --> 17:20.040
perspective.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.600
Um, uh, the, or he can be attractive to gay people as well.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.840
And what do you call that?

17:24.840 --> 17:25.840
He's a hot.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.160
He has to be hot.

17:28.160 --> 17:32.680
But like straight guys have to like, have to be willing to like bend a knee, like, like,

17:32.680 --> 17:35.520
which is so tough, like only Chris Pratt has achieved that recently.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.520
So yeah.

17:36.520 --> 17:40.840
He's also a guy who values like writing as being more powerful than like his super strength,

17:40.840 --> 17:44.040
which I thought was really cool being like a writer nerd because he's really hard just

17:44.040 --> 17:47.440
trying to like Superman really loves writing.

17:47.440 --> 17:53.440
There was this whole story where he went around saving writers in between the saving women

17:53.440 --> 17:56.520
from being beaten in the face.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.920
His favorite human being is Lois Lane, who's like this person who she topples tyrants with

17:59.920 --> 18:01.720
her typewriter for a literation.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.720
Yeah.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.720
He has a, he's a journalist.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
You're right.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.840
But I always thought like that he's not really a real journalist.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.560
Like I didn't know, I don't know if Clark Kent like ever submitted any good articles

18:09.560 --> 18:14.120
to the, I always felt like that was like part of the invasiveness is that he's dwelling

18:14.120 --> 18:18.320
among us and he's part of the fourth estate and he's like, like, it's like in there.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.320
He's an alien.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.440
He doesn't need those glasses.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.440
It's a disguise.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.680
He's disguised as a human.

18:22.680 --> 18:23.680
He's an alien parasite.

18:23.680 --> 18:28.480
A lot of hipster girls are though too.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.920
They had this great thing in the late nineties too, where he wrote a novel because he was

18:31.920 --> 18:35.240
like, I am a, I'm not really doing anything like Lois is so much better than I am at this.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.920
I'm going to have like, he quit the planet and wrote a novel called under a yellow sun

18:38.920 --> 18:40.480
and tried to be like the new John Grisham.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.120
Wait, it's called Clark Kent did?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.120
Yeah.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.120
Yeah.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.120
Yeah.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.120
All right.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.120
All right.

18:47.120 --> 18:54.800
The guy who saved Superman, Eric saved him from my rap, my very marketable rap that is

18:54.800 --> 18:58.040
being catered to in theaters across the nation this summer.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.840
Like, can you save the Muppets too?

19:01.840 --> 19:04.960
I don't think your Muppets hatred might be irretrievable.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.160
That seems like a lot of it.

19:06.160 --> 19:11.760
I just respect creators and I just like, I don't, I feel like Walt Disney was around

19:11.760 --> 19:15.800
and made Mickey Mouse and it's like, it comes from his heart and it's like, then these things

19:15.800 --> 19:21.560
to get taken over by capitalism and it's like the crowning jewel on the toxicity is like,

19:21.560 --> 19:25.800
like didn't we change copyright law just because like it didn't make sense that Mickey

19:25.800 --> 19:28.120
Mouse could be owned by people?

19:28.120 --> 19:33.000
It's like, like when does Darth Vader stop being Anakin Skywalker, you know?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.480
Speaking of Mickey Mouse, I was talking to Kali Kazoo because she wasn't here but we

19:36.480 --> 19:38.120
were talking about animated figures.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.320
Was it about why they were gloves?

19:40.320 --> 19:43.680
And she has the answer for that, of course, because she's an animation freak.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.760
All the characters back then because it was black and white, all the characters were mostly

19:46.760 --> 19:51.200
just black and so they put the white gloves on them so they weren't just black people.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.760
That makes them look more like minstrels because the minstrel performers all wear white gloves

19:54.760 --> 19:55.760
too.

19:55.760 --> 20:01.480
But what was the, with minstrel performers, they wanted their hands to read on stage?

20:01.480 --> 20:02.480
I think so.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.320
They just weren't completely head to foot black, like so they'd look like that.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.880
You'd think before, so at that point, common sense kicked it.

20:09.880 --> 20:14.440
Like, wow, we want this to read.

20:14.440 --> 20:18.320
Remember when we were burning the cork and rubbing the, no one thought at that point,

20:18.320 --> 20:19.840
nah, this seems evil.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.960
Although I'm sure I'm still getting a little bit wrong.

20:22.960 --> 20:23.960
Do you know?

20:23.960 --> 20:25.960
Oh, you do?

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
Get up here.

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
Get up here.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.960
If you want.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
If you want.

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
Male Cali-Kazoo.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.960
What's your name, sir?

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
Scoota.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Scoota?

20:34.960 --> 20:35.960
Yeah.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
Come on.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.400
Is it Scooter, but you're from Boston?

20:40.400 --> 20:42.400
No, it's Scoota.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.080
We literally had this conversation last time I was up here.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.080
I'm an alcoholic.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.080
Wait, on stage?

20:49.080 --> 20:53.360
The show is an alcoholic.

20:53.360 --> 20:57.080
Well the show collectively is just a drunk uncle whose mind is turning to tapioca.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.600
All right, Scoota, what did we talk about?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.600
How's art school?

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
Yeah, I told you.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.280
So again, not an animation actor, but it is just a simple thing for you for why their

21:06.280 --> 21:11.000
hands are white when most characters were black in an animated world.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.160
Can you eat that mic a little bit, Scoota?

21:13.160 --> 21:14.160
Yeah, yeah.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.880
If their hand crossed their body, you can still see their hand.

21:17.880 --> 21:25.400
See, I feel like Cali put more of a racial spin on that.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.400
Interesting.

21:26.400 --> 21:33.040
Of course, she's not here to defend herself, so let's just all label her a racist.

21:33.040 --> 21:38.280
I would have thought the reason why they were gloves is because things that move when you're

21:38.280 --> 21:43.600
doing cell-based animation, they tend to be a different shade, different color.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.120
Like Scooby-Doo in your watch, I'm sure we talked about this the last time that this

21:47.120 --> 21:48.120
was my theory.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.760
It's like, you know, in Scooby-Doo, it's like, gee, I wonder where the secret door is.

21:51.760 --> 21:58.400
Because it's on a different layer of acetate, and so it's like a slightly different color.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.640
Things that are about to move in that shot, they tend to be a different shade, so I thought

22:02.640 --> 22:03.640
characters...

22:03.640 --> 22:08.120
I think back in those days, though, they didn't do that in complete animation.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.960
Every frame was probably a new cell.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.400
All right.

22:11.400 --> 22:16.080
This has been, I don't know, nothing, but the old nothing piece.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.960
I call this segment, we almost proved Mickey Mouse or Walt Disney was a racist.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.920
Well, I'm sure he was.

22:22.920 --> 22:23.920
You know what the big question is?

22:23.920 --> 22:24.920
Would we have been?

22:24.920 --> 22:25.920
Like...

22:25.920 --> 22:30.000
There's a thing at Disneyland, because I used to work at Disneyland, and all the horses

22:30.000 --> 22:37.120
on the carousel in, what's it called, the Fairy Book Land, you know, by Jeff...

22:37.120 --> 22:38.120
Not Fantasyland.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.120
Is it not Fantasyland?

22:39.120 --> 22:42.400
No, it's not Frontierland.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.920
By Sleeping Beauty's Castle, you got the carousel there, and all the horses are white, supposedly

22:46.920 --> 22:50.920
because he thought that the kids would fight over the white horse, so he made all the horses

22:50.920 --> 22:54.320
white, which isn't necessarily racist, but it's certainly...

22:54.320 --> 22:55.640
It's of a certain time.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.000
Also, there was a rumor, and I really believe that I remember this.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.360
When you walk in down Main Street, in the old days, there was little houses up there,

23:03.360 --> 23:07.160
with little miniature windows to make kind of force perspective.

23:07.160 --> 23:11.400
There was a curtain up there with little mini swastikas on it that was there.

23:11.400 --> 23:17.840
All right, this is going to sound bad, but it's not what it looks like.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.840
There's a reason.

23:18.840 --> 23:26.080
It was a symbol for unity while Disney was into Native American culture, and by the way,

23:26.080 --> 23:31.040
the association of the color white, and the color black, which are these like really extreme

23:31.040 --> 23:36.280
parts of the color wheel, whatever, black isn't the color, whatever.

23:36.280 --> 23:40.080
I get confused, scientifically black isn't the color, and then you talk to painter people,

23:40.080 --> 23:44.200
and they're like, black is every color, black's none of them, I fucking get it, I hate it.

23:44.200 --> 23:48.120
People that look at things make me angry.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.360
Learn to read.

23:52.360 --> 23:56.560
The idea that the white horse would be more valuable to children, and then connecting

23:56.560 --> 24:03.880
that dot to race, that's also a racist thought, isn't it?

24:03.880 --> 24:12.480
Because we're not white, we're dirty, gross, yellow, like jaundice, burnt sienna, whatever,

24:12.480 --> 24:16.640
I don't know what this color is, douchebag, I don't know what this, the Crayola box would

24:16.640 --> 24:17.640
be.

24:17.640 --> 24:22.160
I wonder if there's another reason for the kids wanting the white horse, I'm not sure

24:22.160 --> 24:28.920
when Disneyland kind of came about, but maybe depending on the prevalence of the lone ranger

24:28.920 --> 24:34.320
in pop culture, do they want the white horse when they perceive that maybe kids wanting

24:34.320 --> 24:37.320
a white horse would have implications that other people would see not knowing, or it's

24:37.320 --> 24:39.840
because everyone wanted to have.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.880
There might have been a white horse in film, you've got Lon Ranger, you've got maybe some

24:43.880 --> 24:48.000
animated film, whatever, but I don't think you need to say that he was racist because

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
of that, but his reason was, just make them all the same color so that the kids aren't

24:54.000 --> 24:56.920
fighting, so everybody gets the same horse.

24:56.920 --> 25:01.120
But it's a white horse, he didn't make a bunch of black horses.

25:01.120 --> 25:05.160
When you look back in history, and there's certain representations that we characterize

25:05.160 --> 25:09.680
different decades, different generations, different historical figures, we look through

25:09.680 --> 25:15.880
this lens of detecting racism, what is racism, and like some people are like early champions

25:15.880 --> 25:20.520
of what we now consider to be human rights, and then some other people are early like

25:20.520 --> 25:26.160
cautionary tales, and then some people are like publicly on the right page because that's

25:26.160 --> 25:31.360
not even the popular point of view, but is publicly what they should be, and they do

25:31.360 --> 25:36.160
the right thing publicly, but then these private things come to light that reveal that really

25:36.160 --> 25:41.560
in the fiber of their being, they can't help but look at people that are different than

25:41.560 --> 25:47.680
them with some kind of downward gaze, and that that might even have been part of their

25:47.680 --> 25:53.200
public face, that what we now call, oh, that guy was a champion of blah, blah, blah rights,

25:53.200 --> 25:56.600
it was like, yeah, but that guy thought that those people were animals, that guy thought

25:56.600 --> 26:02.240
that that was a charity, like I just saw, I was really compelled by this Frank Sinatra

26:02.240 --> 26:09.080
documentary I just saw to fight, he's like, like, okay, we had a guy that, we had a guy

26:09.080 --> 26:14.200
that rude for hating Jews, and a guy that was, yeah, I think he loves documentaries,

26:14.200 --> 26:16.320
Scooter, are you comfortable, do you need anything?

26:16.320 --> 26:17.320
I'm perfect.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.320
Okay, all right.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.320
Do you like a drink?

26:19.320 --> 26:20.320
You want a thing?

26:20.320 --> 26:21.320
Would you like a cracker to be named after you?

26:21.320 --> 26:22.320
Sure, yeah.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.320
It could be easy, believe me, Scooter.

26:25.320 --> 26:32.520
I'm sorry, sorry, it also sounds like a sexual thing to me.

26:32.520 --> 26:38.280
Yeah, but before we leave Disney, she gave me a Scooter.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.960
Before you go on to Sinatra, I do want to talk about the documentary, if you guys don't

26:41.960 --> 26:46.200
know this, if you go to Disneyland, I love Disneyland, I love to go there, go there in

26:46.200 --> 26:50.200
the morning, go get ice cream, and then run to Space Mountain, that's my tradition, but

26:50.200 --> 26:55.000
if you want a great photo moment, for those of you who don't know this, go to Frontier

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Land.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.320
When you walk up Main Street, there's the hub, which is where all the land spoke off

27:00.320 --> 27:04.880
of, and there's a statue of Walt with a Mickey Mouse in his left hand, and he's pointing

27:04.880 --> 27:10.000
down Main Street, and the future, and beyond.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.880
If you stand right at the edge of the entrance of Frontier Land, and you look back at it,

27:14.880 --> 27:19.680
what you see is Mickey's on the far side of Walt, and Walt is pointing, and Mickey's

27:19.680 --> 27:27.400
nose is right at his crotch, and it looks like Walt Disney's got a giant boner.

27:27.400 --> 27:32.120
And if you go there, although, now they've got the new rockets, that new rockets kind

27:32.120 --> 27:35.840
of obscures the background, because it's so busy, back, it used to be white, like totally

27:35.840 --> 27:39.360
white background, Tomorrowland, and you get a perfect silhouette of that.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.880
Now it's a little bit broken up by the new rocket red, but you'll go there and you will

27:42.880 --> 27:46.600
see like some savvy, like Japanese kids, like taking a picture and giggling like mad, it's

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
very good.

27:47.600 --> 27:54.200
Have I ever talked about the fact that when you go into the Nickelodeon building?

27:54.200 --> 27:58.280
As one does.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.520
When you're pitching your animated shows.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.520
Which one?

28:01.520 --> 28:04.680
The weird one on like Hollywood, no, was it Buena Vista or Hollywood Way or was it?

28:04.680 --> 28:08.160
Yeah, I don't know, it looks like you're going to get slimed when you go in there or whatever.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.680
Or Victory is a victory.

28:11.680 --> 28:19.240
There's a Lego Spongebob in the lobby, and I've only ever seen that character, you know,

28:19.240 --> 28:25.200
from the front angle in a two dimensional medium, here he is represented in a 3D context

28:25.200 --> 28:35.320
out of made out of Legos, and his nose is a straight up cock, like it has a shaft and

28:35.320 --> 28:36.320
a head.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.320
Really?

28:37.320 --> 28:40.840
Like it's not just like, oh, it's a long nose, like Pinocchio, it's like, it's a fucking

28:40.840 --> 28:41.840
dick.

28:41.840 --> 28:46.800
I thought it was kind of like a Popeye, like a smooth little, whoop, like a, it's a dick,

28:46.800 --> 28:54.760
it's a curved porn star dick with a helmet for, as our anthropologist friend said, plunging

28:54.760 --> 28:56.480
out your competitor's semen.

28:56.480 --> 29:02.040
I don't know if that's what the Spongebob creator was thinking when he, he was just

29:02.040 --> 29:05.280
thinking, this should look like a dick.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.400
God was thinking it should plunge out the last guy's cum.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.440
The helmet part of it would just be an unfortunate accident of Legos kind of pixelization, that

29:11.440 --> 29:12.840
you can't make a smooth edge.

29:12.840 --> 29:18.760
Look, I know a dick when I see one, and, he made that very clear.

29:18.760 --> 29:23.040
And when I'm brushing up against an erect one at hip level, as you do when you exit

29:23.040 --> 29:30.560
and enter the Nickelodeon building, and it's just like, it's, if you took just Spongebob's

29:30.560 --> 29:37.720
nose from the lobby of the Nickelodeon building, and laid it on any counter in any public establishment,

29:37.720 --> 29:40.280
whoever you were doing would go like, what are you doing?

29:40.280 --> 29:41.280
Stop it.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.440
They would get mad.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.880
They wouldn't go, what is that?

29:43.880 --> 29:44.880
Is that a banana?

29:44.880 --> 29:45.880
They would go, what?

29:45.880 --> 29:46.880
Stop it.

29:46.880 --> 29:50.480
But then you put it on the face of this children's character.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.680
Is it possible that someone that worked at Nickelodeon added that on, and like, like, like,

29:53.680 --> 29:54.680
What do you mean added?

29:54.680 --> 29:55.680
Well, I don't, I don't know.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.080
I mean, what's possible is that someone's interpretation of a character that's not usually

29:59.080 --> 30:05.640
rendered that way may have, may have culminated in that, you know, like, like, you take drafting

30:05.640 --> 30:09.240
class, you do things orthographically, you don't quite know what they're going to look

30:09.240 --> 30:20.520
like, I guess, like, when they're extruded, but on a scale from like one to nothing but

30:20.520 --> 30:21.520
trouble.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.520
Where did you write it?

30:22.520 --> 30:25.920
I haven't seen nothing but trouble.

30:25.920 --> 30:29.200
Oh, Dan Ackroyd has a penis nose.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.200
I gotta watch that movie.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.200
No, you don't.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
No, I do.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
I do.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.200
All right.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
All right.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.200
All right.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.840
So anyways, well, I was just going to say, Sinatra in this documentary, I thought, you know,

30:37.840 --> 30:43.960
I grew up, you know, there's certain tarot cards, it's like, oh, Woody Allen's Funny.

30:43.960 --> 30:49.400
Sinatra was a good singer, but he was a jerk to the ladies, and he was racist to Sammy.

30:49.400 --> 30:54.560
And, but like, like, I mean, I was surprised to like hear the story of Frank Sinatra.

30:54.560 --> 31:00.520
Like, well, how long that story is and how many times he was the underdog and how hard

31:00.520 --> 31:02.320
he had to work to be taken seriously.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.920
I actually, I love Sinatra and I was so excited to see that documentary.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.080
I didn't like that documentary.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.880
I thought that was a real fucking fluff piece on him.

31:09.880 --> 31:16.120
It was so friends and family made and they gloss over what a complete virulent asshole

31:16.120 --> 31:17.120
he was.

31:17.120 --> 31:22.680
Yeah, yeah, you knew the mafia guys, but he was always this, he was a great anti-bigotry

31:22.680 --> 31:23.680
guy.

31:23.680 --> 31:27.880
I learned that stuff from that documentary though, so maybe if you take a step back,

31:27.880 --> 31:31.040
maybe it was just enough of he was an asshole because I learned that he was an asshole from

31:31.040 --> 31:32.040
that documentary.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.040
I learned that he was racist in his show.

31:34.040 --> 31:37.640
You don't hear all the threats, possible murders, he was under indictment for murders

31:37.640 --> 31:38.640
and stuff like that.

31:38.640 --> 31:42.000
I thought that they, but a lot of that stuff was maybe apocryphal because they were honest

31:42.000 --> 31:45.120
about the stuff that was real, like his associations with the actual mob.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.360
I think they glossed over it was, is that one moment when Harry Belafonte was disappointed

31:49.360 --> 31:57.920
at him for being racist to Sammy for a couple rat pack summits in Vegas, other than that,

31:57.920 --> 32:01.120
that's the only time when that documentary where I feel like anyone holds him to the

32:01.120 --> 32:02.120
fire at all.

32:02.120 --> 32:07.560
He threatened and bullied and he was such an ass.

32:07.560 --> 32:11.800
Now also, great in other ways, but like if someone referred to him, a friend of his that

32:11.800 --> 32:15.440
worked with him called him a 24 carat manic depressive.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.280
You got both ends of that.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.280
It's that my way thing.

32:19.280 --> 32:23.400
I guess it was like, I finally needed to see through a lens of like, I've only ever thought

32:23.400 --> 32:28.360
he was just like an entitled jackass that was just like born to the manner.

32:28.360 --> 32:33.320
Like I didn't hear the underdog story a little bit like, you know, he had to, but the, the,

32:33.320 --> 32:37.600
the, and the fact that he was in his, well, this is what I was just talking about.

32:37.600 --> 32:41.800
You know, I can't say in his heart or in his mind because there's a difference there.

32:41.800 --> 32:50.040
He was politically early on in his life, he was absolutely like, like, like, like, like

32:50.040 --> 32:55.560
what he wanted to make people understand that racism was wrong because it had affected Italians.

32:55.560 --> 33:00.640
And so why should black people be different?

33:00.640 --> 33:05.200
This guy is going to do that every eight minutes, regardless, we're going to test that theory

33:05.200 --> 33:06.200
in a moment.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.720
See if we can connect with that the next time.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.720
Here's the problem.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.360
Right now, we're not sure if he loves racism or hates it or loves documentary film making

33:12.360 --> 33:14.240
Frank Sinatra or Batman.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.240
We're not sure.

33:15.240 --> 33:20.240
We're going to, but by the end of the night, we're going to go, oh, he loves self-reliance.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.240
That's it.

33:21.240 --> 33:26.440
He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a Walt Whitman fan to connect all those dots.

33:26.440 --> 33:30.240
It's going to draw a theme of like, oh, that guy was about self-reliance.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.240
Okay.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.240
Okay.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.240
Spoilers.

33:33.240 --> 33:38.920
So for instance, for instance, like when they talk about his rise to fame and all of a sudden

33:38.920 --> 33:43.160
he's, uh, he's singing in the big clubs and he's on the marquee and all the Bobby socks

33:43.160 --> 33:44.320
are out there.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.040
And in interviews, he's like, yeah, you got these girls out there and everyone's screaming.

33:47.040 --> 33:50.680
What they just happened to not mention is that that was all fucking paid.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.280
Like they have, they've shipped all those girls in for that shit.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
It was all PR stuff.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.280
Oh really?

33:55.280 --> 33:56.280
Yeah.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.840
That he wasn't instantly that famous.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.880
They took a bunch of girls and sat them out there and said, when he comes out, scream

34:00.880 --> 34:01.880
like fucking mad.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.560
There's a, whatever they gave them.

34:03.560 --> 34:07.240
Like why not mention that in the documentary that every other documentary and book about

34:07.240 --> 34:08.240
him is mentioned.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.240
No.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.240
Okay.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.240
So there was definitely, there was definitely, you could tell.

34:11.240 --> 34:14.200
And all of a sudden, boom, bang, bang, but the people were throwing the thing and the

34:14.200 --> 34:18.880
stuff and the, it's like, no, like you were also just like a, from the very get go.

34:18.880 --> 34:22.600
He was a very political, very driven, ambitious guy.

34:22.600 --> 34:23.600
And that included.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.600
Which is pretty fascinating.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.040
And we could allow, like Howard Hughes was a very flawed guy, but, you know.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.440
Did I ever tell you the Murray Langstrom Sinatra story?

34:29.440 --> 34:30.440
You know Murray Langstrom?

34:30.440 --> 34:34.240
It was the unknown comic, the guy that wore the, the paper bag in his head.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.920
And I was doing a show with the improv guys at the improv in Melrose.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.080
Give me one second.

34:39.080 --> 34:43.600
Scoota, do you need a, just a Gatorade or a weird name or anything?

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
No.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.600
I'm good.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.600
Okay.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.320
I think you're easy on the eyes and it's good to have you up here.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
Okay.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.320
That's fine.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.320
I think the ladies like it.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.320
I haven't been getting tweeted or anything, but.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.320
A bottle of water maybe?

34:53.320 --> 34:54.320
I'll take a bottle of water.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.320
Sure.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.320
It's a nice balance.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.800
I think it's looking at me with my, all right.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.840
So somebody, I think it was Drew Carey goes like Murray, tell Jeff, he'll love it.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.320
Tell Jeff your Sinatra story.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.480
And so he says, this is fucking great.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.760
We're at the bar at the improv and he goes, I, he was doing Carson, I don't, I don't know

35:10.760 --> 35:14.640
what year it would have been, but it would have been probably late 70s, early 80s.

35:14.640 --> 35:15.800
I don't know.

35:15.800 --> 35:20.280
And he's doing Carson and he makes a joke about Sinatra because he was in the news for

35:20.280 --> 35:22.200
another divorce.

35:22.200 --> 35:26.880
And some joke about like, when it comes to cheating on wives, Sinatra does it his way.

35:26.880 --> 35:33.680
Like, not even like a really major zing or whatever, just being a silly Murray joke.

35:33.680 --> 35:38.320
He goes home that night to a shitty apartment, phone rings and he's tired and he's exhausted

35:38.320 --> 35:41.000
and he goes, hello, are you Murray?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Yes.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
This is Frank Sinatra.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
He goes, hey, fucking Tim.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I want one of his friends.

35:45.000 --> 35:52.080
Like, motherfucker, I'm tired, click, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, hello.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.080
Don't hang up on me.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.080
This is Frank Sinatra.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.240
Hey, Tim, you go fuck yourself, man.

35:55.240 --> 36:02.240
I've been working all day, click, ten minutes goes by, phone rings, hello.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.240
Ten minutes.

36:03.240 --> 36:07.240
So, like, is it Frank Sinatra staring at the phone there?

36:07.240 --> 36:12.400
No, Tim, you're about to find out why the time passes there.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.400
Time passes.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.400
He thinks that's that.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.400
The phone rings.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.400
Hello.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.920
And he says, Murray, this is Merle, this is Milton Burle.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.520
Do you recognize my voice?

36:20.520 --> 36:21.520
Oh, God.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.000
And he goes, yes, Milton.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
Like, hello, he goes, that was Frank Sinatra, and he's super, super mad right now.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
He goes, he goes, do not hang up the phone, listen to what I have to tell you.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.800
He goes, he's going to call you back, we're trying to call him down, he's going to send

36:34.800 --> 36:40.280
someone, he's going to send someone to your house to have you fucked up because his kid

36:40.280 --> 36:46.640
watches that show and you just made a joke about daddy fucking around a mommy.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.640
I'm confused again.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.200
Is that family values?

36:50.200 --> 36:53.280
Is he like family values or adultery?

36:53.280 --> 36:56.480
I don't know.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.080
He still hasn't gotten out of software lines necessarily.

36:59.080 --> 37:03.560
He's just drawing a larger circle around whatever it is.

37:03.560 --> 37:08.200
I hope, I hope we don't find he just like saying, you know, that's going to burn me

37:08.200 --> 37:09.200
up.

37:09.200 --> 37:14.440
I'm almost certain that's it then, then don't, don't let him break your heart.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.920
So you got values.

37:15.920 --> 37:16.920
Okay.

37:16.920 --> 37:17.920
Okay.

37:17.920 --> 37:26.640
I'm a human being in an almost shark jumping, uh, breaking of his, uh, he, okay.

37:26.640 --> 37:27.640
He's all right.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.640
Good.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.640
That's good.

37:29.640 --> 37:30.640
I'm glad you did that.

37:30.640 --> 37:31.640
Thank you.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.640
We know you have values.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.640
We're going to track them.

37:33.640 --> 37:37.680
So Milton Burroughs was like, this is not, this is not an alert, this is not a drill.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.880
He's going to send someone to your house and have you fucked up like that.

37:40.880 --> 37:45.640
And he says, Murray, he's absolutely capable of doing that because he does that.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.520
Like he's a very, very violent man and this is not a fucking drill.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.000
He goes, he's going to call you back when we calm him down and you're not going to

37:52.000 --> 37:56.560
say anything, but apologize and you don't say anything else, but you're sorry.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.560
Okay.

37:57.560 --> 37:58.560
And he's like, no, it was just a joke.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.560
We're comics.

37:59.560 --> 38:00.560
That's our job.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.120
He's like, I know, I know, I know, but that doesn't matter right now.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.120
I'm trying to.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.120
I'm Milton Burrough.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.400
I haven't told a joke for 38 years.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.880
I'm famous for standing there.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.240
So he's like, like, I'm just trying to help you out.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.760
So he's like, God, it's fucking bullshit.

38:13.760 --> 38:17.440
And so as Murray's telling the story, he's like, he's like, I'm like, fuck this guy.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.440
You know?

38:18.440 --> 38:20.520
And so the phone rings and he's like, the whole time he's like, I'm going to tell this

38:20.520 --> 38:23.960
guy, you know, jump on a lake and like take my chances or whatever.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.760
I like how classy he is about it.

38:27.760 --> 38:34.840
I'm going to tell this guy, you know, go, go build a wheel and make like a leaf and just

38:34.840 --> 38:37.960
get out of here and take it on the road, Jack.

38:37.960 --> 38:38.960
The story is a while ago.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.320
I'm paraphrasing Murray.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.160
I cannot quote verbatim on this.

38:42.160 --> 38:45.360
So the phone rings and he picks it up and he goes, hello.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.960
And all he hears is talk.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.800
And that's it.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.800
That wasn't the deal.

38:50.800 --> 38:57.000
And so he goes, he goes, I think about it for a second.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.160
It's just not, I'm so sorry.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.880
I'm so, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.880
My big fan of yours.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.880
I would never do anything.

39:01.880 --> 39:02.880
And he goes on and on and on.

39:02.880 --> 39:03.880
I'm a fan of your music.

39:03.880 --> 39:04.880
I would never insult your family.

39:04.880 --> 39:05.880
It was just a thing.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.760
You'll never happen again.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.320
And then just eventually click.

39:09.320 --> 39:15.600
And that was it, no, no resolution, no, no, no, no.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
Family values is gone.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.320
Family, family values is out.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.880
Suffer lines is out on that one.

39:19.880 --> 39:21.880
Also there's the danger of the copycat youping.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.880
Is it a copycat youper?

39:23.880 --> 39:24.880
I don't know.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.880
I don't know.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
I'll say it.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.880
Nope.

39:27.880 --> 39:28.880
Nope.

39:28.880 --> 39:33.240
I mean, it's not a, it's not a hard one to copycat.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.240
Yeah.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.240
So they're getting closer together too.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.240
It's like in the movie theater.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.840
Somebody gets a laugh and then it's like, oh boy, I hope, I hope he sees that pattern

39:40.840 --> 39:46.600
and tries to trick us, space, space it out, fan it out, blow our minds.

39:46.600 --> 39:50.080
Let's hear the next youp, like, 915.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
That was a good copycat.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.080
It was a copycat.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.080
Okay.

39:53.080 --> 39:56.400
So we've talked too long about the Frank Sinatra documentary.

39:56.400 --> 40:02.440
I, I, I had never, I had only heard these like, you know, the zeitgeist stuff.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.560
So it was a good start to watch like this.

40:04.560 --> 40:08.080
As you say, I think it's very accurate as a friends and family produced documentary.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.480
I had that tone.

40:09.480 --> 40:13.760
But even within that, there were the stories of all these things that you had heard them

40:13.760 --> 40:19.120
spread out on a timeline, like a big, long Spongebob nose.

40:19.120 --> 40:29.720
I'm just bringing it back around to you and just like the, I already, I already thought

40:29.720 --> 40:34.520
that that was so interesting because I did, I even, I don't know, I do believe, I, I

40:34.520 --> 40:37.400
know here's, here's the thing that, here's the thing that makes it relevant right now

40:37.400 --> 40:42.280
in this room is that here was this guy who had a, at a very young age, he was very like

40:42.280 --> 40:47.600
he's putting himself out there about this new topic of racism and, and I believe these

40:47.600 --> 40:53.160
stories are true because why wouldn't they be like, like the, the, the idea of him taking

40:53.160 --> 40:59.960
Sammy Davis, Jr. under his arm and really actually caring about this emerging thing

40:59.960 --> 41:01.960
of like black people aren't human beings.

41:01.960 --> 41:06.680
I think he found Sammy singing at, at Sero's and saw him and he went to Vegas, he's like

41:06.680 --> 41:09.480
this guy's going to be in the thing and like, no, we can't put him in the main room.

41:09.480 --> 41:13.280
He's like, no, he's, he's, he's main room and then they all had to live in dark town,

41:13.280 --> 41:16.920
which is a shanty town outside of Vegas and all the musicians, like Count Basie's band,

41:16.920 --> 41:21.480
Count Basie, you couldn't fucking go and stay in Vegas and Sinatra said, they stay in the

41:21.480 --> 41:22.480
hotel.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.440
It's like, if you don't want Sammy Davis in your hotel, you don't want Frank Sinatra

41:24.440 --> 41:26.800
in your hotel and he completely bullied them around.

41:26.800 --> 41:27.800
So there you go.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.280
Megalomania as progress.

41:29.280 --> 41:36.400
It's very interesting and, and, but, but ownership, still ownership, right?

41:36.400 --> 41:39.520
So this is the, this is the epiphany that Aaron and I had while we were watching the

41:39.520 --> 41:41.040
documentary because we were like puzzled by it.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.040
It was like, well, wait, cause they showed clips of that, those rat pack shows that are

41:44.040 --> 41:50.400
just like undeniably like anti, like, like not even, it's, it's, I, I thought that, that

41:50.400 --> 41:54.120
it was just sort of like, you know, like you make gay jokes and it's like, oh, there's

41:54.120 --> 41:57.640
a, there's a gay guy on stage and you make a gay joke and it's like, like kind of like,

41:57.640 --> 42:01.600
it's, it's sort of like refreshingly uncomfortable and people giggle uncomfortably.

42:01.600 --> 42:06.120
And it's like, sort of like the comedy bleep edges, like sort of like it's, it's, it's,

42:06.120 --> 42:09.600
it's hit and miss and it's like, you know, blah, blah, blah, but, but they showed clips

42:09.600 --> 42:14.440
of like D Martin, like, like, like Sammy Davis, Jr. touches him as the joke is that he doesn't

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
want him to touch him.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.440
There's an old joke on one of the seizures.

42:16.440 --> 42:19.400
I think it's Caesar's palace rat pack Wednesday because Sammy, I love you.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.400
I love your kids.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.400
I'll hang out with you.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.400
I'll play sports with you.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.160
I'll go golfing with you, but don't touch me.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
Yeah.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.160
I'll go to school with you.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.160
But don't just don't touch me.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.880
But it was also like the joke was that he was angry.

42:29.880 --> 42:34.600
Like the joke was like, like, like the joke, you could tell that if the joke was going

42:34.600 --> 42:40.880
to make anyone laugh, that it was coming from a, from a, a Michael Douglas falling down

42:40.880 --> 42:46.600
angry white man place and not from a, from a hilarious, like we're all starting to mix

42:46.600 --> 42:47.600
together.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.600
That clip is a bummer.

42:48.600 --> 42:52.040
Him, him, him picking Sammy up and saying, I'd like to thank the NAACP for the statue.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.040
That's hilarious.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.040
Sure.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.040
Like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.040
It's like, well, are there any more friends?

42:56.040 --> 42:57.040
And maybe we say these like weird things.

42:57.040 --> 43:00.000
I think the other Sammy would come out there because they, they worshiped Sammy Davis Jr.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.080
and Frank's nickname for him was the great entertainer.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.080
Like he was like, nobody's back.

43:03.080 --> 43:08.560
Like we, he was honored to be on a stage with Sammy and there's a lot of rat pack stuff

43:08.560 --> 43:12.680
where you listen to it and they'll be whoever's singing gets shit from the other guys except

43:12.680 --> 43:13.680
for Frank.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.680
Nobody fucks with Frank while he's out there.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.840
But everybody else has taken a dump on each other and doing jokes.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.880
The easy target Sammy jokes or black guy jokes.

43:19.880 --> 43:23.840
Like, because Rickles is in the, you know, in the next room doing all that shit.

43:23.840 --> 43:29.320
But there's lots of stuff where Sammy does like super like black power jokes on them.

43:29.320 --> 43:33.240
So they go, oh boy, as soon as we get in the lead, you guys are going to go first and the

43:33.240 --> 43:34.240
crowd cheers.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.240
Right.

43:35.240 --> 43:39.760
So, so, so do you, do you have a super point to make or can I stitch right that from there?

43:39.760 --> 43:44.320
They gave it back and forth, but certainly Sammy, I think was a butt of a lot of that.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.320
Right.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.320
So Aaron and I are watching this and we're going like, this is weird.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.560
He's this boy scout guy who like very early in his career, when he actually had a lot

43:50.560 --> 43:56.120
of things to risk before he was in total control is actually early on putting himself out there

43:56.120 --> 44:02.120
because as an Italian saying like, you know what, when I was young, Italians were maligned

44:02.120 --> 44:06.380
and not let in and I don't, I'm a successful Italian now and I don't, I don't want to watch

44:06.380 --> 44:07.880
this shit roll downhill.

44:07.880 --> 44:12.480
And so, so what, how is that guy, these rap pack shows and then we're sitting there puzzling

44:12.480 --> 44:13.480
through it.

44:13.480 --> 44:18.320
And then Aaron said, well, were the world changed underneath all that?

44:18.320 --> 44:22.840
Maybe the people that are at the forefront of, for instance, and this is, I think the

44:22.840 --> 44:28.000
example that we can relate to is 10 years ago, who were the feminists?

44:28.000 --> 44:33.520
How many of them are still in all that has, has come up in the last 10 years?

44:33.520 --> 44:41.680
Like when feminism meant just being a fan of women, like when it was just like, like,

44:41.680 --> 44:46.120
hey, give the girls a hand and maybe give me a kiss, ladies.

44:46.120 --> 44:52.560
Like, like, how, like, is there a subsection of, of like, like the most outspoken like

44:52.560 --> 44:58.240
guys, like that, that beta male quotient where it was like, I'm a rabid, virulent beta male

44:58.240 --> 44:59.240
feminist.

44:59.240 --> 45:04.480
And then 10 years later, like, there are, there is that person that, that, you know,

45:04.480 --> 45:08.800
that personality type that's like, when the shit hits the fan, when the rubber meets the

45:08.800 --> 45:14.160
road, then it's like, well, wait a minute, you know, I, I, I, I was doing that because

45:14.160 --> 45:19.040
I like fairness, I like ownership, I like hierarchy, I like, I like my comfort.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.880
My comfort is now being threatened.

45:20.880 --> 45:27.280
The thing that changed in between Boy Scout, Frank Sinatra, saying, fuck the world if you're

45:27.280 --> 45:33.080
going to be racist, and Frank Sinatra, like, publicly flogging emotionally a black man

45:33.080 --> 45:38.000
on stage for his adoring fans, the thing that changes in between there is that the

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
world changes.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.520
And the thing that remains the same is Frank's in control and saying, fuck you.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.640
Like, I don't think he liked being told what to do.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.640
There's a story that when he, and also, I mean, it's all been told to so many documentaries

45:48.640 --> 45:51.440
and books about him, and TV pieces.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.040
When he was, when he first started out, they made him, they made him change his name when

45:54.040 --> 45:56.880
he was working at some club, and I think it was Frank Diamond, he was, he had to change

45:56.880 --> 46:00.720
his name too, and he did a couple gigs with Frank Diamond, I might be getting that wrong.

46:00.720 --> 46:03.960
And he changed his name back, he's like, he's like, like, he was working at a club because

46:03.960 --> 46:09.080
I can't tell my mom or my grandma or my family that I changed the family name.

46:09.080 --> 46:12.680
And he said, you'll never work with the name Sinatra because no one wants to listen to a

46:12.680 --> 46:13.680
nigger record.

46:13.680 --> 46:17.680
And because the Irish were niggers, the Italians were niggers, like that's, that's what white

46:17.680 --> 46:21.400
people called anybody that was not like a white Protestant.

46:21.400 --> 46:25.240
And so like his, like his, Dukes were always up about being told what to do.

46:25.240 --> 46:28.000
And also like, he was Italian, he's really fucking proud of that.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.440
And they said, you'll never work because being Crosby is like, he's, he's in charge.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.280
And he's like, fuck being Crosby, like he went after being Crosby.

46:35.280 --> 46:41.800
And then later had to get gone after by Elvis and endure that, like he had to do that same.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.920
He works really hard to get the first Catholic president elected.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.160
He had a lot to do with Kennedy getting elected.

46:47.160 --> 46:48.160
Yeah.

46:48.160 --> 46:49.320
And that's where the mob stuff was honest.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.880
That's what I thought was ironic because I thought the other stuff was apocryphal because

46:51.880 --> 46:55.280
in a world, in a documentary where they were honest about the fact that, oh, actually no,

46:55.280 --> 47:00.560
he got Kennedy elected because he had mob influence and, and period.

47:00.560 --> 47:01.560
Yeah.

47:01.560 --> 47:04.760
I was like, well, this seems like an honest thing to say.

47:04.760 --> 47:08.360
So maybe the, if they say the other stuff is apocryphal, maybe it's apocryphal, but

47:08.360 --> 47:09.360
you're right.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.360
It did.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.360
It was clearly produced by people that were.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.360
I think the thing was always that he was in charge.

47:12.360 --> 47:16.600
I think I've even heard like when he was a little kid, his mom was like super alpha,

47:16.600 --> 47:17.600
like really in charge.

47:17.600 --> 47:20.400
And the kids would come over and she'd make dinner for all the neighborhood kids.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.240
And he was a little guy.

47:22.240 --> 47:25.280
He wasn't a tough guy, but he was like the, like the mayor of his block when he was a

47:25.280 --> 47:29.280
little shrimpy kid because he was just super in charge.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.240
Like he had to be the boss of everything, even as a little boy.

47:32.240 --> 47:35.120
So, how do we undo talking about Frank Sinatra for 25 minutes?

47:35.120 --> 47:36.040
What do we do?

47:36.040 --> 47:37.560
Scooter rap!

47:37.560 --> 47:38.560
Scooter rap!

47:38.560 --> 47:39.560
Yeah!

47:39.560 --> 47:40.560
Are you ready Dan?

47:40.560 --> 47:41.560
I'm doing the camera.

47:41.560 --> 47:42.560
This is your rap.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.520
Well you, you put it at, uh, I'll rap about you.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.400
Well, his name is SCUDA.

47:49.400 --> 47:53.440
Scooter rap.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.000
H-T-A-S-K-U-T-A

47:56.000 --> 47:56.980
Okay

47:56.980 --> 47:58.480
Alright

47:58.480 --> 48:03.000
Well, his name is S-K-O-O-D-A

48:03.000 --> 48:04.480
No

48:04.980 --> 48:05.980
Right, get closer

48:05.980 --> 48:06.480
Get closer

48:06.480 --> 48:07.480
Good, good

48:07.480 --> 48:12.840
His name is S-K-U-D-A

48:12.840 --> 48:15.960
H-T-A

48:15.960 --> 48:17.760
Q-T-A

48:17.760 --> 48:19.400
S-K-U-T-A

48:19.400 --> 48:21.520
S-K-U-T-A

48:21.520 --> 48:22.060
Hey, hey, hey

48:22.060 --> 48:26.060
Hey, yup guy, come up on stage, you want to feel it like you're the hype man to do some yups on this.

48:27.560 --> 48:28.560
Oh, shit!

48:31.060 --> 48:35.060
And when you feel it, when you feel it's the time in the rap to do it, you lay it in there.

48:40.060 --> 48:42.060
We're going to get some scooter.

48:43.060 --> 48:46.060
I said we're going to get some scooter.

48:46.060 --> 48:55.060
I got my boys got a 72 Barracuda. I've got my boys with his name as scooter.

48:56.060 --> 49:03.060
He's wearing all these checks. He's riding all these checks. He's eating all these checks. He's riding all these checks.

49:04.060 --> 49:05.060
My boy, he's got these checks.

49:06.060 --> 49:13.060
We are meant to be S-E-O-U-T-A-R-A family.

49:13.060 --> 49:15.060
Yo, family.

49:19.060 --> 49:20.060
Scooter rap, scooter rap.

49:21.060 --> 49:25.060
Yo, Scooter rap, bad family. I got this shit on the motherfucking rim of me.

49:27.060 --> 49:29.060
Alright, yup guy, yup guy.

49:29.060 --> 49:30.060
Oh, that's the yup guy?

49:30.060 --> 49:31.060
This is yup guy.

49:31.060 --> 49:34.060
Alright, yup guy, let's have a seat. Let's have some de neumar here.

49:35.060 --> 49:37.060
Let's have some de neumar.

49:37.060 --> 49:42.060
Can we go, do we have the technology to replay the tape and find out what you rhymed family with? Rammamy?

49:43.060 --> 49:44.060
I don't like rammamy.

49:45.060 --> 49:46.060
I like the refreshing.

49:46.060 --> 49:53.060
My thing is that, listen, my family, they've been ramming me with all this negativity, man.

49:54.060 --> 50:01.060
And I just drove cross country because I heard some good spirits and some beautiful people, some of which are here tonight.

50:01.060 --> 50:06.060
And I love some of what the hamburger glue was saying before.

50:06.060 --> 50:09.060
Ladies and gentlemen, life being beautiful, I'd like to take this moment for five dollars.

50:09.060 --> 50:13.060
You can subscribe to our podcast and find out what this guy actually looks like.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.060
It's not, it's not exactly.

50:22.060 --> 50:24.060
Oh Jesus, it's just, wow.

50:24.060 --> 50:25.060
Casualties.

50:25.060 --> 50:31.060
He almost broke his own glasses. It's like a one man Twilight Zone episode. Time enough at last.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
Finally gets a head bang.

50:34.060 --> 50:37.060
All I want, oh wait, my book on head banging, I can't read it.

50:40.060 --> 50:46.060
Joe, you'll hardly ever see that episode of Twilight Zone when that guy is sitting in the airplane and he's like,

50:46.060 --> 50:49.060
he's chilling in the airplane and he's like, I'm having a good time of shit.

50:49.060 --> 50:51.060
And then like at the end of the episode, he looks out the window.

50:52.060 --> 50:53.060
That was me, boy.

50:53.060 --> 50:54.060
Wait, what?

50:55.060 --> 50:56.060
That's an episode of Twilight Zone?

50:57.060 --> 51:00.060
The guy takes an entire plane ride and then looks out the window and someone says, Now's a guy boy.

51:01.060 --> 51:02.060
Jeff Saw.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.060
I've, I've, no.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.060
Yeah, I saw it.

51:05.060 --> 51:06.060
Jeff, you saw me boy.

51:06.060 --> 51:07.060
I don't know.

51:07.060 --> 51:08.060
Like, what's your name first off?

51:08.060 --> 51:09.060
My name's Dave, man.

51:14.060 --> 51:15.060
My real name's Dave.

51:15.060 --> 51:16.060
That's right.

51:16.060 --> 51:17.060
My name's Dave.

51:17.060 --> 51:18.060
That doesn't surprise me a bit.

51:18.060 --> 51:19.060
My name's Dave Kline.

51:19.060 --> 51:20.060
My name's Dave Kline, baby.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.060
Dave, where you from, man?

51:21.060 --> 51:27.940
I'm from New Jersey, baby, and you've been Frank Sinatra for real for real though for

51:27.940 --> 51:28.940
real.

51:28.940 --> 51:29.940
Where you from?

51:29.940 --> 51:30.940
I'm from Paramus, New Jersey.

51:30.940 --> 51:35.140
I was born in Manhattan because my mama was an opera singer.

51:35.140 --> 51:41.060
Oh, and then she put you in a basket and sent you the wrong way down the river in an anti

51:41.060 --> 51:42.060
Moses story.

51:42.060 --> 51:46.180
Oh, man, you'll love this, you'll love this on me.

51:46.180 --> 51:49.660
My mama, my mama was the leading colorator at New York City Opera.

51:49.660 --> 51:50.660
She was the leading what?

51:50.660 --> 51:53.140
The leading colorator soprano, which is like real high.

51:53.140 --> 51:56.620
So if you sing up, so like, I'm a bad boy.

51:56.620 --> 52:02.740
So like, my voice, my lady, my voice, girl, girl, girl, girl, great.

52:02.740 --> 52:05.340
That's my papa, who's also an opera singer.

52:05.340 --> 52:10.620
My mama was the leading colorator soprano in New York City Opera, and she got pregnant.

52:10.620 --> 52:17.220
And what happened was they brought in an understudy and they were like, yo, you getting old?

52:17.220 --> 52:18.900
We don't like the way you look no more.

52:18.900 --> 52:19.900
You getting pregnant?

52:19.900 --> 52:22.700
We're going to be in this, we're going to be in this gal, right?

52:22.700 --> 52:23.900
And we're going to see what she's at.

52:23.900 --> 52:29.660
We're going to see what she do when mom's pregnant with me, looking at her destiny in

52:29.660 --> 52:34.420
the face and she keeps singing.

52:34.420 --> 52:35.420
Mama kept singing.

52:35.420 --> 52:36.420
All right.

52:36.420 --> 52:37.420
Mama kept singing.

52:37.420 --> 52:38.420
Mama kept singing.

52:38.420 --> 52:39.420
No, she's pregnant.

52:39.420 --> 52:45.260
While she's pregnant with me, daddy sing, bae's mama kept singing, but wait, wait, she

52:45.260 --> 52:48.260
kept singing in the theater was firing her.

52:48.260 --> 52:55.940
Did she keep singing in New Jersey or just you know, no, no, my mom, my mom said, fuck

52:55.940 --> 52:56.940
childbirth.

52:56.940 --> 52:59.420
I'm having a caesarean.

52:59.420 --> 53:00.940
She has a caesarean.

53:00.940 --> 53:03.740
What has me pulled out of her?

53:03.740 --> 53:07.460
Which trimester on stage?

53:07.460 --> 53:11.620
This is actually a David Lynch film directed by Matthew Farney mid eighties.

53:11.620 --> 53:13.700
This is like heavy duty, heavy hitters.

53:13.700 --> 53:21.700
This is the most ancient Greek way to describe my mom got laid off and had a caesarean.

53:21.700 --> 53:28.100
My mom had my body untimely ripped from her womb.

53:28.100 --> 53:32.180
That's what would happen to normal humans, but Mama Klein in a normal human.

53:32.180 --> 53:33.180
She had me cut out.

53:33.180 --> 53:45.900
Your name is Dave Kline, my name is Dave Kline, you don't have to press rewind on

53:45.900 --> 53:46.900
that either.

53:46.900 --> 53:53.460
So, okay, so mama Klein has me ripped out of whatever parts I was growing in because

53:53.460 --> 53:54.700
they want the normal parts.

53:54.700 --> 54:00.740
That's a damn sure and they pull me out of there and I come scurrying out and sniffing

54:00.740 --> 54:10.420
out and I'm more of a macho main Randy Savage guy.

54:10.420 --> 54:11.420
I don't know.

54:11.420 --> 54:13.300
I would say they pull me out.

54:13.300 --> 54:16.180
Long story short, mama Klein's a fucking baller and a rider.

54:16.180 --> 54:17.180
She was ready to go.

54:17.180 --> 54:25.420
They sewed her up and she was on stage singing man all as man all three weeks after having

54:25.420 --> 54:29.740
her gut split open and having me fall out of her and spill over.

54:29.740 --> 54:34.740
You could take away from that that your mom's a workaholic that didn't care about your well-being.

54:34.740 --> 54:35.740
Well...

54:35.740 --> 54:42.740
No, Jen, she was a writer, and she was a baller.

54:42.740 --> 54:44.740
I mean, this gets into...

54:44.740 --> 54:48.740
The thing is like being the son of an extraordinary woman is a difficult thing.

54:48.740 --> 54:49.740
Oh, okay, I like that.

54:49.740 --> 54:50.740
That's good.

54:50.740 --> 54:51.740
That's true.

54:51.740 --> 54:52.740
Yeah, you know what?

54:52.740 --> 54:54.740
And it was hard for her, and they gave her a try, but she still had you.

54:54.740 --> 55:02.740
And yeah, so your burden as a white male with a remarkable mother...

55:02.740 --> 55:05.740
Yeah, I have a lot of guilt, and so I have a lot of guilt, yeah.

55:05.740 --> 55:06.740
She paid a little forward.

55:06.740 --> 55:07.740
She's like, fuck that guy.

55:07.740 --> 55:08.740
I'll have privilege.

55:08.740 --> 55:13.740
I'll semi-abort him and then go back to work.

55:13.740 --> 55:18.740
Like, let him go up to the plates with a couple of strikes.

55:18.740 --> 55:23.740
She knew that she had a fury line in her, and that like she could kind of throw the kid to the wall.

55:23.740 --> 55:26.740
Some kids, when they get thrown to the wolves, they get eaten.

55:26.740 --> 55:27.740
Right.

55:27.740 --> 55:28.740
I got thrown to the wolves.

55:28.740 --> 55:31.740
Others become edipus.

55:31.740 --> 55:34.740
Yo, you know what, you know, you know, Harmon?

55:34.740 --> 55:35.740
Harmon.

55:35.740 --> 55:36.740
It was also very...

55:36.740 --> 55:39.740
You know, Harmon, would you just say about my mama?

55:39.740 --> 55:41.740
Would you just Greek edipus say about my mama?

55:41.740 --> 55:44.740
I said, you may be destined to have sex with her.

55:44.740 --> 55:46.740
I implied, I implied.

55:46.740 --> 55:50.740
You know, all I'm gonna say is that good hair runs in the bloodline.

55:50.740 --> 55:53.740
Is your mom...

55:53.740 --> 55:54.740
Is your mom...

55:54.740 --> 55:55.740
Is your mom still with us?

55:55.740 --> 55:56.740
She is.

55:56.740 --> 55:57.740
Her name's Claudette Peterson.

55:57.740 --> 55:58.740
She's a beautiful woman, yeah.

55:58.740 --> 56:00.740
Where does she live?

56:00.740 --> 56:05.740
How beautiful is she, Dave?

56:05.740 --> 56:07.740
Oh, boy.

56:07.740 --> 56:08.740
Family.

56:08.740 --> 56:11.740
How beautiful is my mama?

56:11.740 --> 56:14.740
My mama is so beautiful.

56:14.740 --> 56:17.740
How beautiful is she?

56:17.740 --> 56:22.740
My mama is so beautiful that Aristotle had to go into the future,

56:22.740 --> 56:25.740
find my mama, find the time machine,

56:25.740 --> 56:30.740
go back in time so that he could write the right answer for what's beauty.

56:30.740 --> 56:34.740
Because when Aristotle wrote it right in the future past,

56:34.740 --> 56:36.740
he said beauty is Mama Klein.

56:44.740 --> 56:49.740
Find out what Dave Kline fucking looks like.

56:49.740 --> 56:58.740
He's like Spencer on ketamine.

56:58.740 --> 57:01.740
I was gonna say is super cool.

57:01.740 --> 57:04.740
You take a marijuana joint, you lace it with PCP.

57:04.740 --> 57:06.740
You ever have one of those, Dave?

57:06.740 --> 57:08.740
You ever puff a super cool?

57:08.740 --> 57:10.740
I actually love to smoke weed.

57:10.740 --> 57:12.740
That's a huge reason why I claimed out here.

57:12.740 --> 57:15.740
I love it, by the way. I don't know if Dave Kline has any take on that.

57:15.740 --> 57:17.740
Well, not to get too real on that,

57:17.740 --> 57:21.740
but I went to an all-boys Catholic super sport factory for high school.

57:21.740 --> 57:26.740
We lost a couple of boys in the towers,

57:26.740 --> 57:29.740
and I was in a classroom watching it.

57:29.740 --> 57:36.740
But you confused me with, you went to a factory for collegiate sports.

57:36.740 --> 57:38.740
Is that like a puppy mill?

57:38.740 --> 57:40.740
Like you went to a factory instead of a school,

57:40.740 --> 57:42.740
like we're gonna make you an athlete.

57:42.740 --> 57:44.740
What they do is like there's certain places in America where they say like,

57:44.740 --> 57:46.740
yo, society's real fucked up and they don't know anything.

57:46.740 --> 57:49.740
So like we don't really know a lot of things,

57:49.740 --> 57:51.740
but what we do know are like a couple of them.

57:51.740 --> 57:55.740
And like what we know,

57:55.740 --> 57:59.740
and like what we know, what we know we're gonna fucking like do.

57:59.740 --> 58:01.740
And we're gonna do this shit like hard.

58:01.740 --> 58:03.740
We're gonna go hard on what we know.

58:03.740 --> 58:05.740
Now listen, boy, we don't know nothing.

58:05.740 --> 58:09.740
You gotta never forget that you know nothing.

58:09.740 --> 58:11.740
Think about that.

58:11.740 --> 58:13.740
Nothing. You really know.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.740
Anyway, Harmon knows this. Harmon knows this.

58:15.740 --> 58:19.740
You don't know anything until you channel the fury into one or two pursuits.

58:19.740 --> 58:23.740
Yeah, start jumping down on them all the way, sniffing around.

58:23.740 --> 58:25.740
The exits are two in the back.

58:25.740 --> 58:27.740
One behind me.

58:27.740 --> 58:29.740
So your school had a lacrosse team?

58:29.740 --> 58:31.740
My school, no, no, my school like...

58:31.740 --> 58:33.740
Please file out an orderly fashion.

58:33.740 --> 58:35.740
This is a real story.

58:35.740 --> 58:38.740
Like for instance, our football team produced the defensive rookie

58:38.740 --> 58:40.740
of the year in the NFL.

58:40.740 --> 58:42.740
No shit, isn't it Brian Cushing?

58:42.740 --> 58:44.740
But you use the word factory.

58:44.740 --> 58:46.740
I just want to know, is that like an actual like cultural thing?

58:46.740 --> 58:48.740
Yeah, a sports factory or what are called magnet schools.

58:48.740 --> 58:50.740
Okay.

58:50.740 --> 58:52.740
For like virtuosic athletes.

58:52.740 --> 58:54.740
So not for nothing. I was a virtuosic swimmer.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.740
And I fly through the water and struggle on earth.

58:56.740 --> 58:59.740
You do seem like a super soldier program gone awry.

58:59.740 --> 59:04.740
It does seem like genetically you were gonna tell all the cards

59:04.740 --> 59:06.740
and then you just made...

59:06.740 --> 59:08.740
Well, I'm not to say... 90 degree choices.

59:08.740 --> 59:11.740
Gentlemen, you came out of the vat and you were like,

59:11.740 --> 59:13.740
where's the record store?

59:13.740 --> 59:17.740
Gentlemen, we finally received funding for Operation Metal Beast.

59:20.740 --> 59:26.740
It looks like if we took you into like an army barracks

59:26.740 --> 59:28.740
and you heard like buzz clippers coming for a while,

59:28.740 --> 59:32.740
like a really marketable guy might emerge.

59:32.740 --> 59:34.740
Here's the thing, Dan.

59:34.740 --> 59:37.740
I went to a school where I got to see a lot of things

59:37.740 --> 59:40.740
of like where the future was gonna go if I went a one direction.

59:40.740 --> 59:44.740
And I did a bad and crazy thing

59:44.740 --> 59:46.740
and got crazy addicted to drugs and alcohol.

59:46.740 --> 59:47.740
Which ones?

59:47.740 --> 59:48.740
Marijuana and alcohol.

59:48.740 --> 59:49.740
Marijuana.

59:49.740 --> 59:51.740
Put out most of the alcohol, but it was really...

59:51.740 --> 59:54.740
Well, for whatever, this is all personal choices.

59:54.740 --> 59:56.740
It was more than I was just a real dark human being

59:56.740 --> 59:58.740
and wasn't like powerful or skilled,

59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.740
which when you're not powerful or skilled

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.740
then you want to be powerful and skilled.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.740
There's like a shadow from your mom,

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.740
like you see these photos of your mom being super talented

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.740
and this mythology of your mom being so talented

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.740
that you had to be ripped from her womb

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.740
so that she could get back to work.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.740
Well, I guess my take on it is that I don't think it's a mythology.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740
I think everybody should...

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.740
Well, when I say mythology, I don't mean lies.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740
Right.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.740
I was afforded some truths that like you can be great

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.740
if you can like be patient

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.740
and only care about like a couple fucking things.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.740
Keep your family fucking close.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.740
You...

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.740
So it's family values.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.740
Family values.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.740
That's what the yips were for.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.740
Family values.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740
Family values.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.740
You finally got it.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:39.740
All right, Dave Kline, are you going to...

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.740
Are you living in LA now?

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.740
Are you going to be coming back with your yips and your...

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.740
This is the crazy thing.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.740
I came out here for my friend's wedding

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.740
and that turned into a...

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:47.740
Well, I might as well...

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.740
And that turned into a...

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.740
A nul...

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.740
Oh shit, an annulment.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.740
Sorry.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:55.740
No.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.740
It's not my...

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.740
It's just because of your toast, as it was, I was thinking.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.740
Just imagining your toast.

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.740
No comment.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.740
No comment.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.740
Look, I've known Stuart a long time!

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.740
Wow!

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740
Here's the thing.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.740
When you know someone

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.740
and you really know someone

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.740
and you don't know anyone else but that person

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.740
and you're focusing your knowledge on them

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.740
and you have a connection.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.740
And then the father of the bride is like,

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.740
What's the toast?

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.740
What are you toasting to?

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.740
I understand it's passionate.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.740
What is it?

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.740
Well, the funny thing is that this actually happened.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.740
It's pretty much exactly how it went down.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.740
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.740
But your friend's still married, right?

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.740
The gal is the most forgiving and beautiful

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.740
and wonderful and understanding person.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.740
Fucking hamburglers.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.740
Adam Goldberg's obviously jealous for obvious reasons.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.740
Have you ever seen the video game Space Ace?

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.740
Adam Goldberg turns into you when you hit that button.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.740
Daphne!

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.740
It's an old reference.

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.740
You can actually download Space Ace on the Apple Store.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.740
It's like five bucks.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.740
You can play this whole game.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.740
Blueith made these laser duck video games back then.

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.740
Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.740
It was incredible.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.740
We thought that's what interactivity was going to be.

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.740
It was going to be like a video game.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:28.740
You just watch a cartoon.

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.740
But all it was was you were watching a cartoon

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.740
and then an arrow would pop up and you had to hit the joystick the right way.

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.740
Anyways, so are your friends here?

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.740
By any chance did you come here with the wedding?

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.740
Are they still here?

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.740
Is the groom here?

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.740
I feel like we should bring the groom up

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.740
but we also need to bring our friends out.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.740
We're going to get the show on the run.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.740
I want to say one of the main...

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.740
There's a constellation of reasons I came out here.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.740
One of for real and it's so lame

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.740
but I'm going to give a voice to a lot of fucking people here.

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.740
What you do here is so cool and powerful

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.740
and chill and just opens up a lot of cool avenues.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.740
I think he knows what he's talking about.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.740
It's just...

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.740
I like you and Superman tonight.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.740
It's just...

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.740
And just thanks for having this

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.740
because I listened to the podcast

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.740
and let me know that LA has some shit that I want to do

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.740
that isn't like the crazy...

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.740
Are you Jeff Spielberg?

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.740
Are you Bob Tarantino?

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.740
It's like...

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.740
You can come out here and form a community of your own

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.740
with one of the biggest resources of LA

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.740
now that we can all make movies and put them on YouTube

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.740
it's actually not the place you need to come because there's sound stages.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.740
The reason to come now is because of the bumper crop of creative people

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.740
sitting around spinning their wheels.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.740
You can form your own communities.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.740
You can do new things.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.740
You can form a new industry.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.740
Dave Kline is now Genuflecting.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.740
Listen, listen.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.740
We're here because he's right

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.740
and I love you guys and I'm going to bounce much love.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.740
Oh, nice!

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:02.740
And he self exits.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.740
I like this guy.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.740
Dave Kline, the youp guy.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:10.740
Youp?

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.740
All right, all right.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.740
No, Scooter, no, Scooter, oh, Scooter, don't take that the wrong way.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.740
When I say Dave, you say youp.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.740
Dave, youp.

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740
Dave, youp.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.740
When I say Scooter, you spell it.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.740
Scooter, S-C-U-T-A.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.740
S-K-U-T-A.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.740
S-K-U-T-A.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.740
It rhymes so you remember it the next day.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.740
I tried to get out like mid-senaturing talk

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.740
and I felt that would destroy the crowd.

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.740
We needed you to hear us ballast for a while.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.740
As a physical buffer, like, you took a couple hits there.

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.740
Scooter.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.740
I didn't want to get me to deal with that.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.740
I did get like several, like, hair whips of the face.

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.740
And it's fine.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.740
It's going fine.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.740
No, Scooter, it's a different case with you.

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.740
I mean, that guy was, he was a character.

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.740
We like it when the characters self exit

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.740
because otherwise the alternative is like cattle prods and stuff like...

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.740
You have a very kind hearted nature.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.740
We knew we could have asked you to leave at any time.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.740
I'm sorry, I praised him for self exiting.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.740
Did not mean that you have been lingering like a...

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.740
I hadn't said anything for a while, sir.

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.740
Scooter, you're not leaving. You're staying the whole show up here.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.740
Scooter ain't leaving.

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:21.740
He's like a...

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:22.740
He's our fuzzy dice.

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.740
Scooter's fuzzy dice.

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.740
You're what makes...

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.740
You bring the whole Chevy together.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.740
I got my Scooter in the rearview.

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.740
Poppin' on the page tonight.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.740
It's a surf-aid song.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.740
This is a surf-aid song.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.740
Yeah, I don't know.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.740
Poppin' on the AIDS?

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.740
Yeah, I don't know.

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:46.740
I gotta run, run, run and be aware of AIDS today.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:50.740
Sorry, if the surfer culture came back but was more modern

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.740
and I got my red ribbon on my vest.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.740
I feel like we're living in a strange vacuum

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.740
after Dave Kline got off the stage.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.740
He brought a lot of power.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:08.740
It's like coming down off...

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.740
I actually see the serotonin that's just all left our bodies.

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.740
That's actually...

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.740
If you imagine that guy, but if he didn't like me,

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.740
that's my brother.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.740
That's what makes me kind of enamored with him.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.740
I'm like, ah, man.

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.740
All the zeal, none of the affection?

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.740
Yeah, I love this...

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.740
My brother was so passionate.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.740
That was a pleasure, Dave. Thank you, man.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.740
It's a very spiritual, interesting thing.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.740
I like that his life is mythical, that he has a goddess for a mom.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.740
Really, there's more there.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.740
We live in a world like...

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.740
We all have our filters, we all have our things that we keep hidden.

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:50.740
Dave, you come up here and you dance and you head bang and stuff like that.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.740
You also reveal a lot about yourself,

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:55.740
but even then, I'm sure there's stuff that you have to hide about yourself.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:56.740
I hide behind a suit.

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.740
He also revealed a lot about the skill of the carpenters

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.740
that assembled this platform.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.740
I don't think that that was ever expected of them.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.740
You think in LA, if you're not making a movie, you're probably phoning it in,

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.740
but whoever made this platform wasn't fucking around.

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:13.740
He revealed a lot about the limits of Scooters physical endurance.

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:17.740
Anyways...

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:22.740
I just like it when it's straight, no chaser. It was very good.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.740
It's been a wonderful, organic show, but only at the expense of...

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.740
We've deprived our friends.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:31.740
It's not deprived our audience friends anymore. Let's bring out DeMorge Brown and Spencer Crittenden, shall we?

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.740
It's our fact to follow, boys!

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.740
Hey, Spencer, what was it like to see the version of you

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.740
that would have existed had you been Superman

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.740
and Superman for a quest for peace had been a thing?

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.740
Eric clapped.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.740
You know, the Internet's a great place.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:14.740
I was trolling the Reddit thread about this episode

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.740
and someone pulled up a picture of him with his family from the past.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.740
Whoa!

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:22.740
It's creepy, man. It's a creepy world.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:25.740
Not the photo. You're saying the ability to see that is creepy.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:27.740
Yeah, I mean, who knew? Right?

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.740
Yeah.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.740
It's just you come up five seconds later.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.740
Your whole Zaba Search is up there on Reddit.

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:37.740
Zaba Search is a great website for pervs and stalkers, so...

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.740
You're one-stop cyber-bullying shop.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.740
Zaba Search.

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:47.740
What was the thing they used to humiliate that Star Wars kid?

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.740
Was that...

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.740
There was like a certain program that was referenced.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.740
Remember the Star Wars kid?

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.740
Yeah, it was like a video that was shared way before YouTube.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.740
I know it was on Napster.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.740
Yeah, it was like a file-sharing service.

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.740
Sorry, it was a Z...

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.740
I remember.

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.740
Yeah.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.740
I wonder what happened with that kid.

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.740
It's just like...

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.740
What a weird phenomenon that was.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.740
It's still such weird things.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:19.740
We're 20 years into everybody's listening, everybody's watching,

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:23.740
and we're still... I don't know if this will ever stop.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740
We're still so fascinated with the minutiae,

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:30.740
because these things pop up out of context and brought to the fore.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.740
Now I'm thinking of the Africa AIDS joke lady,

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.740
and how that phenomenon happened, how she was tweeting,

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.740
and she made this dumb, bad joke, because she's not a comedian.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:48.740
Exactly, yeah. And by the time she landed in Africa,

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.740
she was literally world-famous, and definitely fired,

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.740
and definitely...

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.740
It's absolutely no judgment on...

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.740
I think that's the thing is like...

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.740
Why judgment?

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:04.740
Outside of that, the phenomenon happening becomes the bigger story.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.740
We have the power now to destroy human life.

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.740
Outside of referendum, outside of criminal courts,

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.740
outside, we can really... We've always had that power,

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.740
but it was like broadcast news would occasionally graze

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.740
across an individual human life, and it was like,

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.740
oh, you were on the nightly news, and it was like a rarer thing.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:25.740
But now you can just go from the airport, fuck it around,

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.740
to the cover of Time Magazine in a bad way,

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.740
in the span of a three-hour span.

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.740
And I don't...

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:40.740
It's equal parts scary and kind of invigorating,

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.740
because also, this is the same thing that we're finding out.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.740
It's not like cops are all of a sudden going insane.

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.740
Clearly, it's been a high-pressure job for a while,

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.740
and some shit's been swept into the carpet,

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:56.740
and individual instances are becoming able to...

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.740
Everybody was wearing a camera at all times.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.740
Yeah, now we're just like...

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.740
We're awakening to this world of taste buds.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.740
Everything tastes all fucked up,

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:09.740
and we're focusing on these individual things.

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.740
I think my hope is that we can aggregate that

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:18.740
into some common-sense stuff about, for instance...

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.740
It's going to force people to be serious about what they say and what they do.

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:26.740
You see politicians now who are, I assume, older.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.740
Maybe this is why, but they're behind the curve,

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.740
and you have them telling stories, or their renditions of things,

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.740
because they're used to being caught up to,

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.740
if they're going to get vetted maybe a year or two years later,

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.740
and now it's happening pretty much instantly.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:43.740
It happened to Hillary when she was talking about that plane landing.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.740
Well, also, this new phenomenon, this next generation of politicians,

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.740
like, okay, so the guy that took over the Daily Show,

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.740
he made, when he was 20-something,

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:56.740
like, oh my God, the jokes that I made when I was in my 20s,

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.740
and the guy that's taken over the Daily Show,

01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.740
so we saw that phenomenon.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.740
It was like, he was vetted, because John Stuart is, for better or for worse,

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.740
a senator, and he's retiring,

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.740
and the guy taking his place needed to be vetted,

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.740
and he was vetted via the Internet,

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.740
and there's a public record of him growing as a comedian,

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.740
including all of his Jew jokes and his misogyny,

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.740
and stuff like him experimenting with trying to be funny.

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.740
And so, like, politicians, holy shit, man,

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.740
like, the next generation of people trying to be senators and presidents,

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.740
you're gonna be able to go back and go like, yeah,

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.740
like, I want to think of it as a good thing,

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.740
but my concern is that it's just gonna enter a new, like, Elizabethan kind of,

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.740
or Victorian, I don't know anything about history.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.740
No, no, no, no.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.740
That prudence will reign, and that will not free us.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.740
I think what's happening right now is that, like,

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:52.740
I mean, I hate politics, and I don't like Republicans or Democrats particularly,

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.740
and that people have this choice to make with Hillary,

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.740
she'll be the only nominee, right?

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:01.740
And there are people that are, like, she's not a perfect candidate,

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:04.740
but I think nowadays, I don't think there'll ever be such a thing as a perfect candidate again,

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.740
because there'll be no secrets, no mysteries.

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:11.740
All of your warrants and pimples and flaws are gonna be so much a matter of public record

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:16.740
from your entire existence that maybe there's a possible possibility.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.740
Or there will be superhumans like Barack Obama,

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:23.740
who, like, he, like, the thing that was significant about him to me

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.740
was his ability to withstand all of that shit.

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.740
That became a kind of hero's journey in and of itself.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.740
I started rooting for him, because as much as I hate politicians,

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.740
I'm like, fuck yeah, fuck you for trying to, like, dirty this guy,

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.740
and you can't find it, you can't figure it out,

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.740
you can't figure out why he's a bad guy.

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.740
But my concern is that then it's just, like, we evolve in that direction,

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.740
that these people continue to, like, you pull them out of their mother's womb

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.740
by either untimely or not,

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:53.740
and you put it on a scale and you barcode.

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.740
I mean, this is already my perception of the political career path.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.740
Like, they're pulled out of a womb in a different hospital.

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.740
Have you noticed that we're getting less upes now that they've got all out of a system?

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.740
Like, yeah, he's good.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:10.740
He's now in his mind, he's curled up in his mother's breast going,

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.740
youp.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.740
Youp.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:18.740
Or she's going, like, youp.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.740
It's way higher, way higher, she's a soprano.

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.740
Youp, and the glasses are breaking.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.740
That's why he brings two pairs of glasses on stage.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.740
What is my point?

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:33.740
When I was a communications major in college, my professor, Ken Sobiak, said,

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.740
with technology comes, we keep trying to figure out,

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.740
is this good technology or bad technology?

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.740
MP3, direct broadcast satellite, internet, YouTube.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.740
It always turns out it's more good and more bad.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:49.740
I keep, the internet...

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.740
We put Scooter to work apparently trying to kill me.

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.740
Scooter's now become bartender, I love that.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.740
The internet represents, like, new...

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.740
Scooter, you like one?

01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.740
No, I'm good, thank you.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:03.740
New opportunities for the truth to come out,

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:09.740
just worry that it represents a new agenda for lies to get more games of thrownies.

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.740
I think what it's going to inevitably do,

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:16.740
and it does, like, to people that, like, when you first get on Twitter

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:20.740
and you have five followers, you make poopy jokes and nanny jokes, you don't give a shit,

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.740
then, like, if you're, like, you, like, all of a sudden,

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.740
you cross a critical mass threshold of amount of followers,

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.740
you already have to start sanding the edges down

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:32.740
and then trimming, like, major, like, corners off and...

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.740
Yeah.

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.740
You have to decide what stick you are,

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.740
because it's not like I'm just, like, some bland vanilla person,

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.740
but I did have to pick which fucking specific stick I was.

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:42.740
You know what?

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:43.740
I was right.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.740
I did the wrong thing, and I made the right decision afterwards.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.740
I posted a video for, like, 10 seconds from...

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.740
I went against everything I believe in.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.740
I went to this music festival called Stagecoach,

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.740
because my friend was singing, and it's Coachella, but country music.

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.740
It's on the same fairgrounds.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.740
I despise music festivals because it's a bunch of douchebags,

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.740
and it's dirt everywhere.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:05.740
And you have to eat some horrible pizza,

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:07.740
and it was great because, like, you know,

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:10.740
I saw Merle Haggard, which I loved, and it was very fun.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:14.740
Everybody, every girl there, unanimously, in short shirts,

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.740
which seems like something that I'd be all for,

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:17.740
but it was like...

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.740
They were all just, like, young and just...

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.740
Like, it was just...

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.740
You think it was...

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.740
What bothered me, it was 100% white people,

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.740
and it's like, you can't have a festival like this.

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:27.740
Gross!

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.740
I know.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.740
Makes you old, Joe.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.740
No, no, it's like...

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.740
I don't like when it's homogenous like that.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.740
It's just like, that's not a festival.

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.740
Like, have a couple, like, other people.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.740
So anyway, I was walking by this...

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.740
Like, don't just have an all-white festival.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.740
So, not by design, it's a country festival, so, of course.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.740
But I was walking by this trash can,

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:57.740
and they have recycle bin, landfill bin, compost bin.

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.740
And there was a security guard kind of supine

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.740
laying there lazily on some hay bales next to those,

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.740
doing nothing.

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.740
Like a he-ha sketch.

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.740
Out of some corn stalks, and at some point,

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.740
Ray Price came through.

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.740
So, Ray Price was it.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.740
Anyway, there was this two girls,

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.740
and I took a video, which is quite hilarious,

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.740
and I'll show you after the show if you'd like to see it.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:22.740
Two girls wearing the same outfit, white short shirts,

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.740
and one girl was holding the other girl's hair back

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.740
as the other girl was vomiting,

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.740
and I thought quite cleverly into the compost bin.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.740
I thought that was nice.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.740
That's good, right?

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.740
That would be like the best compost ever.

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.740
Not landfill, it's not landfill.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.740
You don't want to recycle.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.740
But also it doesn't ruin the compost process, right?

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.740
I think you're speeding it up.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.740
I think you're halfway home.

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.740
I'm actually actually gay.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.740
I'm almost certain if you've vomited on a corn field,

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.740
you'd grow some nice ass corn.

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:51.740
Aren't there worms in there doing work?

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.740
So, I don't know if the vomit kills the worms,

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:54.740
maybe it's actually bad.

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.740
I think at this stage in the game,

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.740
there's nothing happening yet.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.740
Later on, you want worms to suck.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.740
Okay, I'm confused.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.740
I don't know.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.740
This is a trash can.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.740
I've never seen a compost bin at a major event,

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.740
so that's very cool.

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:05.740
And also, I thought,

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.740
how good for this gal for holding the hair back?

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:08.740
So, I guess, I'm like, got it.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.740
I'm walking by, my phone was in my hand,

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:10.740
I'm like, boop, video.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.740
And I go by, and what I wanted to do,

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:14.740
because the girl's legs was kind of spread,

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.740
and I wanted to end the shot by going down

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.740
and seeing the word compost,

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.740
because that would be hilarious.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.740
And then I would kind of zoom in

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.740
and I would win a Pulitzer Prize.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.740
When I get down to the final shot,

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.740
it turns out her legs were too close together

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.740
and I'm just now filming her ass.

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.740
And you're calling out, spread your legs.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.740
Spread them!

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.740
Show me the compost bag.

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.740
So, now I'm just creepy and McTavish,

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.740
I'm 49 years old, I'm 40.

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:41.740
Creepy and McTavish?

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:43.740
I'm doubled her age, their age.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.740
And the hilarious thing is,

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.740
when I watched a video, and it's so good,

01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.740
is that each time she vomits and she vomits,

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.740
she hurls twice in a six-second span,

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.740
she does a little turkey booty shake.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.740
And it's really funny,

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.740
so I put it online on Instagram,

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.740
I said, a good friend,

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.740
a good person holds her friend's hair back

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:02.740
when she's puking.

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:05.740
A great person makes sure it's in the compost bin.

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:09.740
Stagecoach 2015, hashtag booty shake.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.740
And it was up for fucking five seconds

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.740
and I had eight hate mails.

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.740
You invasive, creepy asshole,

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.740
take that down.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.740
Because the end of your shot, you showed it to me.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:20.740
I just ran out.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:21.740
You were trying for that compost label,

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.740
but you successfully just framed her ass.

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.740
Should I show it on camera?

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:26.740
Should we show this?

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:27.740
Yeah, you should.

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.740
The audience won't see it, though.

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:30.740
No, I'm not great.

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:32.740
Well, DeMorge, you were going to say something.

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:33.740
You kept getting derailed.

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.740
I'll show you after the show.

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.740
We were talking about the internet's dual capacity

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.740
for truth-bringing, but also then encouraging lies.

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.740
I just think that it's going to create other specialties,

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.740
other jobs, which are the people who,

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.740
the people who are telling these stories.

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.740
So especially in politics, you have people running for office

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.740
who are going to have these anecdotes.

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.740
I mean, Romney had an anecdote when she talked

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.740
about a very clear memory of at some sort of convention,

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.740
being at some sort of convention with his father,

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.740
and his father's holding him in his arms,

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:04.740
and the convention he's talking about,

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.740
he hadn't been born yet.

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:08.740
So all it took was an intern at Matt out to go,

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:09.740
hey, we got this thing,

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.740
and then that was the half the episode was that.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.740
And then just playing that over and over again,

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:14.740
and then going, let's look at the timeline

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.740
and doing graphics and other shit.

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.740
And so they're going to need people implanted in,

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.740
and what you had with Obama was you had people

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.740
who recognized, okay, here's another channel.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.740
You can't get everybody directly,

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.740
but there's this internet thing,

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.740
and there's this information that's traveling faster,

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.740
and there's a way people read information.

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.740
The whole results are coming out,

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.740
because news agencies are not news agencies anymore

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.740
by the normal sort of accords.

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:38.740
Now they just want clicks.

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:39.740
That's why he won't.

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.740
So they're reprinted, they're reprinted.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.740
Yeah, they were just faster.

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.740
They were faster, they were quicker, they were better.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.740
He's just like racing grandpa.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.740
It was exactly what JFK beat Nixon.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.740
It was just sort of like the new technology

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.740
and like Nixon, I don't know if it's apocryphal or not,

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.740
but Nixon refused makeup for the first debate.

01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.740
And sweated, and looked nervous, and sweated, and looked horrible.

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.740
And wore a wool suit on TV.

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.740
You're being digitized into a box,

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.740
and no one's gonna know you're wearing makeup.

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:06.740
And he was like, lay it on me,

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.740
like give me all the stage makeup.

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:08.740
Yeah.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.740
But yeah, and so with Obama,

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.740
you've got like, okay,

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.740
so you're good at having even Dan Harmon respect you.

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.740
Like, you can't even, like, he's bulletproof,

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.740
like from all views, you know, there's no stories,

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.740
there's no, you know, and then it's like,

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.740
but then it's like you're president for eight years,

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.740
and it's like Guantanamo doesn't close,

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:40.740
and the district, the fucking attorney general

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.740
is like waging war on pot dispensaries

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.740
while the pot is becoming increasingly legal.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.740
It's all the same horse shit, political shit,

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.740
anything that matters to me,

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.740
this president is no different from fucking anybody

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.740
that came before him,

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.740
he's just another fucking president.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.740
My question is like, are we ever gonna get to the point

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.740
where like something snaps where we have a choice

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.740
between having a human being as a civil servant?

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:06.740
We go like, well, this guy walks with a limp

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:09.740
and hates Malaysians and smoked pot

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:13.740
and had a bad divorce and like,

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.740
like here's all his flaws,

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.740
but blah, blah, blah, fucking blah,

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.740
and you know what, also, not even a big fan

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.740
of this hot button or that hot button,

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:29.740
but civil servant, like wants to save the country.

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:32.740
Where the presidency wasn't a celebrity office,

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.740
it used to be, it's kind of a very, very clerk.

01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:40.740
You go back to the days where the opposition,

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.740
the group in power, the group not in power

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.740
actually respected the presidency.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.740
And there was a point where that turned,

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.740
where they said, okay, now we're going to violate even that.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:53.740
Right, and there was a point when the League of Women Voters,

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.740
I think this was in the 70s,

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:58.740
who used to always moderate all the debates,

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.740
retired from the process,

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.740
and issued a statement that should be emblazoned

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:08.740
on tablets and thrown down upon us

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.740
as we dance naked around golden calves.

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.740
But instead, because it wasn't written by God

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.740
and was written by the League of Women Voters,

01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.740
is forgotten.

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.740
But they, in a paragraph, fucking just, like, summed up.

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.740
They said, we are not moderating debates anymore.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.740
I'm not quoting them at all.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740
Look it up.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.740
Look what they said when they retired from the thing.

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:34.740
I will paraphrase them for my own purposes and say,

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:37.740
they said, we are tired of participating

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:39.740
in a bipartisan sham.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:44.740
We are tired of participating in a rehearsed fucking thing.

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.740
This is all bullshit.

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.740
We are not doing this anymore.

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.740
Dave, can I get a yop?

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:51.740
There you are.

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.740
Like the Comedy Central roast was taken over by Comedy Central,

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.740
I assume, because the Friars had a problem with it,

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.740
for better or for worse.

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.740
Everyone was just like, okay, fine, ladies,

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.740
no more debates, hosted by you, anyways.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:10.740
And it's just like, there is a big, big, big, big,

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.740
we're drunk on our own success.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:16.740
When you're an empire, who's going to tell you to change?

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.740
Why would you ever change?

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.740
The reason you change is because you're losing.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.740
You got to look at the team above you and go,

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:22.740
we're getting our asses kicked.

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.740
We got to shake things up.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:27.740
But the people at the top, the empire is always just crumble

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.740
because they don't fucking figure it out.

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:31.740
Why can't you just figure it out?

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.740
Why can't you just look at your own bullshit

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.740
and go, look at this old mailman landing on the lawn

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.740
and his flying helicopter.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.740
All he's saying is, why is money involved in government?

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.740
That doesn't make any sense.

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:46.740
We're at King's Landing, where money runs everything,

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.740
but why the fuck are our civil servants?

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.740
Why should money affect your election?

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.740
That's insane.

01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.740
You're controlling the free world.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.740
That's a complete...

01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:58.740
If you just think about that with common sense for a second,

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:01.740
everything says campaign reform, campaign reform,

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.740
and everyone in charge of everything that would ever change that

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.740
is already lining their pockets so it would never change.

01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.740
So the fucking guy got in a goddamn flying bicycle,

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.740
and he called the government and said,

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.740
I'm coming in!

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.740
And he wrote letters saying, I'm coming in!

01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:18.740
And he mostly thought he'd be shot down

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:21.740
because he thought that might happen,

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.740
and if that happens,

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:25.740
maybe that will be a life well spent as an American.

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:28.740
And he landed on the fucking Congress's lawn

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:32.740
and because he got through safely, CNN is just going,

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:35.740
so how much more money should we spend on missile defense?

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.740
First the left, then the right.

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.740
This is the full view.

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:43.740
Well, I believe we should spend 50 million dollars on missiles.

01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:45.740
I mean, that guy could have been loaded with ISIS people.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:46.740
Well, I disagree.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:50.740
I think only three ISIS people could be on that copter.

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.740
So I think we should be 100 million.

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.740
Well, you've just witnessed the left and the right.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:56.740
Those are your margins.

01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.740
Get back to work, cocksuckers.

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.740
Sorry if you're a cocksucker.

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.740
This segment brought to you by Honda Motors.

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:09.740
How about the idea that this old fucking hippie civil servant

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.740
who delivers mail to people,

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:15.740
which is a government agency which has never taken any of your taxes,

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.740
that runs on its own money,

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:18.740
which is why they sold stamps.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.740
They figured out self-sufficiency in an age when the FCC

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.740
couldn't give up their fucking power enough to go away

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740
when grace would have demanded it.

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.740
Like, this guy is legacy.

01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.740
He should be a national hero.

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.740
In Europe, they celebrate the lives of people who tried to blow up the government.

01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.740
They're cool that way.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.740
They have maturity on their side.

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:39.740
They can handle it.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.740
We can't even fucking, like, we fire Bill Marver,

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.740
calling the terrorists not cowards,

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.740
and then we yell at him for being an Islamophobe 10 years later.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.740
Like, we don't know what we're doing except that we're scared.

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.740
We're scared to talk wrong or we're scared to be wrong.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.740
This fucking guy is 70 years old

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.740
and said in his manifesto video,

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:58.740
when he was absolutely established that he was perfectly sane.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740
He's fucking Joan of Arc saying, like,

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:05.740
I just don't want to have spent my life in this great country

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740
watching it fall apart.

01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:10.740
I just want to do something as I enter the twilight of my life

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.740
that I think might make a difference.

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:15.740
So I am a mailman, so I'm making this mail vehicle,

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.740
and I am writing a letter to each senator.

01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.740
We should listen to anybody that, in their spare time,

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.740
makes a goddamn helicopter plane thing.

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.740
That's pretty cool.

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.740
And we can't handle the fact

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.740
that we should have been better able to shoot him down.

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.740
First of all, who gives a fuck

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.740
if their goddamn House of Congress is defended?

01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:32.740
Fuck you.

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.740
It's not an important building.

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.740
It's a bunch of fucking idiots.

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740
They don't fucking care.

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.740
Defend the fucking coastline.

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.740
Defend the fucking, like, people.

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.740
If you want to kill senators, they're never there.

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.740
That's the worst place to bomb.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.740
Yeah, fucking blow up a bathhouse down the street.

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.740
Like, fuck, what the fuck are these people?

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.740
Blow up a TGI Friday.

01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.740
Throw up trees.

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.740
They're people that want to be powerful

01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.740
and work for no money.

01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.740
Oh, where will we find another one of those?

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.740
The government's not going to fucking fail

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740
if you blow up that.

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:02.740
Okay, all right.

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.740
You're dead.

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:04.740
All right.

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.740
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.740
Okay.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.740
Edit that.

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.740
Let's play it.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.740
Why don't we harness our blowing up things

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:13.740
into some shadow run?

01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:15.740
Scooter, will you play with us?

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:16.740
Yeah, absolutely.

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:22.740
Scooter, is he going to be mercy or the doctor?

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.740
What would you like to be?

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740
Oh, yeah, your choice, Scooter.

01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:29.740
The doctor is spelled with a K.

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.740
No, no, no.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:32.740
Good.

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.740
Yeah, I'll do the doctor.

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.740
I was trying to just run through what they'd done in the past.

01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.740
I'll do the doctor.

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.740
All right, so do we be cis-normative

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:39.740
and bring up a girl to play mercy,

01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:42.740
or do we, we haven't had any women up here.

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:45.740
Adam, Adam, no, you had your moment, Adam.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.740
It's fucking Dave Kline up here to fucking do this.

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740
Wait, really?

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.740
No.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740
No, no, Dave Kline had his spotlight.

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.740
I saw a timid hand here.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.740
Oh, you're Jen, you're up before.

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.740
Well, okay, let's, let's, let's get some new blood.

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:03.740
Right here, what's your name?

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:04.740
Equally timid hand.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.740
I'm Alisa.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740
Alisa?

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.740
Like the name would, that's the audition.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.740
Do you want to come up?

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:11.740
Okay.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:14.740
Alisa, everybody, welcome here to the stage.

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:22.740
I guess if you said I am Hitler, it would be a name,

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.740
it would be like, ah, oh, Hitler.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.740
All right, Dan, do you want to pass down the character sheets, please?

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:31.740
Alisa, what's your, what's your backstory?

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.740
Well, I'm, oh, hi, I'm,

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.740
You can figure this out, right?

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:37.740
It's a pile of folders.

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.740
Unfortunately, my background isn't as cool as everyone else's,

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:41.740
you know, but,

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.740
Whose background tonight has been cool?

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:50.060
cool. Dave fucking crying. Yeah, Dave, I can't even compare to that. I was born and raised

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:56.020
in the valley, so. Well, okay. So, are you a regular here? Is this your first show? Oh

01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:01.180
no, I've been here a couple times actually. You know, I sit in the corner. Do you listen

01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:07.980
all the time? Uh, me mean online? Because I'm kind of cheap. I don't. You from the valley?

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:12.540
What city? North Hills. Yeah, what high school did you go to? James Monroe High School. James

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:19.100
Monroe? Monroe. Monroe. Yeah. Yeah. Was it was it was it was a skiddy? Yeah. Pretty nasty. You

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:24.740
know, Monroe hit women. Was that LA Unified? Or is that a different thing as Valley? Yeah,

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:30.340
yeah. See anybody from the LA area knows about LA USD. It's kind of like, uh, I don't know.

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.780
I don't know anything about that. Kids come up, they talk about their school. They go like,

01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:39.140
I'm from what a, what a, what a work up. And I go like, Oh, cool. Most people who have actually

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:42.220
lived in the valley have never heard of Monroe. They know of the other schools

01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:48.580
around there, but never Monroe. It's a failure school. What are you, so you're a

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:53.820
college student? What's your what's your ambition? What's your interest? Are you

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:59.620
in high school? No. I dropped out of college twice. Wait, I got confused.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:04.340
Oh, he asked you what school you went to. Yeah, that's a school, high school. What are you, what's

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:09.780
your do you have a do you have a like a light that you're headed towards? I hope

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:14.940
not. Is she dying? That would be terrible, I think. I'm kind of young. An ambition,

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:20.860
you know, a fantasy, good job. Well, I do have a job and working at a Universal

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:24.220
Studios Hollywood for the past four years as a ride operator. Oh, yeah,

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:27.900
operator. Which ride? I used to work there. What were you working? I used to work at

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:32.260
Jurassic Park River Adventure, Despicable Me, Minion, Mayhem, The Mummy Ride, and

01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:36.300
Super Silly Funnet. I spent a summer dressed up as Harry from Harry and the

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:43.100
Hennison's in a Sasquatch suit. I want to ask you about the Jurassic Park ride,

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:47.380
but I think you'll get fired because it'll come back to you. It's the

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:51.220
best place to work. There's an urban myth about the ride about the t-rex

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:55.620
malfunctioning and spraying searing hot hydraulic fluid onto the people. That is

01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.500
actually true and it doesn't, they don't do that anymore. Now it's just

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.620
pressurized there. Oh, no, they just roar at you. Now they just roar at you. Okay, yeah, now it's just, now it's okay, now nothing

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:09.620
gets sprayed at you. Chris Pratt came in and trained the t-rex. Stay. Like,

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:14.020
touched his nose and was just like, be still. When that doesn't really move. I was

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:17.940
working at Universal when that ride first opened, Jurassic Park ride. Well, just, I

01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.580
think just after it opened and they wanted to put walk-around characters in

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.460
there and so they wanted, like, like for the back of the future they had like a

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:26.820
Doc Brown and he would run around and stuff and I was part of the walk. He's actually still there.

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:32.100
Might be the same guy. No, he's the actual original guy died like a

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:36.900
couple years ago. Yeah. I'm almost certain I shared a break room with him.

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:42.180
He was a sweetheart though. But there was, I went and auditioned. They thought

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:45.460
about having a, who's the doctor, the Attenborough from?

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:47.140
Dr. Hammond.

01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.660
Dr. Hammond. Hammond?

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.180
John Hammond. John Hammond.

01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:56.020
Him and a Malcolm, a Goldblum character and I went to the hand prop lot and I got

01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:01.060
a leather jacket and I rehearsed and learned a Jeff Goldblum impression and

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:05.620
went to the hand prop lot, which is this enormous building down in the back lot.

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.820
And I walked in and I said, do you have Jeff Goldblum's glasses from Jurassic

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:12.420
Park? And they go, uh, yeah, we have the clear ones and the sunglasses. I go, okay,

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.860
where are they? I was just, I just walked in, no one knew who I was.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.420
I think I, he goes, it's right here. He opened the case. He walked away. I just went,

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:26.420
took a, so on my, on my table, I still have the actual glasses that Goldblum wore.

01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:34.020
Cause I'm a bad person.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.780
That is the, you know, I, I talked about women's rights at one point and you guys

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:41.540
were pretty docile.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.380
But stealing, no.

01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:46.660
Yeah. I'm sorry. I keep them up on my desk. I look at them once around and go,

01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:51.700
those are fucking Dr. Malcolm's glasses, man.

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:54.980
You guys, they had his prescriptions in there. So I had them popped out, took them

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:58.740
to a lens place and had them put just regular sunglasses.

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:03.860
Uh, god damn it. I don't want to do rail. Okay. We should, we should start, but the

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:08.420
fucking Jurassic world trailer came out and, uh, yeah, it was like, like, I, uh,

01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.900
like, I don't know. It's like, like, I don't know. There's somebody,

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.620
sort of like informed, like, uh, nerds kind of hating on it. Like, it's like, oh,

01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:19.300
it's going to be bad, but I don't really see any evidence. I mean, what the fuck

01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:24.260
do you want from a, I wanted that world to have a history with the guy.

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:28.580
Well, you know, the girl, she had a history with Chris Pratt that they revealed.

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.500
That's dumb. That's too dot connected to me.

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:37.460
Yeah. Well, I mean, that's on the trailer. What, what did she, it was on the thing I saw.

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:37.940
I don't know.

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.900
Oh, was that not the trailer? That makes more sense. If it's not a trailer.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:47.780
Well, Sam Neill is a backstory with his like hatred of children. I mean, like, I don't know.

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.940
Like Jurassic Park was a pretty satisfying popcorn movie. And, you know, like, like in the

01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.500
Michael Creighton tradition of theme parks that seem like great ideas that then go wrong. And

01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.580
what, what that brings out of people, like we've had a couple of Jurassic Park sequels that are

01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:05.540
kind of like off the mark, given that that that's what really hits the spot is like, hey, it's a

01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:09.940
park and then the dinosaurs and then it goes wrong. That's like the first movie is like the

01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:14.980
park's not open yet. How the fucking parks open seems like a good sequel. Like, I love the premise.

01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:19.220
I really do. But I don't, I don't, I don't like him like being a raptor whisperer. I think that's,

01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:23.620
I don't think you need that. I like the idea of like the park is open. There's, there's a couple

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.260
thousand visitors and now disaster happen again. Yeah. It's kind of a nice parallel to the first

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.740
one and then bigger scale. Yeah. I mean, it's a disaster movie. Just make it. It's like Erwin

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:37.700
Allen is blazing inferno. If they made a bigger, crazier sea world Jurassic Park, I'd be totally

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:42.020
fine with that. It's a whole like those decades where it was like, we just like to go to movies

01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:47.140
and watch like, like, like man's ambition, just go to shit. You know, it's like, it's just fun.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:50.980
And there's a couple characters and they're the get out. You know, you introduce each character,

01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:57.140
like, I'm the son of an opera singer and I, you get really specific. You find these characters

01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:01.860
and it's like, you kind of get to pick your own, you know, favorite. Like, I hope that that guy

01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:07.300
dies. Get picked off one by one and then one guy walks away from the whole fucking thing,

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:14.340
found a park and goes like, the park is closed. All right. I think that's the movie. Spencer,

01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:18.900
catch us and scoot it up on the events of last, last time. I'm sorry. One more thing.

01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:27.540
Frank Sinatra. This is for Los Angeles people. If anyone that's been to universal city walk,

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:33.220
like, do you, do you get high off the shot of the pterodactyls plucking people off and like,

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:37.940
so because it just looks like the city walk and it just like, I've been on that city walk

01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:43.460
and I just want like flying lizards to come and just grab random people. All right.

01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:49.140
Spencer, are you good to go? Yeah, I just want to say that when Dan was telling his story about

01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:55.300
that male guy, I thought it was a metaphor for like two thirds of the story. No, it really happened.

01:36:55.300 --> 01:37:04.100
Yeah. Like the president is like a mailman with a flying bicycle. And I want to know what's going

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:08.020
on with that guy. See, I would vote for that guy. Is that guy in Guantanamo now? Like, well,

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:12.100
is it, I mean, is he going to die mysteriously when we're not paid attention? He's duct taped

01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:17.300
to a folding chair somewhere. We should have him on the show. Oh, yeah. And we should get him some

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:23.300
D&D books if he's in prison. Don't let me forget about that. Spencer, do we have a guest

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:30.820
uh, uh, encapsulator? Uh, yeah. His name was Steven Bassett. And also AIDS. AIDS also wrote

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:37.140
this intro. Steven Bassett, you said? I think, yeah. Any relation to Angela? I hope not. All right.

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:43.860
Here we go. Damn it. That would be so good.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:51.540
Good. Oh, am I? You want to? I don't care.

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.900
And I don't, I don't, I don't want to distract everybody, but Spencer told me this is the music

01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:04.420
he fucks to. So don't, I mean, just try to listen to the recap, but then don't picture that.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:10.420
Yeah.

01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:20.500
Last time on Heart. After a destroyed but surprisingly effective capture of crime syndicate

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:25.860
member Arturo Spaguli, our heroes took turns asking intimidating questions that left the

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:32.100
man confused. Nightblade cut through the confusion and with wide eyes and a lacerated hand, Arturo

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:36.980
pointed them back to the burger tyrant. At the restaurant, Eve started things off using her

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:43.300
stun gloves on the nearby guard, kicking him into cry cooks. Dr. Friend used a magical barrier to

01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:49.940
trap the enemies while Nightblade found jelly dervish locked in a freezer. Uh, sorry, I'm

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:55.620
truncating this a little bit. It's long. Child in tow, the group quickly left the shot of burger

01:38:55.620 --> 01:39:01.380
tyrant with the Doritos eating horticard, driving them away to a distinct dark area somewhere in

01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:08.020
Seattle. But what will they do when they get there? Did Eve ruin the song butterfly kisses for

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:15.380
everyone? Let's find out now. All right. Thank you now.

01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:24.340
So the whole squad right now we're all in the van. We got jelly dervish who's a 10 year old kid,

01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:30.180
right? Uh, eight. Was he sure? I don't know. He's a youngster. Let's yeah. Um, and he's in the van

01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:36.340
with us. And you also got our turtle Spagooly in the van and he's tied up. Right? Yep. And okay.

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:46.180
So are we at the dark area? You're in a dark area. What? Uh, we got jelly dervish. We got to bring

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:52.100
him back to our Johnson, right? Don't don't we have to bring him back to our Mr. Johnson? Yeah,

01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:58.100
who was that by the way? That's our turtle talking. Cool Dave was retired for a while, right? Oh,

01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:05.220
oh, what? Wait, who's asking? Who's Oh, just me. Oh, well, no, don't ask about our Johnson. Oh,

01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:14.100
rude. Just trying to make a special name of our Johnson. What was his name? Ryan dervish. Ryan

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:23.380
dervish. Hey, uh, jelly jelly, we want to bring you back to your dad so we can get paid. You okay

01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:30.900
with that? Oh, interesting. His dad, you say. Who's this talking? Arturo. Okay. All right,

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:36.020
you've got the floor. Oh, I'm just listening to your guys conversation. Those are mine. Seems

01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:40.020
like you're doing more than that. Seems like a very assertive form of listening.

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:49.460
Listening usually takes the form of you don't get to be a mafia man by listening unassertively.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:56.100
Okay. So wait, you saying you didn't know that this kid was was Ryan dervish's son? No,

01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:01.460
I just didn't know he hired you guys to, you know, steal him from us. It's you sound so titillated

01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:06.420
by that you're talking like a guy that wants to get whacked. I'm talking about a guy who knows

01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:13.860
who to whack next. Might I suppose that one of us stays with the Spiguli art also that the rest of

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:22.900
us get out of the car and come to some sort of plane. Yeah, sounds good. So this is this is what

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:27.460
happens. We all get out of the band except for who's staying. Which one of you tied up. We can just

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:33.780
leave him there. I'm good. I someone should stay with him. I'll stay with Arturo. This is this

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.660
is good. I feel like you guys might be a little little one on one scene coming up with you and

01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:48.900
Arturo Spiguli. This was the sort of horticards plan for entertainment purposes. On the com link,

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:53.460
is it possible I might call this dervish and find out where he is? Yeah. This is what I do.

01:41:54.180 --> 01:42:01.700
And bleep, bleep, bleep. Hey, how's it going? Well, we have your, your, your, your target.

01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:09.220
That's fantastic. Can you give us some sort of location or give me a fix on where you are? Why

01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:16.740
don't you meet me at Hank's last stand where we first met? Will you tell those people there to

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:22.020
stand the fuck down and leave me alone? Horticard. Are you in a different place? I'm on the

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:27.220
com link. Are you on the com with Ryan Dervish right now? This is exactly what I am. Yeah.

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:33.540
Yeah. I think we, do we want to let him know that we just told Spiguli that he hired, that he

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:39.060
hired us? That that might be sensitive information. For the record, I have shot down my com link on

01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:44.260
mute for a brief moment. I feel, I feel like that might be something he wouldn't want us to have said.

01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:49.380
Like they're supposed to be more of a blackout. Yeah. I think we kind of took the shadow out of

01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:55.460
the shadow run. I made it more of a great day marathon. More of a Honolulu marathon time,

01:42:55.460 --> 01:43:00.260
jog. Maybe we could tell him it when we get to the place. Where'd you go? Like drop him off and

01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:06.180
then just like book it. Probably after the payment. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Okay. He'll probably want

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:11.460
to know that. Okay. Well, look, well, that's why I'll stay with Arturo. I mean, like, you know,

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:20.500
one good threat to repercuss deserves another. You can punch that up later when we go drop the

01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:31.540
kid off. Not a writer. I'm a bounty hunter. All right. So we we I call an Uber to get us and the

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:37.780
kid to take it to take us to go drop off. I hate that the out survived lift. I know that they were

01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:47.140
better, right? Like do the robots also harass women? I'm a feminist. I have I have and I stole

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:55.940
Jeff Goldblum's glass. No, you didn't. You fucking liar. So for our use. All right. So I call up a

01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:00.740
new bird. We're eight. You're already you have the Uber. Okay. So how far away is it is Ryan

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:09.940
Dervish from us? Oh, not far. With with Arturo Spagulli and toe, you arrive at Hank's last stand.

01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:16.500
You're your home base sort of thing. It's the old rotten bar. You you you walk in and you see

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:21.540
there's a there's a guy here. It's normally pretty empty this place. But this guy, he's wearing he's

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:27.060
wearing a fabulous blue and magenta suit with a face mask. And he's got a bow slung over his

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:33.780
shoulder. He's just enjoying a glass of water. Can I use my sense of perception to see what sort

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:40.260
of dangers might exist? He has the danger of potentially shooting you with one of his arrows

01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:47.700
in his bow. Other than that, you can't really perceive any any dangers. Now, Mercy, you're

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:54.260
our face woman. You want to go up there and do the how do you do this? Yeah, I've got a was it

01:44:54.260 --> 01:45:00.980
plus two for impressions? Yes, I do. All right. So I want to walk over to this really bright dude.

01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:13.860
Hi. What are you doing here? I'm just having a drink alone. I've never seen you around here before.

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:23.140
That's not surprising. What brings you around here in this necklace? It's kind of dark and

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:32.100
skewy around here. And you seem like a bright color fellow. Just to meet a friend. I look around

01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:37.220
to see if Ryan Dervish is in the room. Ryan Dervish is he's talking to Teddy over in the corner.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:43.220
Okay, let's I guess we should keep that here right? Yeah, we'll keep an eye on that guy. But

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:48.820
let's go over and drop off the football over to Ryan Dervish. I'll stay with the colorful fellow

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:56.180
just in case. Okay, I take I take. Well, you're a negotiator. So maybe you should she should

01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:01.060
take her over to the to Ryan Dervish, right? Or take jelly over whatever you guys want, man.

01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:06.340
It'd be kind of weird if I walked away from this guy. I think it was kind of going weird.

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:15.780
It's weird if you stay there, I think. I'll just say I'll like I'll see him later and I walk away.

01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.820
Okay, so you have to take a shit. I have to go potty. I'll see you later.

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:28.420
I haven't made contact with him yet. So I can stand casually by. Yeah, if I see him do anything

01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:34.020
funny with the the bow, I can throw up a physical barrier. That's nice. Nice, doc. Nice, doc. So

01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:40.660
doc and I will hang back and keep an eye on on fancy suit bow guy. While mercy goes over and

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:47.460
drops off Ryan and mercy don't forget to get that extra money. Alright, so we got the kid walk over

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:55.860
to Teddy and the dude. Oh, you brought up my son and jelly. Thank you so much. I am overcome with

01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:04.660
emotion. I'm so glad to hear that. Where's our payment? Was there any? Was there any mishaps or

01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:12.980
maybe speed bumps along the way? I will have to say not so good. We are we did everything the way

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:18.820
you wanted it to be very low key. It sounds like it. I like that. Here is yours monies.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:26.740
You know, just just, you know, it was it was kind of a long journey and we had, you know,

01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:33.380
we had our expenses food and water and all that. You took a couple hours. I'm really impressed.

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:39.540
You spent that much on food and expenses. We had to buy a lot. We've got a lot of hamburgers.

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:44.740
You know, it takes a lot to keep up these appearances. We gotta look like we're doing

01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:50.980
something not skeevy. Well, I gotta say when you first took this job, I told you I was very poor.

01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:56.020
I did not have a lot of money and we agreed upon a price based on that basis. You see,

01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:01.220
that is very true. But we went through a lot just to get your precious, adoring son who was

01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:07.540
wonderful the entire way, by the way. And as we agreed, I will pay extra. He takes off his shoe

01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:13.620
and gives it to you. Oh, I gave us a shoe today. How much money did we get? 500 a piece, I think.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:18.660
And a shoe. All right. Two shoes now. Two shoes. Oh, we got both shoes. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:27.220
Well, I'm still with Archero's. Yeah. Where am I? Well, I thought in the van, I think you were

01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:33.300
both in you were all in the Uber and you're just in the Uber outside with him in the bar. Yeah.

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:39.940
And I say, okay, so I go. So, you know, about that active listening thing you learned in the mafia.

01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:48.900
Yeah. So I learned it too. So like, I couldn't help but hear that you think that you might

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:55.060
whack somebody based on something you heard. I might. Right. So puts you in a weird position now,

01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:02.980
right? I don't. What do you mean? Well, like, I know that you're going to make me look like a bad

01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:11.300
employee if I don't kill you. Hmm. So like, conflict, me in a world where life means nothing.

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.940
What is it worth it to you? You already got paid, right? Well, what is a bullet cost?

01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:30.820
Wow. Jesus Christ. Unlike you, my job is based on a reputation. Being a classy guy,

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.660
you know, people need to be able to trust me. Apparently, you just leave a trail of slime

01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:41.060
wherever you go. You know, you'll fuck over anybody. Hodergaard has a simultaneously on

01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:50.420
comlink called up another Uber, and then also lifted his rifle just in case. Another Rupert?

01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:56.660
Rifle. Uber, Uber. Okay, sorry. Why don't we just boil it down to this? I mean, I feel like in a

01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:01.620
world of muck where my job is to rake through shit and make money doing it, I had this one job

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:06.660
where I rescue a kid and bring him back to his dad, and you're attempting to make that job dirty.

01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:11.940
And all I got to do to clean it up is shoot one piece of shit. And, you know, destroy a lot of

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:19.940
security footage. Sorry, what? I'm just saying. Face is all over the place in that burger tyrant.

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.500
So you're saying you're not the only link between, you know, this rescue mission and

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:32.500
Jelly's father? No, no, I'm not. There's all sorts of technology that protects, you know, us.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.380
So in other words, if I were to take an active interest in the long, happy life of Jelly and his

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:45.060
father, I would have to be very vigilant. Yeah, I'd say that. So I would do that either by having

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:51.220
security cameras of my own, constantly spending a lot of money on that, or as one man who is able

01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:57.780
to get you in the back of a car, I could just say to you, say to your friends, if anything ever happens,

01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:02.660
it would be bad for everybody all the time. They would never know when. They'd be taking a bath.

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:12.660
I'd be the rubber ducky. They would be eating burgers in a restaurant. I'd be the mayonnaise.

01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:20.660
My name is Jim Nightblade. Do one more scenario. Or maybe, like, do X3 or four more of those.

01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:29.140
They'd be at the movies, and a guy'd be going, yup. And they'd go, who's that? And it'd be me,

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:36.660
and my popcorn would be a gun. I'm just saying, like, I keep a backlog. Like, I'm not like you.

01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:42.260
I don't spin a web and, like, draw the joy from other people. I'm on the run, and I go from job

01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:48.100
to job. And when I do a job for somebody, and the job is to keep their son alive, I check back.

01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:54.740
If I check back, I hold you accountable. You're like my employee now, and my payment is your life.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:02.420
You deal with the security cameras. You deal with all that. Because if anything ever happens,

01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:08.660
like, it's you that gets fired first, air quotes, and around fired. Fired from God's universe.

01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:18.420
With difficult arbitration, it won't be like you're walking down the sidewalk, and you have a

01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:25.460
phenomenon stroke. It'll just be like, I'll take you into a warehouse, and I'll take shit out on you.

01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.340
I'll use you as an excuse to vent things that all men have inside them.

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:40.100
You know what they do in prison, right? They look at child rapists, and they go like,

01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:47.780
oh, finally a reason to be who we are. This world's a prison. You're a pedophile.

01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:50.340
Cliffhanger!

01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:59.220
That's not a cliffhanger. I mean, it's a cliffhanger.

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.180
All right, well, it's a it's a reason to tune in next week. Thanks, Scoota.

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:09.060
Scoota, everybody, please. The man of the hour, Scoota.

01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:15.940
Alyssa. S-C-U-T-A. S-K-U. S-K-U-T-A.

01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:19.460
DeMorge Brown, Alyssa.

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:29.220
Alyssa, goodbye. Chris and Justin and, uh, let's thank Dave, a motherfucking client for coming up,

01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:29.780
shall we?

01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.180
Yeah, Dave, fine. Thank you, Alyssa.

01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:34.500
Adam Goldberg, Superman, Eric. Thank you.

01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:39.140
Spencer Crittenden, and I'm Jeff Davis, and your mayor one more time is Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:43.780
Thank you so much for coming. We worship and adore you.

01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:52.100
Did you get any of that? It's a Scoota show!
