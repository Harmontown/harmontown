{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:14.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the Nerds Outdater, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:26.000\nPlease welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Harmonious Monk himself, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:33.000\nNow I never wanna see somebody from where you get me.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:43.000\nThat was nice, did the Beatles give us some music?\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.920\nDo you know who that is?\n\n00:44.920 --> 00:46.920\nTitanic Sinclair.\n\n00:46.920 --> 00:52.480\nThat's our friend Titanic Sinclair from Fibble Dibbles.\n\n00:52.480 --> 00:57.800\nFrom Frisbee Golf and the fuck around trio.\n\n00:57.800 --> 01:08.720\nHardcore Harmontown fans will remember the Titanic and Mars Visigoth.\n\n01:08.720 --> 01:09.720\nWhat's the name?\n\n01:09.720 --> 01:10.720\nMars Argo.\n\n01:10.720 --> 01:11.720\nMars Visigoth.\n\n01:11.720 --> 01:15.760\nThat was a really early stuff.\n\n01:15.760 --> 01:20.920\nThe lovely Mars Argo and Titanic were on our show when they released that song.\n\n01:20.920 --> 01:25.160\nIt became an unintentional internet sensation because it used the iPhone's default ring\n\n01:25.160 --> 01:27.560\ntone as like a melody.\n\n01:27.560 --> 01:32.560\nAnd some people were just like, I hope you die in fire.\n\n01:32.560 --> 01:33.560\nWhat's up?\n\n01:33.560 --> 01:34.560\nThat was the USS Hooper.\n\n01:34.560 --> 01:35.560\nAh!\n\n01:35.560 --> 01:36.560\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n01:36.560 --> 01:40.160\nAdam Goldberg's back.\n\n01:40.160 --> 01:43.520\nWas that the earliest we've been Goldberg'd in the show?\n\n01:43.520 --> 01:45.320\nWell, he wanted us to know.\n\n01:45.320 --> 01:46.320\nHe wanted us to know.\n\n01:46.320 --> 01:47.320\nI'm back, baby.\n\n01:47.320 --> 01:49.320\nAdam, come on.\n\n01:49.320 --> 01:51.040\nGet up here and give us a...\n\n01:51.040 --> 01:53.080\nHello, brother.\n\n01:53.080 --> 01:54.560\nOh!\n\n01:54.560 --> 01:56.620\nWait.\n\n01:56.620 --> 02:08.880\nThin eyes Goldberg.\n\n02:08.880 --> 02:13.200\nGoldberg came up, he pressed the flesh, he did a little dance, so that was really nice.\n\n02:13.200 --> 02:20.840\nAbsence makes the heart grow fonder, but no presence makes it grow unfound faster than...\n\n02:20.840 --> 02:26.880\nSounds like a group sequel.\n\n02:26.880 --> 02:30.560\nYou do hear, Adam, the conflicted response of what we invite you up.\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:31.560\nThey love it.\n\n02:31.560 --> 02:35.240\nI would call it right down the middle of happiness and sadness.\n\n02:35.240 --> 02:36.240\nSounds like we're life-lives.\n\n02:36.240 --> 02:37.240\nWell, I'm happy.\n\n02:37.240 --> 02:38.240\nI missed you.\n\n02:38.240 --> 02:39.240\nI thought you were...\n\n02:39.240 --> 02:40.240\nI thought you were...\n\n02:40.240 --> 02:41.240\nI assumed you had gone.\n\n02:41.240 --> 02:42.240\nYou're a young man.\n\n02:42.240 --> 02:43.240\nPeople go through phases.\n\n02:43.240 --> 02:48.760\nMaybe you exited the phase of total masochism and sadism.\n\n02:48.760 --> 02:50.560\nYeah, I was right.\n\n02:50.560 --> 02:54.240\nThat middle line between happiness and sadness, as someone said.\n\n02:54.240 --> 02:55.240\nI don't...\n\n02:55.240 --> 02:56.240\nRight.\n\n02:56.240 --> 02:57.240\nJeff?\n\n02:57.240 --> 02:58.240\nWas it...\n\n02:58.240 --> 02:59.240\nI'm thinking it was a J.\n\n02:59.240 --> 03:00.240\nSo, what have you been up to?\n\n03:00.240 --> 03:02.600\nYeah, give us the Goldberg news.\n\n03:02.600 --> 03:04.240\nWhat's going down?\n\n03:04.240 --> 03:07.240\nBusiness is good at my web company, Adam Goldberg's web company.\n\n03:07.240 --> 03:12.680\nI'm not going to bring shame onto that web company by associating myself with it, which\n\n03:12.680 --> 03:17.560\nis a self-hating thing to say, but it turns out, you know, the Minecraft server that's\n\n03:17.560 --> 03:22.000\ndedicated to Harmontown, they burned me alive.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.360\nI was burned in effigy.\n\n03:24.360 --> 03:25.360\nSo, that's what happened to me.\n\n03:25.360 --> 03:26.680\nI was having a nice life.\n\n03:26.680 --> 03:28.800\nI was in a wrestling-based RPG.\n\n03:28.800 --> 03:30.240\nI was getting drunk for Passover.\n\n03:30.240 --> 03:36.240\nI was doing as one does, and then it turns out people burned a symbol of me alive to\n\n03:36.240 --> 03:44.240\nrepresent how much they want to play Minecraft with you, which is weird.\n\n03:44.240 --> 03:45.840\nSo they made, like, out of blocks.\n\n03:45.840 --> 03:46.840\nThey made it.\n\n03:46.840 --> 03:52.440\nYeah, wooden Adam Goldberg to represent a guy from a podcast, and then they sent me on\n\n03:52.440 --> 03:53.440\nvirtual fire.\n\n03:53.440 --> 03:54.440\nDid it resemble you?\n\n03:54.440 --> 03:55.440\nDid they make a little...\n\n03:55.440 --> 03:56.440\nI didn't go there.\n\n03:56.440 --> 03:57.440\nI'm not...\n\n03:57.440 --> 03:59.520\nI don't think I'd be very welcome on a server that would burn a picture of me.\n\n03:59.520 --> 04:01.600\nSo, how did you find out this information?\n\n04:01.600 --> 04:06.680\nThey posted it publicly, and I just... not a lot of upvotes, and the weird thing is,\n\n04:06.680 --> 04:08.120\na lot of people didn't attend.\n\n04:08.120 --> 04:09.120\nIt's like...\n\n04:09.120 --> 04:14.520\nLike, there was a huge thing to have a Goldberg roast, not like a fun comedic roast, which\n\n04:14.520 --> 04:16.600\nonly happens when I throw one for myself.\n\n04:16.600 --> 04:18.000\nAn actual Salem roast.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:25.920\nYeah, an actual... burn the representation of a guy who talks, and that's bad, so Jesus\n\n04:25.920 --> 04:26.920\nChrist.\n\n04:26.920 --> 04:27.920\nHow you been, Deno?\n\n04:27.920 --> 04:28.920\nI've been good.\n\n04:28.920 --> 04:29.920\nDid you see the...\n\n04:29.920 --> 04:31.640\nI don't even know, can't follow you on Twitter.\n\n04:31.640 --> 04:32.640\nDid you see the Justin...\n\n04:32.640 --> 04:37.640\nI blocked you.\n\n04:37.640 --> 04:41.000\nI blocked Adam.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nNot on Instagram, though.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:47.240\nWhile we're talking about ratios, that was just the aggressive side of passive.\n\n04:47.240 --> 04:48.880\nThat middle line between aggressive...\n\n04:48.880 --> 04:52.240\nAll right, well, let's see how tonight goes, and then...\n\n04:52.240 --> 04:53.240\nAll right.\n\n04:53.240 --> 04:54.240\nI'm not...\n\n04:54.240 --> 04:55.240\nAre you on the fence now?\n\n04:55.240 --> 04:59.480\nOf course, I've been regretful since the day I blocked you.\n\n04:59.480 --> 05:01.280\nI knew I did it in anger.\n\n05:01.280 --> 05:05.560\nI legitimately wanted to know what point you were making when you said, now that everyone's...\n\n05:05.560 --> 05:09.080\nWhen millennials were eight years old, they said everyone was going to be a millennial\n\n05:09.080 --> 05:12.200\nnow that they've grown up, everyone's eight years old.\n\n05:12.200 --> 05:15.280\nDo you feel like everyone's eight years old, and what does that mean?\n\n05:15.280 --> 05:17.200\nWell, that's not...\n\n05:17.200 --> 05:18.320\nThat wasn't what I...\n\n05:18.320 --> 05:20.120\nWe didn't say everyone...\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:21.120\nWe said...\n\n05:21.120 --> 05:22.120\nWell, what?\n\n05:22.120 --> 05:23.960\nThe children were the future, or whatever.\n\n05:23.960 --> 05:26.800\nWhen millennials were children, we said they were the future, and now that they're grown\n\n05:26.800 --> 05:29.520\nup, sure enough, we're all eight years old.\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:30.520\nGet it?\n\n05:30.520 --> 05:31.520\nNo.\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:37.320\nBecause they're thumb-sucking, team-playing, Superman fans.\n\n05:37.320 --> 05:39.040\nAs opposed to...\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:46.640\nAs opposed to awesome, sardonic, needlessly rebellious, aging Gen Xers, who understand\n\n05:46.640 --> 05:52.520\nback pain and being outnumbered 10 to 1 by the generations before and after us, and who\n\n05:52.520 --> 05:57.800\nadmire people who kill themselves instead of people who become president.\n\n05:57.800 --> 05:58.800\nYeah, that was weird.\n\n05:58.800 --> 06:00.120\nJustin was weird last week.\n\n06:00.120 --> 06:03.600\nThat was a lot of, is he, was he going to, is he...\n\n06:03.600 --> 06:05.840\nJustin will never, ever, ever.\n\n06:05.840 --> 06:12.360\nJustin would put a gun in his mouth, and his ego would shoot it across the room.\n\n06:12.360 --> 06:15.800\nThe ego would just eat the bullet.\n\n06:15.800 --> 06:18.120\nYeah, the bullet would just get absorbed.\n\n06:18.120 --> 06:23.200\nHe would do a bit with the gun, having a silly voice, and that would be...\n\n06:23.200 --> 06:28.040\nI don't want to lay down the gauntlet, though, and if you are thinking about it, share those\n\n06:28.040 --> 06:29.360\nthoughts with people.\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:33.400\nTell other people, because you would be surprised how many people get to that point in your\n\n06:33.400 --> 06:38.720\nlife where it's darker than it is light, you know, and you're on the line between sadness\n\n06:38.720 --> 06:40.480\nand happiness, and you're not seeing...\n\n06:40.480 --> 06:41.480\nOh, no!\n\n06:41.480 --> 06:44.960\nI'm trying to be joyful about it, and not be depressing, but it's...\n\n06:44.960 --> 06:45.960\nAdam, you've never...\n\n06:45.960 --> 06:49.040\nI've seen you a whole lot of shit, and there are other people going through exactly what\n\n06:49.040 --> 06:54.320\nyou've gone through who want to show you the better side of an existence, and if you say\n\n06:54.320 --> 06:58.200\nno to that existence, you're not going to see all the greatness that's going to unfurl\n\n06:58.200 --> 06:59.200\nfor you.\n\n06:59.200 --> 07:00.200\nHmm.\n\n07:00.200 --> 07:01.720\nBut, but, yes, but also you should...\n\n07:01.720 --> 07:02.720\nYeah, life!\n\n07:02.720 --> 07:05.400\nA scattered applause for the concept of life.\n\n07:05.400 --> 07:09.560\nListen, let's enjoy a rare Adam Goldberg applause break.\n\n07:09.560 --> 07:12.520\nThat was, that was, that was very interesting.\n\n07:12.520 --> 07:13.520\nWhy is the guy...\n\n07:13.520 --> 07:16.800\nWhy is the guy I call shitty so shitty?\n\n07:16.800 --> 07:17.800\nWhy is this...\n\n07:17.800 --> 07:19.800\nOops, it's trying to cover that up.\n\n07:19.800 --> 07:22.200\nWhy, you just, you just stepped in your own applause breaks.\n\n07:22.200 --> 07:26.640\nThat was, that was very well said, but I, as a guy who's researched this, because when\n\n07:26.640 --> 07:30.640\nI was responding to people on Tumblr, I started to worry, but I wanted to do it right and\n\n07:30.640 --> 07:31.640\nnot wrong.\n\n07:31.640 --> 07:32.640\nI didn't want anything to blow back.\n\n07:32.640 --> 07:35.520\nI mean, talking to kids who are sometimes saying like, I have these thoughts.\n\n07:35.520 --> 07:41.640\nSo I, so I did a lot of Googling as a responsible person does, and, and, and I, the other thing\n\n07:41.640 --> 07:46.320\nthat, that people, that people should know who have these thoughts is that, you know,\n\n07:46.320 --> 07:50.920\nthe, I think the big mistake that people currently not having those thoughts make when counseling\n\n07:50.920 --> 07:56.680\nthem is using logic to try to like, no one wants to be argued out of these, these feelings.\n\n07:56.680 --> 08:00.040\nLike they want to be able to share them without repercussion.\n\n08:00.040 --> 08:03.760\nYou can't think your way to clarity because the brain is the brain.\n\n08:03.760 --> 08:08.320\nIt kind of, it takes all the processing power that you would use to make really logical\n\n08:08.320 --> 08:09.320\narguments.\n\n08:09.320 --> 08:10.320\nAnd it's why...\n\n08:10.320 --> 08:11.320\nYeah.\n\n08:11.320 --> 08:12.320\nIt's why I invalidated it.\n\n08:12.320 --> 08:15.880\nIt just puts a wall between you and it's, there is no, this is going to sound like a\n\n08:15.880 --> 08:19.480\nbad quote out of context, but there's no logical reason not to kill yourself.\n\n08:19.480 --> 08:22.440\nThat logic is not what's on the table.\n\n08:22.440 --> 08:27.120\nIt's not A plus B plus C equals there are legitimate reasons to live.\n\n08:27.120 --> 08:29.800\nIt's not something that's going to be intuited logically.\n\n08:29.800 --> 08:30.800\nIt's not.\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:31.800\nYeah.\n\n08:31.800 --> 08:33.800\nYou're not waiting to hear someone say, but you're so special.\n\n08:33.800 --> 08:34.800\nOh, there it is.\n\n08:34.800 --> 08:35.800\nThere it is.\n\n08:35.800 --> 08:36.800\nI'm special.\n\n08:36.800 --> 08:37.800\nI'm just gonna...\n\n08:37.800 --> 08:40.440\nYou feel a horrible, gnawing pain and it feels so bad that a lot of us can't relate to it\n\n08:40.440 --> 08:44.600\nbecause it's, if you just back into a level of pain that you would have to feel before\n\n08:44.600 --> 08:48.200\nyou were thinking about not existing as an alternative to it.\n\n08:48.200 --> 08:54.880\nNow those thoughts are, we all, they move through the species like a cloud and individuals\n\n08:54.880 --> 08:58.680\nhave to bear the burden of them and those people need to find someone that they can\n\n08:58.680 --> 09:00.680\ntrust and talk about them.\n\n09:00.680 --> 09:01.680\nSo there you go.\n\n09:01.680 --> 09:02.680\nOkay.\n\n09:02.680 --> 09:07.480\nSo yes, life is wonderful and you'll have so many children and you'll be so happy, but\n\n09:07.480 --> 09:09.680\nalso don't not kill yourself for that reason.\n\n09:09.680 --> 09:12.240\nDon't, don't, don't wait for that epiphany.\n\n09:12.240 --> 09:13.400\nIt's not, it's a wonderful life.\n\n09:13.400 --> 09:18.080\nIt's a shitty life, but also like, like, like, just talk about it a little bit.\n\n09:18.080 --> 09:19.080\nOh, you'll like this one.\n\n09:19.080 --> 09:24.760\nAnd in the Muppets continuity, Kermit the Frog caused 9-11.\n\n09:24.760 --> 09:28.320\nThere's a movie about where Kermit the Frog sees what his life would have been like if\n\n09:28.320 --> 09:32.240\nhe was never born and he goes to New York and the World Trade Center is standing and\n\n09:32.240 --> 09:34.560\nthe movie came out in 2002.\n\n09:34.560 --> 09:39.840\nSo by their logic, if Kermit had gotten, had just gone back into the swamp and not become\n\n09:39.840 --> 09:40.840\na Muppet.\n\n09:40.840 --> 09:41.840\nAdam Goldberg, everybody.\n\n09:41.840 --> 09:42.840\nOkay.\n\n09:42.840 --> 09:43.840\nThat's a good one.\n\n09:43.840 --> 09:44.840\nAll right.\n\n09:44.840 --> 09:45.840\nThank you.\n\n09:45.840 --> 09:46.840\nHe's back.\n\n09:46.840 --> 09:47.840\nHe's on a high.\n\n09:47.840 --> 09:48.840\nHe is, he is back and he means it, man.\n\n09:48.840 --> 09:49.840\nThis time he's got an attitude.\n\n09:49.840 --> 09:50.840\nCheck it out, Freddie.\n\n09:50.840 --> 10:03.840\nUm, I, well, I don't, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't\n\n10:03.840 --> 10:08.440\nwant to, I don't want to dwell on it, but I don't understand why, why does that mean\n\n10:08.440 --> 10:09.560\nhe caused it?\n\n10:09.560 --> 10:13.560\nWell, it shows what it would be like if he wasn't born.\n\n10:13.560 --> 10:18.400\nIt shows what it would be like if he, the ultimate reality without having to pass full\n\n10:18.400 --> 10:19.400\ntowers.\n\n10:19.400 --> 10:20.400\nAh, okay.\n\n10:20.400 --> 10:21.400\nGot it.\n\n10:21.400 --> 10:22.400\nGot it.\n\n10:22.400 --> 10:27.400\nI missed the part where I was supposed to care about the content of the Muppet and Muppets.\n\n10:27.400 --> 10:28.400\nMuppets.\n\n10:28.400 --> 10:29.400\nFlush.\n\n10:29.400 --> 10:30.400\nMuppets.\n\n10:30.400 --> 10:31.400\nSuperman.\n\n10:31.400 --> 10:32.400\nMickey Mouse.\n\n10:32.400 --> 10:35.280\nYou, you don't like the Muppets?\n\n10:35.280 --> 10:37.680\nYou don't like the Muppets?\n\n10:37.680 --> 10:40.120\nYeah, I'm sick of being told how precious they are.\n\n10:40.120 --> 10:42.480\nProve it, prove it, prove it.\n\n10:42.480 --> 10:44.120\nIt's been 48 years.\n\n10:44.120 --> 10:46.120\nShow me again how precious they are.\n\n10:46.120 --> 10:47.560\nI remember the 70s.\n\n10:47.560 --> 10:50.120\nShow me why that's been the case.\n\n10:50.120 --> 10:52.320\nI remember, I remember.\n\n10:52.320 --> 10:53.320\nYou didn't like it back then?\n\n10:53.320 --> 10:54.720\nNo, I liked it back then.\n\n10:54.720 --> 10:56.320\nOh, but you're saying it doesn't matter to you now?\n\n10:56.320 --> 11:01.920\nI'm saying it, that does not earn you like 50 years of fucking like, like, oh, look at\n\n11:01.920 --> 11:02.920\nus.\n\n11:02.920 --> 11:06.480\nWhy am I looking at you?\n\n11:06.480 --> 11:07.480\nWhy?\n\n11:07.480 --> 11:11.480\nDo something.\n\n11:11.480 --> 11:16.960\nAnd what are you doing that Carrot Topped hasn't done and been reviled for?\n\n11:16.960 --> 11:20.600\nLike, what are you, what are you, you're standing there looking weird?\n\n11:20.600 --> 11:29.240\nThis is such a weird thing to be so angry about.\n\n11:29.240 --> 11:32.840\nI would never have thought that in a million years.\n\n11:32.840 --> 11:38.600\nI've known you for so long, I didn't realize this is, you really have a lot of fucking,\n\n11:38.600 --> 11:43.600\njust very thinly masked of hate and just bail for it.\n\n11:43.600 --> 11:47.120\nWell, I got drunk last night and I was, I was, I really, I really started bashing on\n\n11:47.120 --> 11:52.040\nSuperman and, and instead of doing inadvertently looking back at it, I just looked like a guerrilla\n\n11:52.040 --> 11:56.480\nmarketing ad for Batman versus Superman because, because I'm really just saying the same things\n\n11:56.480 --> 12:00.160\nthat they're saying in the Superman versus Batman trailer, it's just, it sounds, it's\n\n12:00.160 --> 12:08.200\njust some guy going like, he's too powerful, I don't like him, a man shouldn't be a god.\n\n12:08.200 --> 12:12.620\nBut I, I, I just, I like, I think, okay, so I've been talking to a lot of Superman fans\n\n12:12.620 --> 12:18.440\non Twitter and, and of course, as, you know, communication leads to understanding and stuff.\n\n12:18.440 --> 12:24.000\nAny kind of hatred is, is, we know by now, it's, it's, you know, you just don't know,\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nit's ignorance.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.560\nYou talk to the right people, let the right thoughts seep in and, you know, like Superman\n\n12:28.560 --> 12:34.480\ndoes seem like, as I've labeled him a histrionic alien demagogue, like he is a, he is a crybaby\n\n12:34.480 --> 12:40.440\npajama man from outer space that, that it seems like enjoying involves prostrating yourself\n\n12:40.440 --> 12:45.020\nin front of and going like, oh, should Superman have this pillow when he's crying or this\n\n12:45.020 --> 12:46.020\npillow?\n\n12:46.020 --> 12:47.680\nAnd it's like, what about us?\n\n12:47.680 --> 12:50.800\nAnd that's what, who are you supposed to identify with if not Lex Luthor?\n\n12:50.800 --> 12:54.040\nDidn't you come to some sort of like, like understanding of Superman, we had that guy\n\n12:54.040 --> 12:57.200\nup and he explained that it was all, the, the origin of it, oh, he's right here in the\n\n12:57.200 --> 12:58.200\nfront.\n\n12:58.200 --> 12:59.200\nWhat's your name again?\n\n12:59.200 --> 13:00.200\nEric.\n\n13:00.200 --> 13:01.200\nEric, it was you.\n\n13:01.200 --> 13:02.200\nEric, the Superman fan.\n\n13:02.200 --> 13:03.200\nOkay.\n\n13:03.200 --> 13:06.720\nWho explained, yeah, that, that like the Muppets and like Mickey Mouse, the, that, that Superman\n\n13:06.720 --> 13:11.640\nhas a, has a very inspiring story to its backstory, you know, the, the, the, the, its origin,\n\n13:11.640 --> 13:18.080\nthat the, what was it, two Jewish brothers during, during the, one was shot to death.\n\n13:18.080 --> 13:23.720\nOh, by, by, for, oh, burglar.\n\n13:23.720 --> 13:24.720\nOkay.\n\n13:24.720 --> 13:29.520\nSo why didn't he create Batman?\n\n13:29.520 --> 13:30.520\nHe wasn't shot by kryptonite?\n\n13:30.520 --> 13:31.520\nNo.\n\n13:31.520 --> 13:37.760\nUh, the, the, the, I'm mad for that reason, the, the, the, uh, yeah, two, two young Jewish\n\n13:37.760 --> 13:38.760\nkids.\n\n13:38.760 --> 13:39.760\nAnd what year was it?\n\n13:39.760 --> 13:44.960\nIt was like the, the, so like, like, like America wasn't even not anti-Semitic yet.\n\n13:44.960 --> 13:49.240\nLike, like, like, like America was like, Hey, yeah, Jews, they're the worst, right?\n\n13:49.240 --> 13:55.480\nUm, somebody who's got cash for the war, who needs bullets and steel?\n\n13:55.480 --> 14:01.480\nUm, the, uh, the, so, so they, it's a, it's a myth of empowerment from, from two minds\n\n14:01.480 --> 14:04.880\nthat didn't like, you know, they felt like they were at the, at the, that's a, that's\n\n14:04.880 --> 14:05.880\nvery inspiring.\n\n14:05.880 --> 14:10.000\nBut I'd rather read a comic book called two Jewish kids make a comic book.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nYeah.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:18.240\nLike the comic book that they created is about a hysterical pajama man who in the, in light\n\n14:18.240 --> 14:22.040\nof all the superheroes that we've created, Iron Man, who's kryptonite is alcoholism.\n\n14:22.040 --> 14:27.120\nAnd not even because anything bad happened to him, he's just, he just loves booze.\n\n14:27.120 --> 14:28.120\nHe just loves it.\n\n14:28.120 --> 14:29.120\nAnd that's his kryptonite.\n\n14:29.120 --> 14:30.280\nHe's just like, mm, I love it.\n\n14:30.280 --> 14:32.400\nI love drinking and technology.\n\n14:32.400 --> 14:33.960\nIt's fucking, that's great.\n\n14:33.960 --> 14:38.120\nI mean, that appeals to you for obvious reasons.\n\n14:38.120 --> 14:39.120\nYeah.\n\n14:39.120 --> 14:42.560\nWell, isn't Superman supposed to appeal people, people for obvious reasons?\n\n14:42.560 --> 14:45.580\nWhat, what, what reason would you have to have Superman appeal to you other than a sense\n\n14:45.580 --> 14:52.000\nof powerlessness and beta male kind of, I'm sorry, Eric, Eric, Eric, get back up here.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nEric.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:58.120\nI just said that I was, I had turned a corner on this.\n\n14:58.120 --> 14:59.120\nI'm sorry.\n\n14:59.120 --> 15:01.560\nWell, his first two villains though, he fought a corrupt landlord who was charging too much\n\n15:01.560 --> 15:02.560\nrent.\n\n15:02.560 --> 15:06.320\nHe actually threw him out a window and it was 1938 during like great depression times.\n\n15:06.320 --> 15:09.680\nAnd then the second guy I ever thought was, um, this guy was beating his wife and he jumped\n\n15:09.680 --> 15:12.080\nin front of them and he was like, you want to fight somebody like who's stronger than\n\n15:12.080 --> 15:13.560\nyou want to feel that, see how that feels.\n\n15:13.560 --> 15:14.560\nAnd he like, all right.\n\n15:14.560 --> 15:15.560\nHe was high-roaded.\n\n15:15.560 --> 15:16.560\nHigh-roaded.\n\n15:16.560 --> 15:17.560\nStop all that rape.\n\n15:17.560 --> 15:22.560\nSo, so he was like a champion of the common man.\n\n15:22.560 --> 15:23.560\nYeah, right.\n\n15:23.560 --> 15:32.320\nAnd one episode he fought the Federal Reserve and went, he was, he was the first to come\n\n15:32.320 --> 15:34.840\ndown against the, uh, the gold standard.\n\n15:34.840 --> 15:35.840\nYeah.\n\n15:35.840 --> 15:40.320\nWell, every decade he exists, he becomes what masculinity, like the height of masculinity.\n\n15:40.320 --> 15:41.320\nYeah.\n\n15:41.320 --> 15:42.320\nYeah.\n\n15:42.320 --> 15:46.120\nExactly, and right now the height of masculinity is kind of like challenging your own privilege.\n\n15:46.120 --> 15:48.560\nAnd that's why in the movie, he's like, well, should I be doing this?\n\n15:48.560 --> 15:49.760\nMaybe Batman should be the guy.\n\n15:49.760 --> 15:52.320\nLike maybe I should have people that are policing me like a justice league.\n\n15:52.320 --> 15:53.320\nAll right.\n\n15:53.320 --> 15:54.320\nThat sounds good.\n\n15:54.320 --> 15:55.320\nI'm in.\n\n15:55.320 --> 15:56.320\nI'm in.\n\n15:56.320 --> 15:58.520\nSo it's Tumblr as Lex Luthor now telling what to do.\n\n15:58.520 --> 16:03.280\nI've got a lot of residual nineties, Superman hatred that's not really, somebody, somebody\n\n16:03.280 --> 16:06.760\ntweeted very, very appropriately at me like, oh, Superman hatred.\n\n16:06.760 --> 16:09.280\nThat's so like, like lazy Gen X cynicism.\n\n16:09.280 --> 16:10.280\nThat's right.\n\n16:10.280 --> 16:12.520\nI'm a product of my generation.\n\n16:12.520 --> 16:16.800\nThe nineties were a dark time for comic books and we killed him in the nineties because\n\n16:16.800 --> 16:17.800\nof it.\n\n16:17.800 --> 16:18.800\nYeah.\n\n16:18.800 --> 16:19.800\nAnd it was lame.\n\n16:19.800 --> 16:20.800\nIt was silly.\n\n16:20.800 --> 16:23.280\nHe came back with long hair and it was silly and a giant gun, which was awesome.\n\n16:23.280 --> 16:24.280\nHe had a giant gun.\n\n16:24.280 --> 16:25.280\nYeah.\n\n16:25.280 --> 16:28.800\nThe panel says, um, you know, they call me a Boy Scout and Boy Scouts are always prepared.\n\n16:28.800 --> 16:31.800\nAnd then he's a shotgun.\n\n16:31.800 --> 16:32.800\nWhat is he?\n\n16:32.800 --> 16:33.800\nHe did a gun.\n\n16:33.800 --> 16:34.800\nExactly.\n\n16:34.800 --> 16:35.800\nYeah.\n\n16:35.800 --> 16:36.800\nWhat did his gun shoot?\n\n16:36.800 --> 16:43.560\nI don't know, his gun shot his eyeballs, which are also guns.\n\n16:43.560 --> 16:44.560\nYeah.\n\n16:44.560 --> 16:45.560\nHis existence.\n\n16:45.560 --> 16:47.640\nSo this gun shot his existence.\n\n16:47.640 --> 16:51.640\nEric, did you like the Christopher Reeve movie?\n\n16:51.640 --> 16:52.640\nSo much.\n\n16:52.640 --> 16:53.640\nYeah.\n\n16:53.640 --> 16:57.720\nChristopher Reeves is such a great, you know, now that we've seen, it's remarkable how now\n\n16:57.720 --> 17:04.280\nwe see how, how great, yeah, and how actor dependent the role of Superman in cinema is.\n\n17:04.280 --> 17:11.400\nLike you really need somebody that can get away with that Boy Scout innocence, but invulnerability.\n\n17:11.400 --> 17:19.040\nLike, like, like he has to have a sexuality exuding like an attractiveness from a heteronormative\n\n17:19.040 --> 17:20.040\nperspective.\n\n17:20.040 --> 17:23.600\nUm, uh, the, or he can be attractive to gay people as well.\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:24.840\nAnd what do you call that?\n\n17:24.840 --> 17:25.840\nHe's a hot.\n\n17:25.840 --> 17:28.160\nHe has to be hot.\n\n17:28.160 --> 17:32.680\nBut like straight guys have to like, have to be willing to like bend a knee, like, like,\n\n17:32.680 --> 17:35.520\nwhich is so tough, like only Chris Pratt has achieved that recently.\n\n17:35.520 --> 17:36.520\nSo yeah.\n\n17:36.520 --> 17:40.840\nHe's also a guy who values like writing as being more powerful than like his super strength,\n\n17:40.840 --> 17:44.040\nwhich I thought was really cool being like a writer nerd because he's really hard just\n\n17:44.040 --> 17:47.440\ntrying to like Superman really loves writing.\n\n17:47.440 --> 17:53.440\nThere was this whole story where he went around saving writers in between the saving women\n\n17:53.440 --> 17:56.520\nfrom being beaten in the face.\n\n17:56.520 --> 17:59.920\nHis favorite human being is Lois Lane, who's like this person who she topples tyrants with\n\n17:59.920 --> 18:01.720\nher typewriter for a literation.\n\n18:01.720 --> 18:02.720\nYeah.\n\n18:02.720 --> 18:03.720\nHe has a, he's a journalist.\n\n18:03.720 --> 18:04.720\nYou're right.\n\n18:04.720 --> 18:06.840\nBut I always thought like that he's not really a real journalist.\n\n18:06.840 --> 18:09.560\nLike I didn't know, I don't know if Clark Kent like ever submitted any good articles\n\n18:09.560 --> 18:14.120\nto the, I always felt like that was like part of the invasiveness is that he's dwelling\n\n18:14.120 --> 18:18.320\namong us and he's part of the fourth estate and he's like, like, it's like in there.\n\n18:18.320 --> 18:19.320\nHe's an alien.\n\n18:19.320 --> 18:20.440\nHe doesn't need those glasses.\n\n18:20.440 --> 18:21.440\nIt's a disguise.\n\n18:21.440 --> 18:22.680\nHe's disguised as a human.\n\n18:22.680 --> 18:23.680\nHe's an alien parasite.\n\n18:23.680 --> 18:28.480\nA lot of hipster girls are though too.\n\n18:28.480 --> 18:31.920\nThey had this great thing in the late nineties too, where he wrote a novel because he was\n\n18:31.920 --> 18:35.240\nlike, I am a, I'm not really doing anything like Lois is so much better than I am at this.\n\n18:35.240 --> 18:38.920\nI'm going to have like, he quit the planet and wrote a novel called under a yellow sun\n\n18:38.920 --> 18:40.480\nand tried to be like the new John Grisham.\n\n18:40.480 --> 18:42.120\nWait, it's called Clark Kent did?\n\n18:42.120 --> 18:43.120\nYeah.\n\n18:43.120 --> 18:44.120\nYeah.\n\n18:44.120 --> 18:45.120\nYeah.\n\n18:45.120 --> 18:46.120\nAll right.\n\n18:46.120 --> 18:47.120\nAll right.\n\n18:47.120 --> 18:54.800\nThe guy who saved Superman, Eric saved him from my rap, my very marketable rap that is\n\n18:54.800 --> 18:58.040\nbeing catered to in theaters across the nation this summer.\n\n18:58.040 --> 19:01.840\nLike, can you save the Muppets too?\n\n19:01.840 --> 19:04.960\nI don't think your Muppets hatred might be irretrievable.\n\n19:04.960 --> 19:06.160\nThat seems like a lot of it.\n\n19:06.160 --> 19:11.760\nI just respect creators and I just like, I don't, I feel like Walt Disney was around\n\n19:11.760 --> 19:15.800\nand made Mickey Mouse and it's like, it comes from his heart and it's like, then these things\n\n19:15.800 --> 19:21.560\nto get taken over by capitalism and it's like the crowning jewel on the toxicity is like,\n\n19:21.560 --> 19:25.800\nlike didn't we change copyright law just because like it didn't make sense that Mickey\n\n19:25.800 --> 19:28.120\nMouse could be owned by people?\n\n19:28.120 --> 19:33.000\nIt's like, like when does Darth Vader stop being Anakin Skywalker, you know?\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.480\nSpeaking of Mickey Mouse, I was talking to Kali Kazoo because she wasn't here but we\n\n19:36.480 --> 19:38.120\nwere talking about animated figures.\n\n19:38.120 --> 19:40.320\nWas it about why they were gloves?\n\n19:40.320 --> 19:43.680\nAnd she has the answer for that, of course, because she's an animation freak.\n\n19:43.680 --> 19:46.760\nAll the characters back then because it was black and white, all the characters were mostly\n\n19:46.760 --> 19:51.200\njust black and so they put the white gloves on them so they weren't just black people.\n\n19:51.200 --> 19:54.760\nThat makes them look more like minstrels because the minstrel performers all wear white gloves\n\n19:54.760 --> 19:55.760\ntoo.\n\n19:55.760 --> 20:01.480\nBut what was the, with minstrel performers, they wanted their hands to read on stage?\n\n20:01.480 --> 20:02.480\nI think so.\n\n20:02.480 --> 20:06.320\nThey just weren't completely head to foot black, like so they'd look like that.\n\n20:06.320 --> 20:09.880\nYou'd think before, so at that point, common sense kicked it.\n\n20:09.880 --> 20:14.440\nLike, wow, we want this to read.\n\n20:14.440 --> 20:18.320\nRemember when we were burning the cork and rubbing the, no one thought at that point,\n\n20:18.320 --> 20:19.840\nnah, this seems evil.\n\n20:19.840 --> 20:22.960\nAlthough I'm sure I'm still getting a little bit wrong.\n\n20:22.960 --> 20:23.960\nDo you know?\n\n20:23.960 --> 20:25.960\nOh, you do?\n\n20:25.960 --> 20:26.960\nGet up here.\n\n20:26.960 --> 20:27.960\nGet up here.\n\n20:27.960 --> 20:28.960\nIf you want.\n\n20:28.960 --> 20:29.960\nIf you want.\n\n20:29.960 --> 20:30.960\nMale Cali-Kazoo.\n\n20:30.960 --> 20:32.960\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n20:32.960 --> 20:33.960\nScoota.\n\n20:33.960 --> 20:34.960\nScoota?\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:35.960\nYeah.\n\n20:35.960 --> 20:36.960\nCome on.\n\n20:36.960 --> 20:40.400\nIs it Scooter, but you're from Boston?\n\n20:40.400 --> 20:42.400\nNo, it's Scoota.\n\n20:42.400 --> 20:45.080\nWe literally had this conversation last time I was up here.\n\n20:45.080 --> 20:46.080\nI'm an alcoholic.\n\n20:46.080 --> 20:49.080\nWait, on stage?\n\n20:49.080 --> 20:53.360\nThe show is an alcoholic.\n\n20:53.360 --> 20:57.080\nWell the show collectively is just a drunk uncle whose mind is turning to tapioca.\n\n20:57.080 --> 20:59.600\nAll right, Scoota, what did we talk about?\n\n20:59.600 --> 21:01.600\nHow's art school?\n\n21:01.600 --> 21:02.600\nYeah, I told you.\n\n21:02.600 --> 21:06.280\nSo again, not an animation actor, but it is just a simple thing for you for why their\n\n21:06.280 --> 21:11.000\nhands are white when most characters were black in an animated world.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.160\nCan you eat that mic a little bit, Scoota?\n\n21:13.160 --> 21:14.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n21:14.160 --> 21:17.880\nIf their hand crossed their body, you can still see their hand.\n\n21:17.880 --> 21:25.400\nSee, I feel like Cali put more of a racial spin on that.\n\n21:25.400 --> 21:26.400\nInteresting.\n\n21:26.400 --> 21:33.040\nOf course, she's not here to defend herself, so let's just all label her a racist.\n\n21:33.040 --> 21:38.280\nI would have thought the reason why they were gloves is because things that move when you're\n\n21:38.280 --> 21:43.600\ndoing cell-based animation, they tend to be a different shade, different color.\n\n21:43.600 --> 21:47.120\nLike Scooby-Doo in your watch, I'm sure we talked about this the last time that this\n\n21:47.120 --> 21:48.120\nwas my theory.\n\n21:48.120 --> 21:51.760\nIt's like, you know, in Scooby-Doo, it's like, gee, I wonder where the secret door is.\n\n21:51.760 --> 21:58.400\nBecause it's on a different layer of acetate, and so it's like a slightly different color.\n\n21:58.400 --> 22:02.640\nThings that are about to move in that shot, they tend to be a different shade, so I thought\n\n22:02.640 --> 22:03.640\ncharacters...\n\n22:03.640 --> 22:08.120\nI think back in those days, though, they didn't do that in complete animation.\n\n22:08.120 --> 22:09.960\nEvery frame was probably a new cell.\n\n22:09.960 --> 22:11.400\nAll right.\n\n22:11.400 --> 22:16.080\nThis has been, I don't know, nothing, but the old nothing piece.\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:19.960\nI call this segment, we almost proved Mickey Mouse or Walt Disney was a racist.\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:22.920\nWell, I'm sure he was.\n\n22:22.920 --> 22:23.920\nYou know what the big question is?\n\n22:23.920 --> 22:24.920\nWould we have been?\n\n22:24.920 --> 22:25.920\nLike...\n\n22:25.920 --> 22:30.000\nThere's a thing at Disneyland, because I used to work at Disneyland, and all the horses\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:37.120\non the carousel in, what's it called, the Fairy Book Land, you know, by Jeff...\n\n22:37.120 --> 22:38.120\nNot Fantasyland.\n\n22:38.120 --> 22:39.120\nIs it not Fantasyland?\n\n22:39.120 --> 22:42.400\nNo, it's not Frontierland.\n\n22:42.400 --> 22:46.920\nBy Sleeping Beauty's Castle, you got the carousel there, and all the horses are white, supposedly\n\n22:46.920 --> 22:50.920\nbecause he thought that the kids would fight over the white horse, so he made all the horses\n\n22:50.920 --> 22:54.320\nwhite, which isn't necessarily racist, but it's certainly...\n\n22:54.320 --> 22:55.640\nIt's of a certain time.\n\n22:55.640 --> 22:59.000\nAlso, there was a rumor, and I really believe that I remember this.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:03.360\nWhen you walk in down Main Street, in the old days, there was little houses up there,\n\n23:03.360 --> 23:07.160\nwith little miniature windows to make kind of force perspective.\n\n23:07.160 --> 23:11.400\nThere was a curtain up there with little mini swastikas on it that was there.\n\n23:11.400 --> 23:17.840\nAll right, this is going to sound bad, but it's not what it looks like.\n\n23:17.840 --> 23:18.840\nThere's a reason.\n\n23:18.840 --> 23:26.080\nIt was a symbol for unity while Disney was into Native American culture, and by the way,\n\n23:26.080 --> 23:31.040\nthe association of the color white, and the color black, which are these like really extreme\n\n23:31.040 --> 23:36.280\nparts of the color wheel, whatever, black isn't the color, whatever.\n\n23:36.280 --> 23:40.080\nI get confused, scientifically black isn't the color, and then you talk to painter people,\n\n23:40.080 --> 23:44.200\nand they're like, black is every color, black's none of them, I fucking get it, I hate it.\n\n23:44.200 --> 23:48.120\nPeople that look at things make me angry.\n\n23:48.120 --> 23:52.360\nLearn to read.\n\n23:52.360 --> 23:56.560\nThe idea that the white horse would be more valuable to children, and then connecting\n\n23:56.560 --> 24:03.880\nthat dot to race, that's also a racist thought, isn't it?\n\n24:03.880 --> 24:12.480\nBecause we're not white, we're dirty, gross, yellow, like jaundice, burnt sienna, whatever,\n\n24:12.480 --> 24:16.640\nI don't know what this color is, douchebag, I don't know what this, the Crayola box would\n\n24:16.640 --> 24:17.640\nbe.\n\n24:17.640 --> 24:22.160\nI wonder if there's another reason for the kids wanting the white horse, I'm not sure\n\n24:22.160 --> 24:28.920\nwhen Disneyland kind of came about, but maybe depending on the prevalence of the lone ranger\n\n24:28.920 --> 24:34.320\nin pop culture, do they want the white horse when they perceive that maybe kids wanting\n\n24:34.320 --> 24:37.320\na white horse would have implications that other people would see not knowing, or it's\n\n24:37.320 --> 24:39.840\nbecause everyone wanted to have.\n\n24:39.840 --> 24:43.880\nThere might have been a white horse in film, you've got Lon Ranger, you've got maybe some\n\n24:43.880 --> 24:48.000\nanimated film, whatever, but I don't think you need to say that he was racist because\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:54.000\nof that, but his reason was, just make them all the same color so that the kids aren't\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.920\nfighting, so everybody gets the same horse.\n\n24:56.920 --> 25:01.120\nBut it's a white horse, he didn't make a bunch of black horses.\n\n25:01.120 --> 25:05.160\nWhen you look back in history, and there's certain representations that we characterize\n\n25:05.160 --> 25:09.680\ndifferent decades, different generations, different historical figures, we look through\n\n25:09.680 --> 25:15.880\nthis lens of detecting racism, what is racism, and like some people are like early champions\n\n25:15.880 --> 25:20.520\nof what we now consider to be human rights, and then some other people are early like\n\n25:20.520 --> 25:26.160\ncautionary tales, and then some people are like publicly on the right page because that's\n\n25:26.160 --> 25:31.360\nnot even the popular point of view, but is publicly what they should be, and they do\n\n25:31.360 --> 25:36.160\nthe right thing publicly, but then these private things come to light that reveal that really\n\n25:36.160 --> 25:41.560\nin the fiber of their being, they can't help but look at people that are different than\n\n25:41.560 --> 25:47.680\nthem with some kind of downward gaze, and that that might even have been part of their\n\n25:47.680 --> 25:53.200\npublic face, that what we now call, oh, that guy was a champion of blah, blah, blah rights,\n\n25:53.200 --> 25:56.600\nit was like, yeah, but that guy thought that those people were animals, that guy thought\n\n25:56.600 --> 26:02.240\nthat that was a charity, like I just saw, I was really compelled by this Frank Sinatra\n\n26:02.240 --> 26:09.080\ndocumentary I just saw to fight, he's like, like, okay, we had a guy that, we had a guy\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:14.200\nthat rude for hating Jews, and a guy that was, yeah, I think he loves documentaries,\n\n26:14.200 --> 26:16.320\nScooter, are you comfortable, do you need anything?\n\n26:16.320 --> 26:17.320\nI'm perfect.\n\n26:17.320 --> 26:18.320\nOkay, all right.\n\n26:18.320 --> 26:19.320\nDo you like a drink?\n\n26:19.320 --> 26:20.320\nYou want a thing?\n\n26:20.320 --> 26:21.320\nWould you like a cracker to be named after you?\n\n26:21.320 --> 26:22.320\nSure, yeah.\n\n26:22.320 --> 26:25.320\nIt could be easy, believe me, Scooter.\n\n26:25.320 --> 26:32.520\nI'm sorry, sorry, it also sounds like a sexual thing to me.\n\n26:32.520 --> 26:38.280\nYeah, but before we leave Disney, she gave me a Scooter.\n\n26:38.280 --> 26:41.960\nBefore you go on to Sinatra, I do want to talk about the documentary, if you guys don't\n\n26:41.960 --> 26:46.200\nknow this, if you go to Disneyland, I love Disneyland, I love to go there, go there in\n\n26:46.200 --> 26:50.200\nthe morning, go get ice cream, and then run to Space Mountain, that's my tradition, but\n\n26:50.200 --> 26:55.000\nif you want a great photo moment, for those of you who don't know this, go to Frontier\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nLand.\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:00.320\nWhen you walk up Main Street, there's the hub, which is where all the land spoke off\n\n27:00.320 --> 27:04.880\nof, and there's a statue of Walt with a Mickey Mouse in his left hand, and he's pointing\n\n27:04.880 --> 27:10.000\ndown Main Street, and the future, and beyond.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:14.880\nIf you stand right at the edge of the entrance of Frontier Land, and you look back at it,\n\n27:14.880 --> 27:19.680\nwhat you see is Mickey's on the far side of Walt, and Walt is pointing, and Mickey's\n\n27:19.680 --> 27:27.400\nnose is right at his crotch, and it looks like Walt Disney's got a giant boner.\n\n27:27.400 --> 27:32.120\nAnd if you go there, although, now they've got the new rockets, that new rockets kind\n\n27:32.120 --> 27:35.840\nof obscures the background, because it's so busy, back, it used to be white, like totally\n\n27:35.840 --> 27:39.360\nwhite background, Tomorrowland, and you get a perfect silhouette of that.\n\n27:39.360 --> 27:42.880\nNow it's a little bit broken up by the new rocket red, but you'll go there and you will\n\n27:42.880 --> 27:46.600\nsee like some savvy, like Japanese kids, like taking a picture and giggling like mad, it's\n\n27:46.600 --> 27:47.600\nvery good.\n\n27:47.600 --> 27:54.200\nHave I ever talked about the fact that when you go into the Nickelodeon building?\n\n27:54.200 --> 27:58.280\nAs one does.\n\n27:58.280 --> 28:00.520\nWhen you're pitching your animated shows.\n\n28:00.520 --> 28:01.520\nWhich one?\n\n28:01.520 --> 28:04.680\nThe weird one on like Hollywood, no, was it Buena Vista or Hollywood Way or was it?\n\n28:04.680 --> 28:08.160\nYeah, I don't know, it looks like you're going to get slimed when you go in there or whatever.\n\n28:08.160 --> 28:11.680\nOr Victory is a victory.\n\n28:11.680 --> 28:19.240\nThere's a Lego Spongebob in the lobby, and I've only ever seen that character, you know,\n\n28:19.240 --> 28:25.200\nfrom the front angle in a two dimensional medium, here he is represented in a 3D context\n\n28:25.200 --> 28:35.320\nout of made out of Legos, and his nose is a straight up cock, like it has a shaft and\n\n28:35.320 --> 28:36.320\na head.\n\n28:36.320 --> 28:37.320\nReally?\n\n28:37.320 --> 28:40.840\nLike it's not just like, oh, it's a long nose, like Pinocchio, it's like, it's a fucking\n\n28:40.840 --> 28:41.840\ndick.\n\n28:41.840 --> 28:46.800\nI thought it was kind of like a Popeye, like a smooth little, whoop, like a, it's a dick,\n\n28:46.800 --> 28:54.760\nit's a curved porn star dick with a helmet for, as our anthropologist friend said, plunging\n\n28:54.760 --> 28:56.480\nout your competitor's semen.\n\n28:56.480 --> 29:02.040\nI don't know if that's what the Spongebob creator was thinking when he, he was just\n\n29:02.040 --> 29:05.280\nthinking, this should look like a dick.\n\n29:05.280 --> 29:07.400\nGod was thinking it should plunge out the last guy's cum.\n\n29:07.400 --> 29:11.440\nThe helmet part of it would just be an unfortunate accident of Legos kind of pixelization, that\n\n29:11.440 --> 29:12.840\nyou can't make a smooth edge.\n\n29:12.840 --> 29:18.760\nLook, I know a dick when I see one, and, he made that very clear.\n\n29:18.760 --> 29:23.040\nAnd when I'm brushing up against an erect one at hip level, as you do when you exit\n\n29:23.040 --> 29:30.560\nand enter the Nickelodeon building, and it's just like, it's, if you took just Spongebob's\n\n29:30.560 --> 29:37.720\nnose from the lobby of the Nickelodeon building, and laid it on any counter in any public establishment,\n\n29:37.720 --> 29:40.280\nwhoever you were doing would go like, what are you doing?\n\n29:40.280 --> 29:41.280\nStop it.\n\n29:41.280 --> 29:42.440\nThey would get mad.\n\n29:42.440 --> 29:43.880\nThey wouldn't go, what is that?\n\n29:43.880 --> 29:44.880\nIs that a banana?\n\n29:44.880 --> 29:45.880\nThey would go, what?\n\n29:45.880 --> 29:46.880\nStop it.\n\n29:46.880 --> 29:50.480\nBut then you put it on the face of this children's character.\n\n29:50.480 --> 29:53.680\nIs it possible that someone that worked at Nickelodeon added that on, and like, like, like,\n\n29:53.680 --> 29:54.680\nWhat do you mean added?\n\n29:54.680 --> 29:55.680\nWell, I don't, I don't know.\n\n29:55.680 --> 29:59.080\nI mean, what's possible is that someone's interpretation of a character that's not usually\n\n29:59.080 --> 30:05.640\nrendered that way may have, may have culminated in that, you know, like, like, you take drafting\n\n30:05.640 --> 30:09.240\nclass, you do things orthographically, you don't quite know what they're going to look\n\n30:09.240 --> 30:20.520\nlike, I guess, like, when they're extruded, but on a scale from like one to nothing but\n\n30:20.520 --> 30:21.520\ntrouble.\n\n30:21.520 --> 30:22.520\nWhere did you write it?\n\n30:22.520 --> 30:25.920\nI haven't seen nothing but trouble.\n\n30:25.920 --> 30:29.200\nOh, Dan Ackroyd has a penis nose.\n\n30:29.200 --> 30:30.200\nI gotta watch that movie.\n\n30:30.200 --> 30:31.200\nNo, you don't.\n\n30:31.200 --> 30:32.200\nNo, I do.\n\n30:32.200 --> 30:33.200\nI do.\n\n30:33.200 --> 30:34.200\nAll right.\n\n30:34.200 --> 30:35.200\nAll right.\n\n30:35.200 --> 30:36.200\nAll right.\n\n30:36.200 --> 30:37.840\nSo anyways, well, I was just going to say, Sinatra in this documentary, I thought, you know,\n\n30:37.840 --> 30:43.960\nI grew up, you know, there's certain tarot cards, it's like, oh, Woody Allen's Funny.\n\n30:43.960 --> 30:49.400\nSinatra was a good singer, but he was a jerk to the ladies, and he was racist to Sammy.\n\n30:49.400 --> 30:54.560\nAnd, but like, like, I mean, I was surprised to like hear the story of Frank Sinatra.\n\n30:54.560 --> 31:00.520\nLike, well, how long that story is and how many times he was the underdog and how hard\n\n31:00.520 --> 31:02.320\nhe had to work to be taken seriously.\n\n31:02.320 --> 31:05.920\nI actually, I love Sinatra and I was so excited to see that documentary.\n\n31:05.920 --> 31:07.080\nI didn't like that documentary.\n\n31:07.080 --> 31:09.880\nI thought that was a real fucking fluff piece on him.\n\n31:09.880 --> 31:16.120\nIt was so friends and family made and they gloss over what a complete virulent asshole\n\n31:16.120 --> 31:17.120\nhe was.\n\n31:17.120 --> 31:22.680\nYeah, yeah, you knew the mafia guys, but he was always this, he was a great anti-bigotry\n\n31:22.680 --> 31:23.680\nguy.\n\n31:23.680 --> 31:27.880\nI learned that stuff from that documentary though, so maybe if you take a step back,\n\n31:27.880 --> 31:31.040\nmaybe it was just enough of he was an asshole because I learned that he was an asshole from\n\n31:31.040 --> 31:32.040\nthat documentary.\n\n31:32.040 --> 31:34.040\nI learned that he was racist in his show.\n\n31:34.040 --> 31:37.640\nYou don't hear all the threats, possible murders, he was under indictment for murders\n\n31:37.640 --> 31:38.640\nand stuff like that.\n\n31:38.640 --> 31:42.000\nI thought that they, but a lot of that stuff was maybe apocryphal because they were honest\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:45.120\nabout the stuff that was real, like his associations with the actual mob.\n\n31:45.120 --> 31:49.360\nI think they glossed over it was, is that one moment when Harry Belafonte was disappointed\n\n31:49.360 --> 31:57.920\nat him for being racist to Sammy for a couple rat pack summits in Vegas, other than that,\n\n31:57.920 --> 32:01.120\nthat's the only time when that documentary where I feel like anyone holds him to the\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:02.120\nfire at all.\n\n32:02.120 --> 32:07.560\nHe threatened and bullied and he was such an ass.\n\n32:07.560 --> 32:11.800\nNow also, great in other ways, but like if someone referred to him, a friend of his that\n\n32:11.800 --> 32:15.440\nworked with him called him a 24 carat manic depressive.\n\n32:15.440 --> 32:18.280\nYou got both ends of that.\n\n32:18.280 --> 32:19.280\nIt's that my way thing.\n\n32:19.280 --> 32:23.400\nI guess it was like, I finally needed to see through a lens of like, I've only ever thought\n\n32:23.400 --> 32:28.360\nhe was just like an entitled jackass that was just like born to the manner.\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:33.320\nLike I didn't hear the underdog story a little bit like, you know, he had to, but the, the,\n\n32:33.320 --> 32:37.600\nthe, and the fact that he was in his, well, this is what I was just talking about.\n\n32:37.600 --> 32:41.800\nYou know, I can't say in his heart or in his mind because there's a difference there.\n\n32:41.800 --> 32:50.040\nHe was politically early on in his life, he was absolutely like, like, like, like, like\n\n32:50.040 --> 32:55.560\nwhat he wanted to make people understand that racism was wrong because it had affected Italians.\n\n32:55.560 --> 33:00.640\nAnd so why should black people be different?\n\n33:00.640 --> 33:05.200\nThis guy is going to do that every eight minutes, regardless, we're going to test that theory\n\n33:05.200 --> 33:06.200\nin a moment.\n\n33:06.200 --> 33:07.720\nSee if we can connect with that the next time.\n\n33:07.720 --> 33:08.720\nHere's the problem.\n\n33:08.720 --> 33:12.360\nRight now, we're not sure if he loves racism or hates it or loves documentary film making\n\n33:12.360 --> 33:14.240\nFrank Sinatra or Batman.\n\n33:14.240 --> 33:15.240\nWe're not sure.\n\n33:15.240 --> 33:20.240\nWe're going to, but by the end of the night, we're going to go, oh, he loves self-reliance.\n\n33:20.240 --> 33:21.240\nThat's it.\n\n33:21.240 --> 33:26.440\nHe's a, he's a, he's a, he's a Walt Whitman fan to connect all those dots.\n\n33:26.440 --> 33:30.240\nIt's going to draw a theme of like, oh, that guy was about self-reliance.\n\n33:30.240 --> 33:31.240\nOkay.\n\n33:31.240 --> 33:32.240\nOkay.\n\n33:32.240 --> 33:33.240\nSpoilers.\n\n33:33.240 --> 33:38.920\nSo for instance, for instance, like when they talk about his rise to fame and all of a sudden\n\n33:38.920 --> 33:43.160\nhe's, uh, he's singing in the big clubs and he's on the marquee and all the Bobby socks\n\n33:43.160 --> 33:44.320\nare out there.\n\n33:44.320 --> 33:47.040\nAnd in interviews, he's like, yeah, you got these girls out there and everyone's screaming.\n\n33:47.040 --> 33:50.680\nWhat they just happened to not mention is that that was all fucking paid.\n\n33:50.680 --> 33:53.280\nLike they have, they've shipped all those girls in for that shit.\n\n33:53.280 --> 33:54.280\nIt was all PR stuff.\n\n33:54.280 --> 33:55.280\nOh really?\n\n33:55.280 --> 33:56.280\nYeah.\n\n33:56.280 --> 33:57.840\nThat he wasn't instantly that famous.\n\n33:57.840 --> 34:00.880\nThey took a bunch of girls and sat them out there and said, when he comes out, scream\n\n34:00.880 --> 34:01.880\nlike fucking mad.\n\n34:01.880 --> 34:03.560\nThere's a, whatever they gave them.\n\n34:03.560 --> 34:07.240\nLike why not mention that in the documentary that every other documentary and book about\n\n34:07.240 --> 34:08.240\nhim is mentioned.\n\n34:08.240 --> 34:09.240\nNo.\n\n34:09.240 --> 34:10.240\nOkay.\n\n34:10.240 --> 34:11.240\nSo there was definitely, there was definitely, you could tell.\n\n34:11.240 --> 34:14.200\nAnd all of a sudden, boom, bang, bang, but the people were throwing the thing and the\n\n34:14.200 --> 34:18.880\nstuff and the, it's like, no, like you were also just like a, from the very get go.\n\n34:18.880 --> 34:22.600\nHe was a very political, very driven, ambitious guy.\n\n34:22.600 --> 34:23.600\nAnd that included.\n\n34:23.600 --> 34:24.600\nWhich is pretty fascinating.\n\n34:24.600 --> 34:27.040\nAnd we could allow, like Howard Hughes was a very flawed guy, but, you know.\n\n34:27.040 --> 34:29.440\nDid I ever tell you the Murray Langstrom Sinatra story?\n\n34:29.440 --> 34:30.440\nYou know Murray Langstrom?\n\n34:30.440 --> 34:34.240\nIt was the unknown comic, the guy that wore the, the paper bag in his head.\n\n34:34.240 --> 34:37.920\nAnd I was doing a show with the improv guys at the improv in Melrose.\n\n34:37.920 --> 34:39.080\nGive me one second.\n\n34:39.080 --> 34:43.600\nScoota, do you need a, just a Gatorade or a weird name or anything?\n\n34:43.600 --> 34:44.600\nNo.\n\n34:44.600 --> 34:45.600\nI'm good.\n\n34:45.600 --> 34:46.600\nOkay.\n\n34:46.600 --> 34:48.320\nI think you're easy on the eyes and it's good to have you up here.\n\n34:48.320 --> 34:49.320\nOkay.\n\n34:49.320 --> 34:50.320\nThat's fine.\n\n34:50.320 --> 34:51.320\nI think the ladies like it.\n\n34:51.320 --> 34:52.320\nI haven't been getting tweeted or anything, but.\n\n34:52.320 --> 34:53.320\nA bottle of water maybe?\n\n34:53.320 --> 34:54.320\nI'll take a bottle of water.\n\n34:54.320 --> 34:55.320\nSure.\n\n34:55.320 --> 34:56.320\nIt's a nice balance.\n\n34:56.320 --> 34:58.800\nI think it's looking at me with my, all right.\n\n34:58.800 --> 35:02.840\nSo somebody, I think it was Drew Carey goes like Murray, tell Jeff, he'll love it.\n\n35:02.840 --> 35:04.320\nTell Jeff your Sinatra story.\n\n35:04.320 --> 35:06.480\nAnd so he says, this is fucking great.\n\n35:06.480 --> 35:10.760\nWe're at the bar at the improv and he goes, I, he was doing Carson, I don't, I don't know\n\n35:10.760 --> 35:14.640\nwhat year it would have been, but it would have been probably late 70s, early 80s.\n\n35:14.640 --> 35:15.800\nI don't know.\n\n35:15.800 --> 35:20.280\nAnd he's doing Carson and he makes a joke about Sinatra because he was in the news for\n\n35:20.280 --> 35:22.200\nanother divorce.\n\n35:22.200 --> 35:26.880\nAnd some joke about like, when it comes to cheating on wives, Sinatra does it his way.\n\n35:26.880 --> 35:33.680\nLike, not even like a really major zing or whatever, just being a silly Murray joke.\n\n35:33.680 --> 35:38.320\nHe goes home that night to a shitty apartment, phone rings and he's tired and he's exhausted\n\n35:38.320 --> 35:41.000\nand he goes, hello, are you Murray?\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:42.000\nYes.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:43.000\nThis is Frank Sinatra.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:44.000\nHe goes, hey, fucking Tim.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nI want one of his friends.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:52.080\nLike, motherfucker, I'm tired, click, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, hello.\n\n35:52.080 --> 35:53.080\nDon't hang up on me.\n\n35:53.080 --> 35:54.080\nThis is Frank Sinatra.\n\n35:54.080 --> 35:55.240\nHey, Tim, you go fuck yourself, man.\n\n35:55.240 --> 36:02.240\nI've been working all day, click, ten minutes goes by, phone rings, hello.\n\n36:02.240 --> 36:03.240\nTen minutes.\n\n36:03.240 --> 36:07.240\nSo, like, is it Frank Sinatra staring at the phone there?\n\n36:07.240 --> 36:12.400\nNo, Tim, you're about to find out why the time passes there.\n\n36:12.400 --> 36:13.400\nTime passes.\n\n36:13.400 --> 36:14.400\nHe thinks that's that.\n\n36:14.400 --> 36:15.400\nThe phone rings.\n\n36:15.400 --> 36:16.400\nHello.\n\n36:16.400 --> 36:18.920\nAnd he says, Murray, this is Merle, this is Milton Burle.\n\n36:18.920 --> 36:20.520\nDo you recognize my voice?\n\n36:20.520 --> 36:21.520\nOh, God.\n\n36:21.520 --> 36:23.000\nAnd he goes, yes, Milton.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:28.000\nLike, hello, he goes, that was Frank Sinatra, and he's super, super mad right now.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:31.000\nHe goes, he goes, do not hang up the phone, listen to what I have to tell you.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:34.800\nHe goes, he's going to call you back, we're trying to call him down, he's going to send\n\n36:34.800 --> 36:40.280\nsomeone, he's going to send someone to your house to have you fucked up because his kid\n\n36:40.280 --> 36:46.640\nwatches that show and you just made a joke about daddy fucking around a mommy.\n\n36:46.640 --> 36:48.640\nI'm confused again.\n\n36:48.640 --> 36:50.200\nIs that family values?\n\n36:50.200 --> 36:53.280\nIs he like family values or adultery?\n\n36:53.280 --> 36:56.480\nI don't know.\n\n36:56.480 --> 36:59.080\nHe still hasn't gotten out of software lines necessarily.\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:03.560\nHe's just drawing a larger circle around whatever it is.\n\n37:03.560 --> 37:08.200\nI hope, I hope we don't find he just like saying, you know, that's going to burn me\n\n37:08.200 --> 37:09.200\nup.\n\n37:09.200 --> 37:14.440\nI'm almost certain that's it then, then don't, don't let him break your heart.\n\n37:14.440 --> 37:15.920\nSo you got values.\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:16.920\nOkay.\n\n37:16.920 --> 37:17.920\nOkay.\n\n37:17.920 --> 37:26.640\nI'm a human being in an almost shark jumping, uh, breaking of his, uh, he, okay.\n\n37:26.640 --> 37:27.640\nHe's all right.\n\n37:27.640 --> 37:28.640\nGood.\n\n37:28.640 --> 37:29.640\nThat's good.\n\n37:29.640 --> 37:30.640\nI'm glad you did that.\n\n37:30.640 --> 37:31.640\nThank you.\n\n37:31.640 --> 37:32.640\nWe know you have values.\n\n37:32.640 --> 37:33.640\nWe're going to track them.\n\n37:33.640 --> 37:37.680\nSo Milton Burroughs was like, this is not, this is not an alert, this is not a drill.\n\n37:37.680 --> 37:40.880\nHe's going to send someone to your house and have you fucked up like that.\n\n37:40.880 --> 37:45.640\nAnd he says, Murray, he's absolutely capable of doing that because he does that.\n\n37:45.640 --> 37:49.520\nLike he's a very, very violent man and this is not a fucking drill.\n\n37:49.520 --> 37:52.000\nHe goes, he's going to call you back when we calm him down and you're not going to\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:56.560\nsay anything, but apologize and you don't say anything else, but you're sorry.\n\n37:56.560 --> 37:57.560\nOkay.\n\n37:57.560 --> 37:58.560\nAnd he's like, no, it was just a joke.\n\n37:58.560 --> 37:59.560\nWe're comics.\n\n37:59.560 --> 38:00.560\nThat's our job.\n\n38:00.560 --> 38:02.120\nHe's like, I know, I know, I know, but that doesn't matter right now.\n\n38:02.120 --> 38:03.120\nI'm trying to.\n\n38:03.120 --> 38:04.120\nI'm Milton Burrough.\n\n38:04.120 --> 38:06.400\nI haven't told a joke for 38 years.\n\n38:06.400 --> 38:09.880\nI'm famous for standing there.\n\n38:09.880 --> 38:12.240\nSo he's like, like, I'm just trying to help you out.\n\n38:12.240 --> 38:13.760\nSo he's like, God, it's fucking bullshit.\n\n38:13.760 --> 38:17.440\nAnd so as Murray's telling the story, he's like, he's like, I'm like, fuck this guy.\n\n38:17.440 --> 38:18.440\nYou know?\n\n38:18.440 --> 38:20.520\nAnd so the phone rings and he's like, the whole time he's like, I'm going to tell this\n\n38:20.520 --> 38:23.960\nguy, you know, jump on a lake and like take my chances or whatever.\n\n38:23.960 --> 38:27.760\nI like how classy he is about it.\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:34.840\nI'm going to tell this guy, you know, go, go build a wheel and make like a leaf and just\n\n38:34.840 --> 38:37.960\nget out of here and take it on the road, Jack.\n\n38:37.960 --> 38:38.960\nThe story is a while ago.\n\n38:38.960 --> 38:40.320\nI'm paraphrasing Murray.\n\n38:40.320 --> 38:42.160\nI cannot quote verbatim on this.\n\n38:42.160 --> 38:45.360\nSo the phone rings and he picks it up and he goes, hello.\n\n38:45.360 --> 38:47.960\nAnd all he hears is talk.\n\n38:47.960 --> 38:49.800\nAnd that's it.\n\n38:49.800 --> 38:50.800\nThat wasn't the deal.\n\n38:50.800 --> 38:57.000\nAnd so he goes, he goes, I think about it for a second.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:58.160\nIt's just not, I'm so sorry.\n\n38:58.160 --> 38:59.880\nI'm so, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.\n\n38:59.880 --> 39:00.880\nMy big fan of yours.\n\n39:00.880 --> 39:01.880\nI would never do anything.\n\n39:01.880 --> 39:02.880\nAnd he goes on and on and on.\n\n39:02.880 --> 39:03.880\nI'm a fan of your music.\n\n39:03.880 --> 39:04.880\nI would never insult your family.\n\n39:04.880 --> 39:05.880\nIt was just a thing.\n\n39:05.880 --> 39:07.760\nYou'll never happen again.\n\n39:07.760 --> 39:09.320\nAnd then just eventually click.\n\n39:09.320 --> 39:15.600\nAnd that was it, no, no resolution, no, no, no, no.\n\n39:15.600 --> 39:16.600\nFamily values is gone.\n\n39:16.600 --> 39:18.320\nFamily, family values is out.\n\n39:18.320 --> 39:19.880\nSuffer lines is out on that one.\n\n39:19.880 --> 39:21.880\nAlso there's the danger of the copycat youping.\n\n39:21.880 --> 39:23.880\nIs it a copycat youper?\n\n39:23.880 --> 39:24.880\nI don't know.\n\n39:24.880 --> 39:25.880\nI don't know.\n\n39:25.880 --> 39:26.880\nI'll say it.\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:27.880\nNope.\n\n39:27.880 --> 39:28.880\nNope.\n\n39:28.880 --> 39:33.240\nI mean, it's not a, it's not a hard one to copycat.\n\n39:33.240 --> 39:34.240\nYeah.\n\n39:34.240 --> 39:35.240\nSo they're getting closer together too.\n\n39:35.240 --> 39:36.240\nIt's like in the movie theater.\n\n39:36.240 --> 39:40.840\nSomebody gets a laugh and then it's like, oh boy, I hope, I hope he sees that pattern\n\n39:40.840 --> 39:46.600\nand tries to trick us, space, space it out, fan it out, blow our minds.\n\n39:46.600 --> 39:50.080\nLet's hear the next youp, like, 915.\n\n39:50.080 --> 39:51.080\nThat was a good copycat.\n\n39:51.080 --> 39:52.080\nIt was a copycat.\n\n39:52.080 --> 39:53.080\nOkay.\n\n39:53.080 --> 39:56.400\nSo we've talked too long about the Frank Sinatra documentary.\n\n39:56.400 --> 40:02.440\nI, I, I had never, I had only heard these like, you know, the zeitgeist stuff.\n\n40:02.440 --> 40:04.560\nSo it was a good start to watch like this.\n\n40:04.560 --> 40:08.080\nAs you say, I think it's very accurate as a friends and family produced documentary.\n\n40:08.080 --> 40:09.480\nI had that tone.\n\n40:09.480 --> 40:13.760\nBut even within that, there were the stories of all these things that you had heard them\n\n40:13.760 --> 40:19.120\nspread out on a timeline, like a big, long Spongebob nose.\n\n40:19.120 --> 40:29.720\nI'm just bringing it back around to you and just like the, I already, I already thought\n\n40:29.720 --> 40:34.520\nthat that was so interesting because I did, I even, I don't know, I do believe, I, I\n\n40:34.520 --> 40:37.400\nknow here's, here's the thing that, here's the thing that makes it relevant right now\n\n40:37.400 --> 40:42.280\nin this room is that here was this guy who had a, at a very young age, he was very like\n\n40:42.280 --> 40:47.600\nhe's putting himself out there about this new topic of racism and, and I believe these\n\n40:47.600 --> 40:53.160\nstories are true because why wouldn't they be like, like the, the, the idea of him taking\n\n40:53.160 --> 40:59.960\nSammy Davis, Jr. under his arm and really actually caring about this emerging thing\n\n40:59.960 --> 41:01.960\nof like black people aren't human beings.\n\n41:01.960 --> 41:06.680\nI think he found Sammy singing at, at Sero's and saw him and he went to Vegas, he's like\n\n41:06.680 --> 41:09.480\nthis guy's going to be in the thing and like, no, we can't put him in the main room.\n\n41:09.480 --> 41:13.280\nHe's like, no, he's, he's, he's main room and then they all had to live in dark town,\n\n41:13.280 --> 41:16.920\nwhich is a shanty town outside of Vegas and all the musicians, like Count Basie's band,\n\n41:16.920 --> 41:21.480\nCount Basie, you couldn't fucking go and stay in Vegas and Sinatra said, they stay in the\n\n41:21.480 --> 41:22.480\nhotel.\n\n41:22.480 --> 41:24.440\nIt's like, if you don't want Sammy Davis in your hotel, you don't want Frank Sinatra\n\n41:24.440 --> 41:26.800\nin your hotel and he completely bullied them around.\n\n41:26.800 --> 41:27.800\nSo there you go.\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:29.280\nMegalomania as progress.\n\n41:29.280 --> 41:36.400\nIt's very interesting and, and, but, but ownership, still ownership, right?\n\n41:36.400 --> 41:39.520\nSo this is the, this is the epiphany that Aaron and I had while we were watching the\n\n41:39.520 --> 41:41.040\ndocumentary because we were like puzzled by it.\n\n41:41.040 --> 41:44.040\nIt was like, well, wait, cause they showed clips of that, those rat pack shows that are\n\n41:44.040 --> 41:50.400\njust like undeniably like anti, like, like not even, it's, it's, I, I thought that, that\n\n41:50.400 --> 41:54.120\nit was just sort of like, you know, like you make gay jokes and it's like, oh, there's\n\n41:54.120 --> 41:57.640\na, there's a gay guy on stage and you make a gay joke and it's like, like kind of like,\n\n41:57.640 --> 42:01.600\nit's, it's sort of like refreshingly uncomfortable and people giggle uncomfortably.\n\n42:01.600 --> 42:06.120\nAnd it's like, sort of like the comedy bleep edges, like sort of like it's, it's, it's,\n\n42:06.120 --> 42:09.600\nit's hit and miss and it's like, you know, blah, blah, blah, but, but they showed clips\n\n42:09.600 --> 42:14.440\nof like D Martin, like, like, like Sammy Davis, Jr. touches him as the joke is that he doesn't\n\n42:14.440 --> 42:15.440\nwant him to touch him.\n\n42:15.440 --> 42:16.440\nThere's an old joke on one of the seizures.\n\n42:16.440 --> 42:19.400\nI think it's Caesar's palace rat pack Wednesday because Sammy, I love you.\n\n42:19.400 --> 42:20.400\nI love your kids.\n\n42:20.400 --> 42:21.400\nI'll hang out with you.\n\n42:21.400 --> 42:22.400\nI'll play sports with you.\n\n42:22.400 --> 42:24.160\nI'll go golfing with you, but don't touch me.\n\n42:24.160 --> 42:25.160\nYeah.\n\n42:25.160 --> 42:26.160\nI'll go to school with you.\n\n42:26.160 --> 42:27.160\nBut don't just don't touch me.\n\n42:27.160 --> 42:29.880\nBut it was also like the joke was that he was angry.\n\n42:29.880 --> 42:34.600\nLike the joke was like, like, like the joke, you could tell that if the joke was going\n\n42:34.600 --> 42:40.880\nto make anyone laugh, that it was coming from a, from a, a Michael Douglas falling down\n\n42:40.880 --> 42:46.600\nangry white man place and not from a, from a hilarious, like we're all starting to mix\n\n42:46.600 --> 42:47.600\ntogether.\n\n42:47.600 --> 42:48.600\nThat clip is a bummer.\n\n42:48.600 --> 42:52.040\nHim, him, him picking Sammy up and saying, I'd like to thank the NAACP for the statue.\n\n42:52.040 --> 42:53.040\nThat's hilarious.\n\n42:53.040 --> 42:54.040\nSure.\n\n42:54.040 --> 42:55.040\nLike, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n42:55.040 --> 42:56.040\nIt's like, well, are there any more friends?\n\n42:56.040 --> 42:57.040\nAnd maybe we say these like weird things.\n\n42:57.040 --> 43:00.000\nI think the other Sammy would come out there because they, they worshiped Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.080\nand Frank's nickname for him was the great entertainer.\n\n43:02.080 --> 43:03.080\nLike he was like, nobody's back.\n\n43:03.080 --> 43:08.560\nLike we, he was honored to be on a stage with Sammy and there's a lot of rat pack stuff\n\n43:08.560 --> 43:12.680\nwhere you listen to it and they'll be whoever's singing gets shit from the other guys except\n\n43:12.680 --> 43:13.680\nfor Frank.\n\n43:13.680 --> 43:15.680\nNobody fucks with Frank while he's out there.\n\n43:15.680 --> 43:17.840\nBut everybody else has taken a dump on each other and doing jokes.\n\n43:17.840 --> 43:19.880\nThe easy target Sammy jokes or black guy jokes.\n\n43:19.880 --> 43:23.840\nLike, because Rickles is in the, you know, in the next room doing all that shit.\n\n43:23.840 --> 43:29.320\nBut there's lots of stuff where Sammy does like super like black power jokes on them.\n\n43:29.320 --> 43:33.240\nSo they go, oh boy, as soon as we get in the lead, you guys are going to go first and the\n\n43:33.240 --> 43:34.240\ncrowd cheers.\n\n43:34.240 --> 43:35.240\nRight.\n\n43:35.240 --> 43:39.760\nSo, so, so do you, do you have a super point to make or can I stitch right that from there?\n\n43:39.760 --> 43:44.320\nThey gave it back and forth, but certainly Sammy, I think was a butt of a lot of that.\n\n43:44.320 --> 43:45.320\nRight.\n\n43:45.320 --> 43:47.320\nSo Aaron and I are watching this and we're going like, this is weird.\n\n43:47.320 --> 43:50.560\nHe's this boy scout guy who like very early in his career, when he actually had a lot\n\n43:50.560 --> 43:56.120\nof things to risk before he was in total control is actually early on putting himself out there\n\n43:56.120 --> 44:02.120\nbecause as an Italian saying like, you know what, when I was young, Italians were maligned\n\n44:02.120 --> 44:06.380\nand not let in and I don't, I'm a successful Italian now and I don't, I don't want to watch\n\n44:06.380 --> 44:07.880\nthis shit roll downhill.\n\n44:07.880 --> 44:12.480\nAnd so, so what, how is that guy, these rap pack shows and then we're sitting there puzzling\n\n44:12.480 --> 44:13.480\nthrough it.\n\n44:13.480 --> 44:18.320\nAnd then Aaron said, well, were the world changed underneath all that?\n\n44:18.320 --> 44:22.840\nMaybe the people that are at the forefront of, for instance, and this is, I think the\n\n44:22.840 --> 44:28.000\nexample that we can relate to is 10 years ago, who were the feminists?\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:33.520\nHow many of them are still in all that has, has come up in the last 10 years?\n\n44:33.520 --> 44:41.680\nLike when feminism meant just being a fan of women, like when it was just like, like,\n\n44:41.680 --> 44:46.120\nhey, give the girls a hand and maybe give me a kiss, ladies.\n\n44:46.120 --> 44:52.560\nLike, like, how, like, is there a subsection of, of like, like the most outspoken like\n\n44:52.560 --> 44:58.240\nguys, like that, that beta male quotient where it was like, I'm a rabid, virulent beta male\n\n44:58.240 --> 44:59.240\nfeminist.\n\n44:59.240 --> 45:04.480\nAnd then 10 years later, like, there are, there is that person that, that, you know,\n\n45:04.480 --> 45:08.800\nthat personality type that's like, when the shit hits the fan, when the rubber meets the\n\n45:08.800 --> 45:14.160\nroad, then it's like, well, wait a minute, you know, I, I, I, I was doing that because\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:19.040\nI like fairness, I like ownership, I like hierarchy, I like, I like my comfort.\n\n45:19.040 --> 45:20.880\nMy comfort is now being threatened.\n\n45:20.880 --> 45:27.280\nThe thing that changed in between Boy Scout, Frank Sinatra, saying, fuck the world if you're\n\n45:27.280 --> 45:33.080\ngoing to be racist, and Frank Sinatra, like, publicly flogging emotionally a black man\n\n45:33.080 --> 45:38.000\non stage for his adoring fans, the thing that changes in between there is that the\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nworld changes.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:42.520\nAnd the thing that remains the same is Frank's in control and saying, fuck you.\n\n45:42.520 --> 45:44.640\nLike, I don't think he liked being told what to do.\n\n45:44.640 --> 45:48.640\nThere's a story that when he, and also, I mean, it's all been told to so many documentaries\n\n45:48.640 --> 45:51.440\nand books about him, and TV pieces.\n\n45:51.440 --> 45:54.040\nWhen he was, when he first started out, they made him, they made him change his name when\n\n45:54.040 --> 45:56.880\nhe was working at some club, and I think it was Frank Diamond, he was, he had to change\n\n45:56.880 --> 46:00.720\nhis name too, and he did a couple gigs with Frank Diamond, I might be getting that wrong.\n\n46:00.720 --> 46:03.960\nAnd he changed his name back, he's like, he's like, like, he was working at a club because\n\n46:03.960 --> 46:09.080\nI can't tell my mom or my grandma or my family that I changed the family name.\n\n46:09.080 --> 46:12.680\nAnd he said, you'll never work with the name Sinatra because no one wants to listen to a\n\n46:12.680 --> 46:13.680\nnigger record.\n\n46:13.680 --> 46:17.680\nAnd because the Irish were niggers, the Italians were niggers, like that's, that's what white\n\n46:17.680 --> 46:21.400\npeople called anybody that was not like a white Protestant.\n\n46:21.400 --> 46:25.240\nAnd so like his, like his, Dukes were always up about being told what to do.\n\n46:25.240 --> 46:28.000\nAnd also like, he was Italian, he's really fucking proud of that.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:31.440\nAnd they said, you'll never work because being Crosby is like, he's, he's in charge.\n\n46:31.440 --> 46:35.280\nAnd he's like, fuck being Crosby, like he went after being Crosby.\n\n46:35.280 --> 46:41.800\nAnd then later had to get gone after by Elvis and endure that, like he had to do that same.\n\n46:41.800 --> 46:44.920\nHe works really hard to get the first Catholic president elected.\n\n46:44.920 --> 46:47.160\nHe had a lot to do with Kennedy getting elected.\n\n46:47.160 --> 46:48.160\nYeah.\n\n46:48.160 --> 46:49.320\nAnd that's where the mob stuff was honest.\n\n46:49.320 --> 46:51.880\nThat's what I thought was ironic because I thought the other stuff was apocryphal because\n\n46:51.880 --> 46:55.280\nin a world, in a documentary where they were honest about the fact that, oh, actually no,\n\n46:55.280 --> 47:00.560\nhe got Kennedy elected because he had mob influence and, and period.\n\n47:00.560 --> 47:01.560\nYeah.\n\n47:01.560 --> 47:04.760\nI was like, well, this seems like an honest thing to say.\n\n47:04.760 --> 47:08.360\nSo maybe the, if they say the other stuff is apocryphal, maybe it's apocryphal, but\n\n47:08.360 --> 47:09.360\nyou're right.\n\n47:09.360 --> 47:10.360\nIt did.\n\n47:10.360 --> 47:11.360\nIt was clearly produced by people that were.\n\n47:11.360 --> 47:12.360\nI think the thing was always that he was in charge.\n\n47:12.360 --> 47:16.600\nI think I've even heard like when he was a little kid, his mom was like super alpha,\n\n47:16.600 --> 47:17.600\nlike really in charge.\n\n47:17.600 --> 47:20.400\nAnd the kids would come over and she'd make dinner for all the neighborhood kids.\n\n47:20.400 --> 47:22.240\nAnd he was a little guy.\n\n47:22.240 --> 47:25.280\nHe wasn't a tough guy, but he was like the, like the mayor of his block when he was a\n\n47:25.280 --> 47:29.280\nlittle shrimpy kid because he was just super in charge.\n\n47:29.280 --> 47:32.240\nLike he had to be the boss of everything, even as a little boy.\n\n47:32.240 --> 47:35.120\nSo, how do we undo talking about Frank Sinatra for 25 minutes?\n\n47:35.120 --> 47:36.040\nWhat do we do?\n\n47:36.040 --> 47:37.560\nScooter rap!\n\n47:37.560 --> 47:38.560\nScooter rap!\n\n47:38.560 --> 47:39.560\nYeah!\n\n47:39.560 --> 47:40.560\nAre you ready Dan?\n\n47:40.560 --> 47:41.560\nI'm doing the camera.\n\n47:41.560 --> 47:42.560\nThis is your rap.\n\n47:42.560 --> 47:46.520\nWell you, you put it at, uh, I'll rap about you.\n\n47:46.520 --> 47:49.400\nWell, his name

his name is S-K-O-O-D-A\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.480\nNo\n\n48:04.980 --> 48:05.980\nRight, get closer\n\n48:05.980 --> 48:06.480\nGet closer\n\n48:06.480 --> 48:07.480\nGood, good\n\n48:07.480 --> 48:12.840\nHis name is S-K-U-D-A\n\n48:12.840 --> 48:15.960\nH-T-A\n\n48:15.960 --> 48:17.760\nQ-T-A\n\n48:17.760 --> 48:19.400\nS-K-U-T-A\n\n48:19.400 --> 48:21.520\nS-K-U-T-A\n\n48:21.520 --> 48:22.060\nHey, hey, hey\n\n48:22.060 --> 48:26.060\nHey, yup guy, come up on stage, you want to feel it like you're the hype man to do some yups on this.\n\n48:27.560 --> 48:28.560\nOh,

--> 48:46.060\nI said we're going to get some scooter.\n\n48:46.060 --> 48:55.060\nI got my boys got a 72 Barracuda. I've got my boys with his name as scooter.\n\n48:56.060 --> 49:03.060\nHe's wearing all these checks. He's riding all these checks. He's eating all these checks. He's riding all these checks.\n\n49:04.060 --> 49:05.060\nMy boy, he's got these checks.\n\n49:06.060 --> 49:13.060\nWe are meant to be S-E-O-U-T-A-R-A family.\n\n49:13.060 --> 49:15.060\nYo, family.\n\n49:19.060 --> 49:20.060\nScooter rap, scooter rap.\n\n49:21.060 --> 49:25.060\nYo, Scooter rap, bad family. I got this shit on the motherfucking rim of me.\n\n49:27.060 --> 49:29.060\nAlright, yup guy, yup guy.\n\n49:29.060 --> 49:30.060\nOh, that's the yup guy?\n\n49:30.060 --> 49:31.060\nThis is yup guy.\n\n49:31.060 --> 49:34.060\nAlright, yup guy, let's have a seat. Let's have some de neumar here.\n\n49:35.060 --> 49:37.060\nLet's have some de neumar.\n\n49:37.060 --> 49:42.060\nCan we go, do we have the technology to replay the tape and find out what you rhymed family with? Rammamy?\n\n49:43.060 --> 49:44.060\nI don't like rammamy.\n\n49:45.060 --> 49:46.060\nI like the refreshing.\n\n49:46.060 --> 49:53.060\nMy thing is that, listen, my family, they've been ramming me with all this negativity, man.\n\n49:54.060 --> 50:01.060\nAnd I just drove cross country because I heard some good spirits and some beautiful people, some of which are here tonight.\n\n50:01.060 --> 50:06.060\nAnd I love some of what the hamburger glue was saying before.\n\n50:06.060 --> 50:09.060\nLadies and gentlemen, life being beautiful, I'd like to take this moment for five dollars.\n\n50:09.060 --> 50:13.060\nYou can subscribe to our podcast and find out what this guy actually looks like.\n\n50:19.060 --> 50:21.060\nIt's not, it's not exactly.\n\n50:22.060 --> 50:24.060\nOh Jesus, it's just, wow.\n\n50:24.060 --> 50:25.060\nCasualties.\n\n50:25.060 --> 50:31.060\nHe almost broke his own glasses. It's like a one man Twilight Zone episode. Time enough at last.\n\n50:33.060 --> 50:34.060\nFinally gets a head bang.\n\n50:34.060 --> 50:37.060\nAll I want, oh wait, my book on head banging, I can't read it.\n\n50:40.060 --> 50:46.060\nJoe, you'll hardly ever see that episode of Twilight Zone when that guy is sitting in the airplane and he's like,\n\n50:46.060 --> 50:49.060\nhe's chilling in the airplane and he's like, I'm having a good time of shit.\n\n50:49.060 --> 50:51.060\nAnd then like at the end of the episode, he looks out the window.\n\n50:52.060 --> 50:53.060\nThat was me, boy.\n\n50:53.060 --> 50:54.060\nWait, what?\n\n50:55.060 --> 50:56.060\nThat's an episode of Twilight Zone?\n\n50:57.060 --> 51:00.060\nThe guy takes an entire plane ride and then looks out the window and someone says, Now's a guy boy.\n\n51:01.060 --> 51:02.060\nJeff Saw.\n\n51:03.060 --> 51:04.060\nI've, I've, no.\n\n51:04.060 --> 51:05.060\nYeah, I saw it.\n\n51:05.060 --> 51:06.060\nJeff, you saw me boy.\n\n51:06.060 --> 51:07.060\nI don't know.\n\n51:07.060 --> 51:08.060\nLike, what's your name first off?\n\n51:08.060 --> 51:09.060\nMy name's Dave, man.\n\n51:14.060 --> 51:15.060\nMy real name's Dave.\n\n51:15.060

because my mama was an opera singer.\n\n51:35.140 --> 51:41.060\nOh, and then she put you in a basket and sent you the wrong way down the river in an anti\n\n51:41.060 --> 51:42.060\nMoses

52:10.620\nMy mama was the leading colorator soprano in New York City Opera, and she got pregnant.\n\n52:10.620 --> 52:17.220\nAnd what happened was they brought in an understudy and they were like, yo, you getting old?\n\n52:17.220 --> 52:18.900\nWe don't like the way you look no more.\n\n52:18.900 --> 52:19.900\nYou getting pregnant?\n\n52:19.900 --> 52:22.700\nWe're going to be in this, we're

destiny in\n\n52:29.660 --> 52:34.420\nthe face and she keeps singing.\n\n52:34.420 --> 52:35.420\nMama kept singing.\n\n52:35.420 --> 52:36.420\nAll right.\n\n52:36.420 --> 52:37.420\nMama kept singing.\n\n52:37.420 --> 52:38.420\nMama kept singing.\n\n52:38.420 --> 52:39.420\nNo, she's pregnant.\n\n52:39.420 --> 52:45.260\nWhile she's pregnant with me, daddy sing, bae's mama kept singing, but wait, wait, she\n\n52:45.260 --> 52:48.260\nkept singing in the theater was firing her.\n\n52:48.260 --> 52:55.940\nDid she keep singing in New Jersey or just you know, no, no, my mom, my mom said, fuck\n\n52:55.940 --> 52:56.940\nchildbirth.\n\n52:56.940 --> 52:59.420\nI'm having a caesarean.\n\n52:59.420 --> 53:00.940\nShe has a caesarean.\n\n53:00.940 --> 53:03.740\nWhat has me pulled out of her?\n\n53:03.740 --> 53:07.460\nWhich trimester on stage?\n\n53:07.460 --> 53:11.620\nThis is actually a David Lynch film directed by Matthew Farney mid eighties.\n\n53:11.620 --> 53:13.700\nThis is like heavy duty, heavy hitters.\n\n53:13.700 --> 53:21.700\nThis is the most ancient Greek way to describe my mom got laid off and had a caesarean.\n\n53:21.700 --> 53:28.100\nMy mom had my body untimely ripped from her womb.\n\n53:28.100 --> 53:32.180\nThat's what would happen to normal humans, but Mama Klein in a normal human.\n\n53:32.180 --> 53:33.180\nShe had me cut out.\n\n53:33.180 --> 53:45.900\nYour name is Dave Kline, my name is Dave Kline, you don't have to press rewind on\n\n53:45.900 --> 53:46.900\nthat either.\n\n53:46.900 --> 53:53.460\nSo, okay, so mama Klein has me ripped out of whatever parts I was growing in because\n\n53:53.460 --> 53:54.700\nthey want the normal parts.\n\n53:54.700 --> 54:00.740\nThat's a damn sure and they pull me out of there and I come scurrying out and sniffing\n\n54:00.740 --> 54:10.420\nout and I'm more of a macho main Randy Savage guy.\n\n54:10.420 --> 54:11.420\nI don't know.\n\n54:11.420 --> 54:13.300\nI would say they pull me out.\n\n54:13.300 --> 54:16.180\nLong story short, mama Klein's a fucking baller and a rider.\n\n54:16.180 --> 54:17.180\nShe was ready to go.\n\n54:17.180 --> 54:25.420\nThey sewed her up and she was on stage singing man all as man all three weeks after having\n\n54:25.420 --> 54:29.740\nher gut split open and having me fall out of her and spill over.\n\n54:29.740 --> 54:34.740\nYou could take away from that that your mom's a workaholic that didn't care about your well-being.\n\n54:34.740 --> 54:35.740\nWell...\n\n54:35.740 --> 54:42.740\nNo, Jen, she was a writer, and she was a baller.\n\n54:42.740 --> 54:44.740\nI mean, this gets into...\n\n54:44.740 --> 54:48.740\nThe thing is like being the son of an extraordinary woman is a difficult thing.\n\n54:48.740 --> 54:49.740\nOh, okay, I like that.\n\n54:49.740 --> 54:50.740\nThat's good.\n\n54:50.740 --> 54:51.740\nThat's true.\n\n54:51.740 --> 54:52.740\nYeah, you know what?\n\n54:52.740 --> 54:54.740\nAnd it was hard for her, and they gave her a try, but she still had you.\n\n54:54.740 --> 55:02.740\nAnd yeah, so your burden as a white male with a remarkable mother...\n\n55:02.740 --> 55:05.740\nYeah, I have a lot of guilt, and so I have a lot of guilt, yeah.\n\n55:05.740 --> 55:06.740\nShe paid a little forward.\n\n55:06.740 --> 55:07.740\nShe's like, fuck that guy.\n\n55:07.740 --> 55:08.740\nI'll have privilege.\n\n55:08.740 --> 55:13.740\nI'll semi-abort him and then go back to work.\n\n55:13.740 --> 55:18.740\nLike, let him go up to the plates with a couple of strikes.\n\n55:18.740 --> 55:23.740\nShe knew that she had a fury line in her, and that like she could kind of throw the kid to the wall.\n\n55:23.740 --> 55:26.740\nSome kids, when they get thrown to the wolves, they get eaten.\n\n55:26.740 --> 55:27.740\nRight.\n\n55:27.740 --> 55:28.740\nI got thrown to the wolves.\n\n55:28.740 --> 55:31.740\nOthers become edipus.\n\n55:31.740 --> 55:34.740\nYo, you know what, you know, you know, Harmon?\n\n55:34.740 --> 55:35.740\nHarmon.\n\n55:35.740 --> 55:36.740\nIt was also very...\n\n55:36.740 --> 55:39.740\nYou know, Harmon, would you just say about my mama?\n\n55:39.740 --> 55:41.740\nWould you just Greek edipus say about my mama?\n\n55:41.740 --> 55:44.740\nI said, you may be destined to have sex with her.\n\n55:44.740 --> 55:46.740\nI implied, I implied.\n\n55:46.740 --> 55:50.740\nYou know, all I'm gonna say is that good hair runs in the bloodline.\n\n55:50.740 --> 55:53.740\nIs your mom...\n\n55:53.740 --> 55:54.740\nIs your mom...\n\n55:54.740 --> 55:55.740\nIs your mom still with us?\n\n55:55.740 --> 55:56.740\nShe is.\n\n55:56.740 --> 55:57.740\nHer name's Claudette Peterson.\n\n55:57.740 --> 55:58.740\nShe's a beautiful woman, yeah.\n\n55:58.740 --> 56:00.740\nWhere does she live?\n\n56:00.740 --> 56:05.740\nHow beautiful is she, Dave?\n\n56:05.740 --> 56:07.740\nOh, boy.\n\n56:07.740 -->

choices.\n\n59:08.740 --> 59:11.740\nGentlemen, you came out of the vat and you were like,\n\n59:11.740 --> 59:13.740\nwhere's the record store?\n\n59:13.740 --> 59:17.740\nGentlemen, we finally received funding for Operation Metal Beast.\n\n59:20.740 --> 59:26.740\nIt looks like if we took you into like an army barracks\n\n59:26.740 --> 59:28.740\nand you heard like buzz clippers coming for a while,\n\n59:28.740 --> 59:32.740\nlike a really marketable guy might emerge.\n\n59:32.740 --> 59:34.740\nHere's the thing, Dan.\n\n59:34.740 --> 59:37.740\nI went to a school where I got to see a

got crazy addicted to drugs and alcohol.\n\n59:46.740 --> 59:47.740\nWhich ones?\n\n59:47.740 --> 59:48.740\nMarijuana and alcohol.\n\n59:48.740 --> 59:49.740\nMarijuana.\n\n59:49.740 --> 59:51.740\nPut out most of the alcohol, but it was really...\n\n59:51.740 --> 59:54.740\nWell, for whatever, this is all personal choices.\n\n59:54.740 --> 59:56.740\nIt was more than I was just a real dark human being\n\n59:56.740 --> 59:58.740\nand wasn't like powerful or skilled,\n\n59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.740\nwhich when you're not powerful or skilled\n\n01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.740\nthen you want to be powerful and skilled.\n\n01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.740\nThere's like a shadow from your mom,\n\n01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.740\nlike you see these photos of your mom being super talented\n\n01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.740\nand this mythology of your mom being so talented\n\n01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.740\nthat you had to be ripped from her womb\n\n01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.740\nso that she could get back to work.\n\n01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.740\nWell, I guess my take on it is that I don't think it's a mythology.\n\n01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740\nI think everybody should...\n\n01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.740\nWell, when I say mythology, I don't mean lies.\n\n01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740\nRight.\n\n01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.740\nI was afforded some

someone\n\n01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.740\nand you don't know anyone else but that person\n\n01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.740\nand you're focusing your knowledge on them\n\n01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.740\nand you have a connection.\n\n01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.740\nAnd then the father of the bride is like,\n\n01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.740\nWhat's the toast?\n\n01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.740\nWhat are you toasting to?\n\n01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.740\nI understand it's passionate.\n\n01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.740\nWhat is it?\n\n01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.740\nWell, the funny thing is that this actually happened.\n\n01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.740\nIt's pretty much exactly how it went down.\n\n01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.740\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.740\nBut your friend's still married, right?\n\n01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.740\nThe gal is the most forgiving and beautiful\n\n01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.740\nand wonderful and understanding person.\n\n01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.740\nFucking hamburglers.\n\n01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.740\nAdam Goldberg's obviously jealous for obvious reasons.\n\n01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.740\nHave you ever seen the video game Space Ace?\n\n01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.740\nAdam Goldberg turns into you when you hit that button.\n\n01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.740\nDaphne!\n\n01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.740\nIt's an old reference.\n\n01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.740\nYou can actually download Space Ace on the Apple Store.\n\n01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.740\nIt's like five bucks.\n\n01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.740\nYou can play this whole game.\n\n01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.740\nBlueith made these laser duck video games back then.\n\n01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.740\nDragon's Lair and Space Ace.\n\n01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.740\nIt was incredible.\n\n01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.740\nWe thought that's what interactivity was going to be.\n\n01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.740\nIt was going to be like a video game.\n\n01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:28.740\nYou just watch a cartoon.\n\n01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.740\nBut all it was was you were watching a cartoon\n\n01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.740\nand then an arrow would pop up and you had to hit the joystick the right way.\n\n01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.740\nAnyways, so are your friends here?\n\n01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.740\nBy any chance did you come here with the wedding?\n\n01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.740\nAre they still here?\n\n01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.740\nIs the groom here?\n\n01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.740\nI feel like we should bring the groom up\n\n01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.740\nbut we also need to bring our friends out.\n\n01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.740\nWe're going to get the show on the run.\n\n01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.740\nI want to say one of the main...\n\n01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.740\nThere's a constellation of reasons I came out here.\n\n01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.740\nOne of for real and it's so lame\n\n01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.740\nbut I'm going to give a voice to a lot of fucking people here.\n\n01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.740\nWhat you do here is so cool and powerful\n\n01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.740\nand chill and just opens up a lot of cool avenues.\n\n01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.740\nI think he knows what he's talking about.\n\n01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.740\nIt's just...\n\n01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.740\nI like you and Superman tonight.\n\n01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.740\nIt's just...\n\n01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.740\nAnd just thanks for having this\n\n01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.740\nbecause I listened to the podcast\n\n01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.740\nand let me know that LA has some shit that I want to do\n\n01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.740\nthat isn't like the crazy...\n\n01:03:22.740 -->

and form a community of your own\n\n01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.740\nwith one of the biggest resources of LA\n\n01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.740\nnow that we can all make movies and put them on YouTube\n\n01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.740\nit's actually not the place you need to come because there's sound stages.\n\n01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.740\nThe reason to come now is because of the bumper crop of creative people\n\n01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.740\nsitting around spinning their wheels.\n\n01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.740\nYou can form your own communities.\n\n01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.740\nYou can do new things.\n\n01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.740\nYou can form a new industry.\n\n01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.740\nDave Kline is now Genuflecting.\n\n01:03:55.740 -->

01:04:34.740\nIt rhymes so you remember it the next day.\n\n01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.740\nI tried to get out like mid-senaturing talk\n\n01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.740\nand I felt that would destroy the crowd.\n\n01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.740\nWe needed you to hear us ballast for a while.\n\n01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.740\nAs a physical buffer, like, you took a couple hits there.\n\n01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.740\nScooter.\n\n01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.740\nI didn't want to get me to deal with that.\n\n01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.740\nI did get like several, like, hair whips of the face.\n\n01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.740\nAnd it's fine.\n\n01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.740\nIt's going fine.\n\n01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.740\nNo, Scooter, it's a different case with you.\n\n01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.740\nI mean, that guy was, he was a character.\n\n01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.740\nWe like it when the characters self exit\n\n01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.740\nbecause otherwise the alternative is like cattle prods and stuff like...\n\n01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.740\nYou have a very kind hearted nature.\n\n01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.740\nWe knew we could have asked you to leave at any time.\n\n01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.740\nI'm sorry, I praised him for self exiting.\n\n01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.740\nDid not mean that you have been lingering like a...\n\n01:05:13.740 -->

I don't know if this will ever stop.\n\n01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740\nWe're still so fascinated with the minutiae,\n\n01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:30.740\nbecause these things pop up out of context and brought to the fore.\n\n01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.740\nNow I'm thinking of the Africa AIDS joke lady,\n\n01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.740\nand how that phenomenon happened, how she was tweeting,\n\n01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.740\nand she made this dumb, bad joke, because she's not a comedian.\n\n01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:48.740\nExactly, yeah. And by the time she landed in Africa,\n\n01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.740\nshe was literally world-famous, and definitely fired,\n\n01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.740\nand definitely...\n\n01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.740\nIt's absolutely no judgment on...\n\n01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.740\nI think that's the thing is like...\n\n01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.740\nWhy judgment?\n\n01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:04.740\nOutside of that, the phenomenon happening becomes the bigger story.\n\n01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.740\nWe have the power now to destroy human life.\n\n01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.740\nOutside of referendum, outside of criminal courts,\n\n01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.740\noutside, we can really... We've always had that power,\n\n01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.740\nbut it was like broadcast news would occasionally graze\n\n01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.740\nacross an individual human life, and it was like,\n\n01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.740\noh, you were on the nightly news, and it was like a rarer thing.\n\n01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:25.740\nBut now you can just go from the airport, fuck it around,\n\n01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.740\nto the cover of Time Magazine in a bad way,\n\n01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.740\nin the span of a three-hour span.\n\n01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.740\nAnd I don't...\n\n01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:40.740\nIt's equal parts scary and kind of invigorating,\n\n01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.740\nbecause also, this is the same thing that we're finding out.\n\n01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.740\nIt's not like cops are all of a sudden going insane.\n\n01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.740\nClearly, it's been a high-pressure job for a while,\n\n01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.740\nand some shit's been swept into the carpet,\n\n01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:56.740\nand individual instances are becoming able to...\n\n01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.740\nEverybody was wearing a camera at all times.\n\n01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.740\nYeah, now we're just like...\n\n01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.740\nWe're awakening to this world of taste buds.\n\n01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.740\nEverything tastes all fucked up,\n\n01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:09.740\nand we're focusing on these individual things.\n\n01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.740\nI think my hope is that we can aggregate that\n\n01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:18.740\ninto some common-sense stuff about, for instance...\n\n01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.740\nIt's going to force people to be serious about what they say and what they do.\n\n01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:26.740\nYou see politicians now who are, I assume, older.\n\n01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.740\nMaybe this is why, but they're behind the curve,\n\n01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.740\nand you have them telling stories, or their renditions of things,\n\n01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.740\nbecause they're used to being caught up to,\n\n01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.740\nif they're going to get vetted maybe a year or two years later,\n\n01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.740\nand now it's happening pretty much instantly.\n\n01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:43.740\nIt happened to Hillary when she was talking about that plane landing.\n\n01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.740\nWell, also, this new phenomenon, this next generation of politicians,\n\n01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.740\nlike, okay, so the guy that took over the Daily Show,\n\n01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.740\nhe made, when he was 20-something,\n\n01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:56.740\nlike, oh my God, the jokes that I made when I was in my 20s,\n\n01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.740\nand the guy that's taken over the Daily Show,\n\n01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.740\nso we saw that phenomenon.\n\n01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.740\nIt was like, he was vetted, because John Stuart is, for better or for worse,\n\n01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.740\na senator, and he's retiring,\n\n01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.740\nand the guy taking his place needed to be vetted,\n\n01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.740\nand he was vetted via the Internet,\n\n01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.740\nand there's a public record of him growing as a comedian,\n\n01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.740\nincluding all of his Jew jokes and his misogyny,\n\n01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.740\nand stuff like him experimenting with trying to be funny.\n\n01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.740\nAnd so, like, politicians, holy shit, man,\n\n01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.740\nlike, the next generation of people trying to be senators and presidents,\n\n01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.740\nyou're gonna be able to go back and go like, yeah,\n\n01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.740\nlike, I want to think of it as a good thing,\n\n01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.740\nbut my concern is that it's just gonna enter a new, like, Elizabethan kind of,\n\n01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.740\nor Victorian, I don't know anything about history.\n\n01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.740\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.740\nThat prudence will reign, and that will not free us.\n\n01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.740\nI think what's happening right now is that, like,\n\n01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:52.740\nI mean, I hate politics, and I don't like Republicans or Democrats particularly,\n\n01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.740\nand that people have this choice to make with Hillary,\n\n01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.740\nshe'll be the only nominee, right?\n\n01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:01.740\nAnd there are people that are, like, she's not a perfect candidate,\n\n01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:04.740\nbut I think nowadays, I don't think there'll ever be such a thing as a perfect candidate again,\n\n01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.740\nbecause there'll be no secrets, no mysteries.\n\n01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:11.740\nAll of your warrants and pimples and flaws are gonna be so much a matter of public record\n\n01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:16.740\nfrom your entire existence that maybe there's a possible possibility.\n\n01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.740\nOr there will be superhumans like Barack Obama,\n\n01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:23.740\nwho, like, he, like, the thing that was significant about him to me\n\n01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.740\nwas his ability to withstand all of that shit.\n\n01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.740\nThat became a kind of hero's journey in and of itself.\n\n01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.740\nI started rooting for him, because as much as I hate politicians,\n\n01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.740\nI'm like, fuck yeah, fuck you for trying to, like, dirty this guy,\n\n01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.740\nand you can't find it, you can't figure it out,\n\n01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.740\nyou can't figure out why he's a bad guy.\n\n01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.740\nBut my concern is that then it's just, like, we evolve in that direction,\n\n01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.740\nthat these people continue to, like, you pull them out of their mother's womb\n\n01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.740\nby either untimely or not,\n\n01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:53.740\nand you put it on a scale and you barcode.\n\n01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.740\nI mean, this is already my perception of the political career path.\n\n01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.740\nLike, they're pulled out of a womb in a different hospital.\n\n01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.740\nHave you noticed that we're getting less upes now that they've got all out of a system?\n\n01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.740\nLike, yeah, he's good.\n\n01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:10.740\nHe's now in his mind, he's curled up in his mother's breast going,\n\n01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.740\nyoup.\n\n01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.740\nYoup.\n\n01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:18.740\nOr she's going, like, youp.\n\n01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.740\nIt's way higher, way higher, she's a soprano.\n\n01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.740\nYoup, and the glasses are breaking.\n\n01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.740\nThat's why he brings two pairs of glasses on stage.\n\n01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.740\nWhat is my point?\n\n01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:33.740\nWhen I was a communications major in college, my professor, Ken Sobiak, said,\n\n01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.740\nwith technology comes, we keep trying to figure out,\n\n01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.740\nis this good technology or bad technology?\n\n01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.740\nMP3, direct broadcast satellite, internet, YouTube.\n\n01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.740\nIt always turns out it's more good and more bad.\n\n01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:49.740\nI keep, the internet...\n\n01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.740\nWe put Scooter to work apparently trying to kill me.\n\n01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.740\nScooter's now become bartender, I love that.\n\n01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.740\nThe internet represents, like, new...\n\n01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.740\nScooter, you like one?\n\n01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.740\nNo, I'm good, thank you.\n\n01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:03.740\nNew opportunities for the truth to come out,\n\n01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:09.740\njust worry that it represents a new agenda for lies to get more games of thrownies.\n\n01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.740\nI think what it's going to inevitably do,\n\n01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:16.740\nand it does, like, to people that, like, when you first get on Twitter\n\n01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:20.740\nand you have five followers, you make poopy jokes and nanny jokes, you don't give a shit,\n\n01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.740\nthen, like, if you're, like, you, like, all of a sudden,\n\n01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.740\nyou cross a critical mass threshold of amount of followers,\n\n01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.740\nyou already have to start sanding the edges down\n\n01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:32.740\nand then trimming, like, major, like, corners off and...\n\n01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.740\nYeah.\n\n01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.740\nYou have to decide what stick you are,\n\n01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.740\nbecause it's not like I'm just, like, some bland vanilla person,\n\n01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.740\nbut I did have to pick which fucking specific stick I was.\n\n01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:42.740\nYou know what?\n\n01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:43.740\nI was right.\n\n01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.740\nI did the wrong thing, and I made the right decision afterwards.\n\n01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.740\nI posted a video for, like, 10 seconds from...\n\n01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.740\nI went against everything I believe in.\n\n01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.740\nI went to this music festival called Stagecoach,\n\n01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.740\nbecause my friend was singing, and it's Coachella, but country music.\n\n01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.740\nIt's on the same fairgrounds.\n\n01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.740\nI despise music festivals because it's a bunch of douchebags,\n\n01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.740\nand it's dirt everywhere.\n\n01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:05.740\nAnd you have to eat some horrible pizza,\n\n01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:07.740\nand it was great because, like, you know,\n\n01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:10.740\nI saw Merle Haggard, which I loved, and it was very fun.\n\n01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:14.740\nEverybody, every girl there, unanimously, in short shirts,\n\n01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.740\nwhich seems like something that I'd be all for,\n\n01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:17.740\nbut it was like...\n\n01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.740\nThey were all just, like, young and just...\n\n01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.740\nLike, it was just...\n\n01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.740\nYou think it was...\n\n01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.740\nWhat bothered me, it was 100% white people,\n\n01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.740\nand it's like, you can't have a festival like this.\n\n01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:27.740\nGross!\n\n01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.740\nI know.\n\n01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.740\nMakes you old, Joe.\n\n01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.740\nNo, no, it's like...\n\n01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.740\nI don't like when it's homogenous like that.\n\n01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.740\nIt's just like, that's not a festival.\n\n01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.740\nLike, have a couple, like, other people.\n\n01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.740\nSo anyway, I was walking by this...\n\n01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.740\nLike, don't just have an all-white festival.\n\n01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.740\nSo, not by design, it's a country festival, so, of course.\n\n01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.740\nBut I was walking by this trash can,\n\n01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:57.740\nand they have recycle bin, landfill bin, compost bin.\n\n01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.740\nAnd there was a security guard kind of supine\n\n01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.740\nlaying there lazily on some hay bales next to those,\n\n01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.740\ndoing nothing.\n\n01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.740\nLike a he-ha sketch.\n\n01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.740\nOut of some corn stalks, and at some point,\n\n01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.740\nRay Price came through.\n\n01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.740\nSo, Ray Price was it.\n\n01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.740\nAnyway, there was this two girls,\n\n01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.740\nand I took a video, which is quite hilarious,\n\n01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.740\nand I'll show you after the show if you'd like to see it.\n\n01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:22.740\nTwo girls wearing the same outfit, white short shirts,\n\n01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.740\nand one girl was holding the other girl's hair back\n\n01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.740\nas the other girl was vomiting,\n\n01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.740\nand I thought quite cleverly into the compost bin.\n\n01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.740\nI thought that was nice.\n\n01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.740\nThat's good, right?\n\n01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.740\nThat would be like the best compost ever.\n\n01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.740\nNot landfill, it's not landfill.\n\n01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.740\nYou don't want to recycle.\n\n01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.740\nBut also it doesn't ruin the compost process, right?\n\n01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.740\nI think you're speeding it up.\n\n01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.740\nI think you're halfway home.\n\n01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.740\nI'm actually actually gay.\n\n01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.740\nI'm almost certain if you've vomited on a corn field,\n\n01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.740\nyou'd grow some nice ass corn.\n\n01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:51.740\nAren't there worms in there doing work?\n\n01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.740\nSo, I don't know if the vomit kills the worms,\n\n01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:54.740\nmaybe it's actually bad.\n\n01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.740\nI think at this stage in the game,\n\n01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.740\nthere's nothing happening yet.\n\n01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.740\nLater on, you want worms to suck.\n\n01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.740\nOkay, I'm confused.\n\n01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.740\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.740\nThis is a trash can.\n\n01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.740\nI've never seen a compost bin at a major event,\n\n01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.740\nso that's very cool.\n\n01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:05.740\nAnd also, I thought,\n\n01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.740\nhow good for this gal for holding the hair back?\n\n01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:08.740\nSo, I guess, I'm like, got it.\n\n01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.740\nI'm walking by, my phone was in my hand,\n\n01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:10.740\nI'm like, boop, video.\n\n01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.740\nAnd I go by, and what I wanted to do,\n\n01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:14.740\nbecause the girl's legs was kind of spread,\n\n01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.740\nand I wanted to end the shot by going down\n\n01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.740\nand seeing the word compost,\n\n01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.740\nbecause that would be hilarious.\n\n01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.740\nAnd then I would kind of zoom in\n\n01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.740\nand I would win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\n01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.740\nWhen I get down to the final shot,\n\n01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.740\nit turns out her legs were too close together\n\n01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.740\nand I'm just now filming her ass.\n\n01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.740\nAnd you're calling out, spread your legs.\n\n01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.740\nSpread them!\n\n01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.740\nShow me the compost bag.\n\n01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.740\nSo, now I'm just creepy and McTavish,\n\n01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.740\nI'm 49 years old, I'm 40.\n\n01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:41.740\nCreepy and McTavish?\n\n01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:43.740\nI'm doubled her age, their age.\n\n01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.740\nAnd the hilarious thing is,\n\n01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.740\nwhen I watched a video, and it's so good,\n\n01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.740\nis that each time she vomits and she vomits,\n\n01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.740\nshe hurls twice in a six-second span,\n\n01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.740\nshe does a little turkey booty shake.\n\n01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.740\nAnd it's really funny,\n\n01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.740\nso I put it online on Instagram,\n\n01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.740\nI said, a good friend,\n\n01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.740\na good person holds her friend's hair back\n\n01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:02.740\nwhen she's puking.\n\n01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:05.740\nA great person makes sure it's in the compost bin.\n\n01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:09.740\nStagecoach 2015, hashtag booty shake.\n\n01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.740\nAnd it was up for fucking five seconds\n\n01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.740\nand I had eight hate mails.\n\n01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.740\nYou invasive, creepy asshole,\n\n01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.740\ntake that down.\n\n01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.740\nBecause the end of your shot, you showed it to me.\n\n01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:20.740\nI just ran out.\n\n01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:21.740\nYou were trying for that compost label,\n\n01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.740\nbut you successfully just framed her ass.\n\n01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.740\nShould I show it on camera?\n\n01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:26.740\nShould we show this?\n\n01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:27.740\nYeah, you should.\n\n01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.740\nThe audience won't see it, though.\n\n01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:30.740\nNo, I'm not great.\n\n01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:32.740\nWell, DeMorge, you were going to say something.\n\n01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:33.740\nYou kept getting derailed.\n\n01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.740\nI'll show you after the show.\n\n01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.740\nWe were talking about the internet's dual capacity\n\n01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.740\nfor truth-bringing, but also then encouraging lies.\n\n01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.740\nI just think that it's going to create other specialties,\n\n01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.740\nother jobs, which are the people who,\n\n01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.740\nthe people who are telling these stories.\n\n01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.740\nSo especially in politics, you have people running for office\n\n01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.740\nwho are going to have these anecdotes.\n\n01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.740\nI mean, Romney had an anecdote when she talked\n\n01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.740\nabout a very clear memory of at some sort of convention,\n\n01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.740\nbeing at some sort of convention with his father,\n\n01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.740\nand his father's holding him in his arms,\n\n01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:04.740\nand the convention he's talking about,\n\n01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.740\nhe hadn't been born yet.\n\n01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:08.740\nSo all it took was an intern at Matt out to go,\n\n01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:09.740\nhey, we got this thing,\n\n01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.740\nand then that was the half the episode was that.\n\n01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.740\nAnd then just playing that over and over again,\n\n01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:14.740\nand then going, let's look at the timeline\n\n01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.740\nand doing graphics and other shit.\n\n01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.740\nAnd so they're going to need people implanted in,\n\n01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.740\nand what you had with Obama was you had people\n\n01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.740\nwho recognized, okay, here's another channel.\n\n01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.740\nYou can't get everybody directly,\n\n01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.740\nbut there's this internet thing,\n\n01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.740\nand there's this information that's traveling faster,\n\n01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.740\nand there's a way people read information.\n\n01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.740\nThe whole results are coming out,\n\n01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.740\nbecause news agencies are not news agencies anymore\n\n01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.740\nby the normal sort of accords.\n\n01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:38.740\nNow they just want clicks.\n\n01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:39.740\nThat's why he won't.\n\n01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.740\nSo they're reprinted, they're reprinted.\n\n01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.740\nYeah, they were just faster.\n\n01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.740\nThey were faster, they were quicker, they were better.\n\n01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.740\nHe's just like racing grandpa.\n\n01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.740\nIt was exactly what JFK beat Nixon.\n\n01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.740\nIt was just sort of like the new technology\n\n01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.740\nand like Nixon, I don't know if it's apocryphal or not,\n\n01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.740\nbut Nixon refused makeup for the first debate.\n\n01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.740\nAnd sweated, and looked nervous, and sweated, and looked horrible.\n\n01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.740\nAnd wore a wool suit on TV.\n\n01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.740\nYou're being digitized into a box,\n\n01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.740\nand no one's gonna know you're wearing makeup.\n\n01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:06.740\nAnd he was like, lay it on me,\n\n01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.740\nlike give me all the stage makeup.\n\n01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:08.740\nYeah.\n\n01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.740\nBut yeah, and so with Obama,\n\n01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.740\nyou've got like, okay,\n\n01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.740\nso you're good at having even Dan Harmon respect you.\n\n01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.740\nLike, you can't even, like, he's bulletproof,\n\n01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.740\nlike from all views, you know, there's no stories,\n\n01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.740\nthere's no, you know, and then it's like,\n\n01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.740\nbut then it's like you're president for eight years,\n\n01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.740\nand it's like Guantanamo doesn't close,\n\n01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:40.740\nand the district, the fucking attorney general\n\n01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.740\nis like waging war on pot dispensaries\n\n01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.740\nwhile the pot is becoming increasingly legal.\n\n01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.740\nIt's all the same horse shit, political shit,\n\n01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.740\nanything that matters to me,\n\n01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.740\nthis president is no different from fucking anybody\n\n01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.740\nthat came before him,\n\n01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.740\nhe's just another fucking president.\n\n01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.740\nMy question is like, are we ever gonna get to the point\n\n01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.740\nwhere like something snaps where we have a choice\n\n01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.740\nbetween having a human being as a civil servant?\n\n01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:06.740\nWe go like, well, this guy walks with a limp\n\n01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:09.740\nand hates Malaysians and smoked pot\n\n01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:13.740\nand had a bad divorce and like,\n\n01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.740\nlike here's all his flaws,\n\n01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.740\nbut blah, blah, blah, fucking blah,\n\n01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.740\nand you know what, also, not even a big fan\n\n01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.740\nof this hot button or that hot button,\n\n01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:29.740\nbut civil servant, like wants to save the country.\n\n01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:32.740\nWhere the presidency wasn't a celebrity office,\n\n01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.740\nit used to be, it's kind of a very, very clerk.\n\n01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:40.740\nYou go back to the days where the opposition,\n\n01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.740\nthe group in power, the group not in power\n\n01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.740\nactually respected the presidency.\n\n01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.740\nAnd there was a point where that turned,\n\n01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.740\nwhere they said, okay, now we're going to violate even that.\n\n01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:53.740\nRight, and there was a point when the League of Women Voters,\n\n01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.740\nI think this was in the 70s,\n\n01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:58.740\nwho used to always moderate all the debates,\n\n01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.740\nretired from the process,\n\n01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.740\nand issued a statement that should be emblazoned\n\n01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:08.740\non tablets and thrown down upon us\n\n01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.740\nas we dance naked around golden calves.\n\n01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.740\nBut instead, because it wasn't written by God\n\n01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.740\nand was written by the League of Women Voters,\n\n01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.740\nis forgotten.\n\n01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.740\nBut they, in a paragraph, fucking just, like, summed up.\n\n01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.740\nThey said, we are not moderating debates anymore.\n\n01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.740\nI'm not quoting them at all.\n\n01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740\nLook it up.\n\n01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.740\nLook what they said when they retired from the thing.\n\n01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:34.740\nI will paraphrase them for my own purposes and say,\n\n01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:37.740\nthey said, we are tired of participating\n\n01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:39.740\nin a bipartisan sham.\n\n01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:44.740\nWe are tired of participating in a rehearsed fucking thing.\n\n01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.740\nThis is all bullshit.\n\n01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.740\nWe are not doing this anymore.\n\n01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.740\nDave, can I get a yop?\n\n01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:51.740\nThere you are.\n\n01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.740\nLike the Comedy Central roast was taken over by Comedy Central,\n\n01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.740\nI assume, because the Friars had a problem with it,\n\n01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.740\nfor better or for worse.\n\n01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.740\nEveryone was just like, okay, fine, ladies,\n\n01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.740\nno more debates, hosted by you, anyways.\n\n01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:10.740\nAnd it's just like, there is a big, big, big, big,\n\n01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.740\nwe're drunk on our own success.\n\n01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:16.740\nWhen you're an empire, who's going to tell you to change?\n\n01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.740\nWhy would you ever change?\n\n01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.740\nThe reason you change is because you're losing.\n\n01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.740\nYou got to look at the team above you and go,\n\n01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:22.740\nwe're getting our asses kicked.\n\n01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.740\nWe got to shake things up.\n\n01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:27.740\nBut the people at the top, the empire is always just crumble\n\n01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.740\nbecause they don't fucking figure it out.\n\n01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:31.740\nWhy can't you just figure it out?\n\n01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.740\nWhy can't you just look at your own bullshit\n\n01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.740\nand go, look at this old mailman landing on the lawn\n\n01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.740\nand his flying helicopter.\n\n01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.740\nAll he's saying is, why is money involved in government?\n\n01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.740\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:46.740\nWe're at King's Landing, where money runs everything,\n\n01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.740\nbut why the fuck are our civil servants?\n\n01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.740\nWhy should money affect your election?\n\n01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.740\nThat's insane.\n\n01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.740\nYou're controlling the free world.\n\n01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.740\nThat's a complete...\n\n01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:58.740\nIf you just think about that with common sense for a second,\n\n01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:01.740\neverything says campaign reform, campaign reform,\n\n01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.740\nand everyone in charge of everything that would ever change that\n\n01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.740\nis already lining their pockets so it would never change.\n\n01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.740\nSo the fucking guy got in a goddamn flying bicycle,\n\n01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.740\nand he called the government and said,\n\n01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.740\nI'm coming in!\n\n01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.740\nAnd he wrote letters saying, I'm coming in!\n\n01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:18.740\nAnd he mostly thought he'd be shot down\n\n01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:21.740\nbecause he thought that might happen,\n\n01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.740\nand if that happens,\n\n01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:25.740\nmaybe that will be a life well spent as an American.\n\n01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:28.740\nAnd he landed on the fucking Congress's lawn\n\n01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:32.740\nand because he got through safely, CNN is just going,\n\n01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:35.740\nso how much more money should we spend on missile defense?\n\n01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.740\nFirst the left, then the right.\n\n01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.740\nThis is the full view.\n\n01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:43.740\nWell, I believe we should spend 50 million dollars on missiles.\n\n01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:45.740\nI mean, that guy could have been loaded with ISIS people.\n\n01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:46.740\nWell, I disagree.\n\n01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:50.740\nI think only three ISIS people could be on that copter.\n\n01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.740\nSo I think we should be 100 million.\n\n01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.740\nWell, you've just witnessed the left and the right.\n\n01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:56.740\nThose are your margins.\n\n01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.740\nGet back to work, cocksuckers.\n\n01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.740\nSorry if you're a cocksucker.\n\n01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.740\nThis segment brought to you by Honda Motors.\n\n01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:09.740\nHow about the idea that this old fucking hippie civil servant\n\n01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.740\nwho delivers mail to people,\n\n01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:15.740\nwhich is a government agency which has never taken any of your taxes,\n\n01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.740\nthat runs on its own money,\n\n01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:18.740\nwhich is why they sold stamps.\n\n01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.740\nThey figured out self-sufficiency in an age when the FCC\n\n01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.740\ncouldn't give up their fucking power enough to go away\n\n01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740\nwhen grace would have demanded it.\n\n01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.740\nLike, this guy is legacy.\n\n01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.740\nHe should be a national hero.\n\n01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.740\nIn Europe, they celebrate the lives of people who tried to blow up the government.\n\n01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.740\nThey're cool that way.\n\n01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.740\nThey have maturity on their side.\n\n01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:39.740\nThey can handle it.\n\n01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.740\nWe can't even fucking, like, we fire Bill Marver,\n\n01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.740\ncalling the terrorists not cowards,\n\n01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.740\nand then we yell at him for being an Islamophobe 10 years later.\n\n01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.740\nLike, we don't know what we're doing except that we're scared.\n\n01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.740\nWe're scared to talk wrong or we're scared to be wrong.\n\n01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.740\nThis fucking guy is 70 years old\n\n01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.740\nand said in his manifesto video,\n\n01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:58.740\nwhen he was absolutely established that he was perfectly sane.\n\n01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740\nHe's fucking Joan of Arc saying, like,\n\n01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:05.740\nI just don't want to have spent my life in this great country\n\n01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740\nwatching it fall apart.\n\n01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:10.740\nI just want to do something as I enter the twilight of my life\n\n01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.740\nthat I think might make a difference.\n\n01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:15.740\nSo I am a mailman, so I'm making this mail vehicle,\n\n01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.740\nand I am writing a letter to each senator.\n\n01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.740\nWe should listen to anybody that, in their spare time,\n\n01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.740\nmakes a goddamn helicopter plane thing.\n\n01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.740\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.740\nAnd we can't handle the fact\n\n01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.740\nthat we should have been better able to shoot him down.\n\n01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.740\nFirst of all, who gives a fuck\n\n01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.740\nif their goddamn House of Congress is defended?\n\n01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:32.740\nFuck you.\n\n01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.740\nIt's not an important building.\n\n01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.740\nIt's a bunch of fucking idiots.\n\n01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740\nThey don't fucking care.\n\n01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.740\nDefend the fucking coastline.\n\n01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.740\nDefend the fucking, like, people.\n\n01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.740\nIf you want to kill senators, they're never there.\n\n01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.740\nThat's the worst place to bomb.\n\n01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.740\nYeah, fucking blow up a bathhouse down the street.\n\n01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.740\nLike, fuck, what the fuck are these people?\n\n01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.740\nBlow up a TGI Friday.\n\n01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.740\nThrow up trees.\n\n01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.740\nThey're people that want to be powerful\n\n01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.740\nand work for no money.\n\n01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.740\nOh, where will we find another one of those?\n\n01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.740\nThe government's not going to fucking fail\n\n01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740\nif you blow up that.\n\n01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:02.740\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.740\nYou're dead.\n\n01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:04.740\nAll right.\n\n01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.740\nSorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.740\nOkay.\n\n01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.740\nEdit that.\n\n01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.740\nLet's play it.\n\n01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.740\nWhy don't we harness our blowing up things\n\n01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:13.740\ninto some shadow run?\n\n01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:15.740\nScooter, will you play with us?\n\n01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:16.740\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:22.740\nScooter, is he going to be mercy or the doctor?\n\n01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.740\nWhat would you like to be?\n\n01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740\nOh, yeah, your choice, Scooter.\n\n01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:29.740\nThe doctor is spelled with a K.\n\n01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.740\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:32.740\nGood.\n\n01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.740\nYeah, I'll do the doctor.\n\n01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.740\nI was trying to just run through what they'd done in the past.\n\n01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.740\nI'll do the doctor.\n\n01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.740\nAll right, so do we be cis-normative\n\n01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:39.740\nand bring up a girl to play mercy,\n\n01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:42.740\nor do we, we haven't had any women up here.\n\n01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:45.740\nAdam, Adam, no, you had your moment, Adam.\n\n01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.740\nIt's fucking Dave Kline up here to fucking do this.\n\n01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740\nWait, really?\n\n01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.740\nNo.\n\n01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740\nNo, no, Dave Kline had his spotlight.\n\n01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.740\nI saw a timid hand here.\n\n01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.740\nOh, you're Jen, you're up before.\n\n01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.740\nWell, okay,

Alisa.\n\n01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740\nAlisa?\n\n01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.740\nLike the name would, that's the audition.\n\n01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.740\nDo you want to come up?\n\n01:29:10.740

name,\n\n01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.740\nit would be like, ah, oh, Hitler.\n\n01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.740\nAll right, Dan, do you want to pass down the character sheets, please?\n\n01:29:26.740 -->

01:29:37.740\nIt's a pile of folders.\n\n01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.740\nUnfortunately, my background isn't as cool as everyone else's,\n\n01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:41.740\nyou know, but,\n\n01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.740\nWhose background tonight has been cool?\n\n01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:50.060\ncool. Dave fucking crying. Yeah, Dave, I can't even compare to that. I was born and raised\n\n01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:56.020\nin the valley, so. Well, okay. So, are you a regular here? Is this your first show? Oh\n\n01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:01.180\nno, I've been here a couple times actually. You know, I sit in the corner. Do you listen\n\n01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:07.980\nall the time? Uh, me mean online? Because I'm kind of cheap. I don't. You from the valley?\n\n01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:12.540\nWhat city? North Hills. Yeah, what high school did you go to? James Monroe High School. James\n\n01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:19.100\nMonroe? Monroe. Monroe. Yeah. Yeah. Was it was it was it was a skiddy? Yeah. Pretty nasty. You\n\n01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:24.740\nknow, Monroe hit women. Was that LA Unified? Or is that a different thing as Valley? Yeah,\n\n01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:30.340\nyeah. See anybody from the LA area knows about LA USD. It's kind of like, uh, I don't know.\n\n01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.780\nI don't know anything about that. Kids come up, they talk about their school. They go like,\n\n01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:39.140\nI'm from what a, what a, what a work up. And I go like, Oh, cool. Most people who have actually\n\n01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:42.220\nlived in the valley have never heard of Monroe. They know of the other schools\n\n01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:48.580\naround there, but never Monroe. It's a failure school. What are you, so you're a\n\n01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:53.820\ncollege student? What's your what's your ambition? What's your interest? Are you\n\n01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:59.620\nin high school? No. I dropped out of college twice. Wait, I got confused.\n\n01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:04.340\nOh, he asked you what school you went to. Yeah, that's a school, high school. What are you, what's\n\n01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:09.780\nyour do you have a do you have a like a light that you're headed towards? I hope\n\n01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:14.940\nnot. Is she dying? That would be terrible, I think. I'm kind of young. An ambition,\n\n01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:20.860\nyou know, a fantasy, good job. Well, I do have a job and working at a Universal\n\n01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:24.220\nStudios Hollywood for the past four years as a ride operator. Oh, yeah,\n\n01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:27.900\noperator. Which ride? I used to work there. What were you working? I used to work at\n\n01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:32.260\nJurassic Park River Adventure, Despicable Me, Minion, Mayhem, The Mummy Ride, and\n\n01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:36.300\nSuper Silly Funnet. I spent a summer dressed up as Harry from Harry and the\n\n01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:43.100\nHennison's in a Sasquatch suit. I want to ask you about the Jurassic Park ride,\n\n01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:47.380\nbut I think you'll get fired because it'll come back to you. It's the\n\n01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:51.220\nbest place to work. There's an urban myth about the ride about the t-rex\n\n01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:55.620\nmalfunctioning and spraying searing hot hydraulic fluid onto the people. That is\n\n01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.500\nactually true and it doesn't, they don't do that anymore. Now it's just\n\n01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.620\npressurized there. Oh, no, they just roar at you. Now they just roar at you. Okay, yeah, now it's just, now it's okay, now nothing\n\n01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:09.620\ngets sprayed at you. Chris Pratt came in and trained the t-rex. Stay. Like,\n\n01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:14.020\ntouched his nose and was just like, be still. When that doesn't really move. I was\n\n01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:17.940\nworking at Universal when that ride first opened, Jurassic Park ride. Well, just, I\n\n01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.580\nthink just after it opened and they wanted to put walk-around characters in\n\n01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.460\nthere and so they wanted, like, like for the back of the future they had like a\n\n01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:26.820\nDoc Brown and he would run around and stuff and I was part of the walk. He's actually still there.\n\n01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:32.100\nMight be the same guy. No, he's the actual original guy died like a\n\n01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:36.900\ncouple years ago. Yeah. I'm almost certain I shared a break room with him.\n\n01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:42.180\nHe was a sweetheart though. But there was, I went and auditioned. They thought\n\n01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:45.460\nabout having a, who's the doctor, the Attenborough from?\n\n01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:47.140\nDr. Hammond.\n\n01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.660\nDr. Hammond. Hammond?\n\n01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.180\nJohn Hammond. John Hammond.\n\n01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:56.020\nHim and a Malcolm, a Goldblum character and I went to the hand prop lot and I got\n\n01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:01.060\na leather jacket and I rehearsed and learned a Jeff Goldblum impression and\n\n01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:05.620\nwent to the hand prop lot, which is this enormous building down in the back lot.\n\n01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.820\nAnd I walked in and I said, do you have Jeff Goldblum's glasses from Jurassic\n\n01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:12.420\nPark? And they go, uh, yeah, we have the clear ones and the sunglasses. I go, okay,\n\n01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.860\nwhere are they? I was just, I just walked in, no one knew who I was.\n\n01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.420\nI think I, he goes, it's right here. He opened the case. He walked away. I just went,\n\n01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:26.420\ntook a, so on my, on my table, I still have the actual glasses that Goldblum wore.\n\n01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:34.020\nCause I'm a bad person.\n\n01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.780\nThat is the, you know, I, I talked about women's rights at one point and you guys\n\n01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:41.540\nwere pretty docile.\n\n01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.380\nBut stealing, no.\n\n01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:46.660\nYeah. I'm sorry. I keep them up on my desk. I look at them once around and go,\n\n01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:51.700\nthose are fucking Dr. Malcolm's glasses, man.\n\n01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:54.980\nYou guys, they had his prescriptions in there. So I had them popped out, took them\n\n01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:58.740\nto a lens place and had them put just regular sunglasses.\n\n01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:03.860\nUh, god damn it. I don't want to do rail. Okay. We should, we should start, but the\n\n01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:08.420\nfucking Jurassic world trailer came out and, uh, yeah, it was like, like, I, uh,\n\n01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.900\nlike, I don't know. It's like, like, I don't know. There's somebody,\n\n01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.620\nsort of like informed, like, uh, nerds kind of hating on it. Like, it's like, oh,\n\n01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:19.300\nit's going to be bad, but I don't really see any evidence. I mean, what the fuck\n\n01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:24.260\ndo you want from a, I wanted that world to have a history with the guy.\n\n01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:28.580\nWell, you know, the girl, she had a history with Chris Pratt that they revealed.\n\n01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.500\nThat's dumb. That's too dot connected to me.\n\n01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:37.460\nYeah. Well, I mean, that's on the trailer. What, what did she, it was on the thing I saw.\n\n01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:37.940\nI don't know.\n\n01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.900\nOh, was that not the trailer? That makes more sense. If it's not a trailer.\n\n01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:47.780\nWell, Sam Neill is a backstory with his like hatred of children. I mean, like, I don't know.\n\n01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.940\nLike Jurassic Park was a pretty satisfying popcorn movie. And, you know, like, like in the\n\n01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.500\nMichael Creighton tradition of theme parks that seem like great ideas that then go wrong. And\n\n01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.580\nwhat, what that brings out of people, like we've had a couple of Jurassic Park sequels that are\n\n01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:05.540\nkind of like off the mark, given that that that's what really hits the spot is like, hey, it's a\n\n01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:09.940\npark and then the dinosaurs and then it goes wrong. That's like the first movie is like the\n\n01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:14.980\npark's not open yet. How the fucking parks open seems like a good sequel. Like, I love the premise.\n\n01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:19.220\nI really do. But I don't, I don't, I don't like him like being a raptor whisperer. I think that's,\n\n01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:23.620\nI don't think you need that. I like the idea of like the park is open. There's, there's a couple\n\n01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.260\nthousand visitors and now disaster happen again. Yeah. It's kind of a nice parallel to the first\n\n01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.740\none and then bigger scale. Yeah. I mean, it's a disaster movie. Just make it. It's like Erwin\n\n01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:37.700\nAllen is blazing inferno. If they made a bigger, crazier sea world Jurassic Park, I'd be totally\n\n01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:42.020\nfine with that. It's a whole like those decades where it was like, we just like to go to movies\n\n01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:47.140\nand watch like, like, like man's ambition, just go to shit. You know, it's like, it's just fun.\n\n01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:50.980\nAnd there's a couple characters and they're the get out. You know, you introduce each character,\n\n01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:57.140\nlike, I'm the son of an opera singer and I, you get really specific. You find these characters\n\n01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:01.860\nand it's like, you kind of get to pick your own, you know, favorite. Like, I hope that that guy\n\n01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:07.300\ndies. Get picked off one by one and then one guy walks away from the whole fucking thing,\n\n01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:14.340\nfound a park and goes like, the park is closed. All right. I think that's the movie. Spencer,\n\n01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:18.900\ncatch us and scoot it up on the events of last, last time. I'm sorry. One more thing.\n\n01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:27.540\nFrank Sinatra. This is for Los Angeles people. If anyone that's been to universal city walk,\n\n01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:33.220\nlike, do you, do you get high off the shot of the pterodactyls plucking people off and like,\n\n01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:37.940\nso because it just looks like the city walk and it just like, I've been on that city walk\n\n01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:43.460\nand I just want like flying lizards to come and just grab random people. All right.\n\n01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:49.140\nSpencer, are you good to go? Yeah, I just want to say that when Dan was telling his story about\n\n01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:55.300\nthat male guy, I thought it was a metaphor for like two thirds of the story. No, it really happened.\n\n01:36:55.300 --> 01:37:04.100\nYeah. Like the president is like a mailman with a flying bicycle. And I want to know what's going\n\n01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:08.020\non with that guy. See, I would vote for that guy. Is that guy in Guantanamo now? Like, well,\n\n01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:12.100\nis it, I mean, is he going to die mysteriously when we're not paid attention? He's duct taped\n\n01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:17.300\nto a folding chair somewhere. We should have him on the show. Oh, yeah. And we should get him some\n\n01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:23.300\nD&D books if he's in prison. Don't let me forget about that. Spencer, do we have a guest\n\n01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:30.820\nuh, uh, encapsulator? Uh, yeah. His name was Steven Bassett. And also AIDS. AIDS also wrote\n\n01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:37.140\nthis intro. Steven Bassett, you said? I think, yeah. Any relation to Angela? I hope not. All right.\n\n01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:43.860\nHere we go. Damn it. That would be so good.\n\n01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:51.540\nGood. Oh, am I? You want to? I don't care.\n\n01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.900\nAnd I don't, I don't, I don't want to distract everybody, but Spencer told me this is the music\n\n01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:04.420\nhe fucks to. So don't, I mean, just try to listen to the recap, but then don't picture that.\n\n01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:10.420\nYeah.\n\n01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:20.500\nLast time on Heart. After a destroyed but surprisingly effective capture of crime syndicate\n\n01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:25.860\nmember Arturo Spaguli, our heroes took turns asking intimidating questions that left the\n\n01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:32.100\nman confused. Nightblade cut through the confusion and with wide eyes and a lacerated hand, Arturo\n\n01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:36.980\npointed them back to the burger tyrant. At the restaurant, Eve started things off using her\n\n01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:43.300\nstun gloves on the nearby guard, kicking him into cry cooks. Dr. Friend used a magical barrier to\n\n01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:49.940\ntrap the enemies while Nightblade found jelly dervish locked in a freezer. Uh, sorry, I'm\n\n01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:55.620\ntruncating this a little bit. It's long. Child in tow, the group quickly left the shot of burger\n\n01:38:55.620 --> 01:39:01.380\ntyrant with the Doritos eating horticard, driving them away to a distinct dark area somewhere in\n\n01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:08.020\nSeattle. But what will they do when they get there? Did Eve ruin the song butterfly kisses for\n\n01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:15.380\neveryone? Let's find out now. All right. Thank you now.\n\n01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:24.340\nSo the whole squad right now we're all in the van. We got jelly dervish who's a 10 year old kid,\n\n01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:30.180\nright? Uh, eight. Was he sure? I don't know. He's a youngster. Let's yeah. Um, and he's in the van\n\n01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:36.340\nwith us. And you also got our turtle Spagooly in the van and he's tied up. Right? Yep. And okay.\n\n01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:46.180\nSo are we at the dark area? You're in a dark area. What? Uh, we got jelly dervish. We got to bring\n\n01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:52.100\nhim back to our Johnson, right? Don't don't we have to bring him back to our Mr. Johnson? Yeah,\n\n01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:58.100\nwho was that by the way? That's our turtle talking. Cool Dave was retired for a while, right? Oh,\n\n01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:05.220\noh, what? Wait, who's asking? Who's Oh, just me. Oh, well, no, don't ask about our Johnson. Oh,\n\n01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:14.100\nrude. Just trying to make a special name of our Johnson. What was his name? Ryan dervish. Ryan\n\n01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:23.380\ndervish. Hey, uh, jelly jelly, we want to bring you back to your dad so we can get paid. You okay\n\n01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:30.900\nwith that? Oh, interesting. His dad, you say. Who's this talking? Arturo. Okay. All right,\n\n01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:36.020\nyou've got the floor. Oh, I'm just listening to your guys conversation. Those are mine. Seems\n\n01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:40.020\nlike you're doing more than that. Seems like a very assertive form of listening.\n\n01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:49.460\nListening usually takes the form of you don't get to be a mafia man by listening unassertively.\n\n01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:56.100\nOkay. So wait, you saying you didn't know that this kid was was Ryan dervish's son? No,\n\n01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:01.460\nI just didn't know he hired you guys to, you know, steal him from us. It's you sound so titillated\n\n01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:06.420\nby that you're talking like a guy that wants to get whacked. I'm talking about a guy who knows\n\n01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:13.860\nwho to whack next. Might I suppose that one of us stays with the Spiguli art also that the rest of\n\n01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:22.900\nus get out of the car and come to some sort of plane. Yeah, sounds good. So this is this is what\n\n01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:27.460\nhappens. We all get out of the band except for who's staying. Which one of you tied up. We can just\n\n01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:33.780\nleave him there. I'm good. I someone should stay with him. I'll stay with Arturo. This is this\n\n01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.660\nis good. I feel like you guys might be a little little one on one scene coming up with you and\n\n01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:48.900\nArturo Spiguli. This was the sort of horticards plan for entertainment purposes. On the com link,\n\n01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:53.460\nis it possible I might call this dervish and find out where he is? Yeah. This is what I do.\n\n01:41:54.180 --> 01:42:01.700\nAnd bleep, bleep, bleep. Hey, how's it going? Well, we have your, your, your, your target.\n\n01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:09.220\nThat's fantastic. Can you give us some sort of location or give me a fix on where you are? Why\n\n01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:16.740\ndon't you meet me at Hank's last stand where we first met? Will you tell those people there to\n\n01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:22.020\nstand the fuck down and leave me alone? Horticard. Are you in a different place? I'm on the\n\n01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:27.220\ncom link. Are you on the com with Ryan Dervish right now? This is exactly what I am. Yeah.\n\n01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:33.540\nYeah. I think we, do we want to let him know that we just told Spiguli that he hired, that he\n\n01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:39.060\nhired us? That that might be sensitive information. For the record, I have shot down my com link on\n\n01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:44.260\nmute for a brief moment. I feel, I feel like that might be something he wouldn't want us to have said.\n\n01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:49.380\nLike they're supposed to be more of a blackout. Yeah. I think we kind of took the shadow out of\n\n01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:55.460\nthe shadow run. I made it more of a great day marathon. More of a Honolulu marathon time,\n\n01:42:55.460 --> 01:43:00.260\njog. Maybe we could tell him it when we get to the place. Where'd you go? Like drop him off and\n\n01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:06.180\nthen just like book it. Probably after the payment. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Okay. He'll probably want\n\n01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:11.460\nto know that. Okay. Well, look, well, that's why I'll stay with Arturo. I mean, like, you know,\n\n01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:20.500\none good threat to repercuss deserves another. You can punch that up later when we go drop the\n\n01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:31.540\nkid off. Not a writer. I'm a bounty hunter. All right. So we we I call an Uber to get us and the\n\n01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:37.780\nkid to take it to take us to go drop off. I hate that the out survived lift. I know that they were\n\n01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:47.140\nbetter, right? Like do the robots also harass women? I'm a feminist. I have I have and I stole\n\n01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:55.940\nJeff Goldblum's glass. No, you didn't. You fucking liar. So for our use. All right. So I call up a\n\n01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:00.740\nnew bird. We're eight. You're already you have the Uber. Okay. So how far away is it is Ryan\n\n01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:09.940\nDervish from us? Oh, not far. With with Arturo Spagulli and toe, you arrive at Hank's last stand.\n\n01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:16.500\nYou're your home base sort of thing. It's the old rotten bar. You you you walk in and you see\n\n01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:21.540\nthere's a there's a guy here. It's normally pretty empty this place. But this guy, he's wearing he's\n\n01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:27.060\nwearing a fabulous blue and magenta suit with a face mask. And he's got a bow slung over his\n\n01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:33.780\nshoulder. He's just enjoying a glass of water. Can I use my sense of perception to see what sort\n\n01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:40.260\nof dangers might exist? He has the danger of potentially shooting you with one of his arrows\n\n01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:47.700\nin his bow. Other than that, you can't really perceive any any dangers. Now, Mercy, you're\n\n01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:54.260\nour face woman. You want to go up there and do the how do you do this? Yeah, I've got a was it\n\n01:44:54.260 --> 01:45:00.980\nplus two for impressions? Yes, I do. All right. So I want to walk over to this really bright dude.\n\n01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:13.860\nHi. What are you doing here? I'm just having a drink alone. I've never seen you around here before.\n\n01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:23.140\nThat's not surprising. What brings you around here in this necklace? It's kind of dark and\n\n01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:32.100\nskewy around here. And you seem like a bright color fellow. Just to meet a friend. I look around\n\n01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:37.220\nto see if Ryan Dervish is in the room. Ryan Dervish is he's talking to Teddy over in the corner.\n\n01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:43.220\nOkay, let's I guess we should keep that here right? Yeah, we'll keep an eye on that guy. But\n\n01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:48.820\nlet's go over and drop off the football over to Ryan Dervish. I'll stay with the colorful fellow\n\n01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:56.180\njust in case. Okay, I take I take. Well, you're a negotiator. So maybe you should she should\n\n01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:01.060\ntake her over to the to Ryan Dervish, right? Or take jelly over whatever you guys want, man.\n\n01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:06.340\nIt'd be kind of weird if I walked away from this guy. I think it was kind of going weird.\n\n01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:15.780\nIt's weird if you stay there, I think. I'll just say I'll like I'll see him later and I walk away.\n\n01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.820\nOkay, so you have to take a shit. I have to go potty. I'll see you later.\n\n01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:28.420\nI haven't made contact with him yet. So I can stand casually by. Yeah, if I see him do anything\n\n01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:34.020\nfunny with the the bow, I can throw up a physical barrier. That's nice. Nice, doc. Nice, doc. So\n\n01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:40.660\ndoc and I will hang back and keep an eye on on fancy suit bow guy. While mercy goes over and\n\n01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:47.460\ndrops off Ryan and mercy don't forget to get that extra money. Alright, so we got the kid walk over\n\n01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:55.860\nto Teddy and the dude. Oh, you brought up my son and jelly. Thank you so much. I am overcome with\n\n01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:04.660\nemotion. I'm so glad to hear that. Where's our payment? Was there any? Was there any mishaps or\n\n01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:12.980\nmaybe speed bumps along the way? I will have to say not so good. We are we did everything the way\n\n01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:18.820\nyou wanted it to be very low key. It sounds like it. I like that. Here is yours monies.\n\n01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:26.740\nYou know, just just, you know, it was it was kind of a long journey and we had, you know,\n\n01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:33.380\nwe had our expenses food and water and all that. You took a couple hours. I'm really impressed.\n\n01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:39.540\nYou spent that much on food and expenses. We had to buy a lot. We've got a lot of hamburgers.\n\n01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:44.740\nYou know, it takes a lot to keep up these appearances. We gotta look like we're doing\n\n01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:50.980\nsomething not skeevy. Well, I gotta say when you first took this job, I told you I was very poor.\n\n01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:56.020\nI did not have a lot of money and we agreed upon a price based on that basis. You see,\n\n01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:01.220\nthat is very true. But we went through a lot just to get your precious, adoring son who was\n\n01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:07.540\nwonderful the entire way, by the way. And as we agreed, I will pay extra. He takes off his shoe\n\n01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:13.620\nand gives it to you. Oh, I gave us a shoe today. How much money did we get? 500 a piece, I think.\n\n01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:18.660\nAnd a shoe. All right. Two shoes now. Two shoes. Oh, we got both shoes. Oh, that's right. Yeah.\n\n01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:27.220\nWell, I'm still with Archero's. Yeah. Where am I? Well, I thought in the van, I think you were\n\n01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:33.300\nboth in you were all in the Uber and you're just in the Uber outside with him in the bar. Yeah.\n\n01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:39.940\nAnd I say, okay, so I go. So, you know, about that active listening thing you learned in the mafia.\n\n01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:48.900\nYeah. So I learned it too. So like, I couldn't help but hear that you think that you might\n\n01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:55.060\nwhack somebody based on something you heard. I might. Right. So puts you in a weird position now,\n\n01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:02.980\nright? I don't. What do you mean? Well, like, I know that you're going to make me look like a bad\n\n01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:11.300\nemployee if I don't kill you. Hmm. So like, conflict, me in a world where life means nothing.\n\n01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.940\nWhat is it worth it to you? You already got paid, right? Well, what is a bullet cost?\n\n01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:30.820\nWow. Jesus Christ. Unlike you, my job is based on a reputation. Being a classy guy,\n\n01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.660\nyou know, people need to be able to trust me. Apparently, you just leave a trail of slime\n\n01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:41.060\nwherever you go. You know, you'll fuck over anybody. Hodergaard has a simultaneously on\n\n01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:50.420\ncomlink called up another Uber, and then also lifted his rifle just in case. Another Rupert?\n\n01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:56.660\nRifle. Uber, Uber. Okay, sorry. Why don't we just boil it down to this? I mean, I feel like in a\n\n01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:01.620\nworld of muck where my job is to rake through shit and make money doing it, I had this one job\n\n01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:06.660\nwhere I rescue a kid and bring him back to his dad, and you're attempting to make that job dirty.\n\n01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:11.940\nAnd all I got to do to clean it up is shoot one piece of shit. And, you know, destroy a lot of\n\n01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:19.940\nsecurity footage. Sorry, what? I'm just saying. Face is all over the place in that burger tyrant.\n\n01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.500\nSo you're saying you're not the only link between, you know, this rescue mission and\n\n01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:32.500\nJelly's father? No, no, I'm not. There's all sorts of technology that protects, you know, us.\n\n01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.380\nSo in other words, if I were to take an active interest in the long, happy life of Jelly and his\n\n01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:45.060\nfather, I would have to be very vigilant. Yeah, I'd say that. So I would do that either by having\n\n01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:51.220\nsecurity cameras of my own, constantly spending a lot of money on that, or as one man who is able\n\n01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:57.780\nto get you in the back of a car, I could just say to you, say to your friends, if anything ever happens,\n\n01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:02.660\nit would be bad for everybody all the time. They would never know when. They'd be taking a bath.\n\n01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:12.660\nI'd be the rubber ducky. They would be eating burgers in a restaurant. I'd be the mayonnaise.\n\n01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:20.660\nMy name is Jim Nightblade. Do one more scenario. Or maybe, like, do X3 or four more of those.\n\n01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:29.140\nThey'd be at the movies, and a guy'd be going, yup. And they'd go, who's that? And it'd be me,\n\n01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:36.660\nand my popcorn would be a gun. I'm just saying, like, I keep a backlog. Like, I'm not like you.\n\n01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:42.260\nI don't spin a web and, like, draw the joy from other people. I'm on the run, and I go from job\n\n01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:48.100\nto job. And when I do a job for somebody, and the job is to keep their son alive, I check back.\n\n01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:54.740\nIf I check back, I hold you accountable. You're like my employee now, and my payment is your life.\n\n01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:02.420\nYou deal with the security cameras. You deal with all that. Because if anything ever happens,\n\n01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:08.660\nlike, it's you that gets fired first, air quotes, and around fired. Fired from God's universe.\n\n01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:18.420\nWith difficult arbitration, it won't be like you're walking down the sidewalk, and you have a\n\n01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:25.460\nphenomenon stroke. It'll just be like, I'll take you into a warehouse, and I'll take shit out on you.\n\n01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.340\nI'll use you as an excuse to vent things that all men have inside them.\n\n01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:40.100\nYou know what they do in prison, right? They look at child rapists, and they go like,\n\n01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:47.780\noh, finally a reason to be who we are. This world's a prison. You're a pedophile.\n\n01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:50.340\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:59.220\nThat's not a cliffhanger. I mean, it's a cliffhanger.\n\n01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.180\nAll right, well, it's a it's a reason to tune in next week. Thanks, Scoota.\n\n01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:09.060\nScoota, everybody, please. The man of the hour, Scoota.\n\n01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:15.940\nAlyssa. S-C-U-T-A. S-K-U. S-K-U-T-A.\n\n01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:19.460\nDeMorge Brown, Alyssa.\n\n01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:29.220\nAlyssa, goodbye. Chris and Justin and, uh, let's thank Dave, a motherfucking client for coming up,\n\n01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:29.780\nshall we?\n\n01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.180\nYeah, Dave, fine. Thank you, Alyssa.\n\n01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:34.500\nAdam Goldberg, Superman, Eric. Thank you.\n\n01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:39.140\nSpencer Crittenden, and I'm Jeff Davis, and your mayor one more time is Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:43.780\nThank you so much for coming. We worship and adore you.\n\n01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:52.100\nDid you get any of that? It's a Scoota show!\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[174667]}
