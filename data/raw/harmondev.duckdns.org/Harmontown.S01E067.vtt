00:00.000 --> 00:12.200
For the back room of Meltdown Comics and the NerdMelt Theater, I'm proud to say that Harmon

00:12.200 --> 00:16.440
Town is once again in session.

00:16.440 --> 00:23.480
Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:23.480 --> 00:38.840
Ray! Thank you. Mr. Jeff Davis, your comptroller.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.840
Thank you for waiting. We usually do get it started a little bit after 8, but we had some

00:42.840 --> 00:49.480
speaker wiring issues or something. The holodeck had to be rejiggered and thank you for your

00:49.480 --> 00:55.120
patience. I hope it didn't affect the energy with which you were going to go home and watch

00:55.120 --> 01:03.400
Breaking Bad on your DVRs. And also thank you for DVRing it and coming here. Erin did

01:03.400 --> 01:08.840
not choose Breaking Bad over the show, but she is not here because she long ago committed

01:08.840 --> 01:18.880
to hosting a Breaking Bad party at my house. It seems like she just stayed home to watch

01:18.880 --> 01:24.400
Breaking Bad, but it's more important than that. There are guests and stuff. They're wearing

01:24.400 --> 01:33.640
costumes and having a lot of fun and we're here. Chakes shaped like hats and, you know,

01:33.640 --> 01:44.240
Erin Paul themed snacks. Anyways, I was just saying backstage, I've never seen a single

01:44.240 --> 01:51.000
minute of that show. I look forward to maybe watching it all like one month on DVD or something.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.720
You've got to be the last guy. I can't even think of... We should find a woman that also

01:55.720 --> 02:02.880
hasn't seen it and meet you two and create some kind of... Interesting couple? Specialized

02:02.880 --> 02:10.240
working breed of a person. Alright, so one thing on my mind and that's all I can think

02:10.240 --> 02:16.760
about and then let's bring our friends up to make up for last time, but I'm a dog owner

02:16.760 --> 02:22.880
and a cat owner. A lot of people my age have children. A lot of people my age have children

02:22.880 --> 02:33.840
that are half my age. I have a dog and a cat and they're not getting along... Well, I mean

02:33.840 --> 02:40.480
they're getting along okay. The cat doesn't let the dog more than a foot... There's a

02:40.480 --> 02:48.200
cat bubble. If the dog gets too close, then the cat hisses and maybe swipes, but they've

02:48.200 --> 02:54.220
never touched each other ever. They came very close to accidentally... Erin puts little

02:54.220 --> 02:58.600
summit snacks in between the two of them. There's these snacks that both dogs and cats

02:58.600 --> 03:04.840
like, so this kind of cruel fashion... Summit snacks? Well, I'm saying, she has a summit

03:04.840 --> 03:09.600
and puts a little snack on the bed and the cat and the dog both like the snacks. There's

03:09.600 --> 03:15.320
some for the cat, some for the dog, put them a little closer like Reese's Pieces. A summit

03:15.320 --> 03:22.680
like Stalin and Roosevelt? Yeah. So they've never touched each other. The ultimate dream

03:22.680 --> 03:27.280
is to have them snuggled up to each other, like a little dog-cat couple. Do you think

03:27.280 --> 03:33.640
that dream is fast escaping? It's not going to ever... Well, here's the plot twist. We're

03:33.640 --> 03:39.040
primates. We don't understand how these creatures really think at the end of the day. They exhibit

03:39.040 --> 03:44.200
characteristics that make us think, well, okay, that cat's mad. I get mad. It doesn't

03:44.200 --> 03:51.520
want something, so it's lashing out. Okay, I understand that. And so we then think that

03:51.520 --> 03:56.360
these things have the same brains and emotions that we have and we're just wrong and I will

03:56.360 --> 04:03.520
tell you why I found that out today. I was at work and Aaron texted me. Most of my colleagues

04:03.520 --> 04:10.560
get texts from their significant others telling them, oh, little Jude took his first steps

04:10.560 --> 04:17.120
or while you're working on community or Franklin ate a booger or they have kids is what I'm

04:17.120 --> 04:28.480
saying. But I get this text to Aaron said, like... I mean, I guess I should use her...

04:28.480 --> 04:35.320
I want you to feel my confusion and... Let's see. For those listening, Dan has produced

04:35.320 --> 04:42.120
his enormous phone. Okay. So I just get a text from Aaron that says, Harvey licked

04:42.120 --> 04:54.920
Fiv's butt. A frowny emoticon. Well, it sounds like that was the goal, wasn't it? Oh, so

04:54.920 --> 05:01.720
your dog touched the cat wrong. Then she followed it up with dot, dot, dot, like there was candy

05:01.720 --> 05:11.120
inside her butt hole. And I was very confused. I said, by the way, Fiv is the name of the

05:11.120 --> 05:17.120
cat and Harvey's the dog. I said, what did Fiv do? Question mark exclamation point. What

05:17.120 --> 05:22.920
do we call... What did we learn? Do we call those? I forget. Question mark. Terabang.

05:22.920 --> 05:33.960
In terabang. Teragon. What did Fiv do in terabang? Aaron, she let him. Well, of course she let

05:33.960 --> 05:45.000
him. Who doesn't want their asshole gently licked? Then another... Well... I was speaking

05:45.000 --> 05:49.800
as a primate, I'm sorry. Exactly. Like, you wouldn't want your asshole gently licked by

05:49.800 --> 06:01.680
another primate that you hated. Well... Don't put words in my mouth. And if you did after

06:01.680 --> 06:08.920
that primate licked your ass, you would find it hard to pretend you still hated it. If

06:08.920 --> 06:13.080
another primate that I hated came up to me and started gently licking my ass, I would

06:13.080 --> 06:18.000
take that as an act of contrition. Exactly. It would be an event that would transform

06:18.000 --> 06:22.320
a thing. Certainly. That's why we're a storytelling species. I find ass licking always to be a

06:22.320 --> 06:28.200
transformative moment. All right. So, now back to this story. Okay. Now I'm listening.

06:28.200 --> 06:34.840
Yeah, exactly. So, she let him. And then followed it up with, she just stood there like he was

06:34.840 --> 06:44.800
paying dues. And I said, like, he was paying or she was paying? Are you saying she wanted

06:44.800 --> 06:55.000
it? Enjoyed it? And she said, he was paying. She wanted it. Then she sat down. He sat down

06:55.000 --> 07:02.360
next to her and she hissed at him. I said, I'm having trouble processing this. It's

07:02.360 --> 07:06.000
not what I expected would be their first physical contact. She said, believe me, I saw it and

07:06.000 --> 07:11.040
I can't process it. She offered him her butt. He sniffed it. He then licked her butthole

07:11.040 --> 07:16.760
for upwards of 30 seconds. And I clarified. And she was like, that's right. You missed

07:16.760 --> 07:21.760
a spot? Then laid down. He laid next to her and she was like, what are you crazy? Don't

07:21.760 --> 07:33.640
ever come near me? Yep, exactly. Wow. Baby steps, you know. But that's not, baby steps.

07:33.640 --> 07:37.880
That's how we think. You take steps and then you start to walk. You develop, you adapt,

07:37.880 --> 07:44.240
you change at these milestones. This cat let this dog lick its asshole. It's not afraid

07:44.240 --> 07:50.960
of it. That seems like, here's what I think. If I had to make a guess that Fiv being the

07:50.960 --> 07:55.640
elder, she's been there longer. She's quite old, right? How old is Fiv now? Do we know?

07:55.640 --> 08:01.160
She's got to be at least 13. She's an old, she's the grand dam of the estate. And here

08:01.160 --> 08:05.920
comes this young puppy who's been bumming her out and she's been hissing at and she's

08:05.920 --> 08:11.120
been quarantined into different parts of the home. And yeah, the least he can do is like

08:11.120 --> 08:14.720
a little asshole. But that doesn't make it cool. It's like, no, you get to lick my ass

08:14.720 --> 08:20.200
forever. I'm still not going to like you. That's an alpha, like saying like, yeah, you're

08:20.200 --> 08:25.120
the ass licker. I still hate your guts. Yeah, I guess. It's like the closest you can come

08:25.120 --> 08:29.240
to understanding is like prison, you know, like, like, like men make love to each other

08:29.240 --> 08:35.440
in prison, but they don't then high five. They stab each other. Thank you for letting

08:35.440 --> 08:39.320
me make love to you. That's, that's the least you can do for being in prison with me. Now

08:39.320 --> 08:46.840
stabby, stab, stab. I wonder what, what Harvey's instinct was. Does he, does he just like

08:46.840 --> 08:54.200
he's bummed out because Harvey, Harvey views, views all moving things as potential delay

08:54.200 --> 08:59.120
is apples. Like, you know, if he sees a squirrel, he sees a cat, he sees another dog, he sees

08:59.120 --> 09:03.920
a child, he sees a male man. He's, he has the same reaction to all of it. He just wants

09:03.920 --> 09:09.160
to interact and play. It's very, very, very, very jolly fella who has never really experienced

09:09.160 --> 09:15.840
any pain in his life. We're using this modern, you know, post Caesar Milan training technique.

09:15.840 --> 09:21.360
We've never, we have never negatively addressed him. We have never even implied to him that

09:21.360 --> 09:25.000
he's done anything wrong. And I'm proud to say it works. I'm relieved to say it works.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.820
Like I always thought that dogs inherently, you need to like, you need to be punitive

09:28.820 --> 09:29.820
at some point.

09:29.820 --> 09:30.820
No praise, no.

09:30.820 --> 09:35.280
No, no, no praise. Oh, always lots of praise for the things that you want them to do. But

09:35.280 --> 09:41.520
then no, but no, if they take a shit in the middle of the constitution, like, like, while

09:41.520 --> 09:46.920
you're signing it, you don't sign a constitution probably. But if they take a shit on your

09:46.920 --> 09:51.560
Persian rug, you don't, you know, the old school way is like, you come down, you see

09:51.560 --> 09:57.000
the shit. And at the very least, you go like, hey, bad, and hope that they pick up on it

09:57.000 --> 10:01.440
at the worst you rub the face and blah, blah, blah. It just doesn't, it doesn't work. It's

10:01.440 --> 10:05.520
a, it doesn't, the dog doesn't know, the dog doesn't, it doesn't, you can, you can make

10:05.520 --> 10:11.040
a dog negatively associate negative behaviors with negative consequences, but, but kind of,

10:11.040 --> 10:14.720
but overall what you're actually doing is making the dog associate you with negative

10:14.720 --> 10:15.720
consequences.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.960
Not, you're not, you're just making the dog nervous. You're, it's kind of like, the last

10:19.960 --> 10:24.760
time I did anything I wanted, I kind of, I got hit in the nose with a newspaper. I guess

10:24.760 --> 10:29.800
I'll kind of generally stick to what I know to be safe behaviors. So it's a, it's a kind

10:29.800 --> 10:31.600
of, it's rabbit hunting with an elephant.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.720
Well, so you've never told your dog, no. So your dog thinks everything is a possibility.

10:35.720 --> 10:40.600
So it starts looking a cat's asshole. And the cat says, no, after it, let's, let's it

10:40.600 --> 10:44.160
lick her butt and then hisses at it and he's getting negative.

10:44.160 --> 10:49.760
Yeah. Well, the cat isn't bound by our rules and just definitely using Caesar Milan techniques

10:49.760 --> 10:50.760
on the dog.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.360
So he's all fucked up now. He doesn't know what's going on.

10:52.360 --> 10:57.960
No, you see, he's just, the cat's got a, the dog better trained than us. I don't know what

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
you're trying to point out.

10:58.960 --> 11:02.440
I'm just trying to figure out, we were trying to like figure out Harvey's state of mind

11:02.440 --> 11:03.440
right now.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.720
It's a cat. I mean, if the dog went up to a door and the door closed on its face, it

11:06.720 --> 11:10.040
wouldn't, it's the, the door, the door, it's a cat.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.880
Do you think that Harvey will, Harvey has learned his lesson to not lick Fib's ass anymore?

11:13.880 --> 11:15.680
Or do you think he's going to go back to that well?

11:15.680 --> 11:19.560
That I don't know. I mean, she, she let him lick her ass.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.560
Right.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.560
For 30 seconds.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.560
30 seconds is a good long time.

11:23.560 --> 11:28.760
The new school of dog training suggests that over time he will become an ass-licking cat.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.640
That he will, he will only lick her ass.

11:31.640 --> 11:36.840
She may have nailed it. Like, like she, she, she, he won't go near her unless she offers

11:36.840 --> 11:41.560
her asshole and he'll just lick it and then he won't, but he won't ever do anything else

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
with her.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
I hope that's the case.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.720
It'll be interesting. All right. We've talked too long about this.

11:46.720 --> 11:47.720
Or not long enough.

11:47.720 --> 11:52.400
Let's, let's, let's, let's, I just want to bring up Kumail. He makes me comfortable.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.400
Let's bring up Kumail Nanjiani.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
He may be in the bathroom.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.400
He's right here.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
Hey, guys.

11:56.400 --> 12:09.280
That is one of the nicest intros I've ever gotten, sincerely.

12:09.280 --> 12:15.760
Yeah. I just, yeah. I just, you've become the edge of my pool. I just grab it instinctively

12:15.760 --> 12:17.840
when I'm either scared or lazy.

12:17.840 --> 12:23.720
We, so the cat and the dog didn't like each other in the beginning and now they're, they're

12:23.720 --> 12:24.720
better.

12:24.720 --> 12:31.600
I don't, I, I don't have an answer to that question. The dog licks the cat's asshole,

12:31.600 --> 12:33.320
but the cat still doesn't like the dog.

12:33.320 --> 12:39.560
The dog has always licked the cat. The dog expresses, the dog expresses all desire through

12:39.560 --> 12:45.880
barking. Like if you, when the cat, it follows the cat, the cat doesn't want to associate

12:45.880 --> 12:51.120
with the dog. We have a network of baby gates with the one slap taken out. So the cat has

12:51.120 --> 12:56.800
more wizard, wizardly access to the whole house. It's never more than five feet away

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
from safety.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.720
Whereas the dog has, it's like a ladybug, that video game from the 80s. Like there's

13:01.720 --> 13:03.720
just a lot of gates.

13:03.720 --> 13:08.280
Woo! I've never heard of this video game.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.400
Well, why don't you guys all marry life if you're so young?

13:11.400 --> 13:18.680
I think we do. We're marrying life, right, young people?

13:18.680 --> 13:23.240
I don't, I don't think it's an age thing. You could have referenced equally old video

13:23.240 --> 13:26.120
games, but maybe a little more popular one than ladybugs.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.960
But he's like ladybug. He like, it was a very limited movement.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.160
Oh, don't patronize me.

13:32.160 --> 13:38.280
So he's like this ladybug that you speak of.

13:38.280 --> 13:43.200
You know the character's name isn't ladybug. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's Barbara, Barbara,

13:43.200 --> 13:44.200
Barbara.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
We had, ah.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.000
I can't, I can't riff a name.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
You really can't.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
No.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Barbara.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Barbara. Okay.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.280
We have this cat and she's, ah, what happened was the people who lived in our house when

13:56.280 --> 13:59.840
we moved in, she had two cats and when she moved, she just left the cats outside and

13:59.840 --> 14:01.480
just moved away.

14:01.480 --> 14:06.680
So which is, yeah, horrifying. So these two, one of the cats went feral like immediately.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.840
The other cat was just hanging out like really sweet, like always like looking at us like,

14:10.840 --> 14:16.320
hey guys, how's it going? We were feeding it, but our neighborhood has coyotes. So every

14:16.320 --> 14:20.640
night it had to like battle giant werewolves basically.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.160
And every morning it would be like, good food. Do you have any guns or anything?

14:24.160 --> 14:29.280
But you could see it getting more desperate. So we took it to the vet, got it all checked

14:29.280 --> 14:34.520
out. The sweetest cat we named him Wallace and we, and we, our own existing cat is bagel,

14:34.520 --> 14:36.920
like really sweet, unaggressive bagel, right?

14:36.920 --> 14:37.920
Oh adorable.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.800
And we brought him home. Is it because when he sleeps, he looks like a little bagel?

14:41.800 --> 14:46.880
No, I just always wanted a cat named bagel and I was like, it's not even the right color

14:46.880 --> 14:55.120
or anything. It's not Jewish or anything. It is from Brooklyn though. So not Williamsburg.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.120
Anyways.

14:56.120 --> 15:01.440
So, but bagels like totally switched. Like she turned into a different, it was weird.

15:01.440 --> 15:06.280
Like part of her like saber tooth brain, like evolution. It's like something changed and

15:06.280 --> 15:10.880
she like totally turned into a different, like she would walk different, super mean

15:10.880 --> 15:17.720
to this cat. We would see like the bagel would just stare down Wallace so, so long that bagel

15:17.720 --> 15:21.440
would start falling asleep and then like wake up and be like, what am I doing? Oh right,

15:21.440 --> 15:24.440
fuck this guy.

15:24.440 --> 15:28.720
For like a week, just like staring at him and Wallace would just sort of annoyed because

15:28.720 --> 15:30.920
he's been battling werewolves, you know,

15:30.920 --> 15:37.920
He's from the streets. Yeah, he's from the streets. He's here that Eugene Levy of Cats is saying get away, brother.

15:37.920 --> 15:46.720
Exactly. That's exactly right. This, is this better? Okay, that one felt weird. But Wallace

15:46.720 --> 15:48.120
is just looking at us like.

15:48.120 --> 15:53.160
No, no. I had that one turned down because it seemed so loud. And then you picked up

15:53.160 --> 15:54.160
that one.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.160
Alright.

15:55.160 --> 16:00.360
Maybe, and then I just thought to myself, I think you have a more resonant voice than

16:00.360 --> 16:01.800
the rest of us. You have a very,

16:01.800 --> 16:03.800
I'm just loud, you're saying?

16:03.800 --> 16:08.120
No, you have a very professional Cedar voice. You project more.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.120
Okay.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.120
That's a really racist stereotype.

16:12.120 --> 16:18.120
Oh yeah? What do we usually scream, Jeff?

16:18.120 --> 16:21.120
Fuck.

16:21.120 --> 16:28.120
He eyes up, brothers, anybody? Now, nobody looks like they are on my side.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.120
You do?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
No, not at all.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
I look, but I'm not.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.120
He can pass. He can infiltrate.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.120
What nationality are you?

16:36.120 --> 16:39.120
I'm Mexican, but I still get checked at the airport.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.120
You're Mexican, but you still get checked at the airport?

16:41.120 --> 16:42.120
Yeah.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
That's a bummer.

16:43.120 --> 16:47.120
Wait, it's a bummer even if I get checked at the airport?

16:47.120 --> 16:58.120
No, but it's a bummer. I mean, if you, it's a, I think, look, is it?

16:58.120 --> 17:01.120
This is a double bummer because he gets checked at the border too.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.120
Hey man, bummers are bummers.

17:04.120 --> 17:08.120
Infinity times two is still infinity. It's still a bummer.

17:08.120 --> 17:12.120
Well, I guess that's sort of a crass way of putting it, but I wasn't thinking like,

17:12.120 --> 17:16.120
oh, he gets checked twice as much, but I was thinking as a white person, I was like,

17:16.120 --> 17:21.120
oh man, you get the harassment, which is kind of a, I think, I think, I think I fantasize

17:21.120 --> 17:27.120
about being, you know, because, you know, that's the one thing that white people don't get to have is...

17:27.120 --> 17:28.120
Racism?

17:28.120 --> 17:30.120
Racist it at?

17:30.120 --> 17:36.120
Is the fantasy of being locked out, of like waking up in the morning and being like,

17:36.120 --> 17:38.120
man, fucking, fuck this shit.

17:38.120 --> 17:42.120
So the one thing white people don't have is not having privilege?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.120
Exactly, yes.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.120
Yes.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.120
You know what? As far as sacrifices go...

17:49.120 --> 17:50.120
Camille, Camille.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.120
I'm aware that I'm being glib.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.120
I'm making the same joke. I'm just saying.

17:54.120 --> 17:59.120
I know I'm one with that. You have no idea how good you have it.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.120
Well, it's like that old joke, like there's like a camera.

18:02.120 --> 18:08.120
Oh, you beat me. You've taught me humility. Now I have everything.

18:08.120 --> 18:17.120
Like the idea of like getting to be like really hardcore Irish or really like hardcore anything.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.120
It's true.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.120
You would want that?

18:19.120 --> 18:27.120
That's what I'm saying is, if you get to be something, anything other than just this vanilla like meringue,

18:27.120 --> 18:33.120
if you get to be something, then there's the price, which is like harassment, prejudice and all this stuff.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.120
But at least you have, but then there's the upside, which is like identity.

18:37.120 --> 18:42.120
And this poor guy, they're stopping up at the airport and going, hey, over here, Punjab.

18:42.120 --> 18:51.120
And he's like, wait, I'm, I'm not Punjab. I'm not, I don't have a, I'm not, I'm not even allowed to be offended in a specific way.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.120
I'm just being inconvenienced.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.120
What is your name?

18:54.120 --> 18:55.120
Amadeez.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.120
It sounds weird.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.120
Amadeez?

18:57.120 --> 18:58.120
Close enough.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.120
Close enough.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.120
Might as well be Punjab.

19:01.120 --> 19:05.120
Amadeez is pretty racially nonspecific.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.120
It's ambiguous.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.120
Yeah.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.120
That could be anything.

19:08.120 --> 19:12.120
I, I get what you're saying, because sometimes if something shitty happens to me, I'm like, oh, this guy's racist.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.120
But to you, it's like, oh, he just hates you.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
You're just...

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
Dan, is that what I'm saying?

19:18.120 --> 19:19.120
I don't think...

19:19.120 --> 19:29.120
What I'm saying is that, is that when the downside is being on the barrel end of racism, the upside is being in an exclusive, exclusive club.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.120
You get to be like something.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.120
Yeah, I understand.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.120
That makes sense.

19:33.120 --> 19:37.120
And so it would be a bummer to be mistaken for something and it'd be like, whoa.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.120
But it sounds like it's more for you like a kind of a persecution complex.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.120
Like you're kind of Christ, you know.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.120
Yeah, I like that.

19:44.120 --> 19:49.120
Yeah, that's what appeals to me about racism is the idea of being a minority.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.120
That would be the thing that I would be into.

19:51.120 --> 19:56.120
I would be, if I was, if I was not white, you better believe I'd make a fucking meal out of it.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
Yeah.

19:57.120 --> 20:06.120
Because I, because I, look at me, I am a fat white rich guy and I'm constantly raving about how I'm unappreciated and I'm a genius and no one knows it and all this shit.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.120
Would you be a Black Panther or an activist?

20:08.120 --> 20:13.120
I imagine I would push whatever envelope you could while still being a coward.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.120
I don't think I'd do anything cool.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.120
I think I just bitch a lot.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.120
I'd probably have a really cloying blog.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.120
Today I was at the bank and they said, can I help you?

20:24.120 --> 20:27.120
What do you mean, can you help me?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.120
Like I need help?

20:29.120 --> 20:30.120
I don't know.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.120
They're right, definitely.

20:31.120 --> 20:34.120
It sounds like you'd be a terrorist.

20:34.120 --> 20:40.120
It sounds like you'd have a lot of problems with the man and you'd want to tear them down and make them feel kind of punished them.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.120
No, but he doesn't have, wouldn't have the courage to like actually be a terrorist.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.120
He just like sort of have their back, whatever that means.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.120
Some of you are trying to trick me into saying I'd be a terrorist.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.120
Others of you are saying it takes courage to be a terrorist.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.120
I'm stepping off of all of this.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.120
Hey man.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.120
I'm just saying you don't have to walk.

20:59.120 --> 21:03.120
You don't have to be non-white to be a terrorist.

21:03.120 --> 21:07.120
Well, let's talk about this. Let's plan this out.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.120
What would we do, Jeff?

21:11.120 --> 21:16.120
First I'd say let's hit pause on our podcast.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.120
Let's come up with a logo.

21:18.120 --> 21:24.120
And then I would lower the screen and I would show you a 15-minute slideshow about some ideas that I have.

21:24.120 --> 21:29.120
I'll say I'm special guest Aziz Ansari.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.120
We'll continue with the show.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.120
We do a slightly related segue.

21:33.120 --> 21:38.120
I have been thinking lately that it's time to get back to getting to the moon.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.120
I think we need to make that a new objective.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.120
You mean our quickly bailed on premise that we had three years ago?

21:43.120 --> 21:47.120
Yeah, but it was a passionate one. It was about alienation, like getting the fuck out of here.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.120
Just, I'm getting that feeling again.

21:49.120 --> 21:53.120
Let's get the fuck out of here, man. Everyone's dumb.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.120
Let's go.

21:55.120 --> 21:59.120
That's a great response. Everyone's dumb.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.120
He's got his SAT score on a headband.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.120
The smartest guy in the world.

22:05.120 --> 22:11.120
Man, I've been totally waiting for someone to say that, man.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.120
I expected a bigger response from this lot.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.120
I think most people are politely nodding.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.120
Yes, don't tell them, Mayor Harmon.

22:20.120 --> 22:26.120
Lots of monocles are falling out of people's eyes.

22:26.120 --> 22:32.120
But yeah, I want to get up there and pitch a geodesic dome with a cooler of beer and just be left alone.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.120
How many people were you initially talking about bringing up there?

22:35.120 --> 22:41.120
Well, it should be a mythical number, right? So either 12 or 666, I don't know.

22:41.120 --> 22:45.120
Is pitching a geodesic dome the moon version of pitching a tent?

22:45.120 --> 22:46.120
Yeah.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.120
But not getting a boner.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.120
Okay.

22:48.120 --> 22:53.120
Your bone won't be shaped like a crystal with multifaceted sides to it.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.120
Yeah, space boner.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.120
12 seems too small.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.120
I think 600 is a good number.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.120
I wonder what the ideal number would be.

23:02.120 --> 23:08.120
Well, the ideal number would be about 100 if the goal, excuse me for burping, was...

23:08.120 --> 23:13.120
I'm convinced that roughly 100 is sort of like...

23:13.120 --> 23:18.120
The average person can keep track of 100 people.

23:18.120 --> 23:22.120
It starts to get past 100 that things start to get statistical.

23:22.120 --> 23:25.120
Yeah, to me it would be hell, the idea that you could keep track of everybody.

23:25.120 --> 23:30.120
The idea that you knew everybody was like living in a small town that would make me feel incredibly...

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
Look at these people.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.120
There's about 100 of these people.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.120
I don't know these motherfuckers.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.120
Yeah, but exactly.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.120
What if this was what we thought?

23:36.120 --> 23:37.120
Yeah, but we don't live together.

23:37.120 --> 23:41.120
If we all lived on a colony on the moon, we would all know each other.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.120
Then it would take years, you would slowly get to know them.

23:45.120 --> 23:51.120
You would go through rotations and go like, hey, Ben, what are you doing for dinner tonight?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
I don't know, 100 people.

23:52.120 --> 23:57.120
No, you go to the moon and go, hey, there's a big party on Friday night and that would happen every Friday night.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.120
You'd meet everybody every week.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.120
100 people you'd get to know.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.120
But the parties would be, therefore, more meaningful.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.120
They wouldn't just default to this weird networking thing.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.120
But you're not going to like 100 people out of that 100.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
You're going to like four.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.120
Not 100.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.120
Yeah, at a time.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.120
And then you get sick of those four and you move over to four otherwise.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
But they're still going to be there.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.120
You're gradually going to get sick of everybody but four people.

24:17.120 --> 24:22.120
In 18 years, at which point, there's all these new people you made.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.120
But they're my kids.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
No, they're 18.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.120
There are other people's kids too.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.120
But they're the kids of the people I don't like.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.120
It's a new generation.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.120
They were bellicose.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.120
They're parents.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.120
They hate their parents.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.120
People I don't like.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.120
I don't like their kids either.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.120
No, come on.

24:36.120 --> 24:41.120
Look, some of their, you would, Jeff, stop it.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.120
We know what you're doing and we don't like it.

24:44.120 --> 24:47.120
I'm saying 100 people is not a lot of people.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.120
It's just not enough for you because you're a sponge.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.120
You would never get enough.

24:52.120 --> 24:56.120
100 people, you'd be like, so there's a cap on the amount of love I can get?

24:56.120 --> 24:59.120
You would be like, I'm dying in a coffin.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.120
I would be like, finally controlled.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.120
It's not about receiving love.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.120
It's about variety.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.120
I couldn't live in a very, very small town.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.120
Variety?

25:09.120 --> 25:11.120
You go to the same bar every day.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.120
I don't mean that in a bad way, but I mean like we have our parents.

25:14.120 --> 25:19.120
No, I don't go, but also, it's not the same people that go in every time.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.120
It's a new cast of characters that come and go.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.120
Is it?

25:22.120 --> 25:23.120
Yeah.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.120
Okay.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.120
Is it?

25:25.120 --> 25:26.120
Not really.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.120
I see the same fucking people.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.120
Every three days, some guy wonders through and goes, hey, what's with the suit?

25:32.120 --> 25:34.120
That wouldn't happen on the moon.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.120
That's what you're worried about.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.120
No, I would love, that would be good.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
I love the idea that people, because now people-

25:40.120 --> 25:42.120
People have now stopped asking me about the suit.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.120
Now if I show up not in a suit, people go, hey man, is everything good?

25:45.120 --> 25:46.120
That's true.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
Whenever you show up-

25:47.120 --> 25:48.120
Were you at a funeral?

25:48.120 --> 25:52.120
People are concerned like, hey man, do you get out of jail?

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
What's going on here?

25:53.120 --> 25:57.120
What do you say when people say what's with the suit?

25:57.120 --> 25:59.120
It depends on who says it.

25:59.120 --> 26:03.120
When I first started wearing suits a lot, you would get like-

26:03.120 --> 26:06.120
I feel like we've talked about this in the show before.

26:06.120 --> 26:10.120
If you have, then we don't have to talk about it.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.120
Generally it happens at a urinal, which I'm not a big fan of urinal chit chat.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.120
No, I'm not here to make friends.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.120
Yeah, exactly.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.120
There's not an-

26:15.120 --> 26:17.120
I don't want to make a connection here.

26:17.120 --> 26:22.120
Some guy is peeing next to you and goes, hey, suit guy!

26:22.120 --> 26:23.120
It's like that.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.120
Hey man!

26:24.120 --> 26:26.120
I told dad this one.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.120
That was a good one.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
Was it the Viper in the long time ago?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.120
Very long time ago.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.120
When I first- I had one suit.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.120
One $30 vintage suit that I wore to death.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.120
He was there with River Phoenix.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.120
That's how long ago it was.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.120
No, it was just around the same time.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.120
But I was in the bathroom and he goes, hey, suit guy!

26:41.120 --> 26:42.120
I was like, hey, how's it going?

26:42.120 --> 26:45.120
I said, do we- you know, our dicks are in hand.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.120
And I said, I'm sorry, do we know each other?

26:47.120 --> 26:49.120
He's like, no man, but you always wear a suit.

26:49.120 --> 26:53.120
You always wear the same outfit, but you get some mad puss.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.120
And I was like, I just kind of frowned.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.120
And he goes, hey man, I'm not trying to hate, I'm trying to celebrate.

26:59.120 --> 27:03.120
By the way, and I actually said, I went, pine cone.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.120
And he goes, what? I go, I don't know.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.120
I just thought if I'd say something, you'd rhyme it.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.120
But like, you get like- sometimes guys would go like,

27:11.120 --> 27:13.120
hey man, how come you always wear a suit?

27:13.120 --> 27:15.120
And I go, how come you never do?

27:15.120 --> 27:19.120
And they go, yeah.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.120
That's like that Donnie Darko line where they're like,

27:21.120 --> 27:23.120
why are you wearing a stupid rabbit suit?

27:23.120 --> 27:25.120
Why are you wearing that stupid human suit?

27:25.120 --> 27:26.120
That's sort of like that.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.120
Wow, Donnie Darko, what a movie.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.120
That movie fucking stinks.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.120
Stinks.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.120
Some people don't like it, right?

27:33.120 --> 27:34.120
Some people don't like it.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.120
But more people like it.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.120
I think people don't like it.

27:38.120 --> 27:42.120
Anatoly likes it.

27:42.120 --> 27:46.120
Anatoly has the luxury of having English as a second language though.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.120
That's like airbrushing everything.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.120
It's like putting pantyhose over a shitty movie.

27:51.120 --> 27:56.120
I'm sure like the subtleties of something's shittiness can like-

27:56.120 --> 27:58.120
Isn't that movie good? I don't know.

27:58.120 --> 28:01.120
I think it's like-

28:01.120 --> 28:03.120
It's a wonderful life, but backwards.

28:03.120 --> 28:06.120
It's a wonderful life, but backwards?

28:06.120 --> 28:09.120
Yeah, it's about how he shouldn't be alive.

28:09.120 --> 28:14.120
Well, but it's also backwards in the sense that it's a wonderful life is good.

28:14.120 --> 28:17.120
So they nailed it.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.120
They made a shitty version of a backwards premise.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.120
It's like there's these movies that came out that were huge

28:21.120 --> 28:25.120
and now everybody's decided like, we hate them like that in Garden State.

28:25.120 --> 28:29.120
Everyone liked it when it first came out and now everyone hates those movies.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.120
No, I hated it when it came out.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.120
This guy hated it.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.120
He hated it when it came out. Everyone says that.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.120
It's like in prison everyone says they're innocent.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
Yeah.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.120
I just think that you become a curmudgeon as you get older

28:44.120 --> 28:49.120
because you basically like you just don't bother to go through the phase.

28:49.120 --> 28:54.120
You know, but like the younger you are, let's face it.

28:54.120 --> 28:58.120
I like a lot of movies from when I was like 18 that are just like, they're not going to hold up.

28:58.120 --> 29:01.120
If I show people go like, no, this is the best movie.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.120
It's like, watch Midnight Run. It's the best.

29:03.120 --> 29:07.120
Like someone's going to have a right to go, Midnight Run is not that good.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.120
Stop jacking off on it.

29:09.120 --> 29:14.120
Like, no, but I still agree that Midnight Run is an amazing movie,

29:14.120 --> 29:19.120
but I still think it's equally true if somebody were to watch it and go like, this is a piece of shit.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.120
You were 18 when you saw this and it was meaningful to you

29:22.120 --> 29:25.120
and you can't escape those like neural pathways that you created when you saw it.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.120
We talked about this with Goonies.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.120
Labyrinth.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.120
Labyrinth and yeah, people came up.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.120
There was a girl that came up that felt that way about Space Jam

29:32.120 --> 29:33.120
and she's not a bad person.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.120
She's not a...

29:35.120 --> 29:37.120
But she made no case for it.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.120
Well, there's no case for it.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.120
That's the point.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.120
There is no way to prove that Space Jam's a good or bad movie.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.120
Well, yes there is.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.120
She made no case for not being a good bad person.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.120
Oh, okay.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.120
Is she here?

29:53.120 --> 29:55.120
She's a bad person.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.120
She's like Typhoid Mary.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.120
She just wanted to suggest Space Jam was good.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.120
She's out of the next city.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.120
She's in Idaho right now and an open mic.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.120
Space Jam, right guys?

30:08.120 --> 30:10.120
Give it another shot.

30:10.120 --> 30:14.120
I don't like Led Zeppelin, but I will defend Neil Diamond.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.120
That doesn't make me right.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.120
It makes me weird.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.120
It makes you you, huh?

30:20.120 --> 30:21.120
Yeah, it does.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.120
So, curmudgeonry, if that's a word,

30:23.120 --> 30:27.120
is the phenomenon of getting older and older and older

30:27.120 --> 30:33.120
and not even bothering with the period between

30:33.120 --> 30:37.120
seeing something and realizing that it's probably

30:37.120 --> 30:40.120
like good or not good or whatever.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.120
Like not going through the part where you're like,

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
whoa!

30:43.120 --> 30:46.120
You just go like, I'm not falling for that.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.120
You see a Spider-Man, Bill Burton.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.120
You're just like, that's dumb.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.120
I've seen eight Spider-Man movies.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.120
And then some 18-year-old guy is like, you know what?

30:54.120 --> 30:56.120
There's no drug like being 18.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.120
We can't remember what it's like.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.120
Your fucking brain is on fire.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.120
Your dick's like a blackened Decker.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.120
It's just like your blood is different.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.120
Your blood is literally different

31:06.120 --> 31:08.120
and every chemical in it is different.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.120
And we take substances to alter our state,

31:11.120 --> 31:14.120
but we've failed to recognize that when you're 18,

31:14.120 --> 31:16.120
you are a different species.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.120
And you see a Spider-Man, Bill Burton,

31:18.120 --> 31:21.120
and you combine that hormonal energy

31:21.120 --> 31:23.120
with the fact that you haven't been around long enough

31:23.120 --> 31:26.120
to not trust a movie.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.120
And you're just like, fucking Spider-Man 4 was awesome.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.120
And then some 40-year-old guy goes, you fucking dick,

31:32.120 --> 31:33.120
get out of here.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
Fuck you.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.120
You should kill yourself.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.120
You fucking piece of shit.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.120
Whoa, what's with the fossil?

31:38.120 --> 31:40.120
He's bummed out.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.120
It's like...

31:43.120 --> 31:45.120
Cremuginary is abused hope.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.120
It's disappointment.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.120
Yeah, you have a higher standard

31:48.120 --> 31:51.120
for the flavors you've tasted.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.120
You go like, what happened to...

31:53.120 --> 31:55.120
But we failed to recognize it.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.120
Some of the shit, we were like,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.120
oh, what happened to...

31:58.120 --> 32:01.120
Why doesn't everything taste as good as Star Wars?

32:01.120 --> 32:04.120
You were like 12 when you saw it.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.120
And also, there were no fucking...

32:08.120 --> 32:10.120
There wasn't festivals and conventions

32:10.120 --> 32:13.120
where the cast of Star Wars had to show up

32:13.120 --> 32:15.120
two years before the movie was finished

32:15.120 --> 32:17.120
and tell 6,000 people,

32:17.120 --> 32:19.120
Darth Vader's Luke's father,

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
who wants to hear it?

32:20.120 --> 32:21.120
Yay!

32:21.120 --> 32:23.120
Okay, we got a sneak preview for you.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.120
Here's some Ash Kins.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.120
We got some bottle openers.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.120
Good job, good job.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.120
Go to StarWars.com.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.120
You got your free preview.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.120
And all this week,

32:31.120 --> 32:33.120
we got Star Wars Ministers coming in.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.120
Everything's just kind of...

32:34.120 --> 32:35.120
It's not good or bad.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.120
Everything's just this big oatmeal and fucking...

32:37.120 --> 32:41.120
Like, we were 12 in a world that was like,

32:41.120 --> 32:45.120
holy shit, there's pictures moving on the screen.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.120
And there's no way to capture them,

32:47.120 --> 32:50.120
except with our hearts.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.120
I can't...

32:51.120 --> 32:53.120
They're gone.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.120
What did he say?

32:54.120 --> 32:56.120
He said he was his father?

32:56.120 --> 32:58.120
I mean, I just re-winded, I can't,

32:58.120 --> 32:59.120
and there's no word for rewinding.

32:59.120 --> 33:01.120
My favorite toy is when I was a kid,

33:01.120 --> 33:02.120
there was two things,

33:02.120 --> 33:04.120
Legos and Star Wars action figures.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.120
Legos were awesome,

33:05.120 --> 33:07.120
because, you know, they build stuff.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.120
But I remember being four-ish,

33:09.120 --> 33:10.120
four and a half,

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
going on five,

33:11.120 --> 33:13.120
standing in line at the Orange Cinerama Dome

33:13.120 --> 33:14.120
for Star Wars with my family.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.120
I remember it vividly,

33:15.120 --> 33:17.120
because there was a bunch of dudes

33:17.120 --> 33:18.120
in white bell bottoms,

33:18.120 --> 33:19.120
because it was 77,

33:19.120 --> 33:20.120
and they had long hair

33:20.120 --> 33:23.120
and kind of proto-mustaches,

33:23.120 --> 33:25.120
and everybody had pickup trucks and fans

33:25.120 --> 33:26.120
with airbrush shit on them,

33:26.120 --> 33:27.120
and there's weed everywhere.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.120
Like, you later on go,

33:29.120 --> 33:30.120
what's that smell?

33:30.120 --> 33:32.120
Oh, that's the Star Wars parking lot smell.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.120
It's a bunch of marijuana.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.120
Why were there so many worse skunks in the 70s?

33:36.120 --> 33:38.120
By the way, this sounds a lot like right now.

33:38.120 --> 33:41.120
My father had to take me out of the theater,

33:41.120 --> 33:44.120
out of the, embarrassingly, sadly,

33:44.120 --> 33:45.120
out of the emergency,

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
one of the exits,

33:46.120 --> 33:50.120
by the stage left, screen right door,

33:50.120 --> 33:51.120
in front of everybody,

33:51.120 --> 33:52.120
because I started crying

33:52.120 --> 33:53.120
when Darth Vader came out.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.120
That's why I love the action figures,

33:55.120 --> 33:57.120
because that was the most important moving in the world.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.120
There was a big scary bad guy.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
That was the greatest.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.120
So were you training yourself

34:01.120 --> 34:03.120
with the action figure to not be scared

34:03.120 --> 34:05.120
to go through and be able to sit through the movie again?

34:05.120 --> 34:07.120
I am bigger than you.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
You're like shaming it,

34:10.120 --> 34:11.120
leaving it in the bathroom.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.120
I never thought of it like that.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.120
I never thought of it like that,

34:13.120 --> 34:14.120
but that certainly has to be some of the fantasies

34:14.120 --> 34:16.120
that you are Zeus,

34:16.120 --> 34:17.120
you're controlling these things

34:17.120 --> 34:19.120
that had power over you mythologically.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.120
I was watching the original King Kong recently,

34:22.120 --> 34:24.120
and you think of like people,

34:24.120 --> 34:26.120
like when did that come out?

34:26.120 --> 34:27.120
I'm sure you know.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.120
33.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.120
People just going and seeing fucking King Kong,

34:31.120 --> 34:33.120
and it just like blowing their minds,

34:33.120 --> 34:34.120
and it sucks that we don't,

34:34.120 --> 34:35.120
like that first movie,

34:35.120 --> 34:37.120
what was that train going through the tunnel?

34:37.120 --> 34:38.120
I bet people watching were like,

34:38.120 --> 34:40.120
this will never be better than this.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.120
This is the best movie ever.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.120
My favorite movie was People Leaving Factory.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.120
That was good.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.120
The Lumiere Brothers.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.120
I mean yeah, back then they actually,

34:49.120 --> 34:52.120
like guys had to figure out,

34:52.120 --> 34:54.120
and girls I'm sure,

34:54.120 --> 34:57.120
that had to figure out like that concept

34:57.120 --> 35:00.120
of like cutting from one thing to another.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.120
Oh yeah, there was no language for it.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.120
The idea of like,

35:03.120 --> 35:05.120
there was a box that captured light,

35:05.120 --> 35:06.120
and there was like,

35:06.120 --> 35:08.120
oh those first movies were like,

35:08.120 --> 35:12.120
go get that guy that does that magic trick.

35:12.120 --> 35:15.120
Because they could only conceive

35:15.120 --> 35:18.120
of shooting something interesting

35:18.120 --> 35:20.120
that had its own interest.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.120
Like what should we preserve,

35:21.120 --> 35:23.120
and then someone had to figure out,

35:23.120 --> 35:25.120
wait, the camera,

35:25.120 --> 35:27.120
the audience's brain will tolerate

35:27.120 --> 35:31.120
using this device to whip around the cosmos

35:31.120 --> 35:33.120
to be up in this guy's grill,

35:33.120 --> 35:35.120
and then cut to what he's looking at,

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
and then cut back to him,

35:36.120 --> 35:37.120
and have him go,

35:37.120 --> 35:38.120
I want a sandwich.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.120
Amazing.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.120
And then when people would walk on the screen,

35:42.120 --> 35:44.120
like reportedly, supposedly,

35:44.120 --> 35:46.120
people would see this,

35:46.120 --> 35:48.120
and they couldn't help but like,

35:48.120 --> 35:50.120
they would train their necks.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.120
And when the train came at them,

35:51.120 --> 35:52.120
people ducked.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.120
Yeah, it makes sense,

35:53.120 --> 35:55.120
because we go to the, you know, Carnival Ride thing,

35:55.120 --> 35:57.120
the Simpsons, Transformers, whatever,

35:57.120 --> 35:59.120
they capital, I mean, we're still going to do it.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.120
Anyways, what are we talking about?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.120
I'm wasting this show.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.120
We should be talking about terrorism.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.120
Uh, let's get to the moon,

36:09.120 --> 36:10.120
where it's legal.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.120
Terrorism is legal?

36:11.120 --> 36:14.120
Yeah, there's no laws there yet.

36:14.120 --> 36:18.120
Nothing to blow up, but no consequences.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.120
But then you're going against the people

36:21.120 --> 36:22.120
who you went to the moon with,

36:22.120 --> 36:23.120
what are you rebelling against?

36:23.120 --> 36:24.120
Aren't you all sort of in agreement?

36:24.120 --> 36:27.120
Gotta bring a couple bad people up there with us.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.120
Just for terrorism?

36:29.120 --> 36:31.120
Yes.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.120
I feel like it's going to take

36:32.120 --> 36:34.120
what terrorist doing a great job

36:34.120 --> 36:36.120
for this whole thing to die.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.120
Now, Dan, you're saying,

36:39.120 --> 36:41.120
I don't like the idea of just 100 people.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.120
It seems too low.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.120
Oh, right.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
But let's say it's 100,

36:44.120 --> 36:45.120
because that's a good round number.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
What did you say?

36:46.120 --> 36:47.120
100.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.120
Let's just call it 100 right now.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.120
Well, okay.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.120
You want that guy to be like,

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
you want enough people

36:53.120 --> 36:55.120
so that you could run into someone at the urinal

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
who's like,

36:56.120 --> 36:58.120
you don't hate, participate.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.120
I don't know.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.120
I don't want that guy in the moon.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.120
There would be nobody allowed like that up there.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
It would all be Spencers.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.120
It would just be like 100 Spencers.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.120
But 100 Spencers,

37:06.120 --> 37:09.120
100 Spencers would devalue the Spencer currency.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.120
Well, I mean,

37:10.120 --> 37:11.120
I mean like Spencer,

37:11.120 --> 37:13.120
but I mean equally cool.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.120
But like everybody would be different.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.120
What have we found at Harmontown?

37:16.120 --> 37:17.120
There are 100 Spencers.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.120
My question was though,

37:19.120 --> 37:22.120
if you were up there with a bunch of really intelligent people,

37:22.120 --> 37:23.120
would you be happy?

37:23.120 --> 37:24.120
Because like,

37:24.120 --> 37:27.120
isn't part of your Christ complex persecution thing,

37:27.120 --> 37:28.120
your fantasy that,

37:28.120 --> 37:30.120
how much smarter you are than people

37:30.120 --> 37:31.120
and how much,

37:31.120 --> 37:32.120
you're always like,

37:32.120 --> 37:34.120
how much better you are than people.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.120
Wouldn't you kind of die on the vine

37:36.120 --> 37:37.120
if everybody was like.

37:37.120 --> 37:40.120
No, no, I don't think so.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.120
I don't want,

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
I mean,

37:43.120 --> 37:45.120
and I have discovered as of late,

37:45.120 --> 37:46.120
humble brag,

37:46.120 --> 37:49.120
that to a limited degree,

37:49.120 --> 37:51.120
as much as someone in my field

37:51.120 --> 37:53.120
is supposed to experience it,

37:53.120 --> 37:54.120
which should be never,

37:54.120 --> 37:55.120
but I have on accident,

37:55.120 --> 37:57.120
like this concept of fame,

37:57.120 --> 38:00.120
as opposed to respect.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.120
Like I want everyone to like me,

38:03.120 --> 38:04.120
or I started that way.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.120
I want everyone to like me.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.120
I want as many people to like me as possible.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.120
But there's other people who are like,

38:09.120 --> 38:11.120
I want everyone to know my name.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.120
I'm not one of those people.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.120
Do not like that.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.120
Because when everyone knows your name,

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
then it's just like random people

38:17.120 --> 38:18.120
are just going like,

38:18.120 --> 38:19.120
hey, fuck face,

38:19.120 --> 38:20.120
like get a job,

38:20.120 --> 38:21.120
fuck it, whatever.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.120
Like I've gone out with Jack Black

38:23.120 --> 38:24.120
to grocery stores,

38:24.120 --> 38:28.120
like he was just trying to buy a box of tricks

38:28.120 --> 38:31.120
and like people just like come up to him

38:31.120 --> 38:32.120
and point at his face,

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
like he's a bug,

38:33.120 --> 38:34.120
and go,

38:34.120 --> 38:36.120
you're famous, right?

38:36.120 --> 38:37.120
And he goes,

38:37.120 --> 38:38.120
no,

38:38.120 --> 38:39.120
because fuck you,

38:39.120 --> 38:40.120
if you don't even know.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.120
And they're like, yeah you are.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.120
Can I get a picture?

38:43.120 --> 38:46.120
Okay.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.120
And then like people are running back up to him

38:48.120 --> 38:49.120
and going,

38:49.120 --> 38:50.120
because they went and Googled him

38:50.120 --> 38:51.120
or something like that.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.120
And they go like,

38:52.120 --> 38:53.120
Jack Black,

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
Jack Black,

38:54.120 --> 38:56.120
King Kong wasn't that good though.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.120
Fuck that.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.120
That's fame.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.120
I don't want,

39:00.120 --> 39:01.120
that's no good.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120
Like,

39:02.120 --> 39:07.120
I want to be in a room

39:07.120 --> 39:11.120
where I don't have to worry about a single person

39:11.120 --> 39:12.120
thinking that there's anything wrong with me.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.120
Would you be comfortable in a room

39:14.120 --> 39:16.120
or in a colony full of people

39:16.120 --> 39:18.120
that were slightly smarter than you?

39:18.120 --> 39:19.120
Where you kind of felt like you just...

39:19.120 --> 39:20.120
As long as,

39:20.120 --> 39:21.120
as long as,

39:21.120 --> 39:22.120
I don't,

39:22.120 --> 39:23.120
first of all not possible,

39:23.120 --> 39:24.120
second of all,

39:24.120 --> 39:25.120
no,

39:25.120 --> 39:26.120
no,

39:26.120 --> 39:27.120
I'm kidding.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.120
No,

39:28.120 --> 39:29.120
I mean,

39:29.120 --> 39:30.120
I'm,

39:30.120 --> 39:32.120
it's not a politically incorrect usage of the word,

39:32.120 --> 39:34.120
like I'm borderline retarded

39:34.120 --> 39:35.120
in terms of math,

39:35.120 --> 39:36.120
in terms of all kinds of things.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.120
So,

39:37.120 --> 39:38.120
like there's a lot of people

39:38.120 --> 39:39.120
that are way smarter than me.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.120
Smart in other ways.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.120
Yeah.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.120
I,

39:42.120 --> 39:43.120
as long as,

39:43.120 --> 39:44.120
as long as I wasn't like a burden,

39:44.120 --> 39:45.120
that's the thing.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.120
That is fear of alienation.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.120
I don't want to be stuffed in a locker.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.120
I don't want to be,

39:48.120 --> 39:50.120
I don't want to ever have to be in a room

39:50.120 --> 39:52.120
where there's a single person that's like,

39:52.120 --> 39:53.120
God,

39:53.120 --> 39:54.120
it would be so much better

39:54.120 --> 39:55.120
if you just fucking die.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.120
Which is high school.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.120
It's just like,

39:57.120 --> 39:58.120
like,

39:58.120 --> 39:59.120
it's 90% of the people are just like,

39:59.120 --> 40:00.120
why don't you just fucking die?

40:00.120 --> 40:01.120
All right,

40:01.120 --> 40:02.120
then what about,

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
like,

40:03.120 --> 40:04.120
not to say that people that do,

40:04.120 --> 40:05.120
like,

40:05.120 --> 40:06.120
functionary jobs,

40:06.120 --> 40:07.120
like,

40:07.120 --> 40:08.120
let's say,

40:08.120 --> 40:09.120
like,

40:09.120 --> 40:10.120
you know,

40:10.120 --> 40:11.120
like,

40:11.120 --> 40:12.120
gain satisfaction or doing simple tasks,

40:12.120 --> 40:13.120
like that,

40:13.120 --> 40:14.120
like,

40:14.120 --> 40:15.120
they can't,

40:15.120 --> 40:16.120
we can't all be,

40:16.120 --> 40:17.120
or like,

40:17.120 --> 40:18.120
the colony could not just be a bunch of intellectuals,

40:18.120 --> 40:19.120
a bunch of artists.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.120
There'd have to be people that were satisfied

40:20.120 --> 40:21.120
doing menial tasks,

40:21.120 --> 40:22.120
like,

40:22.120 --> 40:23.120
like stuff like that.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.120
Well,

40:24.120 --> 40:25.120
I don't think,

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
I mean,

40:26.120 --> 40:27.120
we've,

40:27.120 --> 40:28.120
we've explored this at the 60s.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.120
Like there's,

40:29.120 --> 40:30.120
there's been,

40:30.120 --> 40:31.120
like colonies of hippies,

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
they're all plenty smart,

40:32.120 --> 40:33.120
and they,

40:33.120 --> 40:34.120
they grow their potatoes

40:34.120 --> 40:35.120
and they remove their garbage

40:35.120 --> 40:36.120
and they cut each other's hair

40:36.120 --> 40:37.120
and they deliver each other's babies

40:37.120 --> 40:38.120
and it's,

40:38.120 --> 40:39.120
it's worked.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.120
Like the fact that a hundred people's worth of poop

40:41.120 --> 40:42.120
had to be cleaned up.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.120
Like the Spanish Civil War,

40:43.120 --> 40:44.120
like,

40:44.120 --> 40:45.120
like the anarchist communes there

40:45.120 --> 40:46.120
and like the,

40:46.120 --> 40:47.120
the Paris Communists and like that,

40:47.120 --> 40:48.120
these,

40:48.120 --> 40:49.120
these are people that had planned secretly

40:49.120 --> 40:50.120
under fascist governments

40:50.120 --> 40:52.120
or monarchy governments to,

40:52.120 --> 40:53.120
they had,

40:53.120 --> 40:54.120
like,

40:54.120 --> 40:55.120
underground teaching each other

40:55.120 --> 40:56.120
how to run things,

40:56.120 --> 40:57.120
how to operate stuff,

40:57.120 --> 40:59.120
and it takes years and years and years

40:59.120 --> 41:00.120
and years of education,

41:00.120 --> 41:01.120
and,

41:01.120 --> 41:02.120
and under those situations,

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
like,

41:03.120 --> 41:04.120
completely illegally and underground

41:04.120 --> 41:05.120
to learn how,

41:05.120 --> 41:06.120
when the revolution happens,

41:06.120 --> 41:07.120
that we're ready to go,

41:07.120 --> 41:08.120
take out the trash.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.120
Okay, all right.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.120
You got this.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.120
You got this.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
That's awesome.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.120
So you'd have to be,

41:13.120 --> 41:14.120
like,

41:14.120 --> 41:15.120
you can't just take a ship up to the moon

41:15.120 --> 41:16.120
and say,

41:16.120 --> 41:17.120
all right, everybody,

41:17.120 --> 41:18.120
we're all

41:18.120 --> 41:19.120
anarcho-syndicalists.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.120
We're all,

41:20.120 --> 41:21.120
everyone's going to do their own thing.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.120
Like,

41:22.120 --> 41:23.120
like,

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
we're all going to take pride in our work.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
We're all going to do it.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.120
Yes.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.120
You can go,

41:27.120 --> 41:28.120
okay, everybody,

41:28.120 --> 41:29.120
because there's only a hundred of us.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.120
So,

41:30.120 --> 41:31.120
like,

41:31.120 --> 41:32.120
there's probably a hundred,

41:32.120 --> 41:33.120
fifty,

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
two hundred people in this room,

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
so we know that we could do this on the moon.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.120
So we go,

41:36.120 --> 41:37.120
okay, everybody,

41:37.120 --> 41:38.120
and none of us

41:38.120 --> 41:39.120
wants to clean up poop.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.120
And,

41:40.120 --> 41:41.120
I mean,

41:41.120 --> 41:42.120
maybe one guy would go,

41:42.120 --> 41:43.120
I love it.

41:43.120 --> 41:44.120
We made a mistake.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.120
What's your name?

41:45.120 --> 41:46.120
Toby?

41:46.120 --> 41:47.120
Okay,

41:47.120 --> 41:48.120
Toby, fine,

41:48.120 --> 41:49.120
fine,

41:49.120 --> 41:50.120
sorry for the meeting.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
Let's talk.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.120
But,

41:52.120 --> 41:53.120
assuming Toby doesn't exist,

41:53.120 --> 41:54.120
like,

41:54.120 --> 41:55.120
like,

41:55.120 --> 41:56.120
like,

41:56.120 --> 41:57.120
okay,

41:57.120 --> 41:58.120
no one wants to clean up poop,

41:58.120 --> 41:59.120
but there's a hundred of us,

41:59.120 --> 42:00.120
there's a hundred people's worth of poop.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.120
The good news is,

42:01.120 --> 42:02.120
if we all take turns,

42:02.120 --> 42:03.120
we only have to clean poop

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
one percent of our,

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
of our lives.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.120
That's a lot.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.120
Dude,

42:07.120 --> 42:08.120
you also, though,

42:08.120 --> 42:09.120
you get to do all the cool stuff,

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
like,

42:10.120 --> 42:11.120
one percent of the time,

42:11.120 --> 42:12.120
like,

42:12.120 --> 42:13.120
like,

42:13.120 --> 42:14.120
like,

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
cleaning the poop,

42:15.120 --> 42:16.120
if people poop,

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
let's say once or twice or three times a day,

42:17.120 --> 42:18.120
that's,

42:18.120 --> 42:19.120
you're doing it like a lot.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.120
But,

42:20.120 --> 42:21.120
this is a space colony,

42:21.120 --> 42:22.120
like,

42:22.120 --> 42:23.120
you're pooping into a toilet

42:23.120 --> 42:24.120
that is suctioning your poop into a...

42:24.120 --> 42:25.120
Oh,

42:25.120 --> 42:26.120
we just shoot it back to Earth.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.120
Yeah!

42:27.120 --> 42:28.120
No,

42:28.120 --> 42:29.120
because then Earth declares war on you.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.120
Man,

42:30.120 --> 42:31.120
if you guys just put like

42:31.120 --> 42:32.120
an NBC logo on it,

42:32.120 --> 42:33.120
and like,

42:33.120 --> 42:34.120
like,

42:34.120 --> 42:35.120
like,

42:35.120 --> 42:41.120
I was trying to think of a logo, like a corporate logo, and I blurted out the name of my employers.

42:41.120 --> 42:44.120
That's never happened before.

42:44.120 --> 42:50.120
In the podcast where we talked about terrorism being for brave people, and we would have said,

42:50.120 --> 42:57.120
the one thing tomorrow would be, Dan Harmon blasts the peacock with space poop,

42:57.120 --> 43:01.120
suggests that the mass opiate ain't having it.

43:01.120 --> 43:05.120
If you do hurl the colonies-

43:05.120 --> 43:09.120
The Charlie Sheen of writers blew up again last night.

43:09.120 --> 43:17.120
This time is Lava Mouth Flood about poop and NBC being the same.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.120
Click here for Bacardi!

43:24.120 --> 43:29.120
You could send the poop back though because it would just burn up an Earth's atmosphere kind of harmlessly, wouldn't it?

43:29.120 --> 43:33.120
All you have to do is make it a little slower, and it'll burn up.

43:33.120 --> 43:37.120
That's the great thing about the atmosphere. Automatic poop burner. Perfect.

43:37.120 --> 43:41.120
We're already nailing this. It'll be a symbolic thing.

43:41.120 --> 43:46.120
You'd have to get that just right because eventually you would create a pooposphere.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.120
A ring, a beautiful brown ring around it.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.120
It's like a Saturn's poop ring.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.120
From the moon?

43:52.120 --> 43:56.120
For Earth it would look like, shit, we're being satellite by shit.

43:56.120 --> 43:59.120
That's a symbol of our power.

43:59.120 --> 44:03.120
But then Earth attacks the moon because it's the poop wars and they come and get you.

44:03.120 --> 44:07.120
I dare them to attack. Do you know how hard it would be for them to attack the moon?

44:07.120 --> 44:11.120
We put some fuckers on there in 1969 with a digital watch.

44:11.120 --> 44:15.120
And we haven't been back there since because it's that expensive and we're that lazy.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.120
There's no real space program.

44:17.120 --> 44:24.120
If we figure out a way to get back to the moon with 100 people, all we have to do is destroy the Earth.

44:24.120 --> 44:27.120
We just go, hey, Earth, fuck you.

44:27.120 --> 44:35.120
And then move 20 yards so that by the time they figure out how to invade where that signal came from,

44:35.120 --> 44:39.120
there's nothing there but a thousand craters that were already there.

44:39.120 --> 44:42.120
The moon is like a mega-Afghanistan.

44:42.120 --> 44:45.120
You have moon?

44:45.120 --> 44:50.120
I had a question but let's talk about that a little bit.

44:50.120 --> 44:53.120
You have moon, moving technology?

44:53.120 --> 44:56.120
No, not moon. I'm not moving the moon.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.120
I'm saying a hundred of us.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.120
Just move over.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.120
But they could land a robot on the moon.

45:01.120 --> 45:03.120
I would like to see that.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.120
We've done it.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.120
We've done it because we're smart.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.120
People on the Earth will still be people on the Earth.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.120
Not smart people.

45:11.120 --> 45:13.120
There's more than 100 smart people on Earth.

45:13.120 --> 45:18.120
But there's sell-outs and that will compromise them.

45:18.120 --> 45:22.120
If I've learned one thing, if I take the 100 people I want,

45:22.120 --> 45:27.120
I will have already removed, just removing the 100 people that I want.

45:27.120 --> 45:33.120
Earth's passion will have been reduced by 90%.

45:33.120 --> 45:42.120
I want to say first of all, I would say that mega-Afghanistan is actually Pakistan.

45:42.120 --> 45:46.120
Stop quoting your bumper stickers.

45:46.120 --> 45:49.120
Guys, they're on sale over there.

45:49.120 --> 45:52.120
The sign as you drive into Pakistan.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.120
Welcome to Pakistan.

45:53.120 --> 45:55.120
Yeah, mega-Afghanistan.

45:55.120 --> 45:59.120
I don't know, maybe the tourism board needs a rewrite.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.120
The entire time, all I could see in my head was Adam Goldberg,

46:02.120 --> 46:07.120
wearing different disguises, trying to get on the rocket ship.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.120
I think I'd bring him.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.120
You would take Adam maybe, right?

46:11.120 --> 46:15.120
I've said I'd put a statue to Adam Goldberg up in the front.

46:15.120 --> 46:20.120
There's a lot of real estate, so having a statue wouldn't be that big a deal.

46:20.120 --> 46:25.120
Everybody's got a statue, so don't get too excited.

46:25.120 --> 46:28.120
Name to me some archetypes that you wouldn't want to bring along.

46:28.120 --> 46:30.120
Wouldn't want to bring along.

46:30.120 --> 46:33.120
That guy, the pea guy, the rhyming...

46:33.120 --> 46:35.120
Rhyming urinal talking guy is probably not coming.

46:35.120 --> 46:37.120
Rhyming frat guy is not coming.

46:37.120 --> 46:41.120
Anybody who's ever said in their entire life, ever,

46:41.120 --> 46:45.120
you'd have to somehow figure out a way to polygraphically prove this,

46:45.120 --> 46:48.120
because their instincts are going to be a lie when they find out what's at stake.

46:48.120 --> 46:53.120
Anyone who has ever in their entire life said too much information.

46:53.120 --> 46:56.120
Or first world problems.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.120
Or white people problems.

46:58.120 --> 47:01.120
Or dig a little deeper, or tell us how you really feel.

47:01.120 --> 47:04.120
Or didn't get the best of the first cut right there.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.120
Yeah.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.120
Are you not coming?

47:08.120 --> 47:11.120
There's one, I know people that use it all the time, I just wish everybody would stop saying,

47:11.120 --> 47:14.120
at the end of the day, I hate that it drives me fucking mad.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.120
I say it all the time.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.120
Everybody said, yeah.

47:18.120 --> 47:22.120
I think I probably would have to have my own moon moon.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.120
A moon of the moon?

47:24.120 --> 47:27.120
Yeah, it'd be like a little VIP moon.

47:27.120 --> 47:30.120
We're already creating Earth on moon.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.120
This is why we got away.

47:32.120 --> 47:35.120
Yeah, but Adam Goldberg's going to be there, and I'm going to have to get out of here.

47:35.120 --> 47:38.120
I kind of like that, though, that we incorporate into our culture.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.120
No offense, Adam, I love you.

47:40.120 --> 47:42.120
It's a hundred.

47:42.120 --> 47:45.120
The moon's not big enough for the two of us, man.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.120
I would let you come to VIP moon once in a while.

47:48.120 --> 47:51.120
We incorporate into our moon another moon.

47:51.120 --> 47:53.120
Once in a blue moon.

47:53.120 --> 47:57.120
Membership revoked.

47:57.120 --> 48:01.120
By the way, people at home don't know he stood up to say that.

48:01.120 --> 48:06.120
He either took a bow or his spinal problems are...

48:06.120 --> 48:08.120
He stood up and said, I'm sorry.

48:08.120 --> 48:10.120
Did that feel rude?

48:10.120 --> 48:12.120
No, it was funny.

48:12.120 --> 48:14.120
But it looked like he took a bow.

48:14.120 --> 48:17.120
He chipped an imaginary top hat when he did that.

48:17.120 --> 48:23.120
He had the expression on his face that he was expecting people to just carry him out on his shoulder.

48:23.120 --> 48:28.120
I'm saying just for me, the ability to be alone in a crowd is the greatest thing in the world.

48:28.120 --> 48:31.120
The ability to get away.

48:31.120 --> 48:33.120
I love everybody here that comes to these shows.

48:33.120 --> 48:36.120
I've never had a bad experience here doing Harmontown.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.120
I've never been bummed out by anyone that's ever come.

48:38.120 --> 48:40.120
But when the show's over, I just leave.

48:40.120 --> 48:43.120
I want to go and kind of get away.

48:43.120 --> 48:47.120
And that's just my own need to separate myself from crowds.

48:47.120 --> 48:49.120
But where do you go?

48:49.120 --> 48:51.120
You don't go to...

48:51.120 --> 48:53.120
I have to go to another place.

48:53.120 --> 48:56.120
There will be so many places for you to go on the moon.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.120
Where?

48:58.120 --> 49:00.120
A little cheeky bar called Jeff's Place.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.120
It's a hundred people.

49:02.120 --> 49:05.120
What if I wanted a hundred different restaurant options?

49:05.120 --> 49:08.120
There can't be just the can'ts. There will be three restaurants.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.120
No, there'll be more than three.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.120
Who's going to work there?

49:11.120 --> 49:12.120
The moon is huge.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.120
A hundred people are going to man how many restaurants?

49:14.120 --> 49:16.120
It's all automated, dude.

49:16.120 --> 49:20.120
Okay, if there's 99 restaurants and you all work in one, then that's fine with me.

49:20.120 --> 49:23.120
Okay, here's the thing. Jeff, there's not going to be any restaurants.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.120
What?

49:24.120 --> 49:26.120
There's not going to be any... Yeah, Jeff, no restaurants.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.120
Fuck you.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.120
There's not going to be capitalism, Joe.

49:30.120 --> 49:34.120
I'm not saying it's about fucking quid pro quo and reciprocity.

49:34.120 --> 49:36.120
I'm saying there has to be...

49:36.120 --> 49:39.120
VIP Moon's going to have some fucking swinging restaurants up there.

49:39.120 --> 49:41.120
If you guys want to go have a nice meal.

49:41.120 --> 49:45.120
Are you going to have that restaurant that you talked about called the Leftovers or whatever?

49:45.120 --> 49:48.120
Where it's like everything in the bike taken out of it?

49:48.120 --> 49:50.120
Real обnets idea?

49:50.120 --> 49:51.120
Yeah. Is that what that was?

49:51.120 --> 49:53.120
It's going to be called Space Bikes.

49:53.120 --> 49:56.120
But my Moon will actually rotate.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.120
It won't be orbit-locked like our Moon.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.120
Mine will actually be a revolving restaurant.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.120
You can actually have a revolving view of fake bullshit moon.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.120
Okay, where do we...

50:05.120 --> 50:07.120
Are you in real Moon?

50:07.120 --> 50:08.120
Yeah.

50:08.120 --> 50:10.120
We call it fake bullshit moon.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.120
It's called fake moon.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.120
Because it's...

50:12.120 --> 50:13.120
Yeah, we just call it Moon.

50:13.120 --> 50:15.120
On this fictional Moon that you created.

50:15.120 --> 50:19.120
Yeah, we're talking about shit that we can do.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.120
You're on a flight of fancy here.

50:21.120 --> 50:25.120
In my humanity, you're clinging to the very problems that made Earth uninhabitable.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.120
With your magical VIP...

50:27.120 --> 50:29.120
My Moon is going to be called Phoenixville.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.120
And we're going to look down on Moon Moon.

50:32.120 --> 50:33.120
And we're going to go like...

50:33.120 --> 50:34.120
Look, it's nice to live...

50:34.120 --> 50:35.120
It's just called Moon.

50:35.120 --> 50:36.120
Moon app.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.120
We have a lot of names for the Moon.

50:37.120 --> 50:39.120
The Moon.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.120
But a hundred fucking...

50:41.120 --> 50:43.120
You got to take a vacation and get off of the fucking Moon.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.120
It's so big.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.120
Yeah, but a hundred people...

50:46.120 --> 50:48.120
Going to the Moon is the vacation.

50:48.120 --> 50:52.120
All right, is the Moon totally filled?

50:52.120 --> 50:55.120
Oh yeah, we've teal whatever the entire thing.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.120
Yeah, it's all matter.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.120
What is it called?

50:57.120 --> 50:58.120
You've got a hundred people...

50:58.120 --> 50:59.120
Terraforming.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.120
We've terraformed the whole thing.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.120
You've terraformed...

51:01.120 --> 51:03.120
So it's not just a dusty wasteland.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.120
No, dude, it's great.

51:07.120 --> 51:09.120
Then where's the restaurants?

51:09.120 --> 51:10.120
Well, I don't know.

51:10.120 --> 51:11.120
First of all...

51:11.120 --> 51:12.120
Yeah, I'll let you take the restaurant.

51:12.120 --> 51:15.120
We can't say we terraformed the whole place like there's grass there.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.120
Is there going to be Mexican food?

51:16.120 --> 51:18.120
Because if there's no Mexican food, I'm going to VIP Moon.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.120
There will be Mexican food.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.120
Here's what there's going to be, you guys.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.120
There has to be Mexican people.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.120
How many Mexicans are you bringing up out of a hundred?

51:24.120 --> 51:26.120
What in the world...

51:26.120 --> 51:30.120
We're leaving the Earth to get away from this horrible classism.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.120
There is no warranty anymore.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.120
I love Mexican people.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.120
I love Mexican food.

51:34.120 --> 51:36.120
Well, there will be three Mexican guys up there,

51:36.120 --> 51:38.120
and they'll all be brilliant painters.

51:38.120 --> 51:39.120
Fine.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.120
They're not going to bring you food.

51:40.120 --> 51:41.120
Okay.

51:41.120 --> 51:45.120
Somehow that's very offensive too, but...

51:45.120 --> 51:47.120
They're going to be great lovers.

51:47.120 --> 51:49.120
I'm bringing Pedro almost over.

51:49.120 --> 51:53.120
We're going to need more than a hundred people is what I'm saying.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.120
There's a lot of shit to get done,

51:55.120 --> 51:57.120
and a hundred people aren't going to do it.

51:57.120 --> 51:58.120
I don't understand.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.120
There's a lot of shit to get done.

52:00.120 --> 52:03.120
No, we're just going up there to exist in peace.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.120
You could do it with three people, but...

52:05.120 --> 52:08.120
A small community, if everyone knows each other's name to me,

52:08.120 --> 52:10.120
it sounds like hell.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.120
Oh my God.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.120
That's heaven to me.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.120
Really?

52:13.120 --> 52:14.120
Yeah.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.120
You could say that.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.120
Seven billion people whose names I never know.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.120
Yeah, but...

52:18.120 --> 52:22.120
I could finally be that guy that walks into a room and goes,

52:22.120 --> 52:24.120
Mike, Kevin, Barbara, Stacy.

52:24.120 --> 52:26.120
I should throw some ethnic beans in there.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.120
We should throw, yeah.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.120
Yeah.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.120
Armadice.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.120
Almadovar.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.120
Armadice, you're coming.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.120
You're Mexican.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.120
Armadice.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.120
Anatoli.

52:34.120 --> 52:35.120
He counts, right?

52:35.120 --> 52:36.120
Yeah.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.120
He counts.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.120
Totally.

52:38.120 --> 52:39.120
Spencer.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.120
Enti.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.120
Enti.

52:41.120 --> 52:42.120
Oh my God, Enti.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.120
You don't like to travel.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.120
You would love to have a...

52:45.120 --> 52:46.120
You're a hermit.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.120
You would love to have a...

52:47.120 --> 52:49.120
Like build a giant Danadoo wherever you're...

52:49.120 --> 52:52.120
I would love to not feel like a dick everywhere I go.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.120
I go to Channel 101.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.120
I go even out here after the show.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.120
Jeff, what time is it?

52:56.120 --> 52:57.120
Look.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.120
9-11.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.120
So many...

53:04.120 --> 53:08.120
So much of my life is spent with this interaction.

53:08.120 --> 53:09.120
People coming up and going,

53:09.120 --> 53:13.120
hey, and I go, hey, and I look at their face

53:13.120 --> 53:16.120
and I recognize the expression of a person who...

53:16.120 --> 53:17.120
Knows you.

53:17.120 --> 53:19.120
Believes that I should know their name.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.120
And I...

53:20.120 --> 53:21.120
That's everybody.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.120
We all go through that.

53:22.120 --> 53:25.120
I go through it more than other people, I think.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.120
I am miserable about it.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.120
I would like...

53:28.120 --> 53:30.120
I very much enjoy walking into a room

53:30.120 --> 53:32.120
and knowing who everybody is.

53:32.120 --> 53:34.120
I hate if I'm going to go through that.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.120
It makes me very aloof-seeming

53:36.120 --> 53:38.120
and makes me very uncomfortable.

53:38.120 --> 53:40.120
It makes me have to stare at the floor

53:40.120 --> 53:43.120
and it's already hard enough to interact with people.

53:43.120 --> 53:44.120
I could like...

53:44.120 --> 53:46.120
If I actually could recognize people...

53:46.120 --> 53:48.120
You wouldn't get sick of the same people

53:48.120 --> 53:49.120
that you knew all the time?

53:49.120 --> 53:50.120
I mean, 100 people?

53:50.120 --> 53:52.120
That's like a big apple to bite.

53:52.120 --> 53:54.120
Like I said, by the time I would get bored with them,

53:54.120 --> 53:56.120
I think it would be 20 years later,

53:56.120 --> 53:57.120
not only would I be dying,

53:57.120 --> 53:58.120
but there would be all these new people.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.120
But they would be children.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.120
No, they would be 20-year-old people.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.120
We're going to start fucking as soon as we get up there.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.120
100 people fucking.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.120
It's like, it's not...

54:06.120 --> 54:08.120
I don't know.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.120
Have you looked at the Earth lately?

54:09.120 --> 54:11.120
100 people fucking leads to this.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.120
Yeah.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.120
No.

54:13.120 --> 54:15.120
By the way, I know what's going to happen

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
is in like 20 years on the moon,

54:16.120 --> 54:18.120
you guys are going to be like fierce enemies

54:18.120 --> 54:19.120
in these stories.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.120
Like, remember on Earth, they used to be friends.

54:21.120 --> 54:24.120
Like how Superman and Lex Luthor went to school together

54:24.120 --> 54:25.120
in a small world.

54:25.120 --> 54:27.120
What if you took the...

54:27.120 --> 54:29.120
What if you took half of the moon

54:29.120 --> 54:31.120
and it was like the capitalist side?

54:31.120 --> 54:32.120
This is the whole story.

54:32.120 --> 54:33.120
I despise capitalism.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.120
Guys!

54:34.120 --> 54:35.120
I don't want capitalism.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.120
I want...

54:36.120 --> 54:37.120
I want...

54:37.120 --> 54:39.120
You want fancy restaurants.

54:39.120 --> 54:41.120
For instance, but I also want to be able...

54:41.120 --> 54:42.120
I want variety.

54:42.120 --> 54:43.120
I want the unknown.

54:43.120 --> 54:44.120
I would need to be able to travel.

54:44.120 --> 54:46.120
I like going to places where I don't speak the language.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
You despise them.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.120
But they know why you're going to the moon at all then

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
if you want to go to places...

54:50.120 --> 54:52.120
I'm starting to rethink it.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.120
Now, if you're a citizen of the moon,

54:54.120 --> 54:56.120
do you have the ability to go back

54:56.120 --> 54:59.120
if you ever want to take a vacation back to Italy or something like that?

54:59.120 --> 55:01.120
I can't allow that.

55:01.120 --> 55:04.120
I think...

55:04.120 --> 55:06.120
VIP moon.

55:06.120 --> 55:08.120
No, I'm kidding.

55:08.120 --> 55:11.120
I'm assuming that there's going to have to be

55:11.120 --> 55:13.120
an awful lot of back and forth.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.120
You know, the first people that...

55:14.120 --> 55:15.120
You think so?

55:15.120 --> 55:17.120
Yeah, there would have to be.

55:17.120 --> 55:18.120
For instance...

55:18.120 --> 55:20.120
I think also that could be part of the culture

55:20.120 --> 55:22.120
is that the moon is like a...

55:22.120 --> 55:23.120
There would be people...

55:23.120 --> 55:25.120
I would look at it as like a...

55:25.120 --> 55:27.120
like a sieve kind of...

55:27.120 --> 55:29.120
I don't know how to articulate the process.

55:29.120 --> 55:31.120
Like it's an optional...

55:31.120 --> 55:34.120
There's a shuttle that goes back and forth

55:34.120 --> 55:35.120
every year, right?

55:35.120 --> 55:37.120
So you...

55:37.120 --> 55:40.120
Over time, the people that end up populating the moon

55:40.120 --> 55:42.120
are people that actually do enjoy it.

55:42.120 --> 55:45.120
No one that actually doesn't like it

55:45.120 --> 55:48.120
has to be there longer than a certain interval.

55:48.120 --> 55:50.120
And then over time,

55:50.120 --> 55:53.120
even the gene pool is just like people that actually are into the moon.

55:53.120 --> 55:56.120
You got 100 people to start fucking day one.

55:56.120 --> 56:00.120
And 18 years later, there's a bunch of 18-year-olds running around.

56:00.120 --> 56:02.120
They're not all going to be guaranteed likeable people.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.120
What if there's some Friday...

56:04.120 --> 56:05.120
But they're raised well.

56:05.120 --> 56:07.120
Then they get to go away.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.120
They don't want to go.

56:08.120 --> 56:09.120
Their family's up there.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.120
They're not going to like their family if they're uncool.

56:11.120 --> 56:13.120
Their families are going to be cool.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.120
And they'll raise their kids to be cool.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.120
I'm not going to bring uncool people to the moon.

56:17.120 --> 56:19.120
No one uncool is going to like being there.

56:19.120 --> 56:22.120
I'm going to create an environment that uncool people do not like.

56:22.120 --> 56:24.120
Uncool people could have uncool kids.

56:24.120 --> 56:25.120
I mean, cool people could have uncool kids.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.120
Right.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.120
And then the uncool kids get to leave.

56:27.120 --> 56:28.120
And you said,

56:28.120 --> 56:29.120
well, their families are going to be there.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.120
Their families are cool.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.120
They don't like their families if they're uncool.

56:32.120 --> 56:33.120
I see that.

56:33.120 --> 56:35.120
That's oversimplifying it.

56:35.120 --> 56:36.120
Oversimplifying.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.120
Sometimes I wish my family was on the moon

56:38.120 --> 56:40.120
so I could just come to Earth forever.

56:40.120 --> 56:42.120
You know, I think I think that's...

56:42.120 --> 56:43.120
And I know...

56:43.120 --> 56:44.120
Oh, God.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.120
What was going to happen here?

56:45.120 --> 56:47.120
But I honestly think, like,

56:47.120 --> 56:48.120
for a lot of people,

56:48.120 --> 56:49.120
being away from their families forever

56:49.120 --> 56:50.120
would be something that they want to do.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.120
What about this?

56:51.120 --> 56:52.120
Okay.

56:52.120 --> 56:53.120
At the end of each year,

56:53.120 --> 56:55.120
and who knows what a year is when you're on the moon?

56:55.120 --> 56:56.120
I don't know how that works.

56:56.120 --> 56:58.120
How is day and night going to work?

56:58.120 --> 56:59.120
I don't know.

56:59.120 --> 57:00.120
I can't wait to find out.

57:00.120 --> 57:02.120
It works the same because it's locked.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
The orbit is locked around.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.120
All right, smarty pants.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.120
At the end of each year...

57:06.120 --> 57:07.120
No.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.120
The moon is geostationary,

57:08.120 --> 57:10.120
but the sun still goes around it

57:10.120 --> 57:11.120
because that's how we get the phases of the moon.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.120
Right.

57:12.120 --> 57:14.120
So the dark side of the moon is not actually dark.

57:14.120 --> 57:15.120
It's dark to us.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.120
Right.

57:16.120 --> 57:17.120
Yeah.

57:17.120 --> 57:18.120
No, we know that,

57:18.120 --> 57:19.120
but doesn't the moon go around?

57:19.120 --> 57:20.120
We don't know that.

57:20.120 --> 57:21.120
Coomale knows that.

57:21.120 --> 57:24.120
The moon is locked in a geostationary orbit,

57:24.120 --> 57:27.120
which means the sun is facing us, right?

57:27.120 --> 57:31.120
But then when the sun is perpendicular to it,

57:31.120 --> 57:33.120
we see half the moon is being dark.

57:33.120 --> 57:36.120
That means the side that's away from us is lit up.

57:36.120 --> 57:39.120
So how long is the moon year built?

57:39.120 --> 57:43.120
It takes like a month to go around the Earth months, right?

57:43.120 --> 57:45.120
It takes like 28 days or something.

57:45.120 --> 57:47.120
But then days and nights are going to be totally different.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.120
It's not going to be 24 hours.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.120
It's going to be one month.

57:50.120 --> 57:53.120
One day is going to be one month.

57:53.120 --> 57:54.120
This is great.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.120
Is it really?

57:55.120 --> 57:58.120
I'll be able to write the script so much faster.

57:58.120 --> 58:00.120
I'm not even living there yet.

58:00.120 --> 58:02.120
I'll get it to you tomorrow.

58:02.120 --> 58:03.120
Yeah.

58:03.120 --> 58:14.120
I might have to jerk off for a couple of air quotes hours.

58:14.120 --> 58:15.120
Okay.

58:15.120 --> 58:19.120
So whatever a moon year is, you have a big party.

58:19.120 --> 58:20.120
Someone's raising their hand.

58:20.120 --> 58:21.120
We have a hand up.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.120
Yes, sir?

58:22.120 --> 58:23.120
Yes.

58:23.120 --> 58:24.120
In addition to jerking off,

58:24.120 --> 58:26.120
what would be your favorite moon activities?

58:26.120 --> 58:29.120
I'm thinking of specifically zero gravity.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.120
Oh, right.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.120
Well, it's one-sixth gravity.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.120
It's one-sixth gravity.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.120
So he's saying, other than jerking off,

58:34.120 --> 58:37.120
what would be your favorite one-sixth gravity gas times?

58:37.120 --> 58:39.120
Right now, at this point,

58:39.120 --> 58:44.120
I can't see past the joy of being just left alone, largely.

58:44.120 --> 58:47.120
I just like talking to people and drinking.

58:47.120 --> 58:51.120
And I don't know if I would take a lot of advantage of the one-sixth gravity

58:51.120 --> 58:53.120
and play a lot of football or anything.

58:53.120 --> 58:55.120
I would think that you probably would create,

58:55.120 --> 58:58.120
indoors, it would be normal gravity, earth gravity.

58:58.120 --> 58:59.120
Probably.

58:59.120 --> 59:01.120
You don't want people like slowly, like, you know...

59:01.120 --> 59:06.120
But I mean, given that gravity would have to be artificially induced.

59:06.120 --> 59:07.120
Sure.

59:07.120 --> 59:13.120
So which means that making a fun room would be as simple as putting less work into it.

59:13.120 --> 59:17.120
I guess there would be places you could go where you could go,

59:17.120 --> 59:19.120
I'm only 30 pounds.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.120
I don't know if I'd hang out there.

59:22.120 --> 59:27.120
I think I'd just have a kind of a log cabin feel.

59:27.120 --> 59:31.120
For you, the moon in itself, there's nothing special about the moon that is the best thing.

59:31.120 --> 59:33.120
No, it's just not on earth.

59:33.120 --> 59:36.120
You just hate groups of people and you don't want...

59:36.120 --> 59:42.120
I don't want to be subject to, yeah, idiot's tyranny.

59:42.120 --> 59:44.120
And then the moon is still free rock.

59:44.120 --> 59:51.120
I'm afraid of my own extreme abject boredom up there with only a small amount of options.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.120
But how many people do you see?

59:53.120 --> 59:57.120
How many different places do you go to in a month?

59:57.120 --> 59:59.120
Dozens? Hundreds? I don't know.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.120
Hundreds?

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.120
Also, if I want to, I can take a trip, I can go somewhere, I'll leave.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.120
Just the option is enough.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.120
Yeah, certainly.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.120
If you go to New York, it's incredibly calming.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.120
I don't want to live in New York, but I love being in New York

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.120
because the idea that you can do anything you want at any time of day.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.120
I wish I would stand in a plexiglass cube.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.120
If somehow you could construct a one where it was like, oh, you're not...

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:28.120
You're allowed to think, say, and feel and do whatever you want while you're standing in this space

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.120
and you're not accountable to it at all.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.120
Did you bring someone else in there with you?

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.120
No, I'm saying this is how extreme my alienation is from society.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:47.120
If I could just have a three-foot-square patch of pee-pee pad for a dog,

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:55.120
where if I stood on it, I was not capable of being a bad person

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.120
for feeling something or saying something or doing something.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.120
That would be such a huge guess for me.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120
You can't do that in a bathroom here.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.120
No, you cannot.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120
Why?

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.120
You cannot because there is always going to be something that you can do

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.120
even in the privacy of your own home.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.120
You are always under the fucking rule of morons.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.120
You are never free.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:32.120
The moon is literally separate from this planet of just fucking insect people.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.120
They will get you somehow.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.120
And I don't care that there's no oxygen there.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.120
That's secondary to my goddamn freedom.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.120
I just want to stand somewhere for a little bit.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.120
I love being asleep because they're not fucking with me there.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.120
But in my dreams, they're still like, stop it.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.120
Shut up, knock it off.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120
What are you doing?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.120
Tie your shoes.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.120
Take a bath.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.120
But that's you talking to yourself.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120
That's them, man.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.120
That's them.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.120
Yeah, society's telling you to take a bath.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120
It sure is.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.120
I know that this is all just hypothetical in the planning stages,

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.120
but whatever number of people you picked,

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120
you're going to obviously have to pick them

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.120
and you're going to have the rules of who they are.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.120
There's also going to have to be rules of conduct.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.120
And my fear is that you are going to become some sort of weird autocratic tyrant.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120
No, no.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.120
It will be true anarchy, defined by the fact that there is no...

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.120
You know how like kind of in the Judeo-Christian ethic,

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120
and you have lumped in all of them.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.120
We say Judeo-Christian ethic, that's actually not

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120
probably politically correct anymore.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.120
The truth is all of the new major religions,

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.120
they all have an anti-murder policy.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.120
It's like, what is the worst thing that you can do?

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120
Like inherently?

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.120
What is the fiber of evil?

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.120
Like any major religion will tell you, yeah, killing another dude.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120
That's not... don't do that.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120
And then they start with the asterisk.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.120
So, well, if the government wants to...

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.120
If you have to do it for me, I'd love it.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.120
But on the moon, of course, killing...

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.120
That's not even going to come into the picture.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.120
You're never going to get there.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120
Before you even get there,

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.120
the big fucking taboo is going to be hierarchy.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:23.120
Any implication or thirst for it will be condemned.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120
Like frowned upon.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.120
It won't even be...

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:34.120
Why are you talking to me as if I'm beneath or above you?

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120
At all.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.120
Don't do it.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.120
Don't talk to me like I'm in charge of you,

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.120
and don't talk to me like you're in charge of me.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:47.120
Non-hierarchical humanity in a bunch of grapes.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.120
Like existing.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.120
But hierarchies happen.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.120
With 100 people, there's going to be hierarchies.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.120
We are always tempted to do it.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.120
We're tempted to do lots of things that we have risen above.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.120
Ideally, those hierarchies would be based on knowledge.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.120
But even that, isn't that still sort of what you don't want?

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.120
I have boogers in my nose that will fall out.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120
I have snot in my mucous membranes.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120
I have spit in my mouth.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.120
I have turds in my butt.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.120
We are born not knowing the alphabet.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.120
We educate and refine ourselves.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.120
We rise to something.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120
There's a mimetic evolution to our species,

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.120
in addition to the genetic evolution that we've all but halted

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120
for good reasons by going like,

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.120
oh, he wears glasses, but I'm hot for him,

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120
because he's smart.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.120
Okay, so say hello to a myopic species.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.120
But we chose to advance ourselves over being giraffes

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.120
and going like, little bit of the longer neck, please.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120
Fuck those guys. They're dead to us.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.120
These giraffes are going to be dead pretty soon.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120
We're the only things that have a chance of getting off

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.120
of this fucking piece of shit planet.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.120
It's not a piece of shit planet.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.120
It's pretty nice. It's got waterfalls.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:08.120
I'm saying that we achieved the ability to be about to do something naturally,

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.120
raise our fist, hate something,

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.120
and then we go, oh, no, but my species,

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.120
even if not biologically, I don't do that.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.120
When I was a baby, that was like touching a hot stove.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.120
I don't do that.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120
I don't think about hierarchy.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.120
I have a word for it. I know what it is.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.120
I recognize it when I see it.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.120
I don't hit another person in the face with a toy fire truck,

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.120
because when I did that the first time when I was one years old,

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.120
I was told, don't do that.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.120
I think we have hierarchy now.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.120
I mean, you called most of us insect people.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120
I think that's just how we do sort of...

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.120
Because they love hierarchy.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.120
That's really weird logic.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.120
Because they like hierarchy.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.120
It's ironic logic, but it's not flawed.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:06.120
I look down on people who express hierarchy.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.120
You look down on people who look down on people.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.120
Exactly.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120
Or up to people.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.120
I look down on everybody because we're caught in this infantile thing

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.120
of thinking that we need leaders, heroes, government.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.120
Are you fucking kidding me? We're not this smart yet?

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.120
The internet is proving to us.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.120
I understand that it has its own...

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.120
These governance has emerged, but in their infancy,

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.120
forums like Reddit and...

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.120
The internet is global.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.120
If you upvote this, you downvote that.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120
It's relatively...

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.120
It's not purely devoid of hierarchy,

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.120
but it's functional without hierarchy.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120
It's like...

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.120
It's not necessary for us to go,

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.120
Hey, there's Carl. I love Carl.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.120
I love Carl, too. I love Carl. Carl's popular today.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.120
He doesn't have to get a better parking space.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.120
He doesn't have to tell us what to do.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.120
That is infantile.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.120
It is literally infantile.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.120
It's an instinct that we carry into adulthood from infancy.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.120
We start to look at Barack Obama or whoever's running for anything.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.120
We have democracy.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.120
At the end of the day, it's got to be somebody's fault when it rains.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.120
It's not going to be me.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.120
I'm not going to take responsibility for it.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.120
I'm not just going to hang out with my friends

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120
as a group, constantly communicate with them.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120
Say everything that's on my mind.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.120
I want to go in my house and keep everything to myself

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.120
and sit on a bullet ice cream and then get on the computer

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.120
and go, Fuck Obama, it rained today.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.120
It's all childish, nonsense.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.120
We are responsible for everything that happens.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.120
Our species is a terror to the planet.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120
We know all of this in our heads,

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.120
but we continue to worship heroes and leaders.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.120
But what do we do to them?

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.120
We crucify them.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.120
We take people.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.120
We put them on the covers of magazines.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.120
And then we figure out why their piece is a shit.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.120
We do this over and over and over again in this cycle,

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.120
this ritual of telling ourselves over and over again,

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.120
nodding like rain man in the back of a truck with a straight jacket on.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120
We're going, yeah, change is bad.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.120
Change is bad.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not responsible.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120
I'm not responsible at all.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.120
By the way, the irony of time.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.120
Somebody's got Adam Goldberg.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.120
The irony of, the irony of you saying,

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.120
Adam, I am not above you, but don't ever clap for me

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.120
because it fucks everything up.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.120
I like that you're saying you're not above anyone while

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:30.120
we're all performing in front of a three foot face of you.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.120
And we're all at a place called Harmontown.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120
Let's bring Spencer out right now.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.120
Spencer Spencer, will you come join us?

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:46.120
Thank you.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.120
But that's anyone, anyone can do this.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.120
Anyone can print a three foot.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.120
But some people don't want to do it in the fact.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120
Exactly.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120
No, some people don't want to do it.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120
I don't want to do it.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120
I want to go to her show.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.120
I don't, I don't, I don't like Wednesday night if she has a show.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.120
You don't want to go to her show.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120
What's your show?

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.120
What was the last show you went to?

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.120
You fucking, and also you're talking about responsibility.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120
You're like...

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.120
Yeah, you just want to be king of the moon.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.120
I don't just want to be king of the moon.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120
I want to live there.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120
That's not true.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.120
That's not true.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.120
How often do you pick up your dog's poop?

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.120
What?

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.120
How often do you pick up Harvey's shit?

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.120
I don't know, like every eighth shit.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.120
I don't know.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.120
What about the other seven?

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.120
Who picks up those?

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120
Oh, Erin.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120
She doesn't pick up the other seven shits.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120
Yeah, she does.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.120
Does she really?

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.120
Yeah, what are you, where is she going?

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120
I feel like you don't clean your own place.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120
You rely on other people all the time for other things.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120
Like you're going to be Mr. Responsible on the moon.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.120
You're going to grow your own food.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.120
You're going to have a mansion on the moon.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120
You're not?

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120
No.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.120
What are you going to do?

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120
I'm going to have a fucking like Buck Rogers cubicle.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120
I don't know.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.120
Like it's going to be, it's not going to be like it is here.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.120
You're going to rely on people to do things.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.120
It's going to be a whole different paradigm shift.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.120
There's not going to be property up there.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.120
Do you think you're ready to go up there and be responsible for your own survival?

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.120
For your own daily needs?

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120
I will have to be.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.120
And the hundred people with me will be responsible for each other and ourselves.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.120
And we're not going to be like, oh, my house is bigger.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.120
The idea of a big house, think about how absurd that is.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.120
It doesn't make any sense.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.120
Do you know how fucking medieval that is?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120
Oh, my house is bigger.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120
Do you know where that comes from?

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120
It's slavery.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.120
The idea that the patch of earth that you're allowed to occupy is a little bigger.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.120
You live in a big house right now.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.120
Yes, of course I do.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120
The earth is occupied.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.120
It's an occupied state.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.120
It's worth slaves.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.120
I want the biggest house I can fucking get.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.120
I want the most money.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.120
I want a big bag of cocaine.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.120
I want 11 dogs.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120
I want as much luxury.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:38.120
But above all of that, I'd love to be on a world that didn't have to have that shit.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120
You don't have to have that here.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120
You don't have to have that.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120
What are you talking about?

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120
You don't have to have that.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120
You don't have to have that.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120
The kingdom of God is within you.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120
And then police hit you with a stick if you don't have enough.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.120
It's illegal to be poor here.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.120
They make your life miserable.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.120
Freedom is a product that they sell you.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.120
You don't have to have a house called Danadoo.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.120
You don't have to have that place.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:08.120
Like, yes, we all want big houses because we live on a planet owned by people who have

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:16.120
sold us the idea that the amount of space you can walk in is an expression of freedom.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.120
We were born out of vaginas.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.120
We had freedom of speech.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120
We have the freedom of locomotion.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.120
Nobody's talking out of a vagina.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:33.120
We are already allowed to do everything, and we have been convinced that, oh, well,

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.120
no, you want to park your car there.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.120
Hey, look, man, a lot of people want to park their car there.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120
You're going to give me $5.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.120
On that Tuesday, you parked your car there.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120
That's going to cost you $80.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120
We've got to clean the streets.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.120
You've got to tow that thing.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.120
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.120
What are you talking about?

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120
It's insanity.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.120
You're going to be such a nightmare despot.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.120
I'm not going to have to be.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120
I'm going to go up there.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.120
I'm going to have to sleep like a baby for nine hours a day.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.120
You're going to go up there thinking that you're going to be in control of the mind

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.120
of 100 people.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:07.120
The fact that you picked them already gives you power over everyone else.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:15.120
And the fact that you have incredibly bizarre expectations about behavior of a bunch of different minds,

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.120
a bunch of different entities.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.120
You're going to get someone to be in charge of a situation.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.120
Even tiny situations need someone to be in charge, right?

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120
Is that big red?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.120
Who is that?

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.120
Me.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.120
Is that big red?

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120
No.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.120
What's your name, sir?

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120
Ryan.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.120
Ryan.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.120
Hello, Ryan.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.120
I mean, I'm being devil's advocate.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.120
I think that in a properly functioning society, we don't need government.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.120
We don't need hierarchies.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.120
We don't need power.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.120
We don't need to enforce certain people having and holding power over other people.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.120
People have the ability in small communities to make decisions as a group.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:55.120
Have there been any sustainable communities that have lasted beyond a few years that have had no hierarchy?

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.120
Yes, but let me just answer this question really quick and you can answer the specific example that I know you have.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:07.120
The answer, sir, is when there's a fire, which is what you're talking about,

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.120
you don't have to have hierarchy in order to have a person who is the designated fire marshal.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.120
You don't have to have hierarchy in order to have responsibility.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:27.120
You can have 100 people get together and agree on how to get shit done efficiently without anybody being better than anyone else

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.120
and having more or less rights than anyone else.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.120
You can actually just organize as a group of people.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.120
That is another fucking lie that's been told to us is that anarchy means chaos.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.120
Those are not synonymous words.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.120
Anarchy means not governed.

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.120
Anarchy means non-hierarchical.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120
It means self-governance.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.120
It means no rule.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.120
As Mikhail Bakunin said, anarchy is the mother of order.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:14:00.120
The idea that capitalism and government enforced unemployment to keep prices at a certain place, enforced famine, war, all this stuff.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120
That's chaos.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.120
That's incredible disorder.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.120
The word anarchy has turned into something else.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:18.120
I believe that people living in communities making their own decisions, like in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and the communes there.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.120
When the civil wars happened, the governments fell apart and there was provisional government and everything went to shit.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.120
Women started throwing off prostitution.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.120
They started shrugging off machismo and started doing, actually becoming powerful members of society.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:37.120
Scholars, teachers, and universities swept up the floors and cleaned the toilets after they were done teaching because they felt pride in their universities.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:44.120
The buses ran, the sewers got cleaned, and then all of the fascists from both sides, from Franco, who the fuck their names up?

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:53.120
The communists and the fascists, they all looked at these people all living freely and starting to spread across southwestern Europe.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:15:04.120
They all just turned their guns on them and annihilated them because the idea that people could actually properly function if educated, if turned on by the idea that humanity actually has an incredible desire to get along.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:09.120
Kids in a sandlot absolutely share and they play and they're not bigoted and they're not racist.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.120
We enforce all this shit on them.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.120
Kids are assholes.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120
What are you talking about?

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.120
No, we make kids assholes.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.120
Kids solve fucking problems beautifully if you let them.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:26.120
If you don't enforce the idea that guys are cooler than girls and get bullies and doesn't force property and shit like that.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.120
I've seen kids beautifully behavior on each other.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:38.120
If you give people respect, Tolstoy, even though he was like a landowner, he had all these surfs and he freed them all, but he had these schools and he would let the kids teach themselves.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.120
What do you want to learn today?

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.120
Everybody learned.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:50.120
If you could sit wherever you wanted, they had this incredible education and these textbooks that he made were outlawed under Stalinism and stuff because they were so cool because the idea that actually people...

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120
Is that what they officially said?

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.120
Is that what Tolstoy said?

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.120
The anti-cooler.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:03.120
You got a Lenin's tomb and there's like a placard that says no cool textbooks.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.120
It says cool and that no smoking sound around it.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:09.120
It's like Marxism became a Pringles commercial.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:18.120
I've always been an anarchist at heart, but the idea is the only bummer is that people actually would have to have thought about it and have to be...

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.120
We say take responsibility for your life, but I mean so much more than just saying I'll be responsible.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:36.120
It's like really like taking care of your children, taking care of your elderly, taking care of yourself, not relying on everybody else to do everything for you, but also being able to shrug off shit like sexism and misogyny and racism

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:43.120
and these giant things that we just taught each other to give to necessitate power and people's control over each other.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.120
Sounds great, it's been done.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.120
What happens is governments come in and assassinate you.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.120
Not on the moon.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.120
Because there's nothing up there.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120
There's no oil up there.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.120
There's no money up there.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120
There's no diamonds up there.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120
Yeah, we have a shit ring protecting us.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120
Very quietly.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.120
I'm off for it.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.120
You pitch a tent.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.120
I'm off for it.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.120
There's no restaurants.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.120
I'm off for it.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120
I'm going to need some Mexican food.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.120
We're going to work on this.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.120
The way to do that is I'll make the Mexican food.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.120
I'll try my best.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.120
I'll run a little Mexican restaurant.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.120
And yes, yes, I am picking the people that are going up there.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.120
Because you're going to be a king.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.120
If I go into...

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:22.120
No, because in that town you describe the fucking fascist turn the guns on them because there's people down here.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:27.120
I can't go up there with a bunch of fetuses and hatch them and be one of them too.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.120
I have to pick cool people to end the hierarchy.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.120
I have to pick and choose out of the 7 billion people.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.120
You have to pick and choose.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.120
It's a flawed right there.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.120
It's not a flawed.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.120
It's the only way it's going to happen.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.120
That's going to be your slogan you use.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.120
No, I'm going to wait until someone else does it.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.120
That's how it's going to happen.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120
How do you pick?

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.120
How do you know what's the coolest 100 people?

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120
I don't know.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120
I'm going to try.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.120
And you're pointing at the insinuation that I'm going to do something?

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.120
Is the inherent flaw of doing it?

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.120
I'm saying how do you know what the coolest 100 people are?

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120
Maybe I won't, N-word.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:05.120
I'm going to fucking take a spectacular attempt.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.120
How many black people out of 100 are you breaking?

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.120
18%.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.120
No, I don't know.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:19.120
I'm going to have to come up with a methodology that's going to make sure that there's some kind of ethnic blind.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120
I love the idea that you would try to do this.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.120
I just wonder, do you trust yourself to pick the right 100 people?

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:30.120
The truth is, because when you get into that, are you going to go to all seven continents?

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.120
It's going to be English speaking.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.120
It's going to be American people.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.120
It's going to be flawed because I want to get it done.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.120
I'm not going to do it perfectly.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.120
I'm going to just do it.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120
I'm not going to do it perfectly.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.120
I'm not going to answer to 1,000 people gathering around me going,

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:54.120
well, if you do it this way, isn't you going to, shut it, I'm doing it.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:59.120
Wait, you're saying there's no hierarchy by telling people to shut it.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120
There's insects people.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.120
A planet of fucking idiots.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.120
I don't like who you've become already, Dan.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.120
I think I might stay on earth for the first few years like breaking bad and waiting until it comes out on DVD.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.120
You wait it out, but I'm telling you, when you get up there.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.120
It's going to be great.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:21.120
No, no, no, you're not getting a wristband to the one fancy restaurant we have.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.120
Oh, there's one now?

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.120
There's wristbands!

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120
Hierarchy!

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.120
Judas!

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.120
It starts with wristbands!

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.120
Literally things around your wrist that signify.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.120
It's going to be for one nightclub that's going to be called Fuck With Jeff.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.120
Fine.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.120
So that when he gets up there, we're going to go, hey, come into the club.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.120
Oh shit, you weren't here for the first two years.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.120
You were waiting it out.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.120
We just tattooed specific serial numbers on the people who can go.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.120
Can we play a little D&D right now?

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.120
Can we try to enforce some of our new anarcho-syndicalism?

01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.120
Can we try out a little, like, try some of this philosophy?

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.120
When we fight a spider?

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120
Yeah, I guess.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.120
Hey, Spencer.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.120
Hey, guys.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120
What do you think, Spencer?

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120
Do you believe in me?

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.120
I think that you'd run into a problem of you'd have a hierarchy police.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.120
There'd be people that are like, oh, you're using wristbands, you got to get off the moon.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.120
That's what I'm saying.

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.120
But then they're part of the...

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.120
Yeah, but that's going to happen because otherwise you'd have hierarchy, right?

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.120
I don't know.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.120
There's got to be a way.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120
The Vulcans figured out how to...

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120
I think humans are fucked.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.120
People are clapping because Spencer hates humanity.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.120
Yeah.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.120
But it even sounds like inspiring when he says it.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.120
I mean, the thing is like, you know, like...

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:45.120
If it's true that humans are fucked, then what better way to spend the last decades of our fuckedness

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.120
just fucked for the fuck of it, just fucking around with the idea that we're not fucked?

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.120
Why not just...

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.120
Fine, we're fucked.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.120
We can be fucked by doing nothing or we can be fucked doing...

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.120
Trying.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.120
We could be fucked trying.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.120
I'm just playing devil's advocate here.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.120
We're spitballing.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.120
We're trying to get this right, you know?

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.120
I'm asking you the tough questions now.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.120
What you guys did tonight was called spitballing.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.120
I felt very persecuted.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.120
And I'm really rethinking your moon status.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120
See?

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.120
This is...

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.120
This is what we're up.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120
Dan, I gotta tell you.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.120
You guys are very hierarchical and it does not please me.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.120
Dan.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.120
Dan, the idea that you're not going to become a desperate up there, I think, is that you need to look into that.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.120
Because you're almost certainly going to be disappointed and start making mandates and rules.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.120
Whatever, buddy.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.120
Spencer, what do you think about it all?

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:38.120
I had a cat that I named based off of a promise I made ages ago.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120
That's a really long throwback.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.120
The bagel?

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.120
Yeah.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.120
Well, I wrote down one time, I used to carry a journal and I'd just write down thoughts and stuff.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.120
And I wrote down, cat named Jason.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.120
And then my friend was like, do you want a cat?

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120
And I was like, okay.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.120
And it was a girl, but I named it Jason.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.120
And how long did Jason...

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120
Is Jason still with you?

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.120
Jason's still with us.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.120
And Jason is great.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.120
She's digging it.

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120
Okay.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.120
Are there going to be animals on the moon?

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.120
I'm sorry, I don't mean to go back into this.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.120
No, that's a good question.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.120
I never thought about that.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.120
Would they get equal rights?

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.120
No.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.120
The dog gets a vote.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.120
We're eating kibble every day.

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:27.120
No, I wish that there was a way that we could never leave more than a footprint on another species that we crossed paths with.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:37.120
But I believe that until we get our shit together, that the most prudent philosophy is to consider humanity to be the absolute most important thing.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.120
Whether or not there'd be dogs and cats up there, I don't know.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.120
That's a good question.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.120
We're not disagreeing with you.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.120
We're challenging you to figure out how this is going to go.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.120
I don't know.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.120
I don't like your dominance over animals already, man.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.120
We're going to continue this.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.120
This podcast has now become about colonizing the moon.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.120
We're going to really do it.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120
Hey, where's that guy?

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.120
Where's that guy that worked at that space factory?

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.120
What was his name?

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.120
Jesus.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.120
Jesus Diaz?

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.120
He moved to Long Beach.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.120
He moved to Long Beach.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.120
Which is the moon of Earth.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.120
So he lived in...

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.120
I know the moon is the moon of Earth.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:19.120
He lives in Long Beach and can't make this show, but we're going to take him to the moon.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120
Forget it.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.120
Nobody from Long Beach is coming.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.120
I was born in Long Beach.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120
Well, no, but you've transcended it.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.120
Thank you.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120
Thank you, man.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120
You know you have.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120
I'm sorry about the...

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.120
Don't bring it up again.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.120
Well, that sounds cute.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120
It sounds like a little robot.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.120
Yeah.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.120
You want to live in a society where that is okay to do, right?

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120
I mean, it's funny because it's so wrong.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120
I mean, it's so not accurate, and it's mean, and it's...

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.120
Yeah, that's not the sound I was going to say we make.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120
Did...

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120
Did...

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.120
Are you leading in Pakistani culture?

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.120
No.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.120
We're not, like, taught as kids to go, I'm not even going to do it.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.120
But...

01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.120
Is there no...

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.120
Are you leading there?

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120
No one does that?

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.120
I never saw it once.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.120
Okay.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.120
I was there for 18 years.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.120
Okay, so did it...

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.120
Maybe it was done secretly.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.120
I don't know.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.120
Okay.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.120
But Martin is secretly...

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.120
As long as we're apologizing, I'm sorry, Adam.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.120
I didn't mean...

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.120
What I said when he stood up and he took a bow, I was just making the observation that it's

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120
a real problem.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.120
You said you'd have a statue to him.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.120
He's doing great.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.120
Which he's referenced, but it came out...

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.120
Their audience reacted as if I was being a bully and saying,

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120
Spine, does it work right?

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120
It's not.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.120
That's not what...

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.120
I'm sorry if it came across like that.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.120
What do you think, Adam?

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.120
Bloom wasn't very good.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.120
Bloom, could you do some work?

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.120
But we still love your efforts.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.120
Now, Adam, we adore you.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.120
We love you.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.120
Thank you for coming.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.120
Can I...

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.120
Can I share?

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.120
I...

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.120
I kind of like the boom joke.

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.120
It was better than anything I had.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120
He came up with...

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.120
What was the skeleton one the other day?

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.120
Bone viage.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.120
Yeah, that will never be forgotten.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.120
Bone viage.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.120
All right, Spencer, catch us up and we'll do a little anarchist D&D right now.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.120
Hold up.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.120
And...

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.120
Last time on Harmontown.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.120
Our heroes were in the hall of the Jarl of Fornheim.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.120
Oh, that didn't tick.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.120
The frozen city.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.120
The party hoped to gain some assistance in defeating Admiral Darkstar and ask the Jarl,

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.120
Liv Dahl, for aid.

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.120
But the giant noticed right away that they had collected some of the fragments of power

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.120
and wanted them for himself.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:37.120
This remark incensed Sharpie, who railed against the unjolly blue giant, unleashing a verbal

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.120
teeth-dicking.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:44.120
The giant responded by stomping on Sharpie, leaving him dying.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.120
Broken and body, but not mind.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:53.120
Mulraine, however, had suffered a broken mind.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.120
Thank you, Spencer.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.120
And began furiously courting the Jarl's favor.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:05.120
But Christopher called him out on his bullshit, for which he also suffered a boot to the

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.120
head, but survived.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.120
Weighing the situation, Quark alternated between rage and bargaining, but Sharpie continued

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.120
to hurl insults at the giant until the Jarl murdered the dying man, snuffing it out with

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.120
his blue thumb.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.120
After an insanity of commotion and action, settled at the same time, Quark decided to

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:28.120
trade shards for a skeleton army and Sharpie's life.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:34.120
And Liv Dahl resurrected the slain sorcerer before sending them on their way.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:40.120
Now.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.120
I forgot, that was really intense all we did in that throne room or whatever.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.120
Right, guys?

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.120
We all went through a lot.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.120
My favorite moment, if I could step out of the thing, was you actually stood up and were

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.120
like, okay, guys, there was a lot of emotions going on.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120
There were.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.120
There was a lot going on.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:03.120
I don't think we'll forget the day within the D&D world and also in real life.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120
I know I won't.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.120
So we have our skeleton army right now.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:11.120
It seems a little hierarchical right now to have kind of soldiers.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.120
Well, we do the thing that Daenerys Targaryen doesn't give a thrones where they're like,

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.120
you're free, but you can totally still help us out.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.120
I'd say to the skeletons, hey, you're free, but blah, blah, blah.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:28.120
Yeah, you're free, but if you want to help us out, we did free you.

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.120
We did pick you to come to the moon.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:38.120
If you want to do me a little favor, here's some wristbands.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.120
I feel like it's unfair to use the wristband.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.120
That's my joke.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.120
I was joking.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.120
The wristbands were ironic.

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.120
And then you guys are like, wristbands, wristbands.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120
That's the joke.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:54.120
But the moment they became convenient for your joke, you put another wristband on, man.

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.120
Wait, I didn't understand that.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.120
Hey, man.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.120
Yeah, you never will, man.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.120
You never will.

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.120
You got to hate wristbands to get that joke.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:06.120
You got to wristband on your mind, man.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.120
Yeah, the wristband's not on your wrist, man.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.120
Anatoly, you know what I'm talking about.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.120
You come from Mother Russia.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:18.120
Your grandparents didn't have hierarchy, kind of, except they had one big hierarchy over them.

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.120
Anatoly, we're Tolstoy's books.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.120
Totally cool.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.120
Yeah, I like them.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120
You like them.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120
All right.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.120
All right, so we got our army.

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120
Where do we need to get to?

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.120
Are we actually going to denierism?

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120
Oh, yeah.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.120
Do you want to make a speech there?

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120
Oh, yeah.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120
Yeah.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120
I'm not.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120
I actually don't want to.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.120
I don't think we should do that because they're skeletons that were conjured by a frost giant.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.120
They're not people.

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.120
Are they just things and not people?

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.120
Do they have personalities and names?

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.120
They are skeletons, you know.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.120
Can we name them one through 40?

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.120
And that's how we sort of give them a little bit of...

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.120
That is something you could do.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120
All right, we went through a lot.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.120
Let's just take our army and let's press forward.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.120
All right.

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120
One through 40.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.120
We tattooed the numbers on their wrists.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120
All right.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.120
So do we need to get...

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.120
Not in a bad way.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.120
Do we need to get directions to where Admiral Darkstar's fortification is?

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120
Yeah.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.120
I mean, you're still in the giant city.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.120
You're just not in that palace anymore.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.120
So...

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120
Let's walk to the...

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.120
Let's exit the city and go to the Admiral Darkstar thing, right?

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120
Yeah.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.120
Let's drop by and pay the visit.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.120
Yeah.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.120
Let's go.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.120
So you leave the city heading north towards the Black Keep.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.120
Soon you come to a massive ice canyon, a great rift in the sheer cliff of ice.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:37.120
You'll have to pass through the canyon in order to reach Admiral Darkstar.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.120
No bridge?

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.120
Well, no.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.120
It's like...

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.120
It's like you're at the bottom of a cliff and there's like a canyon going through it.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.120
So...

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.120
So we should walk into the canyon?

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.120
Or you could try and climb up it, but it's hundreds of feet.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.120
You need more rope, probably.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120
All right.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.120
Can I climb up it or...

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.120
I'm sorry.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.120
You're at the bottom of a cliff.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.120
Right.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:59.120
And the only way through the cliff is this canyon that's cutting through the cliff.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.120
Otherwise, you'd have to go up the cliff.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.120
Oh, I see.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.120
So we're being directed into like a tunnel.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.120
Yeah.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.120
Okay.

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.120
All right.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:11.120
Should we take a vote with us and also the 40 skeletons?

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.120
Skeletons, what do you think?

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.120
They look on.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.120
Dead eyes.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:22.120
The eyes are above the nose.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.120
Well, they're not...

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.120
That's accurate.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:26.120
Yeah.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.120
They're not going to climb anywhere with us.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.120
I mean, we're not going to be crafty.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.120
Let's just proceed into this canyon.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.120
Let's do it.

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.120
Let's go.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.120
Skeletons first.

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:42.120
Inside the canyon, you can hear howling wind, but you feel cold beginning to sink in.

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:46.120
Your lack of wintry clothing is beginning to take its toll on your bodies, numbing your

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.120
fingers, and biting your skin.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:51.120
Can we take clothes from the skeletons?

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.120
Sure.

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.120
Are they wearing clothes?

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.120
They're wearing heavy black cloaks.

01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120
Yeah.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.120
They're skeletons.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.120
They don't have dicks to be ashamed of.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:11.120
They don't have zipper scars on them.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.120
How do you think cloaks work, by the way?

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120
Like, what do you think?

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120
The cloaks are...

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.120
All right, let's take some cloaks.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.120
All right.

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.120
That happens.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120
Thank you, 37.

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.120
Thank you, 8.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.120
Thank you, 13.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:30.120
You feel warmer, but still, it's not doing it.

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.120
You're going to have to get out of exposure within the next evening or so.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.120
Otherwise, you might get too cold.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:40.120
In the canyon, are there any caves that we can sort of...

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.120
You'd have to go deeper in the canyon to try and find something like that.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.120
How much time do we have before nightfall?

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.120
You know, plenty of time.

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.120
I said we press up.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.120
We have to find shelter, you guys.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.120
Let's move along.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.120
Immediately, you hear a skittering, chittering, chirping sound coming from all around you.

01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.120
See?

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.120
We found a forest.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:03.120
White, flittering shapes swoop down from above into the canyon.

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:08.120
Thousands of these strange, chittering, white shapes moving about as if a cloud of gnats.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.120
Hello, fairies.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.120
Are you here to warm us?

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.120
That's positive thinking.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.120
They are not.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.120
How do we know that they're not?

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:23.120
You just get that sense after you ask the question.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.120
Are they coming straight for us?

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120
They're kind of descending.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.120
It's kind of descending into the canyon all around you,

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:34.120
and you kind of feel the wind whip up, and you feel kind of slashes.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120
I have an armlet of winter.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.120
That's not going to help.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.120
It's going to make things more cold.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.120
Don't you have armlets that we can do things with?

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.120
I have an armlet of spring, but it's really...

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.120
I need to be in a springy environment in order...

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.120
I can summon armor of thorny vines,

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:50.120
and I can command the vines to blah, blah, blah.

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.120
These guys are so small, though.

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.120
I don't know how we would...

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:58.120
I mean, I'm assuming we have torches lit and stuff?

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.120
I know.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.120
Okay, well, I would like to light a torch.

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.120
Okay.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.120
All right, and hold it aloft.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.120
All right.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.120
You do that.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.120
You know, it's the winds whipping around pretty brilliantly,

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:14.120
but you've managed to create, like, the world's best wind block

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.120
to light this torch, and that happens.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.120
But the howling wind at the same time it kind of bites at your guys

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.120
is, you know, heals and exposes skin.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.120
You take two damage each.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.120
What the hell?

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.120
Oh, come on.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.120
Are the skeletons okay with them?

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.120
What's somebody...

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.120
The skeletons are immune to cold.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.120
I'm using my tooth fillings of hearing voices

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.120
to ask that person to repeat what he just shouted out.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.120
Magic.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120
Magic.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.120
Elements.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.120
Resist.

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.120
Resist elements.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.120
Do we have that?

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:50.120
I don't think we have any magic people up here.

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.120
I'm pretty sure Mulrainee does that as well.

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.120
She's watching Breaking Bad.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.120
Mulrainee, cast Resist Elements.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120
Is she here?

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.120
How does this work when she's here?

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.120
I don't know.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.120
Let's have Anatoly play Mulrainee.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.120
Anatoly, get up here.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.120
Tonight, the role of Mulrainee Tadana will be played by Anatoly.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.120
Do you want to give him this?

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.120
Anatoly, say I cast Resist Elements.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.120
Don't do it.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.120
Be anarchical about it.

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:17.120
Okay, yeah.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.120
I cast Resist Elements.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.120
Good Russian.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.120
Okay.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:26.120
You guys feel like you're resisting elements.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.120
All right.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.120
Hey, good work, Mulrainee.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.120
Wow.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.120
No, I'm kidding.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.120
All right.

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.120
Is it my turn?

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.120
Yeah.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.120
Okay, this is going to sound crazy.

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:45.120
I think we should put on a show.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:46.120
I love shows.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.120
Let's do it.

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:55.120
Oh my God, we put on a show.

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:59.120
She's going to be so pissed that we did a show.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.120
We put on the best show ever.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.120
It's like the Breaking Bad of D&D shows.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.120
What do you do?

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:15.120
Well, I come downstage and I set the stage for, like, it's a period piece.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.120
I go, it'll land without time.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.120
Two peacocks fell in love.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120
One from the house of Featherdom.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.120
The other from the house of Raven.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.120
And then the camera cranes up and points down.

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.120
And it's a Busby Berkeley shot of me like Esther Williams.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.120
And I'm swimming around in the snow.

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:41.120
And all the skeletons are doing a kaleidoscope with their bones.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.120
And the gnats are swirling around.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.120
It's a big, it's a big, huge, like, MGM kind of musical.

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:56.120
Oh, birds of a feather, never, never together.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:02.120
Oh, when you're in the snow and you don't know where to go,

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.120
you need to find a cave.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.120
Your life will be saved.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.120
And then there's a little, like, a little ice pool.

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:19.120
And then all the skeletons will land up and they all start diving in like that.

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.120
I rub some snow on my face so I have a white beard.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:26.120
And then I open a mime door and I come in and go,

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:30.120
You knock it off! You owe me the rent!

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.120
But I can't pay the rent!

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.120
You must pay the rent!

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.120
I'll pay the rent!

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.120
That's like, I made a snowman that looks like a hero.

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:44.120
And then the camera widens out and I've made snowmen out of every character we've met in our entire campaign.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.120
And they're all there.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.120
So it's like a big, huge production number where everybody we've met is just crazy.

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.120
And I sing a song and everyone's like, oh, here he goes.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120
But it's a new song.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.120
It's not Lady in Red.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.120
And it's the best fucking song you've ever heard.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.120
It's amazing.

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:05.120
It's moving and funny and inspiring and a catchy tune.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.120
Chris de Burgh, we had to come this far for you to be inspired to write a new hit.

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.120
And all it took was putting on a show.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.120
Thank God we had this idea.

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.120
Mulraine!

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.120
And at this point...

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.120
Mulraine, I can't believe that you just sat there and watched it, joined the show at all.

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.120
I'm doing nothing because I am after last week's show.

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:27.120
So I'm like, yeah, I have nothing.

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.120
She's not into it.

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.120
And all the evil gnats are crying through smiles.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:37.120
Suffice it to say, it's a great show.

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.120
We should have a final line for the show, right?

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.120
The moral of the story.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.120
The more you snow, the less you know.

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.120
And it makes sense.

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.120
In the context of the show...

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.120
Meaning don't snow so much.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.120
It's too cold out here.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.120
Oh my God, so moving.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.120
You really feel not cold anymore.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.120
Yes!

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:11.120
Our show's so good, we changed the weather.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120
Yeah, so...

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.120
Alright, well let's...

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.120
I mean, I have more, but that's a great time to end it.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.120
Alright, well is that it?

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.120
Let's end it right now.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:26.120
Do you want to put on a cap on the...

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.120
Anatoly, do you want to say...

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.120
Anatoly, you came up here. How's it going in your career?

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.120
Nothing much, actually.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.120
You settled in at UCLA?

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.120
No.

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.120
Why not? What's hard?

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:47.120
I'm just curious because I came from a different country to go to college

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.120
and it was very challenging.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.120
How's it been for you?

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.120
It's okay. Yeah, it's nice.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.120
You seem evasive.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:00.120
Is your parole officer here?

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.120
It's great.

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:06.120
Yeah, I'm just tired, but it's nice.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.120
Oh, he's tired.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.120
Because I was sleeping all day before like...

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.120
Are you still jet lagging?

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.120
Yeah, like, yeah.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.120
Anatoly, do you want to do...

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.120
Since you're portraying the role of Mal Rain right now,

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.120
do you want to do one final action

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.120
because we can end on a little cliffhanger here?

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.120
I mean, look down your character sheet

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.120
or summon the inner Mal Rain in you.

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.120
And this is your opportunity to affect Aaron's character,

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:37.120
to affect our campaign.

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.120
No, no, no.

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.120
She's just still bummed out from the last...

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:51.120
All right, well, that wasn't the cap we were hoping for.

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:57.120
Oh, but what could follow that amazing show, you know?

01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.120
I mean, what's going to be better than that?

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.120
Only an awesome...

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.120
Oh, and we do it again.

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.120
What were you going to say?

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.120
A rap.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:08.120
An awesome rap?

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.120
Yo, yo, yo.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.120
Rap, rap, rap.

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.120
Rap here, rap there, everywhere.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.120
I'm rapping in the street like a grizzly bear.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.120
I got a row of teeth inside my mouth.

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:24.120
I fucked your momma in the north and the south.

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:26.120
I fucked your momma in the titty and the butt.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.120
I fucked your momma.

01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.120
So what?

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.120
Take it, Anatoly.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:34.120
Go, go, Anatoly, go, go.

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.120
It's Russian rap.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:41.120
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:44.120
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.120
Thank you, Anatoly.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.120
Thank you.

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:53.120
One more time for Kumail Nanjiani, everyone.

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:56.120
Spencer Crittenden.

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:58.120
Everybody here, thank you for coming so much.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.120
And everybody here, I've melted down.

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.120
We love you so much.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.120
One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.120
No hierarchy.

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:12.120
I will find you.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.120
Yeah.

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:43.120
Anatoly.
