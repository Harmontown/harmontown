{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.200\nFor the back room of Meltdown Comics and the NerdMelt Theater, I'm proud to say that Harmon\n\n00:12.200 --> 00:16.440\nTown is once again in session.\n\n00:16.440 --> 00:23.480\nPlease welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:23.480 --> 00:38.840\nRay! Thank you. Mr. Jeff Davis, your comptroller.\n\n00:38.840 --> 00:42.840\nThank you for waiting. We usually do get it started a little bit after 8, but we had some\n\n00:42.840 --> 00:49.480\nspeaker wiring issues or something. The holodeck had to be rejiggered and thank you for your\n\n00:49.480 --> 00:55.120\npatience. I hope it didn't affect the energy with which you were going to go home and watch\n\n00:55.120 --> 01:03.400\nBreaking Bad on your DVRs. And also thank you for DVRing it and coming here. Erin did\n\n01:03.400 --> 01:08.840\nnot choose Breaking Bad over the show, but she is not here because she long ago committed\n\n01:08.840 --> 01:18.880\nto hosting a Breaking Bad party at my house. It seems like she just stayed home to watch\n\n01:18.880 --> 01:24.400\nBreaking Bad, but it's more important than that. There are guests and stuff. They're wearing\n\n01:24.400 --> 01:33.640\ncostumes and having a lot of fun and we're here. Chakes shaped like hats and, you know,\n\n01:33.640 --> 01:44.240\nErin Paul themed snacks. Anyways, I was just saying backstage, I've never seen a single\n\n01:44.240 --> 01:51.000\nminute of that show. I look forward to maybe watching it all like one month on DVD or something.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:55.720\nYou've got to be the last guy. I can't even think of... We should find a woman that also\n\n01:55.720 --> 02:02.880\nhasn't seen it and meet you two and create some kind of... Interesting couple? Specialized\n\n02:02.880 --> 02:10.240\nworking breed of a person. Alright, so one thing on my mind and that's all I can think\n\n02:10.240 --> 02:16.760\nabout and then let's bring our friends up to make up for last time, but I'm a dog owner\n\n02:16.760 --> 02:22.880\nand a cat owner. A lot of people my age have children. A lot of people my age have children\n\n02:22.880 --> 02:33.840\nthat are half my age. I have a dog and a cat and they're not getting along... Well, I mean\n\n02:33.840 --> 02:40.480\nthey're getting along okay. The cat doesn't let the dog more than a foot... There's a\n\n02:40.480 --> 02:48.200\ncat bubble. If the dog gets too close, then the cat hisses and maybe swipes, but they've\n\n02:48.200 --> 02:54.220\nnever touched each other ever. They came very close to accidentally... Erin puts little\n\n02:54.220 --> 02:58.600\nsummit snacks in between the two of them. There's these snacks that both dogs and cats\n\n02:58.600 --> 03:04.840\nlike, so this kind of cruel fashion... Summit snacks? Well, I'm saying, she has a summit\n\n03:04.840 --> 03:09.600\nand puts a little snack on the bed and the cat and the dog both like the snacks. There's\n\n03:09.600 --> 03:15.320\nsome for the cat, some for the dog, put them a little closer like Reese's Pieces. A summit\n\n03:15.320 --> 03:22.680\nlike Stalin and Roosevelt? Yeah. So they've never touched each other. The ultimate dream\n\n03:22.680 --> 03:27.280\nis to have them snuggled up to each other, like a little dog-cat couple. Do you think\n\n03:27.280 --> 03:33.640\nthat dream is fast escaping? It's not going to ever... Well, here's the plot twist. We're\n\n03:33.640 --> 03:39.040\nprimates. We don't understand how these creatures really think at the end of the day. They exhibit\n\n03:39.040 --> 03:44.200\ncharacteristics that make us think, well, okay, that cat's mad. I get mad. It doesn't\n\n03:44.200 --> 03:51.520\nwant something, so it's lashing out. Okay, I understand that. And so we then think that\n\n03:51.520 --> 03:56.360\nthese things have the same brains and emotions that we have and we're just wrong and I will\n\n03:56.360 --> 04:03.520\ntell you why I found that out today. I was at work and Aaron texted me. Most of my colleagues\n\n04:03.520 --> 04:10.560\nget texts from their significant others telling them, oh, little Jude took his first steps\n\n04:10.560 --> 04:17.120\nor while you're working on community or Franklin ate a booger or they have kids is what I'm\n\n04:17.120 --> 04:28.480\nsaying. But I get this text to Aaron said, like... I mean, I guess I should use her...\n\n04:28.480 --> 04:35.320\nI want you to feel my confusion and... Let's see. For those listening, Dan has produced\n\n04:35.320 --> 04:42.120\nhis enormous phone. Okay. So I just get a text from Aaron that says, Harvey licked\n\n04:42.120 --> 04:54.920\nFiv's butt. A frowny emoticon. Well, it sounds like that was the goal, wasn't it? Oh, so\n\n04:54.920 --> 05:01.720\nyour dog touched the cat wrong. Then she followed it up with dot, dot, dot, like there was candy\n\n05:01.720 --> 05:11.120\ninside her butt hole. And I was very confused. I said, by the way, Fiv is the name of the\n\n05:11.120 --> 05:17.120\ncat and Harvey's the dog. I said, what did Fiv do? Question mark exclamation point. What\n\n05:17.120 --> 05:22.920\ndo we call... What did we learn? Do we call those? I forget. Question mark. Terabang.\n\n05:22.920 --> 05:33.960\nIn terabang. Teragon. What did Fiv do in terabang? Aaron, she let him. Well, of course she let\n\n05:33.960 --> 05:45.000\nhim. Who doesn't want their asshole gently licked? Then another... Well... I was speaking\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:49.800\nas a primate, I'm sorry. Exactly. Like, you wouldn't want your asshole gently licked by\n\n05:49.800 --> 06:01.680\nanother primate that you hated. Well... Don't put words in my mouth. And if you did after\n\n06:01.680 --> 06:08.920\nthat primate licked your ass, you would find it hard to pretend you still hated it. If\n\n06:08.920 --> 06:13.080\nanother primate that I hated came up to me and started gently licking my ass, I would\n\n06:13.080 --> 06:18.000\ntake that as an act of contrition. Exactly. It would be an event that would transform\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:22.320\na thing. Certainly. That's why we're a storytelling species. I find ass licking always to be a\n\n06:22.320 --> 06:28.200\ntransformative moment. All right. So, now back to this story. Okay. Now I'm listening.\n\n06:28.200 --> 06:34.840\nYeah, exactly. So, she let him. And then followed it up with, she just stood there like he was\n\n06:34.840 --> 06:44.800\npaying dues. And I said, like, he was paying or she was paying? Are you saying she wanted\n\n06:44.800 --> 06:55.000\nit? Enjoyed it? And she said, he was paying. She wanted it. Then she sat down. He sat down\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:02.360\nnext to her and she hissed at him. I said, I'm having trouble processing this. It's\n\n07:02.360 --> 07:06.000\nnot what I expected would be their first physical contact. She said, believe me, I saw it and\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:11.040\nI can't process it. She offered him her butt. He sniffed it. He then licked her butthole\n\n07:11.040 --> 07:16.760\nfor upwards of 30 seconds. And I clarified. And she was like, that's right. You missed\n\n07:16.760 --> 07:21.760\na spot? Then laid down. He laid next to her and she was like, what are you crazy? Don't\n\n07:21.760 --> 07:33.640\never come near me? Yep, exactly. Wow. Baby steps, you know. But that's not, baby steps.\n\n07:33.640 --> 07:37.880\nThat's how we think. You take steps and then you start to walk. You develop, you adapt,\n\n07:37.880 --> 07:44.240\nyou change at these milestones. This cat let this dog lick its asshole. It's not afraid\n\n07:44.240 --> 07:50.960\nof it. That seems like, here's what I think. If I had to make a guess that Fiv being the\n\n07:50.960 --> 07:55.640\nelder, she's been there longer. She's quite old, right? How old is Fiv now? Do we know?\n\n07:55.640 --> 08:01.160\nShe's got to be at least 13. She's an old, she's the grand dam of the estate. And here\n\n08:01.160 --> 08:05.920\ncomes this young puppy who's been bumming her out and she's been hissing at and she's\n\n08:05.920 --> 08:11.120\nbeen quarantined into different parts of the home. And yeah, the least he can do is like\n\n08:11.120 --> 08:14.720\na little asshole. But that doesn't make it cool. It's like, no, you get to lick my ass\n\n08:14.720 --> 08:20.200\nforever. I'm still not going to like you. That's an alpha, like saying like, yeah, you're\n\n08:20.200 --> 08:25.120\nthe ass licker. I still hate your guts. Yeah, I guess. It's like the closest you can come\n\n08:25.120 --> 08:29.240\nto understanding is like prison, you know, like, like, like men make love to each other\n\n08:29.240 --> 08:35.440\nin prison, but they don't then high five. They stab each other. Thank you for letting\n\n08:35.440 --> 08:39.320\nme make love to you. That's, that's the least you can do for being in prison with me. Now\n\n08:39.320 --> 08:46.840\nstabby, stab, stab. I wonder what, what Harvey's instinct was. Does he, does he just like\n\n08:46.840 --> 08:54.200\nhe's bummed out because Harvey, Harvey views, views all moving things as potential delay\n\n08:54.200 --> 08:59.120\nis apples. Like, you know, if he sees a squirrel, he sees a cat, he sees another dog, he sees\n\n08:59.120 --> 09:03.920\na child, he sees a male man. He's, he has the same reaction to all of it. He just wants\n\n09:03.920 --> 09:09.160\nto interact and play. It's very, very, very, very jolly fella who has never really experienced\n\n09:09.160 --> 09:15.840\nany pain in his life. We're using this modern, you know, post Caesar Milan training technique.\n\n09:15.840 --> 09:21.360\nWe've never, we have never negatively addressed him. We have never even implied to him that\n\n09:21.360 --> 09:25.000\nhe's done anything wrong. And I'm proud to say it works. I'm relieved to say it works.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:28.820\nLike I always thought that dogs inherently, you need to like, you need to be punitive\n\n09:28.820 --> 09:29.820\nat some point.\n\n09:29.820 --> 09:30.820\nNo praise, no.\n\n09:30.820 --> 09:35.280\nNo, no, no praise. Oh, always lots of praise for the things that you want them to do. But\n\n09:35.280 --> 09:41.520\nthen no, but no, if they take a shit in the middle of the constitution, like, like, while\n\n09:41.520 --> 09:46.920\nyou're signing it, you don't sign a constitution probably. But if they take a shit on your\n\n09:46.920 --> 09:51.560\nPersian rug, you don't, you know, the old school way is like, you come down, you see\n\n09:51.560 --> 09:57.000\nthe shit. And at the very least, you go like, hey, bad, and hope that they pick up on it\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.440\nat the worst you rub the face and blah, blah, blah. It just doesn't, it doesn't work. It's\n\n10:01.440 --> 10:05.520\na, it doesn't, the dog doesn't know, the dog doesn't, it doesn't, you can, you can make\n\n10:05.520 --> 10:11.040\na dog negatively associate negative behaviors with negative consequences, but, but kind of,\n\n10:11.040 --> 10:14.720\nbut overall what you're actually doing is making the dog associate you with negative\n\n10:14.720 --> 10:15.720\nconsequences.\n\n10:15.720 --> 10:19.960\nNot, you're not, you're just making the dog nervous. You're, it's kind of like, the last\n\n10:19.960 --> 10:24.760\ntime I did anything I wanted, I kind of, I got hit in the nose with a newspaper. I guess\n\n10:24.760 --> 10:29.800\nI'll kind of generally stick to what I know to be safe behaviors. So it's a, it's a kind\n\n10:29.800 --> 10:31.600\nof, it's rabbit hunting with an elephant.\n\n10:31.600 --> 10:35.720\nWell, so you've never told your dog, no. So your dog thinks everything is a possibility.\n\n10:35.720 --> 10:40.600\nSo it starts looking a cat's asshole. And the cat says, no, after it, let's, let's it\n\n10:40.600 --> 10:44.160\nlick her butt and then hisses at it and he's getting negative.\n\n10:44.160 --> 10:49.760\nYeah. Well, the cat isn't bound by our rules and just definitely using Caesar Milan techniques\n\n10:49.760 --> 10:50.760\non the dog.\n\n10:50.760 --> 10:52.360\nSo he's all fucked up now. He doesn't know what's going on.\n\n10:52.360 --> 10:57.960\nNo, you see, he's just, the cat's got a, the dog better trained than us. I don't know what\n\n10:57.960 --> 10:58.960\nyou're trying to point out.\n\n10:58.960 --> 11:02.440\nI'm just trying to figure out, we were trying to like figure out Harvey's state of mind\n\n11:02.440 --> 11:03.440\nright now.\n\n11:03.440 --> 11:06.720\nIt's a cat. I mean, if the dog went up to a door and the door closed on its face, it\n\n11:06.720 --> 11:10.040\nwouldn't, it's the, the door, the door, it's a cat.\n\n11:10.040 --> 11:13.880\nDo you think that Harvey will, Harvey has learned his lesson to not lick Fib's ass anymore?\n\n11:13.880 --> 11:15.680\nOr do you think he's going to go back to that well?\n\n11:15.680 --> 11:19.560\nThat I don't know. I mean, she, she let him lick her ass.\n\n11:19.560 --> 11:20.560\nRight.\n\n11:20.560 --> 11:21.560\nFor 30 seconds.\n\n11:21.560 --> 11:23.560\n30 seconds is a good long time.\n\n11:23.560 --> 11:28.760\nThe new school of dog training suggests that over time he will become an ass-licking cat.\n\n11:28.760 --> 11:31.640\nThat he will, he will only lick her ass.\n\n11:31.640 --> 11:36.840\nShe may have nailed it. Like, like she, she, she, he won't go near her unless she offers\n\n11:36.840 --> 11:41.560\nher asshole and he'll just lick it and then he won't, but he won't ever do anything else\n\n11:41.560 --> 11:42.560\nwith her.\n\n11:42.560 --> 11:43.560\nI hope that's the case.\n\n11:43.560 --> 11:46.720\nIt'll be interesting. All right. We've talked too long about this.\n\n11:46.720 --> 11:47.720\nOr not long enough.\n\n11:47.720 --> 11:52.400\nLet's, let's, let's, let's, I just want to bring up Kumail. He makes me comfortable.\n\n11:52.400 --> 11:53.400\nLet's bring up Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n11:53.400 --> 11:54.400\nHe may be in the bathroom.\n\n11:54.400 --> 11:55.400\nHe's right here.\n\n11:55.400 --> 11:56.400\nHey, guys.\n\n11:56.400 --> 12:09.280\nThat is one of the nicest intros I've ever gotten, sincerely.\n\n12:09.280 --> 12:15.760\nYeah. I just, yeah. I just, you've become the edge of my pool. I just grab it instinctively\n\n12:15.760 --> 12:17.840\nwhen I'm either scared or lazy.\n\n12:17.840 --> 12:23.720\nWe, so the cat and the dog didn't like each other in the beginning and now they're, they're\n\n12:23.720 --> 12:24.720\nbetter.\n\n12:24.720 --> 12:31.600\nI don't, I, I don't have an answer to that question. The dog licks the cat's asshole,\n\n12:31.600 --> 12:33.320\nbut the cat still doesn't like the dog.\n\n12:33.320 --> 12:39.560\nThe dog has always licked the cat. The dog expresses, the dog expresses all desire through\n\n12:39.560 --> 12:45.880\nbarking. Like if you, when the cat, it follows the cat, the cat doesn't want to associate\n\n12:45.880 --> 12:51.120\nwith the dog. We have a network of baby gates with the one slap taken out. So the cat has\n\n12:51.120 --> 12:56.800\nmore wizard, wizardly access to the whole house. It's never more than five feet away\n\n12:56.800 --> 12:57.800\nfrom safety.\n\n12:57.800 --> 13:01.720\nWhereas the dog has, it's like a ladybug, that video game from the 80s. Like there's\n\n13:01.720 --> 13:03.720\njust a lot of gates.\n\n13:03.720 --> 13:08.280\nWoo! I've never heard of this video game.\n\n13:08.280 --> 13:11.400\nWell, why don't you guys all marry life if you're so young?\n\n13:11.400 --> 13:18.680\nI think we do. We're marrying life, right, young people?\n\n13:18.680 --> 13:23.240\nI don't, I don't think it's an age thing. You could have referenced equally old video\n\n13:23.240 --> 13:26.120\ngames, but maybe a little more popular one than ladybugs.\n\n13:26.120 --> 13:29.960\nBut he's like ladybug. He like, it was a very limited movement.\n\n13:29.960 --> 13:32.160\nOh, don't patronize me.\n\n13:32.160 --> 13:38.280\nSo he's like this ladybug that you speak of.\n\n13:38.280 --> 13:43.200\nYou know the character's name isn't ladybug. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's Barbara, Barbara,\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:44.200\nBarbara.\n\n13:44.200 --> 13:45.200\nWe had, ah.\n\n13:45.200 --> 13:49.000\nI can't, I can't riff a name.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nYou really can't.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nNo.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nBarbara.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nBarbara. Okay.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.280\nWe have this cat and she's, ah, what happened was the people who lived in our house when\n\n13:56.280 --> 13:59.840\nwe moved in, she had two cats and when she moved, she just left the cats outside and\n\n13:59.840 --> 14:01.480\njust moved away.\n\n14:01.480 --> 14:06.680\nSo which is, yeah, horrifying. So these two, one of the cats went feral like immediately.\n\n14:06.680 --> 14:10.840\nThe other cat was just hanging out like really sweet, like always like looking at us like,\n\n14:10.840 --> 14:16.320\nhey guys, how's it going? We were feeding it, but our neighborhood has coyotes. So every\n\n14:16.320 --> 14:20.640\nnight it had to like battle giant werewolves basically.\n\n14:20.640 --> 14:24.160\nAnd every morning it would be like, good food. Do you have any guns or anything?\n\n14:24.160 --> 14:29.280\nBut you could see it getting more desperate. So we took it to the vet, got it all checked\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:34.520\nout. The sweetest cat we named him Wallace and we, and we, our own existing cat is bagel,\n\n14:34.520 --> 14:36.920\nlike really sweet, unaggressive bagel, right?\n\n14:36.920 --> 14:37.920\nOh adorable.\n\n14:37.920 --> 14:41.800\nAnd we brought him home. Is it because when he sleeps, he looks like a little bagel?\n\n14:41.800 --> 14:46.880\nNo, I just always wanted a cat named bagel and I was like, it's not even the right color\n\n14:46.880 --> 14:55.120\nor anything. It's not Jewish or anything. It is from Brooklyn though. So not Williamsburg.\n\n14:55.120 --> 14:56.120\nAnyways.\n\n14:56.120 --> 15:01.440\nSo, but bagels like totally switched. Like she turned into a different, it was weird.\n\n15:01.440 --> 15:06.280\nLike part of her like saber tooth brain, like evolution. It's like something changed and\n\n15:06.280 --> 15:10.880\nshe like totally turned into a different, like she would walk different, super mean\n\n15:10.880 --> 15:17.720\nto this cat. We would see like the bagel would just stare down Wallace so, so long that bagel\n\n15:17.720 --> 15:21.440\nwould start falling asleep and then like wake up and be like, what am I doing? Oh right,\n\n15:21.440 --> 15:24.440\nfuck this guy.\n\n15:24.440 --> 15:28.720\nFor like a week, just like staring at him and Wallace would just sort of annoyed because\n\n15:28.720 --> 15:30.920\nhe's been battling werewolves, you know,\n\n15:30.920 --> 15:37.920\nHe's from the streets. Yeah, he's from the streets. He's here that Eugene Levy of Cats is saying get away, brother.\n\n15:37.920 --> 15:46.720\nExactly. That's exactly right. This, is this better? Okay, that one felt weird. But Wallace\n\n15:46.720 --> 15:48.120\nis just looking at us like.\n\n15:48.120 --> 15:53.160\nNo, no. I had that one turned down because it seemed so loud. And then you picked up\n\n15:53.160 --> 15:54.160\nthat one.\n\n15:54.160 --> 15:55.160\nAlright.\n\n15:55.160 --> 16:00.360\nMaybe, and then I just thought to myself, I think you have a more resonant voice than\n\n16:00.360 --> 16:01.800\nthe rest of us. You have a very,\n\n16:01.800 --> 16:03.800\nI'm just loud, you're saying?\n\n16:03.800 --> 16:08.120\nNo, you have a very professional Cedar voice. You project more.\n\n16:08.120 --> 16:09.120\nOkay.\n\n16:09.120 --> 16:12.120\nThat's a really racist stereotype.\n\n16:12.120 --> 16:18.120\nOh yeah? What do we usually scream, Jeff?\n\n16:18.120 --> 16:21.120\nFuck.\n\n16:21.120 --> 16:28.120\nHe eyes up, brothers, anybody? Now, nobody looks like they are on my side.\n\n16:28.120 --> 16:29.120\nYou do?\n\n16:29.120 --> 16:31.120\nNo, not at all.\n\n16:31.120 --> 16:33.120\nI look, but I'm not.\n\n16:33.120 --> 16:35.120\nHe can pass. He can infiltrate.\n\n16:35.120 --> 16:36.120\nWhat nationality are you?\n\n16:36.120 --> 16:39.120\nI'm Mexican, but I still get checked at the airport.\n\n16:39.120 --> 16:41.120\nYou're Mexican, but you still get checked at the airport?\n\n16:41.120 --> 16:42.120\nYeah.\n\n16:42.120 --> 16:43.120\nThat's a bummer.\n\n16:43.120 --> 16:47.120\nWait, it's a bummer even if I get checked at the airport?\n\n16:47.120 --> 16:58.120\nNo, but it's a bummer. I mean, if you, it's a, I think, look, is it?\n\n16:58.120 --> 17:01.120\nThis is a double bummer because he gets checked at the border too.\n\n17:01.120 --> 17:04.120\nHey man, bummers are bummers.\n\n17:04.120 --> 17:08.120\nInfinity times two is still infinity. It's still a bummer.\n\n17:08.120 --> 17:12.120\nWell, I guess that's sort of a crass way of putting it, but I wasn't thinking like,\n\n17:12.120 --> 17:16.120\noh, he gets checked twice as much, but I was thinking as a white person, I was like,\n\n17:16.120 --> 17:21.120\noh man, you get the harassment, which is kind of a, I think, I think, I think I fantasize\n\n17:21.120 --> 17:27.120\nabout being, you know, because, you know, that's the one thing that white people don't get to have is...\n\n17:27.120 --> 17:28.120\nRacism?\n\n17:28.120 --> 17:30.120\nRacist it at?\n\n17:30.120 --> 17:36.120\nIs the fantasy of being locked out, of like waking up in the morning and being like,\n\n17:36.120 --> 17:38.120\nman, fucking, fuck this shit.\n\n17:38.120 --> 17:42.120\nSo the one thing white people don't have is not having privilege?\n\n17:42.120 --> 17:44.120\nExactly, yes.\n\n17:44.120 --> 17:45.120\nYes.\n\n17:45.120 --> 17:49.120\nYou know what? As far as sacrifices go...\n\n17:49.120 --> 17:50.120\nCamille, Camille.\n\n17:50.120 --> 17:52.120\nI'm aware that I'm being glib.\n\n17:52.120 --> 17:54.120\nI'm making the same joke. I'm just saying.\n\n17:54.120 --> 17:59.120\nI know I'm one with that. You have no idea how good you have it.\n\n17:59.120 --> 18:02.120\nWell, it's like that old joke, like there's like a camera.\n\n18:02.120 --> 18:08.120\nOh, you beat me. You've taught me humility. Now I have everything.\n\n18:08.120 --> 18:17.120\nLike the idea of like getting to be like really hardcore Irish or really like hardcore anything.\n\n18:17.120 --> 18:18.120\nIt's true.\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:19.120\nYou would want that?\n\n18:19.120 --> 18:27.120\nThat's what I'm saying is, if you get to be something, anything other than just this vanilla like meringue,\n\n18:27.120 --> 18:33.120\nif you get to be something, then there's the price, which is like harassment, prejudice and all this stuff.\n\n18:33.120 --> 18:37.120\nBut at least you have, but then there's the upside, which is like identity.\n\n18:37.120 --> 18:42.120\nAnd this poor guy, they're stopping up at the airport and going, hey, over here, Punjab.\n\n18:42.120 --> 18:51.120\nAnd he's like, wait, I'm, I'm not Punjab. I'm not, I don't have a, I'm not, I'm not even allowed to be offended in a specific way.\n\n18:51.120 --> 18:53.120\nI'm just being inconvenienced.\n\n18:53.120 --> 18:54.120\nWhat is your name?\n\n18:54.120 --> 18:55.120\nAmadeez.\n\n18:55.120 --> 18:56.120\nIt sounds weird.\n\n18:56.120 --> 18:57.120\nAmadeez?\n\n18:57.120 --> 18:58.120\nClose enough.\n\n18:58.120 --> 18:59.120\nClose enough.\n\n18:59.120 --> 19:01.120\nMight as well be Punjab.\n\n19:01.120 --> 19:05.120\nAmadeez is pretty racially nonspecific.\n\n19:05.120 --> 19:06.120\nIt's ambiguous.\n\n19:06.120 --> 19:07.120\nYeah.\n\n19:07.120 --> 19:08.120\nThat could be anything.\n\n19:08.120 --> 19:12.120\nI, I get what you're saying, because sometimes if something shitty happens to me, I'm like, oh, this guy's racist.\n\n19:12.120 --> 19:14.120\nBut to you, it's like, oh, he just hates you.\n\n19:14.120 --> 19:16.120\nYou're just...\n\n19:16.120 --> 19:18.120\nDan, is that what I'm saying?\n\n19:18.120 --> 19:19.120\nI don't think...\n\n19:19.120 --> 19:29.120\nWhat I'm saying is that, is that when the downside is being on the barrel end of racism, the upside is being in an exclusive, exclusive club.\n\n19:29.120 --> 19:31.120\nYou get to be like something.\n\n19:31.120 --> 19:32.120\nYeah, I understand.\n\n19:32.120 --> 19:33.120\nThat makes sense.\n\n19:33.120 --> 19:37.120\nAnd so it would be a bummer to be mistaken for something and it'd be like, whoa.\n\n19:37.120 --> 19:41.120\nBut it sounds like it's more for you like a kind of a persecution complex.\n\n19:41.120 --> 19:43.120\nLike you're kind of Christ, you know.\n\n19:43.120 --> 19:44.120\nYeah, I like that.\n\n19:44.120 --> 19:49.120\nYeah, that's what appeals to me about racism is the idea of being a minority.\n\n19:49.120 --> 19:51.120\nThat would be the thing that I would be into.\n\n19:51.120 --> 19:56.120\nI would be, if I was, if I was not white, you better believe I'd make a fucking meal out of it.\n\n19:56.120 --> 19:57.120\nYeah.\n\n19:57.120 --> 20:06.120\nBecause I, because I, look at me, I am a fat white rich guy and I'm constantly raving about how I'm unappreciated and I'm a genius and no one knows it and all this shit.\n\n20:06.120 --> 20:08.120\nWould you be a Black Panther or an activist?\n\n20:08.120 --> 20:13.120\nI imagine I would push whatever envelope you could while still being a coward.\n\n20:13.120 --> 20:15.120\nI don't think I'd do anything cool.\n\n20:15.120 --> 20:17.120\nI think I just bitch a lot.\n\n20:17.120 --> 20:21.120\nI'd probably have a really cloying blog.\n\n20:21.120 --> 20:24.120\nToday I was at the bank and they said, can I help you?\n\n20:24.120 --> 20:27.120\nWhat do you mean, can you help me?\n\n20:27.120 --> 20:29.120\nLike I need help?\n\n20:29.120 --> 20:30.120\nI don't know.\n\n20:30.120 --> 20:31.120\nThey're right, definitely.\n\n20:31.120 --> 20:34.120\nIt sounds like you'd be a terrorist.\n\n20:34.120 --> 20:40.120\nIt sounds like you'd have a lot of problems with the man and you'd want to tear them down and make them feel kind of punished them.\n\n20:40.120 --> 20:43.120\nNo, but he doesn't have, wouldn't have the courage to like actually be a terrorist.\n\n20:43.120 --> 20:47.120\nHe just like sort of have their back, whatever that means.\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:50.120\nSome of you are trying to trick me into saying I'd be a terrorist.\n\n20:50.120 --> 20:53.120\nOthers of you are saying it takes courage to be a terrorist.\n\n20:53.120 --> 20:56.120\nI'm stepping off of all of this.\n\n20:56.120 --> 20:57.120\nHey man.\n\n20:57.120 --> 20:59.120\nI'm just saying you don't have to walk.\n\n20:59.120 --> 21:03.120\nYou don't have to be non-white to be a terrorist.\n\n21:03.120 --> 21:07.120\nWell, let's talk about this. Let's plan this out.\n\n21:07.120 --> 21:11.120\nWhat would we do, Jeff?\n\n21:11.120 --> 21:16.120\nFirst I'd say let's hit pause on our podcast.\n\n21:16.120 --> 21:18.120\nLet's come up with a logo.\n\n21:18.120 --> 21:24.120\nAnd then I would lower the screen and I would show you a 15-minute slideshow about some ideas that I have.\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:29.120\nI'll say I'm special guest Aziz Ansari.\n\n21:29.120 --> 21:30.120\nWe'll continue with the show.\n\n21:30.120 --> 21:33.120\nWe do a slightly related segue.\n\n21:33.120 --> 21:38.120\nI have been thinking lately that it's time to get back to getting to the moon.\n\n21:38.120 --> 21:40.120\nI think we need to make that a new objective.\n\n21:40.120 --> 21:43.120\nYou mean our quickly bailed on premise that we had three years ago?\n\n21:43.120 --> 21:47.120\nYeah, but it was a passionate one. It was about alienation, like getting the fuck out of here.\n\n21:47.120 --> 21:49.120\nJust, I'm getting that feeling again.\n\n21:49.120 --> 21:53.120\nLet's get the fuck out of here, man. Everyone's dumb.\n\n21:53.120 --> 21:55.120\nLet's go.\n\n21:55.120 --> 21:59.120\nThat's a great response. Everyone's dumb.\n\n21:59.120 --> 22:02.120\nHe's got his SAT score on a headband.\n\n22:02.120 --> 22:05.120\nThe smartest guy in the world.\n\n22:05.120 --> 22:11.120\nMan, I've been totally waiting for someone to say that, man.\n\n22:11.120 --> 22:14.120\nI expected a bigger response from this lot.\n\n22:14.120 --> 22:18.120\nI think most people are politely nodding.\n\n22:18.120 --> 22:20.120\nYes, don't tell them, Mayor Harmon.\n\n22:20.120 --> 22:26.120\nLots of monocles are falling out of people's eyes.\n\n22:26.120 --> 22:32.120\nBut yeah, I want to get up there and pitch a geodesic dome with a cooler of beer and just be left alone.\n\n22:32.120 --> 22:35.120\nHow many people were you initially talking about bringing up there?\n\n22:35.120 --> 22:41.120\nWell, it should be a mythical number, right? So either 12 or 666, I don't know.\n\n22:41.120 --> 22:45.120\nIs pitching a geodesic dome the moon version of pitching a tent?\n\n22:45.120 --> 22:46.120\nYeah.\n\n22:46.120 --> 22:47.120\nBut not getting a boner.\n\n22:47.120 --> 22:48.120\nOkay.\n\n22:48.120 --> 22:53.120\nYour bone won't be shaped like a crystal with multifaceted sides to it.\n\n22:53.120 --> 22:55.120\nYeah, space boner.\n\n22:55.120 --> 22:58.120\n12 seems too small.\n\n22:58.120 --> 23:00.120\nI think 600 is a good number.\n\n23:00.120 --> 23:02.120\nI wonder what the ideal number would be.\n\n23:02.120 --> 23:08.120\nWell, the ideal number would be about 100 if the goal, excuse me for burping, was...\n\n23:08.120 --> 23:13.120\nI'm convinced that roughly 100 is sort of like...\n\n23:13.120 --> 23:18.120\nThe average person can keep track of 100 people.\n\n23:18.120 --> 23:22.120\nIt starts to get past 100 that things start to get statistical.\n\n23:22.120 --> 23:25.120\nYeah, to me it would be hell, the idea that you could keep track of everybody.\n\n23:25.120 --> 23:30.120\nThe idea that you knew everybody was like living in a small town that would make me feel incredibly...\n\n23:30.120 --> 23:31.120\nLook at these people.\n\n23:31.120 --> 23:32.120\nThere's about 100 of these people.\n\n23:32.120 --> 23:33.120\nI don't know these motherfuckers.\n\n23:33.120 --> 23:34.120\nYeah, but exactly.\n\n23:34.120 --> 23:36.120\nWhat if this was what we thought?\n\n23:36.120 --> 23:37.120\nYeah, but we don't live together.\n\n23:37.120 --> 23:41.120\nIf we all lived on a colony on the moon, we would all know each other.\n\n23:41.120 --> 23:45.120\nThen it would take years, you would slowly get to know them.\n\n23:45.120 --> 23:51.120\nYou would go through rotations and go like, hey, Ben, what are you doing for dinner tonight?\n\n23:51.120 --> 23:52.120\nI don't know, 100 people.\n\n23:52.120 --> 23:57.120\nNo, you go to the moon and go, hey, there's a big party on Friday night and that would happen every Friday night.\n\n23:57.120 --> 23:58.120\nYou'd meet everybody every week.\n\n23:58.120 --> 23:59.120\n100 people you'd get to know.\n\n23:59.120 --> 24:01.120\nBut the parties would be, therefore, more meaningful.\n\n24:01.120 --> 24:04.120\nThey wouldn't just default to this weird networking thing.\n\n24:04.120 --> 24:06.120\nBut you're not going to like 100 people out of that 100.\n\n24:06.120 --> 24:07.120\nYou're going to like four.\n\n24:07.120 --> 24:08.120\nNot 100.\n\n24:08.120 --> 24:09.120\nYeah, at a time.\n\n24:09.120 --> 24:12.120\nAnd then you get sick of those four and you move over to four otherwise.\n\n24:12.120 --> 24:14.120\nBut they're still going to be there.\n\n24:14.120 --> 24:17.120\nYou're gradually going to get sick of everybody but four people.\n\n24:17.120 --> 24:22.120\nIn 18 years, at which point, there's all these new people you made.\n\n24:22.120 --> 24:23.120\nBut they're my kids.\n\n24:23.120 --> 24:24.120\nNo, they're 18.\n\n24:24.120 --> 24:25.120\nThere are other people's kids too.\n\n24:25.120 --> 24:27.120\nBut they're the kids of the people I don't like.\n\n24:27.120 --> 24:29.120\nIt's a new generation.\n\n24:29.120 --> 24:30.120\nThey were bellicose.\n\n24:30.120 --> 24:31.120\nThey're parents.\n\n24:31.120 --> 24:32.120\nThey hate their parents.\n\n24:32.120 --> 24:33.120\nPeople I don't like.\n\n24:33.120 --> 24:35.120\nI don't like their kids either.\n\n24:35.120 --> 24:36.120\nNo, come on.\n\n24:36.120 --> 24:41.120\nLook, some of their, you would, Jeff, stop it.\n\n24:41.120 --> 24:44.120\nWe know what you're doing and we don't like it.\n\n24:44.120 --> 24:47.120\nI'm saying 100 people is not a lot of people.\n\n24:47.120 --> 24:50.120\nIt's just not enough for you because you're a sponge.\n\n24:50.120 --> 24:52.120\nYou would never get enough.\n\n24:52.120 --> 24:56.120\n100 people, you'd be like, so there's a cap on the amount of love I can get?\n\n24:56.120 --> 24:59.120\nYou would be like, I'm dying in a coffin.\n\n24:59.120 --> 25:01.120\nI would be like, finally controlled.\n\n25:01.120 --> 25:03.120\nIt's not about receiving love.\n\n25:03.120 --> 25:05.120\nIt's about variety.\n\n25:05.120 --> 25:08.120\nI couldn't live in a very, very small town.\n\n25:08.120 --> 25:09.120\nVariety?\n\n25:09.120 --> 25:11.120\nYou go to the same bar every day.\n\n25:11.120 --> 25:14.120\nI don't mean that in a bad way, but I mean like we have our parents.\n\n25:14.120 --> 25:19.120\nNo, I don't go, but also, it's not the same people that go in every time.\n\n25:19.120 --> 25:21.120\nIt's a new cast of characters that come and go.\n\n25:21.120 --> 25:22.120\nIs it?\n\n25:22.120 --> 25:23.120\nYeah.\n\n25:23.120 --> 25:24.120\nOkay.\n\n25:24.120 --> 25:25.120\nIs it?\n\n25:25.120 --> 25:26.120\nNot really.\n\n25:26.120 --> 25:28.120\nI see the same fucking people.\n\n25:28.120 --> 25:32.120\nEvery three days, some guy wonders through and goes, hey, what's with the suit?\n\n25:32.120 --> 25:34.120\nThat wouldn't happen on the moon.\n\n25:34.120 --> 25:35.120\nThat's what you're worried about.\n\n25:35.120 --> 25:38.120\nNo, I would love, that would be good.\n\n25:38.120 --> 25:40.120\nI love the idea that people, because now people-\n\n25:40.120 --> 25:42.120\nPeople have now stopped asking me about the suit.\n\n25:42.120 --> 25:45.120\nNow if I show up not in a suit, people go, hey man, is everything good?\n\n25:45.120 --> 25:46.120\nThat's true.\n\n25:46.120 --> 25:47.120\nWhenever you show up-\n\n25:47.120 --> 25:48.120\nWere you at a funeral?\n\n25:48.120 --> 25:52.120\nPeople are concerned like, hey man, do you get out of jail?\n\n25:52.120 --> 25:53.120\nWhat's going on here?\n\n25:53.120 --> 25:57.120\nWhat do you say when people say what's with the suit?\n\n25:57.120 --> 25:59.120\nIt depends on who says it.\n\n25:59.120 --> 26:03.120\nWhen I first started wearing suits a lot, you would get like-\n\n26:03.120 --> 26:06.120\nI feel like we've talked about this in the show before.\n\n26:06.120 --> 26:10.120\nIf you have, then we don't have to talk about it.\n\n26:10.120 --> 26:12.120\nGenerally it happens at a urinal, which I'm not a big fan of urinal chit chat.\n\n26:12.120 --> 26:13.120\nNo, I'm not here to make friends.\n\n26:13.120 --> 26:14.120\nYeah, exactly.\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:15.120\nThere's not an-\n\n26:15.120 --> 26:17.120\nI don't want to make a connection here.\n\n26:17.120 --> 26:22.120\nSome guy is peeing next to you and goes, hey, suit guy!\n\n26:22.120 --> 26:23.120\nIt's like that.\n\n26:23.120 --> 26:24.120\nHey man!\n\n26:24.120 --> 26:26.120\nI told dad this one.\n\n26:26.120 --> 26:27.120\nThat was a good one.\n\n26:27.120 --> 26:28.120\nWas it the Viper in the long time ago?\n\n26:28.120 --> 26:29.120\nVery long time ago.\n\n26:29.120 --> 26:30.120\nWhen I first- I had one suit.\n\n26:30.120 --> 26:32.120\nOne $30 vintage suit that I wore to death.\n\n26:32.120 --> 26:33.120\nHe was there with River Phoenix.\n\n26:33.120 --> 26:35.120\nThat's how long ago it was.\n\n26:35.120 --> 26:38.120\nNo, it was just around the same time.\n\n26:38.120 --> 26:41.120\nBut I was in the bathroom and he goes, hey, suit guy!\n\n26:41.120 --> 26:42.120\nI was like, hey, how's it going?\n\n26:42.120 --> 26:45.120\nI said, do we- you know, our dicks are in hand.\n\n26:45.120 --> 26:47.120\nAnd I said, I'm sorry, do we know each other?\n\n26:47.120 --> 26:49.120\nHe's like, no man, but you always wear a suit.\n\n26:49.120 --> 26:53.120\nYou always wear the same outfit, but you get some mad puss.\n\n26:53.120 --> 26:56.120\nAnd I was like, I just kind of frowned.\n\n26:56.120 --> 26:59.120\nAnd he goes, hey man, I'm not trying to hate, I'm trying to celebrate.\n\n26:59.120 --> 27:03.120\nBy the way, and I actually said, I went, pine cone.\n\n27:03.120 --> 27:05.120\nAnd he goes, what? I go, I don't know.\n\n27:05.120 --> 27:08.120\nI just thought if I'd say something, you'd rhyme it.\n\n27:08.120 --> 27:11.120\nBut like, you get like- sometimes guys would go like,\n\n27:11.120 --> 27:13.120\nhey man, how come you always wear a suit?\n\n27:13.120 --> 27:15.120\nAnd I go, how come you never do?\n\n27:15.120 --> 27:19.120\nAnd they go, yeah.\n\n27:19.120 --> 27:21.120\nThat's like that Donnie Darko line where they're like,\n\n27:21.120 --> 27:23.120\nwhy are you wearing a stupid rabbit suit?\n\n27:23.120 --> 27:25.120\nWhy are you wearing that stupid human suit?\n\n27:25.120 --> 27:26.120\nThat's sort of like that.\n\n27:26.120 --> 27:28.120\nWow, Donnie Darko, what a movie.\n\n27:28.120 --> 27:30.120\nThat movie fucking stinks.\n\n27:30.120 --> 27:31.120\nStinks.\n\n27:31.120 --> 27:33.120\nSome people don't like it, right?\n\n27:33.120 --> 27:34.120\nSome people don't like it.\n\n27:34.120 --> 27:36.120\nBut more people like it.\n\n27:36.120 --> 27:38.120\nI think people don't like it.\n\n27:38.120 --> 27:42.120\nAnatoly likes it.\n\n27:42.120 --> 27:46.120\nAnatoly has the luxury of having English as a second language though.\n\n27:46.120 --> 27:48.120\nThat's like airbrushing everything.\n\n27:48.120 --> 27:51.120\nIt's like putting pantyhose over a shitty movie.\n\n27:51.120 --> 27:56.120\nI'm sure like the subtleties of something's shittiness can like-\n\n27:56.120 --> 27:58.120\nIsn't that movie good? I don't know.\n\n27:58.120 --> 28:01.120\nI think it's like-\n\n28:01.120 --> 28:03.120\nIt's a wonderful life, but backwards.\n\n28:03.120 --> 28:06.120\nIt's a wonderful life, but backwards?\n\n28:06.120 --> 28:09.120\nYeah, it's about how he shouldn't be alive.\n\n28:09.120 --> 28:14.120\nWell, but it's also backwards in the sense that it's a wonderful life is good.\n\n28:14.120 --> 28:17.120\nSo they nailed it.\n\n28:17.120 --> 28:19.120\nThey made a shitty version of a backwards premise.\n\n28:19.120 --> 28:21.120\nIt's like there's these movies that came out that were huge\n\n28:21.120 --> 28:25.120\nand now everybody's decided like, we hate them like that in Garden State.\n\n28:25.120 --> 28:29.120\nEveryone liked it when it first came out and now everyone hates those movies.\n\n28:29.120 --> 28:31.120\nNo, I hated it when it came out.\n\n28:31.120 --> 28:32.120\nThis guy hated it.\n\n28:32.120 --> 28:35.120\nHe hated it when it came out. Everyone says that.\n\n28:38.120 --> 28:40.120\nIt's like in prison everyone says they're innocent.\n\n28:40.120 --> 28:41.120\nYeah.\n\n28:41.120 --> 28:44.120\nI just think that you become a curmudgeon as you get older\n\n28:44.120 --> 28:49.120\nbecause you basically like you just don't bother to go through the phase.\n\n28:49.120 --> 28:54.120\nYou know, but like the younger you are, let's face it.\n\n28:54.120 --> 28:58.120\nI like a lot of movies from when I was like 18 that are just like, they're not going to hold up.\n\n28:58.120 --> 29:01.120\nIf I show people go like, no, this is the best movie.\n\n29:01.120 --> 29:03.120\nIt's like, watch Midnight Run. It's the best.\n\n29:03.120 --> 29:07.120\nLike someone's going to have a right to go, Midnight Run is not that good.\n\n29:07.120 --> 29:09.120\nStop jacking off on it.\n\n29:09.120 --> 29:14.120\nLike, no, but I still agree that Midnight Run is an amazing movie,\n\n29:14.120 --> 29:19.120\nbut I still think it's equally true if somebody were to watch it and go like, this is a piece of shit.\n\n29:19.120 --> 29:22.120\nYou were 18 when you saw this and it was meaningful to you\n\n29:22.120 --> 29:25.120\nand you can't escape those like neural pathways that you created when you saw it.\n\n29:25.120 --> 29:27.120\nWe talked about this with Goonies.\n\n29:27.120 --> 29:28.120\nLabyrinth.\n\n29:28.120 --> 29:30.120\nLabyrinth and yeah, people came up.\n\n29:30.120 --> 29:32.120\nThere was a girl that came up that felt that way about Space Jam\n\n29:32.120 --> 29:33.120\nand she's not a bad person.\n\n29:33.120 --> 29:35.120\nShe's not a...\n\n29:35.120 --> 29:37.120\nBut she made no case for it.\n\n29:37.120 --> 29:39.120\nWell, there's no case for it.\n\n29:39.120 --> 29:40.120\nThat's the point.\n\n29:40.120 --> 29:42.120\nThere is no way to prove that Space Jam's a good or bad movie.\n\n29:42.120 --> 29:44.120\nWell, yes there is.\n\n29:46.120 --> 29:49.120\nShe made no case for not being a good bad person.\n\n29:49.120 --> 29:52.120\nOh, okay.\n\n29:52.120 --> 29:53.120\nIs she here?\n\n29:53.120 --> 29:55.120\nShe's a bad person.\n\n29:55.120 --> 29:57.120\nShe's like Typhoid Mary.\n\n29:57.120 --> 29:59.120\nShe just wanted to suggest Space Jam was good.\n\n29:59.120 --> 30:01.120\nShe's out of the next city.\n\n30:03.120 --> 30:06.120\nShe's in Idaho right now and an open mic.\n\n30:06.120 --> 30:08.120\nSpace Jam, right guys?\n\n30:08.120 --> 30:10.120\nGive it another shot.\n\n30:10.120 --> 30:14.120\nI don't like Led Zeppelin, but I will defend Neil Diamond.\n\n30:14.120 --> 30:16.120\nThat doesn't make me right.\n\n30:16.120 --> 30:18.120\nIt makes me weird.\n\n30:18.120 --> 30:20.120\nIt makes you you, huh?\n\n30:20.120 --> 30:21.120\nYeah, it does.\n\n30:21.120 --> 30:23.120\nSo, curmudgeonry, if that's a word,\n\n30:23.120 --> 30:27.120\nis the phenomenon of getting older and older and older\n\n30:27.120 --> 30:33.120\nand not even bothering with the period between\n\n30:33.120 --> 30:37.120\nseeing something and realizing that it's probably\n\n30:37.120 --> 30:40.120\nlike good or not good or whatever.\n\n30:40.120 --> 30:42.120\nLike not going through the part where you're like,\n\n30:42.120 --> 30:43.120\nwhoa!\n\n30:43.120 --> 30:46.120\nYou just go like, I'm not falling for that.\n\n30:46.120 --> 30:48.120\nYou see a Spider-Man, Bill Burton.\n\n30:48.120 --> 30:50.120\nYou're just like, that's dumb.\n\n30:50.120 --> 30:52.120\nI've seen eight Spider-Man movies.\n\n30:52.120 --> 30:54.120\nAnd then some 18-year-old guy is like, you know what?\n\n30:54.120 --> 30:56.120\nThere's no drug like being 18.\n\n30:56.120 --> 30:58.120\nWe can't remember what it's like.\n\n30:58.120 --> 31:00.120\nYour fucking brain is on fire.\n\n31:00.120 --> 31:02.120\nYour dick's like a blackened Decker.\n\n31:02.120 --> 31:04.120\nIt's just like your blood is different.\n\n31:04.120 --> 31:06.120\nYour blood is literally different\n\n31:06.120 --> 31:08.120\nand every chemical in it is different.\n\n31:08.120 --> 31:11.120\nAnd we take substances to alter our state,\n\n31:11.120 --> 31:14.120\nbut we've failed to recognize that when you're 18,\n\n31:14.120 --> 31:16.120\nyou are a different species.\n\n31:16.120 --> 31:18.120\nAnd you see a Spider-Man, Bill Burton,\n\n31:18.120 --> 31:21.120\nand you combine that hormonal energy\n\n31:21.120 --> 31:23.120\nwith the fact that you haven't been around long enough\n\n31:23.120 --> 31:26.120\nto not trust a movie.\n\n31:26.120 --> 31:30.120\nAnd you're just like, fucking Spider-Man 4 was awesome.\n\n31:30.120 --> 31:32.120\nAnd then some 40-year-old guy goes, you fucking dick,\n\n31:32.120 --> 31:33.120\nget out of here.\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:34.120\nFuck you.\n\n31:34.120 --> 31:35.120\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n31:35.120 --> 31:37.120\nYou fucking piece of shit.\n\n31:37.120 --> 31:38.120\nWhoa, what's with the fossil?\n\n31:38.120 --> 31:40.120\nHe's bummed out.\n\n31:40.120 --> 31:42.120\nIt's like...\n\n31:43.120 --> 31:45.120\nCremuginary is abused hope.\n\n31:45.120 --> 31:46.120\nIt's disappointment.\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:48.120\nYeah, you have a higher standard\n\n31:48.120 --> 31:51.120\nfor the flavors you've tasted.\n\n31:51.120 --> 31:53.120\nYou go like, what happened to...\n\n31:53.120 --> 31:55.120\nBut we failed to recognize it.\n\n31:55.120 --> 31:57.120\nSome of the shit, we were like,\n\n31:57.120 --> 31:58.120\noh, what happened to...\n\n31:58.120 --> 32:01.120\nWhy doesn't everything taste as good as Star Wars?\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:04.120\nYou were like 12 when you saw it.\n\n32:04.120 --> 32:08.120\nAnd also, there were no fucking...\n\n32:08.120 --> 32:10.120\nThere wasn't festivals and conventions\n\n32:10.120 --> 32:13.120\nwhere the cast of Star Wars had to show up\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:15.120\ntwo years before the movie was finished\n\n32:15.120 --> 32:17.120\nand tell 6,000 people,\n\n32:17.120 --> 32:19.120\nDarth Vader's Luke's father,\n\n32:19.120 --> 32:20.120\nwho wants to hear it?\n\n32:20.120 --> 32:21.120\nYay!\n\n32:21.120 --> 32:23.120\nOkay, we got a sneak preview for you.\n\n32:23.120 --> 32:24.120\nHere's some Ash Kins.\n\n32:24.120 --> 32:25.120\nWe got some bottle openers.\n\n32:25.120 --> 32:27.120\nGood job, good job.\n\n32:27.120 --> 32:29.120\nGo to StarWars.com.\n\n32:29.120 --> 32:30.120\nYou got your free preview.\n\n32:30.120 --> 32:31.120\nAnd all this week,\n\n32:31.120 --> 32:33.120\nwe got Star Wars Ministers coming in.\n\n32:33.120 --> 32:34.120\nEverything's just kind of...\n\n32:34.120 --> 32:35.120\nIt's not good or bad.\n\n32:35.120 --> 32:37.120\nEverything's just this big oatmeal and fucking...\n\n32:37.120 --> 32:41.120\nLike, we were 12 in a world that was like,\n\n32:41.120 --> 32:45.120\nholy shit, there's pictures moving on the screen.\n\n32:45.120 --> 32:47.120\nAnd there's no way to capture them,\n\n32:47.120 --> 32:50.120\nexcept with our hearts.\n\n32:50.120 --> 32:51.120\nI can't...\n\n32:51.120 --> 32:53.120\nThey're gone.\n\n32:53.120 --> 32:54.120\nWhat did he say?\n\n32:54.120 --> 32:56.120\nHe said he was his father?\n\n32:56.120 --> 32:58.120\nI mean, I just re-winded, I can't,\n\n32:58.120 --> 32:59.120\nand there's no word for rewinding.\n\n32:59.120 --> 33:01.120\nMy favorite toy is when I was a kid,\n\n33:01.120 --> 33:02.120\nthere was two things,\n\n33:02.120 --> 33:04.120\nLegos and Star Wars action figures.\n\n33:04.120 --> 33:05.120\nLegos were awesome,\n\n33:05.120 --> 33:07.120\nbecause, you know, they build stuff.\n\n33:07.120 --> 33:09.120\nBut I remember being four-ish,\n\n33:09.120 --> 33:10.120\nfour and a half,\n\n33:10.120 --> 33:11.120\ngoing on five,\n\n33:11.120 --> 33:13.120\nstanding in line at the Orange Cinerama Dome\n\n33:13.120 --> 33:14.120\nfor Star Wars with my family.\n\n33:14.120 --> 33:15.120\nI remember it vividly,\n\n33:15.120 --> 33:17.120\nbecause there was a bunch of dudes\n\n33:17.120 --> 33:18.120\nin white bell bottoms,\n\n33:18.120 --> 33:19.120\nbecause it was 77,\n\n33:19.120 --> 33:20.120\nand they had long hair\n\n33:20.120 --> 33:23.120\nand kind of proto-mustaches,\n\n33:23.120 --> 33:25.120\nand everybody had pickup trucks and fans\n\n33:25.120 --> 33:26.120\nwith airbrush shit on them,\n\n33:26.120 --> 33:27.120\nand there's weed everywhere.\n\n33:27.120 --> 33:29.120\nLike, you later on go,\n\n33:29.120 --> 33:30.120\nwhat's that smell?\n\n33:30.120 --> 33:32.120\nOh, that's the Star Wars parking lot smell.\n\n33:32.120 --> 33:33.120\nIt's a bunch of marijuana.\n\n33:33.120 --> 33:36.120\nWhy were there so many worse skunks in the 70s?\n\n33:36.120 --> 33:38.120\nBy the way, this sounds a lot like right now.\n\n33:38.120 --> 33:41.120\nMy father had to take me out of the theater,\n\n33:41.120 --> 33:44.120\nout of the, embarrassingly, sadly,\n\n33:44.120 --> 33:45.120\nout of the emergency,\n\n33:45.120 --> 33:46.120\none of the exits,\n\n33:46.120 --> 33:50.120\nby the stage left, screen right door,\n\n33:50.120 --> 33:51.120\nin front of everybody,\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:52.120\nbecause I started crying\n\n33:52.120 --> 33:53.120\nwhen Darth Vader came out.\n\n33:53.120 --> 33:55.120\nThat's why I love the action figures,\n\n33:55.120 --> 33:57.120\nbecause that was the most important moving in the world.\n\n33:57.120 --> 33:59.120\nThere was a big scary bad guy.\n\n33:59.120 --> 34:00.120\nThat was the greatest.\n\n34:00.120 --> 34:01.120\nSo were you training yourself\n\n34:01.120 --> 34:03.120\nwith the action figure to not be scared\n\n34:03.120 --> 34:05.120\nto go through and be able to sit through the movie again?\n\n34:05.120 --> 34:07.120\nI am bigger than you.\n\n34:09.120 --> 34:10.120\nYou're like shaming it,\n\n34:10.120 --> 34:11.120\nleaving it in the bathroom.\n\n34:11.120 --> 34:12.120\nI never thought of it like that.\n\n34:12.120 --> 34:13.120\nI never thought of it like that,\n\n34:13.120 --> 34:14.120\nbut that certainly has to be some of the fantasies\n\n34:14.120 --> 34:16.120\nthat you are Zeus,\n\n34:16.120 --> 34:17.120\nyou're controlling these things\n\n34:17.120 --> 34:19.120\nthat had power over you mythologically.\n\n34:19.120 --> 34:22.120\nI was watching the original King Kong recently,\n\n34:22.120 --> 34:24.120\nand you think of like people,\n\n34:24.120 --> 34:26.120\nlike when did that come out?\n\n34:26.120 --> 34:27.120\nI'm sure you know.\n\n34:27.120 --> 34:28.120\n33.\n\n34:28.120 --> 34:31.120\nPeople just going and seeing fucking King Kong,\n\n34:31.120 --> 34:33.120\nand it just like blowing their minds,\n\n34:33.120 --> 34:34.120\nand it sucks that we don't,\n\n34:34.120 --> 34:35.120\nlike that first movie,\n\n34:35.120 --> 34:37.120\nwhat was that train going through the tunnel?\n\n34:37.120 --> 34:38.120\nI bet people watching were like,\n\n34:38.120 --> 34:40.120\nthis will never be better than this.\n\n34:40.120 --> 34:42.120\nThis is the best movie ever.\n\n34:42.120 --> 34:44.120\nMy favorite movie was People Leaving Factory.\n\n34:44.120 --> 34:45.120\nThat was good.\n\n34:45.120 --> 34:47.120\nThe Lumiere Brothers.\n\n34:47.120 --> 34:49.120\nI mean yeah, back then they actually,\n\n34:49.120 --> 34:52.120\nlike guys had to figure out,\n\n34:52.120 --> 34:54.120\nand girls I'm sure,\n\n34:54.120 --> 34:57.120\nthat had to figure out like that concept\n\n34:57.120 --> 35:00.120\nof like cutting from one thing to another.\n\n35:00.120 --> 35:02.120\nOh yeah, there was no language for it.\n\n35:02.120 --> 35:03.120\nThe idea of like,\n\n35:03.120 --> 35:05.120\nthere was a box that captured light,\n\n35:05.120 --> 35:06.120\nand there was like,\n\n35:06.120 --> 35:08.120\noh those first movies were like,\n\n35:08.120 --> 35:12.120\ngo get that guy that does that magic trick.\n\n35:12.120 --> 35:15.120\nBecause they could only conceive\n\n35:15.120 --> 35:18.120\nof shooting something interesting\n\n35:18.120 --> 35:20.120\nthat had its own interest.\n\n35:20.120 --> 35:21.120\nLike what should we preserve,\n\n35:21.120 --> 35:23.120\nand then someone had to figure out,\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:25.120\nwait, the camera,\n\n35:25.120 --> 35:27.120\nthe audience's brain will tolerate\n\n35:27.120 --> 35:31.120\nusing this device to whip around the cosmos\n\n35:31.120 --> 35:33.120\nto be up in this guy's grill,\n\n35:33.120 --> 35:35.120\nand then cut to what he's looking at,\n\n35:35.120 --> 35:36.120\nand then cut back to him,\n\n35:36.120 --> 35:37.120\nand have him go,\n\n35:37.120 --> 35:38.120\nI want a sandwich.\n\n35:38.120 --> 35:40.120\nAmazing.\n\n35:40.120 --> 35:42.120\nAnd then when people would walk on the screen,\n\n35:42.120 --> 35:44.120\nlike reportedly, supposedly,\n\n35:44.120 --> 35:46.120\npeople would see this,\n\n35:46.120 --> 35:48.120\nand they couldn't help but like,\n\n35:48.120 --> 35:50.120\nthey would train their necks.\n\n35:50.120 --> 35:51.120\nAnd when the train came at them,\n\n35:51.120 --> 35:52.120\npeople ducked.\n\n35:52.120 --> 35:53.120\nYeah, it makes sense,\n\n35:53.120 --> 35:55.120\nbecause we go to the, you know, Carnival Ride thing,\n\n35:55.120 --> 35:57.120\nthe Simpsons, Transformers, whatever,\n\n35:57.120 --> 35:59.120\nthey capital, I mean, we're still going to do it.\n\n35:59.120 --> 36:01.120\nAnyways, what are we talking about?\n\n36:01.120 --> 36:02.120\nI'm wasting this show.\n\n36:02.120 --> 36:04.120\nWe should be talking about terrorism.\n\n36:06.120 --> 36:09.120\nUh, let's get to the moon,\n\n36:09.120 --> 36:10.120\nwhere it's legal.\n\n36:10.120 --> 36:11.120\nTerrorism is legal?\n\n36:11.120 --> 36:14.120\nYeah, there's no laws there yet.\n\n36:14.120 --> 36:18.120\nNothing to blow up, but no consequences.\n\n36:18.120 --> 36:21.120\nBut then you're going against the people\n\n36:21.120 --> 36:22.120\nwho you went to the moon with,\n\n36:22.120 --> 36:23.120\nwhat are you rebelling against?\n\n36:23.120 --> 36:24.120\nAren't you all sort of in agreement?\n\n36:24.120 --> 36:27.120\nGotta bring a couple bad people up there with us.\n\n36:27.120 --> 36:29.120\nJust for terrorism?\n\n36:29.120 --> 36:31.120\nYes.\n\n36:31.120 --> 36:32.120\nI feel like it's going to take\n\n36:32.120 --> 36:34.120\nwhat terrorist doing a great job\n\n36:34.120 --> 36:36.120\nfor this whole thing to die.\n\n36:37.120 --> 36:39.120\nNow, Dan, you're saying,\n\n36:39.120 --> 36:41.120\nI don't like the idea of just 100 people.\n\n36:41.120 --> 36:42.120\nIt seems too low.\n\n36:42.120 --> 36:43.120\nOh, right.\n\n36:43.120 --> 36:44.120\nBut let's say it's 100,\n\n36:44.120 --> 36:45.120\nbecause that's a good round number.\n\n36:45.120 --> 36:46.120\nWhat did you say?\n\n36:46.120 --> 36:47.120\n100.\n\n36:47.120 --> 36:48.120\nLet's just call it 100 right now.\n\n36:48.120 --> 36:50.120\nWell, okay.\n\n36:50.120 --> 36:52.120\nYou want that guy to be like,\n\n36:52.120 --> 36:53.120\nyou want enough people\n\n36:53.120 --> 36:55.120\nso that you could run into someone at the urinal\n\n36:55.120 --> 36:56.120\nwho's like,\n\n36:56.120 --> 36:58.120\nyou don't hate, participate.\n\n36:58.120 --> 36:59.120\nI don't know.\n\n36:59.120 --> 37:00.120\nI don't want that guy in the moon.\n\n37:00.120 --> 37:02.120\nThere would be nobody allowed like that up there.\n\n37:02.120 --> 37:03.120\nIt would all be Spencers.\n\n37:03.120 --> 37:05.120\nIt would just be like 100 Spencers.\n\n37:05.120 --> 37:06.120\nBut 100 Spencers,\n\n37:06.120 --> 37:09.120\n100 Spencers would devalue the Spencer currency.\n\n37:09.120 --> 37:10.120\nWell, I mean,\n\n37:10.120 --> 37:11.120\nI mean like Spencer,\n\n37:11.120 --> 37:13.120\nbut I mean equally cool.\n\n37:13.120 --> 37:15.120\nBut like everybody would be different.\n\n37:15.120 --> 37:16.120\nWhat have we found at Harmontown?\n\n37:16.120 --> 37:17.120\nThere are 100 Spencers.\n\n37:17.120 --> 37:19.120\nMy question was though,\n\n37:19.120 --> 37:22.120\nif you were up there with a bunch of really intelligent people,\n\n37:22.120 --> 37:23.120\nwould you be happy?\n\n37:23.120 --> 37:24.120\nBecause like,\n\n37:24.120 --> 37:27.120\nisn't part of your Christ complex persecution thing,\n\n37:27.120 --> 37:28.120\nyour fantasy that,\n\n37:28.120 --> 37:30.120\nhow much smarter you are than people\n\n37:30.120 --> 37:31.120\nand how much,\n\n37:31.120 --> 37:32.120\nyou're always like,\n\n37:32.120 --> 37:34.120\nhow much better you are than people.\n\n37:34.120 --> 37:36.120\nWouldn't you kind of die on the vine\n\n37:36.120 --> 37:37.120\nif everybody was like.\n\n37:37.120 --> 37:40.120\nNo, no, I don't think so.\n\n37:40.120 --> 37:42.120\nI don't want,\n\n37:42.120 --> 37:43.120\nI mean,\n\n37:43.120 --> 37:45.120\nand I have discovered as of late,\n\n37:45.120 --> 37:46.120\nhumble brag,\n\n37:46.120 --> 37:49.120\nthat to a limited degree,\n\n37:49.120 --> 37:51.120\nas much as someone in my field\n\n37:51.120 --> 37:53.120\nis supposed to experience it,\n\n37:53.120 --> 37:54.120\nwhich should be never,\n\n37:54.120 --> 37:55.120\nbut I have on accident,\n\n37:55.120 --> 37:57.120\nlike this concept of fame,\n\n37:57.120 --> 38:00.120\nas opposed to respect.\n\n38:00.120 --> 38:03.120\nLike I want everyone to like me,\n\n38:03.120 --> 38:04.120\nor I started that way.\n\n38:04.120 --> 38:05.120\nI want everyone to like me.\n\n38:05.120 --> 38:07.120\nI want as many people to like me as possible.\n\n38:07.120 --> 38:09.120\nBut there's other people who are like,\n\n38:09.120 --> 38:11.120\nI want everyone to know my name.\n\n38:11.120 --> 38:13.120\nI'm not one of those people.\n\n38:13.120 --> 38:14.120\nDo not like that.\n\n38:14.120 --> 38:16.120\nBecause when everyone knows your name,\n\n38:16.120 --> 38:17.120\nthen it's just like random people\n\n38:17.120 --> 38:18.120\nare just going like,\n\n38:18.120 --> 38:19.120\nhey, fuck face,\n\n38:19.120 --> 38:20.120\nlike get a job,\n\n38:20.120 --> 38:21.120\nfuck it, whatever.\n\n38:21.120 --> 38:23.120\nLike I've gone out with Jack Black\n\n38:23.120 --> 38:24.120\nto grocery stores,\n\n38:24.120 --> 38:28.120\nlike he was just trying to buy a box of tricks\n\n38:28.120 --> 38:31.120\nand like people just like come up to him\n\n38:31.120 --> 38:32.120\nand point at his face,\n\n38:32.120 --> 38:33.120\nlike he's a bug,\n\n38:33.120 --> 38:34.120\nand go,\n\n38:34.120 --> 38:36.120\nyou're famous, right?\n\n38:36.120 --> 38:37.120\nAnd he goes,\n\n38:37.120 --> 38:38.120\nno,\n\n38:38.120 --> 38:39.120\nbecause fuck you,\n\n38:39.120 --> 38:40.120\nif you don't even know.\n\n38:40.120 --> 38:41.120\nAnd they're like, yeah you are.\n\n38:41.120 --> 38:43.120\nCan I get a picture?\n\n38:43.120 --> 38:46.120\nOkay.\n\n38:46.120 --> 38:48.120\nAnd then like people are running back up to him\n\n38:48.120 --> 38:49.120\nand going,\n\n38:49.120 --> 38:50.120\nbecause they went and Googled him\n\n38:50.120 --> 38:51.120\nor something like that.\n\n38:51.120 --> 38:52.120\nAnd they go like,\n\n38:52.120 --> 38:53.120\nJack Black,\n\n38:53.120 --> 38:54.120\nJack Black,\n\n38:54.120 --> 38:56.120\nKing Kong wasn't that good though.\n\n38:56.120 --> 38:58.120\nFuck that.\n\n38:58.120 --> 38:59.120\nThat's fame.\n\n38:59.120 --> 39:00.120\nI don't want,\n\n39:00.120 --> 39:01.120\nthat's no good.\n\n39:01.120 --> 39:02.120\nLike,\n\n39:02.120 --> 39:07.120\nI want to be in a room\n\n39:07.120 --> 39:11.120\nwhere I don't have to worry about a single person\n\n39:11.120 --> 39:12.120\nthinking that there's anything wrong with me.\n\n39:12.120 --> 39:14.120\nWould you be comfortable in a room\n\n39:14.120 --> 39:16.120\nor in a colony full

40:26.120\nI mean,\n\n40:26.120 --> 40:27.120\nwe've,\n\n40:27.120 --> 40:28.120\nwe've explored this at the 60s.\n\n40:28.120 --> 40:29.120\nLike there's,\n\n40:29.120 --> 40:30.120\nthere's been,\n\n40:30.120 --> 40:31.120\nlike colonies of hippies,\n\n40:31.120 --> 40:32.120\nthey're all plenty smart,\n\n40:32.120 --> 40:33.120\nand they,\n\n40:33.120 --> 40:34.120\nthey grow their potatoes\n\n40:34.120 --> 40:35.120\nand they remove their garbage\n\n40:35.120 --> 40:36.120\nand they cut each other's hair\n\n40:36.120 --> 40:37.120\nand they deliver each other's babies\n\n40:37.120 --> 40:38.120\nand it's,\n\n40:38.120 --> 40:39.120\nit's worked.\n\n40:39.120 --> 40:41.120\nLike the fact that a hundred people's worth of poop\n\n40:41.120 --> 40:42.120\nhad to be cleaned up.\n\n40:42.120 --> 40:43.120\nLike the Spanish Civil War,\n\n40:43.120 --> 40:44.120\nlike,\n\n40:44.120 --> 40:45.120\nlike the anarchist communes there\n\n40:45.120 --> 40:46.120\nand like the,\n\n40:46.120 --> 40:47.120\nthe Paris Communists and like that,\n\n40:47.120 --> 40:48.120\nthese,\n\n40:48.120 --> 40:49.120\nthese are people that had planned secretly\n\n40:49.120 --> 40:50.120\nunder fascist governments\n\n40:50.120 --> 40:52.120\nor monarchy governments to,\n\n40:52.120 --> 40:53.120\nthey had,\n\n40:53.120 --> 40:54.120\nlike,\n\n40:54.120 --> 40:55.120\nunderground teaching each other\n\n40:55.120 --> 40:56.120\nhow to run things,\n\n40:56.120 --> 40:57.120\nhow to operate stuff,\n\n40:57.120 --> 40:59.120\nand it takes years and years and years\n\n40:59.120 --> 41:00.120\nand years of education,\n\n41:00.120 --> 41:01.120\nand,\n\n41:01.120 --> 41:02.120\nand under those situations,\n\n41:02.120 --> 41:03.120\nlike,\n\n41:03.120 --> 41:04.120\ncompletely illegally and underground\n\n41:04.120 --> 41:05.120\nto learn how,\n\n41:05.120 --> 41:06.120\nwhen the revolution happens,\n\n41:06.120 --> 41:07.120\nthat we're ready to go,\n\n41:07.120 --> 41:08.120\ntake out the trash.\n\n41:08.120 --> 41:09.120\nOkay, all right.\n\n41:09.120 --> 41:10.120\nYou got this.\n\n41:10.120 --> 41:11.120\nYou got this.\n\n41:11.120 --> 41:12.120\nThat's awesome.\n\n41:12.120 --> 41:13.120\nSo you'd have to be,\n\n41:13.120 --> 41:14.120\nlike,\n\n41:14.120 --> 41:15.120\nyou can't just take a ship up to the moon\n\n41:15.120 --> 41:16.120\nand say,\n\n41:16.120 --> 41:17.120\nall right, everybody,\n\n41:17.120 --> 41:18.120\nwe're all\n\n41:18.120 --> 41:19.120\nanarcho-syndicalists.\n\n41:19.120 --> 41:20.120\nWe're all,\n\n41:20.120 --> 41:21.120\neveryone's going to do their own thing.\n\n41:21.120 --> 41:22.120\nLike,\n\n41:22.120 --> 41:23.120\nlike,\n\n41:23.120 --> 41:24.120\nwe're all going to take pride in our work.\n\n41:24.120 --> 41:25.120\nWe're all going to do it.\n\n41:25.120 --> 41:26.120\nYes.\n\n41:26.120 --> 41:27.120\nYou can go,\n\n41:27.120 --> 41:28.120\nokay, everybody,\n\n41:28.120 --> 41:29.120\nbecause there's only a hundred of us.\n\n41:29.120 --> 41:30.120\nSo,\n\n41:30.120 --> 41:31.120\nlike,\n\n41:31.120 --> 41:32.120\nthere's probably a hundred,\n\n41:32.120 --> 41:33.120\nfifty,\n\n41:33.120 --> 41:34.120\ntwo hundred people in this room,\n\n41:34.120 --> 41:35.120\nso we know that we could do this on the moon.\n\n41:35.120 --> 41:36.120\nSo we go,\n\n41:36.120 --> 41:37.120\nokay, everybody,\n\n41:37.120 --> 41:38.120\nand none of us\n\n41:38.120 --> 41:39.120\nwants to clean up poop.\n\n41:39.120 --> 41:40.120\nAnd,\n\n41:40.120 --> 41:41.120\nI mean,\n\n41:41.120 --> 41:42.120\nmaybe one guy would go,\n\n41:42.120 --> 41:43.120\nI love it.\n\n41:43.120 --> 41:44.120\nWe made a mistake.\n\n41:44.120 --> 41:45.120\nWhat's your name?\n\n41:45.120 --> 41:46.120\nToby?\n\n41:46.120 --> 41:47.120\nOkay,\n\n41:47.120 --> 41:48.120\nToby, fine,\n\n41:48.120 --> 41:49.120\nfine,\n\n41:49.120 --> 41:50.120\nsorry for the meeting.\n\n41:50.120 --> 41:51.120\nLet's talk.\n\n41:51.120 --> 41:52.120\nBut,\n\n41:52.120 --> 41:53.120\nassuming Toby doesn't exist,\n\n41:53.120 --> 41:54.120\nlike,\n\n41:54.120 --> 41:55.120\nlike,\n\n41:55.120 --> 41:56.120\nlike,\n\n41:56.120 --> 41:57.120\nokay,\n\n41:57.120 --> 41:58.120\nno one wants to clean up poop,\n\n41:58.120 --> 41:59.120\nbut there's a hundred of us,\n\n41:59.120 --> 42:00.120\nthere's a hundred people's worth of poop.\n\n42:00.120 --> 42:01.120\nThe good news is,\n\n42:01.120 --> 42:02.120\nif we all take turns,\n\n42:02.120 --> 42:03.120\nwe only have to clean poop\n\n42:03.120 --> 42:04.120\none percent of our,\n\n42:04.120 --> 42:05.120\nof our lives.\n\n42:05.120 --> 42:06.120\nThat's a lot.\n\n42:06.120 --> 42:07.120\nDude,\n\n42:07.120 --> 42:08.120\nyou also, though,\n\n42:08.120 --> 42:09.120\nyou get to do all the cool stuff,\n\n42:09.120 --> 42:10.120\nlike,\n\n42:10.120 --> 42:11.120\none percent of the time,\n\n42:11.120 --> 42:12.120\nlike,\n\n42:12.120 --> 42:13.120\nlike,\n\n42:13.120 --> 42:14.120\nlike,\n\n42:14.120 --> 42:15.120\ncleaning the poop,\n\n42:15.120 --> 42:16.120\nif people poop,\n\n42:16.120 --> 42:17.120\nlet's say once or twice or three times a day,\n\n42:17.120 --> 42:18.120\nthat's,\n\n42:18.120 --> 42:19.120\nyou're doing it like a lot.\n\n42:19.120 --> 42:20.120\nBut,\n\n42:20.120 --> 42:21.120\nthis is a space colony,\n\n42:21.120 --> 42:22.120\nlike,\n\n42:22.120 --> 42:23.120\nyou're pooping into a toilet\n\n42:23.120 --> 42:24.120\nthat is suctioning your poop into a...\n\n42:24.120 --> 42:25.120\nOh,\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:26.120\nwe just shoot it back to Earth.\n\n42:26.120 --> 42:27.120\nYeah!\n\n42:27.120 --> 42:28.120\nNo,\n\n42:28.120 --> 42:29.120\nbecause then Earth declares war on you.\n\n42:29.120 --> 42:30.120\nMan,\n\n42:30.120 --> 42:31.120\nif you guys just put like\n\n42:31.120 --> 42:32.120\nan NBC logo on it,\n\n42:32.120 --> 42:33.120\nand like,\n\n42:33.120 --> 42:34.120\nlike,\n\n42:34.120 --> 42:35.120\nlike,\n\n42:35.120 --> 42:41.120\nI was trying to think of a logo, like a corporate logo, and I blurted out the name of my employers.\n\n42:41.120 --> 42:44.120\nThat's never happened before.\n\n42:44.120 --> 42:50.120\nIn the podcast where we talked about terrorism being for brave people, and we would have said,\n\n42:50.120 --> 42:57.120\nthe one thing tomorrow would be, Dan Harmon blasts the peacock with space poop,\n\n42:57.120 --> 43:01.120\nsuggests that the mass opiate ain't having it.\n\n43:01.120 --> 43:05.120\nIf you do hurl the colonies-\n\n43:05.120 --> 43:09.120\nThe Charlie Sheen of writers blew up again last night.\n\n43:09.120 --> 43:17.120\nThis time is Lava Mouth Flood about poop and NBC being the same.\n\n43:17.120 --> 43:20.120\nClick here for Bacardi!\n\n43:24.120 --> 43:29.120\nYou could send the poop back though because it would just burn up an Earth's atmosphere kind of harmlessly, wouldn't it?\n\n43:29.120 --> 43:33.120\nAll you have to do is make it a little slower, and it'll burn up.\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:37.120\nThat's the great thing about the atmosphere. Automatic poop burner. Perfect.\n\n43:37.120 --> 43:41.120\nWe're already nailing this. It'll be a symbolic thing.\n\n43:41.120 --> 43:46.120\nYou'd have to get that just right because eventually you would create a pooposphere.\n\n43:46.120 --> 43:48.120\nA ring, a beautiful brown ring around it.\n\n43:48.120 --> 43:50.120\nIt's like a Saturn's poop ring.\n\n43:50.120 --> 43:52.120\nFrom the moon?\n\n43:52.120 --> 43:56.120\nFor Earth it would look like, shit, we're being satellite by shit.\n\n43:56.120 --> 43:59.120\nThat's a symbol of our power.\n\n43:59.120 --> 44:03.120\nBut then Earth attacks the moon because it's the poop wars and they come and get you.\n\n44:03.120 --> 44:07.120\nI dare them to attack. Do you know how hard it would be for them to attack the moon?\n\n44:07.120 --> 44:11.120\nWe put some fuckers on there in 1969 with a digital watch.\n\n44:11.120 --> 44:15.120\nAnd we haven't been back there since because it's that expensive and we're that lazy.\n\n44:15.120 --> 44:17.120\nThere's no real space program.\n\n44:17.120 --> 44:24.120\nIf we figure out a way to get back to the moon with 100 people, all we have to do is destroy the Earth.\n\n44:24.120 --> 44:27.120\nWe just go, hey, Earth, fuck you.\n\n44:27.120 --> 44:35.120\nAnd then move 20 yards so that by the time they figure out how to invade where that signal came from,\n\n44:35.120 --> 44:39.120\nthere's nothing there but a thousand craters that were already there.\n\n44:39.120 --> 44:42.120\nThe moon is like a mega-Afghanistan.\n\n44:42.120 --> 44:45.120\nYou have moon?\n\n44:45.120 --> 44:50.120\nI had a question but let's talk about that a little bit.\n\n44:50.120 --> 44:53.120\nYou have moon, moving technology?\n\n44:53.120 --> 44:56.120\nNo, not moon. I'm not moving the moon.\n\n44:56.120 --> 44:58.120\nI'm saying a hundred of us.\n\n44:58.120 --> 44:59.120\nJust move over.\n\n44:59.120 --> 45:01.120\nBut they could land a robot on the moon.\n\n45:01.120 --> 45:03.120\nI would like to see that.\n\n45:03.120 --> 45:04.120\nWe've done it.\n\n45:04.120 --> 45:06.120\nWe've done it because we're smart.\n\n45:06.120 --> 45:09.120\nPeople on the Earth will still be people on the Earth.\n\n45:09.120 --> 45:11.120\nNot smart people.\n\n45:11.120 --> 45:13.120\nThere's more than 100 smart people on Earth.\n\n45:13.120 --> 45:18.120\nBut there's sell-outs and that will compromise them.\n\n45:18.120 --> 45:22.120\nIf I've learned one thing, if I take the 100 people I want,\n\n45:22.120 --> 45:27.120\nI will have already removed, just removing the 100 people that I want.\n\n45:27.120 --> 45:33.120\nEarth's passion will have been reduced by 90%.\n\n45:33.120 --> 45:42.120\nI want to say first of all, I would say that mega-Afghanistan is actually Pakistan.\n\n45:42.120 --> 45:46.120\nStop quoting your bumper stickers.\n\n45:46.120 --> 45:49.120\nGuys, they're on sale over there.\n\n45:49.120 --> 45:52.120\nThe sign as you drive into Pakistan.\n\n45:52.120 --> 45:53.120\nWelcome to Pakistan.\n\n45:53.120 --> 45:55.120\nYeah, mega-Afghanistan.\n\n45:55.120 --> 45:59.120\nI don't know, maybe the tourism board needs a rewrite.\n\n45:59.120 --> 46:02.120\nThe entire time, all I could see in my head was Adam Goldberg,\n\n46:02.120 --> 46:07.120\nwearing different disguises, trying to get on the rocket ship.\n\n46:07.120 --> 46:09.120\nI think I'd bring him.\n\n46:09.120 --> 46:11.120\nYou would take Adam maybe, right?\n\n46:11.120 --> 46:15.120\nI've said I'd put a statue to Adam Goldberg up in the front.\n\n46:15.120 --> 46:20.120\nThere's a lot of real estate, so having a statue wouldn't be that big a deal.\n\n46:20.120 --> 46:25.120\nEverybody's got a statue, so don't get too excited.\n\n46:25.120 --> 46:28.120\nName to me some archetypes that you wouldn't want to bring along.\n\n46:28.120 --> 46:30.120\nWouldn't want to bring along.\n\n46:30.120 --> 46:33.120\nThat guy, the pea guy, the rhyming...\n\n46:33.120 --> 46:35.120\nRhyming urinal talking guy is probably not coming.\n\n46:35.120 --> 46:37.120\nRhyming frat guy is not coming.\n\n46:37.120 --> 46:41.120\nAnybody who's ever said in their entire life, ever,\n\n46:41.120 --> 46:45.120\nyou'd have to somehow figure out a way to polygraphically prove this,\n\n46:45.120 --> 46:48.120\nbecause their instincts are going to be a lie when they find out what's at stake.\n\n46:48.120 --> 46:53.120\nAnyone who has ever in their entire life said too much information.\n\n46:53.120 --> 46:56.120\nOr first world problems.\n\n46:56.120 --> 46:58.120\nOr white people problems.\n\n46:58.120 --> 47:01.120\nOr dig a little deeper, or tell us how you really feel.\n\n47:01.120 --> 47:04.120\nOr didn't get the best of the first cut right there.\n\n47:04.120 --> 47:06.120\nYeah.\n\n47:06.120 --> 47:08.120\nAre you not coming?\n\n47:08.120 --> 47:11.120\nThere's one, I know people that use it all the time, I just wish everybody would stop saying,\n\n47:11.120 --> 47:14.120\nat the end of the day, I hate that it drives me fucking mad.\n\n47:14.120 --> 47:16.120\nI say it all the time.\n\n47:16.120 --> 47:18.120\nEverybody said, yeah.\n\n47:18.120 --> 47:22.120\nI think I probably would have to have my own moon moon.\n\n47:22.120 --> 47:24.120\nA moon of the moon?\n\n47:24.120 --> 47:27.120\nYeah, it'd be like a little VIP moon.\n\n47:27.120 --> 47:30.120\nWe're already creating Earth on moon.\n\n47:30.120 --> 47:32.120\nThis is why we got away.\n\n47:32.120 --> 47:35.120\nYeah, but Adam Goldberg's going to be there, and I'm going to have to get out of here.\n\n47:35.120 --> 47:38.120\nI kind of like that, though, that we incorporate into our culture.\n\n47:38.120 --> 47:40.120\nNo offense, Adam, I love you.\n\n47:40.120 --> 47:42.120\nIt's a hundred.\n\n47:42.120 --> 47:45.120\nThe moon's not big enough for the two of us, man.\n\n47:45.120 --> 47:48.120\nI would let you come to VIP moon once in a while.\n\n47:48.120 --> 47:51.120\nWe incorporate into our moon another moon.\n\n47:51.120 --> 47:53.120\nOnce in a blue moon.\n\n47:53.120 --> 47:57.120\nMembership revoked.\n\n47:57.120 --> 48:01.120\nBy the way, people at home don't know he stood up to say that.\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:06.120\nHe either took a bow or his spinal problems are...\n\n48:06.120 --> 48:08.120\nHe stood up and said, I'm sorry.\n\n48:08.120 --> 48:10.120\nDid that feel rude?\n\n48:10.120 --> 48:12.120\nNo, it was funny.\n\n48:12.120 --> 48:14.120\nBut it looked like he took a bow.\n\n48:14.120 --> 48:17.120\nHe chipped an imaginary top hat when he did that.\n\n48:17.120 --> 48:23.120\nHe had the expression on his face that he was expecting people to just carry him out on his shoulder.\n\n48:23.120 --> 48:28.120\nI'm saying just for me, the ability to be alone in a crowd is the greatest thing in the world.\n\n48:28.120 --> 48:31.120\nThe ability to get away.\n\n48:31.120 --> 48:33.120\nI love everybody here that comes to these shows.\n\n48:33.120 --> 48:36.120\nI've never had a bad experience here doing Harmontown.\n\n48:36.120 --> 48:38.120\nI've never been bummed out by anyone that's ever come.\n\n48:38.120 --> 48:40.120\nBut when the show's over, I just leave.\n\n48:40.120 --> 48:43.120\nI want to go and kind of get away.\n\n48:43.120 --> 48:47.120\nAnd that's just my own need to separate myself from crowds.\n\n48:47.120 --> 48:49.120\nBut where do you go?\n\n48:49.120 --> 48:51.120\nYou don't go to...\n\n48:51.120 --> 48:53.120\nI have to go to another place.\n\n48:53.120 --> 48:56.120\nThere will be so many places for you to go on the moon.\n\n48:56.120 --> 48:58.120\nWhere?\n\n48:58.120 --> 49:00.120\nA little cheeky bar called Jeff's Place.\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:02.120\nIt's a hundred people.\n\n49:02.120 --> 49:05.120\nWhat if I wanted a hundred different restaurant options?\n\n49:05.120 --> 49:08.120\nThere can't be just the can'ts. There will be three restaurants.\n\n49:08.120 --> 49:10.120\nNo, there'll be more than three.\n\n49:10.120 --> 49:11.120\nWho's going to work there?\n\n49:11.120 --> 49:12.120\nThe moon is huge.\n\n49:12.120 --> 49:14.120\nA hundred people are going to man how many restaurants?\n\n49:14.120 --> 49:16.120\nIt's all automated, dude.\n\n49:16.120 --> 49:20.120\nOkay, if there's 99 restaurants and you all work in one, then that's fine with me.\n\n49:20.120 --> 49:23.120\nOkay, here's the thing. Jeff, there's not going to be any restaurants.\n\n49:23.120 --> 49:24.120\nWhat?\n\n49:24.120 --> 49:26.120\nThere's not going to be any... Yeah, Jeff, no restaurants.\n\n49:26.120 --> 49:28.120\nFuck you.\n\n49:28.120 --> 49:30.120\nThere's not going to be capitalism, Joe.\n\n49:30.120 --> 49:34.120\nI'm not saying it's about fucking quid pro quo and reciprocity.\n\n49:34.120 --> 49:36.120\nI'm saying there has to be...\n\n49:36.120 --> 49:39.120\nVIP Moon's going to have some fucking swinging restaurants up there.\n\n49:39.120 --> 49:41.120\nIf you guys want to go have a nice meal.\n\n49:41.120 --> 49:45.120\nAre you going to have that restaurant that you talked about called the Leftovers or whatever?\n\n49:45.120 --> 49:48.120\nWhere it's like everything in the bike taken out of it?\n\n49:48.120 --> 49:50.120\nReal обnets idea?\n\n49:50.120 --> 49:51.120\nYeah. Is that what that was?\n\n49:51.120 --> 49:53.120\nIt's going to be called Space Bikes.\n\n49:53.120 --> 49:56.120\nBut my Moon will actually rotate.\n\n49:56.120 --> 49:58.120\nIt won't be orbit-locked like our Moon.\n\n49:58.120 --> 50:00.120\nMine will actually be a revolving restaurant.\n\n50:00.120 --> 50:02.120\nYou can actually have a revolving view of fake bullshit moon.\n\n50:02.120 --> 50:04.120\nOkay, where do we...\n\n50:05.120 --> 50:07.120\nAre you in real Moon?\n\n50:07.120 --> 50:08.120\nYeah.\n\n50:08.120 --> 50:10.120\nWe call it fake bullshit moon.\n\n50:10.120 --> 50:11.120\nIt's called fake moon.\n\n50:11.120 --> 50:12.120\nBecause it's...\n\n50:12.120 --> 50:13.120\nYeah, we just call it Moon.\n\n50:13.120 --> 50:15.120\nOn this fictional Moon that you created.\n\n50:15.120 --> 50:19.120\nYeah, we're talking about shit that we can do.\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:21.120\nYou're on a flight of fancy here.\n\n50:21.120 --> 50:25.120\nIn my humanity, you're clinging to the very problems that made Earth uninhabitable.\n\n50:25.120 --> 50:27.120\nWith your magical VIP...\n\n50:27.120 --> 50:29.120\nMy Moon is going to be called Phoenixville.\n\n50:29.120 --> 50:32.120\nAnd we're going to look down on Moon Moon.\n\n50:32.120 --> 50:33.120\nAnd we're going to go like...\n\n50:33.120 --> 50:34.120\nLook, it's nice to live...\n\n50:34.120 --> 50:35.120\nIt's just called Moon.\n\n50:35.120 --> 50:36.120\nMoon app.\n\n50:36.120 --> 50:37.120\nWe have a lot of names for the Moon.\n\n50:37.120 --> 50:39.120\nThe Moon.\n\n50:39.120 --> 50:41.120\nBut a hundred fucking...\n\n50:41.120 --> 50:43.120\nYou got to take a vacation and get off of the fucking Moon.\n\n50:43.120 --> 50:44.120\nIt's so big.\n\n50:44.120 --> 50:46.120\nYeah, but a hundred people...\n\n50:46.120 --> 50:48.120\nGoing to the Moon is the vacation.\n\n50:48.120 --> 50:52.120\nAll right, is the Moon totally filled?\n\n50:52.120 --> 50:55.120\nOh yeah, we've teal whatever the entire thing.\n\n50:55.120 --> 50:56.120\nYeah, it's all matter.\n\n50:56.120 --> 50:57.120\nWhat is it called?\n\n50:57.120 --> 50:58.120\nYou've got a hundred people...\n\n50:58.120 --> 50:59.120\nTerraforming.\n\n50:59.120 --> 51:00.120\nWe've terraformed the whole thing.\n\n51:00.120 --> 51:01.120\nYou've terraformed...\n\n51:01.120 --> 51:03.120\nSo it's not just a dusty wasteland.\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:05.120\nNo, dude, it's great.\n\n51:07.120 --> 51:09.120\nThen where's the restaurants?\n\n51:09.120 --> 51:10.120\nWell, I don't know.\n\n51:10.120 --> 51:11.120\nFirst of all...\n\n51:11.120 --> 51:12.120\nYeah, I'll let you take the restaurant.\n\n51:12.120 --> 51:15.120\nWe can't say we terraformed the whole place like there's grass there.\n\n51:15.120 --> 51:16.120\nIs there going to be Mexican food?\n\n51:16.120 --> 51:18.120\nBecause if there's no Mexican food, I'm going to VIP Moon.\n\n51:18.120 --> 51:19.120\nThere will be Mexican food.\n\n51:19.120 --> 51:21.120\nHere's what there's going to be, you guys.\n\n51:21.120 --> 51:22.120\nThere has to be Mexican people.\n\n51:22.120 --> 51:24.120\nHow many Mexicans are you bringing up out of a hundred?\n\n51:24.120 --> 51:26.120\nWhat in the world...\n\n51:26.120 --> 51:30.120\nWe're leaving the Earth to get away from this horrible classism.\n\n51:30.120 --> 51:31.120\nThere is no warranty anymore.\n\n51:31.120 --> 51:32.120\nI love Mexican people.\n\n51:32.120 --> 51:34.120\nI love Mexican food.\n\n51:34.120 --> 51:36.120\nWell, there will be three Mexican guys up there,\n\n51:36.120 --> 51:38.120\nand they'll all be brilliant painters.\n\n51:38.120 --> 51:39.120\nFine.\n\n51:39.120 --> 51:40.120\nThey're not going to bring you food.\n\n51:40.120 --> 51:41.120\nOkay.\n\n51:41.120 --> 51:45.120\nSomehow that's very offensive too, but...\n\n51:45.120 --> 51:47.120\nThey're going to be great lovers.\n\n51:47.120 --> 51:49.120\nI'm bringing Pedro almost over.\n\n51:49.120 --> 51:53.120\nWe're going to need more than a hundred people is what I'm saying.\n\n51:53.120 --> 51:55.120\nThere's a lot of shit to get done,\n\n51:55.120 --> 51:57.120\nand a hundred people aren't going to do it.\n\n51:57.120 --> 51:58.120\nI don't understand.\n\n51:58.120 --> 52:00.120\nThere's a lot of shit to get done.\n\n52:00.120 --> 52:03.120\nNo, we're just going up there to exist in peace.\n\n52:03.120 --> 52:05.120\nYou could do it with three people, but...\n\n52:05.120 --> 52:08.120\nA small community, if everyone knows each other's name to me,\n\n52:08.120 --> 52:10.120\nit sounds like hell.\n\n52:10.120 --> 52:11.120\nOh my God.\n\n52:11.120 --> 52:12.120\nThat's heaven to me.\n\n52:12.120 --> 52:13.120\nReally?\n\n52:13.120 --> 52:14.120\nYeah.\n\n52:14.120 --> 52:15.120\nYou could say that.\n\n52:15.120 --> 52:17.120\nSeven billion people whose names I never know.\n\n52:17.120 --> 52:18.120\nYeah, but...\n\n52:18.120 --> 52:22.120\nI could finally be that guy that walks into a room and goes,\n\n52:22.120 --> 52:24.120\nMike, Kevin, Barbara, Stacy.\n\n52:24.120 --> 52:26.120\nI should throw some ethnic beans in there.\n\n52:26.120 --> 52:27.120\nWe should throw, yeah.\n\n52:27.120 --> 52:28.120\nYeah.\n\n52:28.120 --> 52:29.120\nArmadice.\n\n52:29.120 --> 52:30.120\nAlmadovar.\n\n52:30.120 --> 52:31.120\nArmadice, you're coming.\n\n52:31.120 --> 52:32.120\nYou're Mexican.\n\n52:32.120 -->

52:38.120\nTotally.\n\n52:38.120 --> 52:39.120\nSpencer.\n\n52:39.120 --> 52:40.120\nEnti.\n\n52:40.120 --> 52:41.120\nEnti.\n\n52:41.120 --> 52:42.120\nOh my God, Enti.\n\n52:42.120 --> 52:44.120\nYou don't like to travel.\n\n52:44.120 --> 52:45.120\nYou would love to have a...\n\n52:45.120 --> 52:46.120\nYou're a hermit.\n\n52:46.120 --> 52:47.120\nYou would love to have a...\n\n52:47.120 --> 52:49.120\nLike build a giant Danadoo wherever you're...\n\n52:49.120 --> 52:52.120\nI would love to not feel like a dick everywhere I go.\n\n52:52.120 --> 52:53.120\nI go to Channel 101.\n\n52:53.120 --> 52:55.120\nI go even out here after the show.\n\n52:55.120 --> 52:56.120\nJeff, what time is it?\n\n52:56.120 --> 52:57.120\nLook.\n\n52:57.120 --> 52:58.120\n9-11.\n\n53:02.120 --> 53:04.120\nSo many...\n\n53:04.120 --> 53:08.120\nSo much of my life is spent with this interaction.\n\n53:08.120 --> 53:09.120\nPeople coming up and going,\n\n53:09.120 --> 53:13.120\nhey, and I go, hey, and I look at their face\n\n53:13.120 --> 53:16.120\nand I recognize the expression of a person who...\n\n53:16.120 --> 53:17.120\nKnows you.\n\n53:17.120 --> 53:19.120\nBelieves that I should know their name.\n\n53:19.120 --> 53:20.120\nAnd I...\n\n53:20.120 --> 53:21.120\nThat's everybody.\n\n53:21.120 --> 53:22.120\nWe all go through that.\n\n53:22.120 --> 53:25.120\nI go through it more than other people, I think.\n\n53:25.120 --> 53:27.120\nI am miserable about it.\n\n53:27.120 --> 53:28.120\nI would like...\n\n53:28.120 --> 53:30.120\nI very much enjoy walking into a room\n\n53:30.120 --> 53:32.120\nand knowing who everybody is.\n\n53:32.120 --> 53:34.120\nI hate if I'm going to go through that.\n\n53:34.120 --> 53:36.120\nIt makes me very aloof-seeming\n\n53:36.120 --> 53:38.120\nand makes me very uncomfortable.\n\n53:38.120 --> 53:40.120\nIt makes me have to stare at the floor\n\n53:40.120 --> 53:43.120\nand it's already hard enough to interact with people.\n\n53:43.120 --> 53:44.120\nI could like...\n\n53:44.120 --> 53:46.120\nIf I actually could recognize people...\n\n53:46.120 --> 53:48.120\nYou wouldn't get sick of the same people\n\n53:48.120 --> 53:49.120\nthat you knew all the time?\n\n53:49.120 --> 53:50.120\nI mean, 100 people?\n\n53:50.120 --> 53:52.120\nThat's like a big apple to bite.\n\n53:52.120 --> 53:54.120\nLike I said, by the time I would get bored with them,\n\n53:54.120 --> 53:56.120\nI think it would be 20 years later,\n\n53:56.120 --> 53:57.120\nnot only would I be dying,\n\n53:57.120 --> 53:58.120\nbut there would be all these new people.\n\n53:58.120 --> 53:59.120\nBut they would be children.\n\n53:59.120 --> 54:01.120\nNo, they would be 20-year-old people.\n\n54:01.120 --> 54:03.120\nWe're going to start fucking as soon as we get up there.\n\n54:03.120 --> 54:05.120\n100 people fucking.\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:06.120\nIt's like, it's not...\n\n54:06.120 --> 54:08.120\nI don't know.\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:09.120\nHave you looked at the Earth lately?\n\n54:09.120 --> 54:11.120\n100 people fucking leads to this.\n\n54:11.120 --> 54:12.120\nYeah.\n\n54:12.120 --> 54:13.120\nNo.\n\n54:13.120 --> 54:15.120\nBy the way, I know what's going to happen\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:16.120\nis in like 20 years on the moon,\n\n54:16.120 --> 54:18.120\nyou guys are going to be like fierce enemies\n\n54:18.120 --> 54:19.120\nin these stories.\n\n54:19.120 --> 54:21.120\nLike, remember on Earth, they used to be friends.\n\n54:21.120 --> 54:24.120\nLike how Superman and Lex Luthor went to school together\n\n54:24.120 --> 54:25.120\nin a small world.\n\n54:25.120 --> 54:27.120\nWhat if you took the...\n\n54:27.120 --> 54:29.120\nWhat if you took half of the moon\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:31.120\nand it was like the capitalist side?\n\n54:31.120 --> 54:32.120\nThis is the whole story.\n\n54:32.120 --> 54:33.120\nI despise capitalism.\n\n54:33.120 --> 54:34.120\nGuys!\n\n54:34.120 --> 54:35.120\nI don't want capitalism.\n\n54:35.120 --> 54:36.120\nI want...\n\n54:36.120 --> 54:37.120\nI want...\n\n54:37.120 --> 54:39.120\nYou want fancy restaurants.\n\n54:39.120 --> 54:41.120\nFor instance, but I also want to be able...\n\n54:41.120 --> 54:42.120\nI want variety.\n\n54:42.120 --> 54:43.120\nI want the unknown.\n\n54:43.120 --> 54:44.120\nI would need to be able to travel.\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:46.120\nI like going to places where I don't speak the language.\n\n54:46.120 --> 54:47.120\nYou despise them.\n\n54:47.120 --> 54:49.120\nBut they know why you're going to the moon at all then\n\n54:49.120 --> 54:50.120\nif you want to go to places...\n\n54:50.120 --> 54:52.120\nI'm starting to rethink it.\n\n54:52.120 --> 54:54.120\nNow, if you're a citizen of the moon,\n\n54:54.120 --> 54:56.120\ndo you have the ability to go back\n\n54:56.120 --> 54:59.120\nif you ever want to take a vacation back to Italy or something like that?\n\n54:59.120 --> 55:01.120\nI can't allow that.\n\n55:01.120 --> 55:04.120\nI think...\n\n55:04.120 --> 55:06.120\nVIP moon.\n\n55:06.120 --> 55:08.120\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n55:08.120 --> 55:11.120\nI'm assuming that there's going to have to be\n\n55:11.120 --> 55:13.120\nan awful lot of back and forth.\n\n55:13.120 --> 55:14.120\nYou know, the first people that...\n\n55:14.120 --> 55:15.120\nYou think so?\n\n55:15.120 --> 55:17.120\nYeah, there would have to be.\n\n55:17.120 --> 55:18.120\nFor instance...\n\n55:18.120 --> 55:20.120\nI think also that could be part of the culture\n\n55:20.120 --> 55:22.120\nis that the moon is like a...\n\n55:22.120 --> 55:23.120\nThere would be people...\n\n55:23.120 --> 55:25.120\nI would look at it as like a...\n\n55:25.120 --> 55:27.120\nlike a sieve kind of...\n\n55:27.120 --> 55:29.120\nI don't know how to articulate the process.\n\n55:29.120 --> 55:31.120\nLike it's an optional...\n\n55:31.120 --> 55:34.120\nThere's a shuttle that goes back and forth\n\n55:34.120 --> 55:35.120\nevery year, right?\n\n55:35.120 --> 55:37.120\nSo you...\n\n55:37.120 --> 55:40.120\nOver time, the people that end up populating the moon\n\n55:40.120 --> 55:42.120\nare people that actually do enjoy it.\n\n55:42.120 --> 55:45.120\nNo one that actually doesn't like it\n\n55:45.120 --> 55:48.120\nhas to be there longer than a certain interval.\n\n55:48.120 --> 55:50.120\nAnd then over time,\n\n55:50.120 --> 55:53.120\neven the gene pool is just like people that actually are into the moon.\n\n55:53.120 --> 55:56.120\nYou got 100 people to start fucking day one.\n\n55:56.120 --> 56:00.120\nAnd 18 years later, there's a bunch of 18-year-olds running around.\n\n56:00.120 --> 56:02.120\nThey're not all going to be guaranteed likeable people.\n\n56:02.120 --> 56:04.120\nWhat if there's some Friday...\n\n56:04.120 --> 56:05.120\nBut they're raised well.\n\n56:05.120 --> 56:07.120\nThen they get to go away.\n\n56:07.120 --> 56:08.120\nThey don't want to go.\n\n56:08.120 --> 56:09.120\nTheir family's up there.\n\n56:09.120 --> 56:11.120\nThey're not going to like their family if they're uncool.\n\n56:11.120 --> 56:13.120\nTheir families are going to be cool.\n\n56:13.120 --> 56:15.120\nAnd they'll raise their kids to be cool.\n\n56:15.120 --> 56:17.120\nI'm not going to bring uncool people to the moon.\n\n56:17.120 --> 56:19.120\nNo one uncool is going to like being there.\n\n56:19.120 --> 56:22.120\nI'm going to create an environment that uncool people do not like.\n\n56:22.120 --> 56:24.120\nUncool people could have uncool kids.\n\n56:24.120 --> 56:25.120\nI mean, cool people could have uncool kids.\n\n56:25.120 --> 56:26.120\nRight.\n\n56:26.120 --> 56:27.120\nAnd then the uncool kids get to leave.\n\n56:27.120 --> 56:28.120\nAnd you said,\n\n56:28.120 --> 56:29.120\nwell, their families are going to be there.\n\n56:29.120 --> 56:30.120\nTheir families are cool.\n\n56:30.120 --> 56:32.120\nThey don't like their families if they're uncool.\n\n56:32.120 --> 56:33.120\nI see that.\n\n56:33.120 --> 56:35.120\nThat's oversimplifying it.\n\n56:35.120 --> 56:36.120\nOversimplifying.\n\n56:36.120 --> 56:38.120\nSometimes I wish my family was on the moon\n\n56:38.120 --> 56:40.120\nso I could just come to Earth forever.\n\n56:40.120 --> 56:42.120\nYou know, I think I think that's...\n\n56:42.120 --> 56:43.120\nAnd I know...\n\n56:43.120 --> 56:44.120\nOh, God.\n\n56:44.120 --> 56:45.120\nWhat was going to happen here?\n\n56:45.120 --> 56:47.120\nBut I honestly think, like,\n\n56:47.120 --> 56:48.120\nfor a lot of people,\n\n56:48.120 --> 56:49.120\nbeing away from their families forever\n\n56:49.120 --> 56:50.120\nwould be something that they want to do.\n\n56:50.120 --> 56:51.120\nWhat about this?\n\n56:51.120 --> 56:52.120\nOkay.\n\n56:52.120 --> 56:53.120\nAt the end of each year,\n\n56:53.120 --> 56:55.120\nand who knows what a year is when you're on the moon?\n\n56:55.120 --> 56:56.120\nI don't know how that works.\n\n56:56.120 --> 56:58.120\nHow is day and night going to work?\n\n56:58.120 --> 56:59.120\nI don't know.\n\n56:59.120 --> 57:00.120\nI can't wait to find out.\n\n57:00.120 --> 57:02.120\nIt works the same because it's locked.\n\n57:02.120 --> 57:03.120\nThe orbit is locked around.\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:04.120\nAll right, smarty pants.\n\n57:04.120 --> 57:06.120\nAt the end of each year...\n\n57:06.120 --> 57:07.120\nNo.\n\n57:07.120 --> 57:08.120\nThe moon is geostationary,\n\n57:08.120 --> 57:10.120\nbut the sun still goes around it\n\n57:10.120 --> 57:11.120\nbecause that's how we get the phases of the moon.\n\n57:11.120 --> 57:12.120\nRight.\n\n57:12.120 --> 57:14.120\nSo the dark side of the moon is not actually dark.\n\n57:14.120 --> 57:15.120\nIt's dark to us.\n\n57:15.120 --> 57:16.120\nRight.\n\n57:16.120 --> 57:17.120\nYeah.\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:18.120\nNo, we know that,\n\n57:18.120 --> 57:19.120\nbut doesn't the moon go around?\n\n57:19.120 --> 57:20.120\nWe don't know that.\n\n57:20.120 --> 57:21.120\nCoomale knows that.\n\n57:21.120 --> 57:24.120\nThe moon is locked in a geostationary orbit,\n\n57:24.120 --> 57:27.120\nwhich means the sun is facing us, right?\n\n57:27.120 --> 57:31.120\nBut then when the sun is perpendicular to it,\n\n57:31.120 --> 57:33.120\nwe see half the moon is being dark.\n\n57:33.120 --> 57:36.120\nThat means the side that's away from us is lit up.\n\n57:36.120 --> 57:39.120\nSo how long is the moon year built?\n\n57:39.120 --> 57:43.120\nIt takes like a month to go around the Earth months, right?\n\n57:43.120 --> 57:45.120\nIt takes like 28 days or something.\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:47.120\nBut then days and nights are going to be totally different.\n\n57:47.120 --> 57:49.120\nIt's not going to be 24 hours.\n\n57:49.120 --> 57:50.120\nIt's going to be one month.\n\n57:50.120 --> 57:53.120\nOne day is going to be one month.\n\n57:53.120 --> 57:54.120\nThis is great.\n\n57:54.120 --> 57:55.120\nIs it really?\n\n57:55.120 --> 57:58.120\nI'll be able to write the script so much faster.\n\n57:58.120 --> 58:00.120\nI'm not even living there yet.\n\n58:00.120 --> 58:02.120\nI'll get it to you tomorrow.\n\n58:02.120 --> 58:03.120\nYeah.\n\n58:03.120 --> 58:14.120\nI might have to jerk off for a couple of air quotes hours.\n\n58:14.120 --> 58:15.120\nOkay.\n\n58:15.120 --> 58:19.120\nSo whatever a moon year is, you have a big party.\n\n58:19.120 --> 58:20.120\nSomeone's raising their hand.\n\n58:20.120 --> 58:21.120\nWe have a hand up.\n\n58:21.120 --> 58:22.120\nYes, sir?\n\n58:22.120 --> 58:23.120\nYes.\n\n58:23.120 --> 58:24.120\nIn addition to jerking off,\n\n58:24.120 --> 58:26.120\nwhat would be your favorite moon activities?\n\n58:26.120 --> 58:29.120\nI'm thinking of specifically zero gravity.\n\n58:29.120 --> 58:30.120\nOh, right.\n\n58:30.120 --> 58:31.120\nWell, it's one-sixth gravity.\n\n58:31.120 --> 58:32.120\nIt's one-sixth gravity.\n\n58:32.120 --> 58:34.120\nSo he's saying, other than jerking off,\n\n58:34.120 --> 58:37.120\nwhat would be your favorite one-sixth gravity gas times?\n\n58:37.120 --> 58:39.120\nRight now, at this point,\n\n58:39.120 --> 58:44.120\nI can't see past the joy of being just left alone, largely.\n\n58:44.120 --> 58:47.120\nI just like talking to people and drinking.\n\n58:47.120 --> 58:51.120\nAnd I don't know if I would take a lot of advantage of the one-sixth gravity\n\n58:51.120 --> 58:53.120\nand play a lot of football or anything.\n\n58:53.120 --> 58:55.120\nI would think that you probably would create,\n\n58:55.120 --> 58:58.120\nindoors, it would be normal gravity, earth gravity.\n\n58:58.120 --> 58:59.120\nProbably.\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:01.120\nYou don't want people like slowly, like, you know...\n\n59:01.120 --> 59:06.120\nBut I mean, given that gravity would have to be artificially induced.\n\n59:06.120 --> 59:07.120\nSure.\n\n59:07.120 --> 59:13.120\nSo which means that making a fun room would be as simple as putting less work into it.\n\n59:13.120 --> 59:17.120\nI guess there would be places you could go where you could go,\n\n59:17.120 --> 59:19.120\nI'm only 30 pounds.\n\n59:19.120 --> 59:22.120\nI don't know if I'd hang out there.\n\n59:22.120 --> 59:27.120\nI think I'd just have a kind of a log cabin feel.\n\n59:27.120 --> 59:31.120\nFor you, the moon in itself, there's nothing special about the moon that is the best thing.\n\n59:31.120 --> 59:33.120\nNo, it's just not on earth.\n\n59:33.120 --> 59:36.120\nYou just hate groups of people and you don't want...\n\n59:36.120 --> 59:42.120\nI don't want to be subject to, yeah, idiot's tyranny.\n\n59:42.120 --> 59:44.120\nAnd then the moon is still free rock.\n\n59:44.120 --> 59:51.120\nI'm afraid of my own extreme abject boredom up there with only a small amount of options.\n\n59:51.120 --> 59:53.120\nBut how many people do you see?\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:57.120\nHow many different places do you go to in a month?\n\n59:57.120 --> 59:59.120\nDozens? Hundreds? I don't know.\n\n59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.120\nHundreds?\n\n01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.120\nAlso, if I want to, I can take a trip, I can go somewhere, I'll leave.\n\n01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.120\nJust the option is enough.\n\n01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.120\nYeah, certainly.\n\n01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.120\nIf you go to New York, it's incredibly calming.\n\n01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.120\nI don't want to live in New York, but I love being in New York\n\n01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.120\nbecause the idea that you can do anything you want at any time of day.\n\n01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.120\nI wish I would stand in a plexiglass cube.\n\n01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.120\nIf somehow you could construct a one where it was like, oh, you're not...\n\n01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:28.120\nYou're allowed to think, say, and feel and do whatever you want while you're standing in this space\n\n01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.120\nand you're not accountable to it at all.\n\n01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.120\nDid you bring someone else in there with you?\n\n01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.120\nNo, I'm saying this is how extreme my alienation is from society.\n\n01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:47.120\nIf I could just have a three-foot-square patch of pee-pee pad for a dog,\n\n01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:55.120\nwhere if I stood on it, I was not capable of being a bad person\n\n01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.120\nfor feeling something or saying something or doing something.\n\n01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.120\nThat would be such a huge guess for me.\n\n01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120\nYou can't do that in a bathroom here.\n\n01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.120\nNo, you cannot.\n\n01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120\nWhy?\n\n01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.120\nYou cannot because there is always going to be something that you can do\n\n01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.120\neven in the privacy of your own home.\n\n01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.120\nYou are always under the fucking rule of morons.\n\n01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.120\nYou are never free.\n\n01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:32.120\nThe moon is literally separate from this planet of just fucking insect people.\n\n01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.120\nThey will get you somehow.\n\n01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.120\nAnd I don't care that there's no oxygen there.\n\n01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.120\nThat's secondary to my goddamn freedom.\n\n01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.120\nI just want to stand somewhere for a little bit.\n\n01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.120\nI love being asleep because they're not fucking with me there.\n\n01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.120\nBut in my dreams, they're still like, stop it.\n\n01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.120\nShut up, knock it off.\n\n01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.120\nTie your shoes.\n\n01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.120\nTake a bath.\n\n01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.120\nBut that's you talking to yourself.\n\n01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120\nThat's them, man.\n\n01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.120\nThat's them.\n\n01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.120\nYeah, society's telling you to take a bath.\n\n01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120\nIt sure is.\n\n01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.120\nI know that this is all just hypothetical in the planning stages,\n\n01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.120\nbut whatever number of people you picked,\n\n01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120\nyou're going to obviously have to pick them\n\n01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.120\nand you're going to have the rules of who they are.\n\n01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.120\nThere's also going to have to be rules of conduct.\n\n01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.120\nAnd my fear is that you are going to become some sort of weird autocratic tyrant.\n\n01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120\nNo, no.\n\n01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.120\nIt will be true anarchy, defined by the fact that there is no...\n\n01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.120\nYou know how like kind of in the Judeo-Christian ethic,\n\n01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120\nand you have lumped in all of them.\n\n01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.120\nWe say Judeo-Christian ethic, that's actually not\n\n01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120\nprobably politically correct anymore.\n\n01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.120\nThe truth is all of the new major religions,\n\n01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.120\nthey all have an anti-murder policy.\n\n01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.120\nIt's like, what is the worst thing that you can do?\n\n01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120\nLike inherently?\n\n01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.120\nWhat is the fiber of evil?\n\n01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.120\nLike any major religion will tell you, yeah, killing another dude.\n\n01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120\nThat's not... don't do that.\n\n01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120\nAnd then they start with the asterisk.\n\n01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.120\nSo, well, if the government wants to...\n\n01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.120\nIf you have to do it for me, I'd love it.\n\n01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.120\nBut on the moon, of course, killing...\n\n01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.120\nThat's not even going to come into the picture.\n\n01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.120\nYou're never going to get there.\n\n01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120\nBefore you even get there,\n\n01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.120\nthe big fucking taboo is going to be hierarchy.\n\n01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:23.120\nAny implication or thirst for it will be condemned.\n\n01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120\nLike frowned upon.\n\n01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.120\nIt won't even be...\n\n01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:34.120\nWhy are you talking to me as if I'm beneath or above you?\n\n01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120\nAt all.\n\n01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.120\nDon't do it.\n\n01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.120\nDon't talk to me like I'm in charge of you,\n\n01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.120\nand don't talk to me like you're in charge of me.\n\n01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:47.120\nNon-hierarchical humanity in a bunch of grapes.\n\n01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.120\nLike existing.\n\n01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.120\nBut hierarchies happen.\n\n01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.120\nWith 100 people, there's going to be hierarchies.\n\n01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.120\nWe are always tempted to do it.\n\n01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.120\nWe're tempted to do lots of things that we have risen above.\n\n01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.120\nIdeally, those hierarchies would be based on knowledge.\n\n01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.120\nBut even that, isn't that still sort of what you don't want?\n\n01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.120\nI have boogers in my nose that will fall out.\n\n01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120\nI have snot in my mucous membranes.\n\n01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120\nI have spit in my mouth.\n\n01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.120\nI have turds in my butt.\n\n01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.120\nWe are born not knowing the alphabet.\n\n01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.120\nWe educate and refine ourselves.\n\n01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.120\nWe rise to something.\n\n01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120\nThere's a mimetic evolution to our species,\n\n01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.120\nin addition to the genetic evolution that we've all but halted\n\n01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120\nfor good reasons by going like,\n\n01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.120\noh, he wears glasses, but I'm hot for him,\n\n01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120\nbecause he's smart.\n\n01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.120\nOkay, so say hello to a myopic species.\n\n01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.120\nBut we chose to advance ourselves over being giraffes\n\n01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.120\nand going like, little bit of the longer neck, please.\n\n01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120\nFuck those guys. They're dead to us.\n\n01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.120\nThese giraffes are going to be dead pretty soon.\n\n01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120\nWe're the only things that have a chance of getting off\n\n01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.120\nof this fucking piece of shit planet.\n\n01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.120\nIt's not a piece of shit planet.\n\n01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.120\nIt's pretty nice. It's got waterfalls.\n\n01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:08.120\nI'm saying that we achieved the ability to be about to do something naturally,\n\n01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.120\nraise our fist, hate something,\n\n01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.120\nand then we go, oh, no, but my species,\n\n01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.120\neven if not biologically, I don't do that.\n\n01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.120\nWhen I was a baby, that was like touching a hot stove.\n\n01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.120\nI don't do that.\n\n01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120\nI don't think about hierarchy.\n\n01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.120\nI have a word for it. I know what it is.\n\n01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.120\nI recognize it when I see it.\n\n01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.120\nI don't hit another person in the face with a toy fire truck,\n\n01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.120\nbecause when I did that the first time when I was one years old,\n\n01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.120\nI was told, don't do that.\n\n01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.120\nI think we have hierarchy now.\n\n01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.120\nI mean, you called most of us insect people.\n\n01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120\nI think that's just how we do sort of...\n\n01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.120\nBecause they love hierarchy.\n\n01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.120\nThat's really weird logic.\n\n01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.120\nBecause they like hierarchy.\n\n01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.120\nIt's ironic logic, but it's not flawed.\n\n01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:06.120\nI look down on people who express hierarchy.\n\n01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.120\nYou look down on people who look down on people.\n\n01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.120\nExactly.\n\n01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120\nOr up to people.\n\n01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.120\nI look down on everybody because we're caught in this infantile thing\n\n01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.120\nof thinking that we need leaders, heroes, government.\n\n01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.120\nAre you fucking kidding me? We're not this smart yet?\n\n01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.120\nThe internet is proving to us.\n\n01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.120\nI understand that it has its own...\n\n01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.120\nThese governance has emerged, but in their infancy,\n\n01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.120\nforums like Reddit and...\n\n01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.120\nThe internet is global.\n\n01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.120\nIf you upvote this, you downvote that.\n\n01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120\nIt's relatively...\n\n01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.120\nIt's not purely devoid of hierarchy,\n\n01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.120\nbut it's functional without hierarchy.\n\n01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120\nIt's like...\n\n01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.120\nIt's not necessary for us to go,\n\n01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.120\nHey, there's Carl. I love Carl.\n\n01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.120\nI love Carl, too. I love Carl. Carl's popular today.\n\n01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.120\nHe doesn't have to get a better parking space.\n\n01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.120\nHe doesn't have to tell us what to do.\n\n01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.120\nThat is infantile.\n\n01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.120\nIt is literally infantile.\n\n01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.120\nIt's an instinct that we carry into adulthood from infancy.\n\n01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.120\nWe start to look at Barack Obama or whoever's running for anything.\n\n01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.120\nWe have democracy.\n\n01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.120\nAt the end of the day, it's got to be somebody's fault when it rains.\n\n01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.120\nIt's not going to be me.\n\n01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.120\nI'm not going to take responsibility for it.\n\n01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.120\nI'm not just going to hang out with my friends\n\n01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120\nas a group, constantly communicate with them.\n\n01:07:29.120 -->

are responsible for everything that happens.\n\n01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.120\nOur species is a terror to the planet.\n\n01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120\nWe know all of this in our heads,\n\n01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.120\nbut we continue to worship heroes and leaders.\n\n01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.120\nBut what do we do to them?\n\n01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.120\nWe crucify them.\n\n01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.120\nWe take people.\n\n01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.120\nWe put them on the covers of magazines.\n\n01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.120\nAnd then we figure out why their piece is a shit.\n\n01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.120\nWe do this over and over and over again in this cycle,\n\n01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.120\nthis ritual of telling ourselves over and over again,\n\n01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.120\nnodding like rain man in the back of a truck with a straight jacket on.\n\n01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120\nWe're going, yeah, change is bad.\n\n01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.120\nChange is bad.\n\n01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not responsible.\n\n01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120\nI'm not responsible at all.\n\n01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.120\nBy the way, the irony of time.\n\n01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.120\nSomebody's got Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.120\nThe irony of, the irony of you saying,\n\n01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.120\nAdam, I am not above you, but don't ever clap for me\n\n01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.120\nbecause it fucks everything up.\n\n01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.120\nI like that you're saying you're not above anyone while\n\n01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:30.120\nwe're all performing in front of a three foot face of you.\n\n01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.120\nAnd we're all at a place called Harmontown.\n\n01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120\nLet's bring Spencer out right now.\n\n01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.120\nSpencer Spencer, will you come join us?\n\n01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:46.120\nThank you.\n\n01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.120\nBut that's anyone, anyone can do this.\n\n01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.120\nAnyone can print a three foot.\n\n01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.120\nBut some people don't want to do it in the fact.\n\n01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120\nExactly.\n\n01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120\nNo, some people don't want to do it.\n\n01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120\nI don't want to do it.\n\n01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120\nI want to go to her show.\n\n01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.120\nI don't, I don't, I don't like Wednesday night if she has a show.\n\n01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.120\nYou don't want to go to her show.\n\n01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120\nWhat's your show?\n\n01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.120\nWhat was the last show you went to?\n\n01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.120\nYou fucking, and also you're talking about responsibility.\n\n01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120\nYou're like...\n\n01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.120\nYeah, you just want to be king of the moon.\n\n01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.120\nI don't just want to be king of the moon.\n\n01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120\nI want to live there.\n\n01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120\nThat's not true.\n\n01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.120\nThat's not true.\n\n01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.120\nHow often do you pick up your dog's poop?\n\n01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.120\nWhat?\n\n01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.120\nHow often do you pick up Harvey's shit?\n\n01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.120\nI don't know, like every eighth shit.\n\n01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.120\nWhat about the other seven?\n\n01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.120\nWho picks up those?\n\n01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120\nOh, Erin.\n\n01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120\nShe doesn't pick up the other seven shits.\n\n01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120\nYeah, she does.\n\n01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.120\nDoes she really?\n\n01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.120\nYeah, what are you, where is she going?\n\n01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120\nI feel like you don't clean your own place.\n\n01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120\nYou rely on other people all the time for other things.\n\n01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120\nLike you're going to be Mr. Responsible on the moon.\n\n01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.120\nYou're going to grow your own food.\n\n01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.120\nYou're going to have a mansion on the moon.\n\n01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120\nYou're not?\n\n01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120\nNo.\n\n01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.120\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120\nI'm going to have a fucking like Buck Rogers cubicle.\n\n01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.120\nLike it's going to be, it's not going to be like it is here.\n\n01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.120\nYou're going to rely on people to do things.\n\n01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.120\nIt's going to be a whole different paradigm shift.\n\n01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.120\nThere's not going to be property up there.\n\n01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.120\nDo you think you're ready to go up there and be responsible for your own survival?\n\n01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.120\nFor your own daily needs?\n\n01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120\nI will have to be.\n\n01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.120\nAnd the hundred people with me will be responsible for each other and ourselves.\n\n01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.120\nAnd we're not going to be like, oh, my house is bigger.\n\n01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.120\nThe idea of a big house, think about how absurd that is.\n\n01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.120\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.120\nDo you know how fucking medieval that is?\n\n01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120\nOh, my house is bigger.\n\n01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120\nDo you know where that comes from?\n\n01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120\nIt's slavery.\n\n01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.120\nThe idea that the patch of earth that you're allowed to occupy is a little bigger.\n\n01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.120\nYou live in a big house right now.\n\n01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.120\nYes, of course I do.\n\n01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120\nThe earth is occupied.\n\n01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.120\nIt's an occupied state.\n\n01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.120\nIt's worth slaves.\n\n01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.120\nI want the biggest house I can fucking get.\n\n01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.120\nI want the most money.\n\n01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.120\nI want a big bag of cocaine.\n\n01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.120\nI want 11 dogs.\n\n01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120\nI want as much luxury.\n\n01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:38.120\nBut above all of that, I'd love to be on a world that didn't have to have that shit.\n\n01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120\nYou don't have to have that here.\n\n01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120\nYou don't have to have that.\n\n01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120\nYou don't have to have that.\n\n01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120\nYou don't have to have that.\n\n01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120\nThe kingdom of God is within you.\n\n01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120\nAnd then police hit you with a stick if you don't have enough.\n\n01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.120\nIt's illegal to be poor here.\n\n01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.120\nThey make your life miserable.\n\n01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.120\nFreedom is a product that they sell you.\n\n01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.120\nYou don't have to have a house called Danadoo.\n\n01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.120\nYou don't have to have that place.\n\n01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:08.120\nLike, yes, we all want big houses because we live on a planet owned by people who have\n\n01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:16.120\nsold us the idea that the amount of space you can walk in is an expression of freedom.\n\n01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.120\nWe were born out of vaginas.\n\n01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.120\nWe had freedom of speech.\n\n01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120\nWe have the freedom of locomotion.\n\n01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.120\nNobody's talking out of a vagina.\n\n01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:33.120\nWe are already allowed to do everything, and we have been convinced that, oh, well,\n\n01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.120\nno, you want to park your car there.\n\n01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.120\nHey, look, man, a lot of people want to park their car there.\n\n01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120\nYou're going to give me $5.\n\n01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.120\nOn that Tuesday, you parked your car there.\n\n01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120\nThat's going to cost you $80.\n\n01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120\nWe've got to clean the streets.\n\n01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.120\nYou've got to tow that thing.\n\n01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.120\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.120\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120\nIt's insanity.\n\n01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.120\nYou're going to be such a nightmare despot.\n\n01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.120\nI'm not going to have to be.\n\n01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120\nI'm going to go up there.\n\n01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.120\nI'm going to have to sleep like a baby for nine hours a day.\n\n01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.120\nYou're going to go up there thinking that you're going to be in control of the mind\n\n01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.120\nof 100 people.\n\n01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:07.120\nThe fact that you picked them already gives you power over everyone else.\n\n01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:15.120\nAnd the fact that you have incredibly bizarre expectations about behavior of a bunch of different minds,\n\n01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.120\na bunch of different entities.\n\n01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.120\nYou're going to get someone to be in charge of a situation.\n\n01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.120\nEven tiny situations need someone to be in charge, right?\n\n01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120\nIs that big red?\n\n01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.120\nWho is that?\n\n01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.120\nMe.\n\n01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.120\nIs that big red?\n\n01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120\nNo.\n\n01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.120\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120\nRyan.\n\n01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.120\nRyan.\n\n01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.120\nHello, Ryan.\n\n01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.120\nI mean, I'm being devil's advocate.\n\n01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.120\nI think that in a properly functioning society, we don't need government.\n\n01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.120\nWe don't need hierarchies.\n\n01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.120\nWe don't need power.\n\n01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.120\nWe don't need to enforce certain people having and holding power over other people.\n\n01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.120\nPeople have the ability in small communities to make decisions as a group.\n\n01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:55.120\nHave there been any sustainable communities that have lasted beyond a few years that have had no hierarchy?\n\n01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.120\nYes, but let me just answer this question really quick and you can answer the specific example that I know you have.\n\n01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:07.120\nThe answer, sir, is when there's a fire, which is what you're talking about,\n\n01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.120\nyou don't have to have hierarchy in order to have a person who is the designated fire marshal.\n\n01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.120\nYou don't have to have hierarchy in order to have responsibility.\n\n01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:27.120\nYou can have 100 people get together and agree on how to get shit done efficiently without anybody being better than anyone else\n\n01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.120\nand having more or less rights than anyone else.\n\n01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.120\nYou can actually just organize as a group of people.\n\n01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.120\nThat is another fucking lie that's been told to us is that anarchy means chaos.\n\n01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.120\nThose are not synonymous words.\n\n01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.120\nAnarchy means not governed.\n\n01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.120\nAnarchy means non-hierarchical.\n\n01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120\nIt means self-governance.\n\n01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.120\nIt means no rule.\n\n01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.120\nAs Mikhail Bakunin said, anarchy is the mother of order.\n\n01:13:51.120 --> 01:14:00.120\nThe idea that capitalism and government enforced unemployment to keep prices at a certain place, enforced famine, war, all this stuff.\n\n01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120\nThat's chaos.\n\n01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.120\nThat's incredible disorder.\n\n01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.120\nThe word anarchy has turned into something else.\n\n01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:18.120\nI believe that people living in communities making their own decisions, like in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and the communes there.\n\n01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.120\nWhen the civil wars happened, the governments fell apart and there was provisional government and everything went to shit.\n\n01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.120\nWomen started throwing off prostitution.\n\n01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.120\nThey started shrugging off machismo and started doing, actually becoming powerful members of society.\n\n01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:37.120\nScholars, teachers, and universities swept up the floors and cleaned the toilets after they were done teaching because they felt pride in their universities.\n\n01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:44.120\nThe buses ran, the sewers got cleaned, and then all of the fascists from both sides, from Franco, who the fuck their names up?\n\n01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:53.120\nThe communists and the fascists, they all looked at these people all living freely and starting to spread across southwestern Europe.\n\n01:14:53.120 --> 01:15:04.120\nThey all just turned their guns on them and annihilated them because the idea that people could actually properly function if educated, if turned on by the idea that humanity actually has an incredible desire to get along.\n\n01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:09.120\nKids in a sandlot absolutely share and they play and they're not bigoted and they're not racist.\n\n01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.120\nWe enforce all this shit on them.\n\n01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.120\nKids are assholes.\n\n01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.120\nNo, we make kids assholes.\n\n01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.120\nKids solve fucking problems beautifully if you let them.\n\n01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:26.120\nIf you don't enforce the idea that guys are cooler than girls and get bullies and doesn't force property and shit like that.\n\n01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.120\nI've seen kids beautifully behavior on each other.\n\n01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:38.120\nIf you give people respect, Tolstoy, even though he was like a landowner, he had all these surfs and he freed them all, but he had these schools and he would let the kids teach themselves.\n\n01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.120\nWhat do you want to learn today?\n\n01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.120\nEverybody learned.\n\n01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:50.120\nIf you could sit wherever you wanted, they had this incredible education and these textbooks that he made were outlawed under Stalinism and stuff because they were so cool because the idea that actually people...\n\n01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120\nIs that what they officially said?\n\n01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.120\nIs that what Tolstoy said?\n\n01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.120\nThe anti-cooler.\n\n01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:03.120\nYou got a Lenin's tomb and there's like a placard that says no cool textbooks.\n\n01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.120\nIt says cool and that no smoking sound around it.\n\n01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:09.120\nIt's like Marxism became a Pringles commercial.\n\n01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:18.120\nI've always been an anarchist at heart, but the idea is the only bummer is that people actually would have to have thought about it and have to be...\n\n01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.120\nWe say take responsibility for your life, but I mean so much more than just saying I'll be responsible.\n\n01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:36.120\nIt's like really like taking care of your children, taking care of your elderly, taking care of yourself, not relying on everybody else to do everything for you, but also being able to shrug off shit like sexism and misogyny and racism\n\n01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:43.120\nand these giant things that we just taught each other to give to necessitate power and people's control over each other.\n\n01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.120\nSounds great, it's been done.\n\n01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.120\nWhat happens is governments come in and assassinate you.\n\n01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.120\nNot on the moon.\n\n01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.120\nBecause there's nothing up there.\n\n01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120\nThere's no oil up there.\n\n01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.120\nThere's no money up there.\n\n01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120\nThere's no diamonds up there.\n\n01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120\nYeah, we have a shit ring protecting us.\n\n01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120\nVery quietly.\n\n01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.120\nI'm off for it.\n\n01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.120\nYou pitch a tent.\n\n01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.120\nI'm off for it.\n\n01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.120\nThere's no restaurants.\n\n01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.120\nI'm off for it.\n\n01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120\nI'm going to need some Mexican food.\n\n01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.120\nWe're going to work on this.\n\n01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.120\nThe way to do that is I'll make the Mexican food.\n\n01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.120\nI'll try my best.\n\n01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.120\nI'll run a little Mexican restaurant.\n\n01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.120\nAnd yes, yes, I am picking the people that are going up there.\n\n01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.120\nBecause you're going to be a king.\n\n01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.120\nIf I go into...\n\n01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:22.120\nNo, because in that town you describe the fucking fascist turn the guns on them because there's people down here.\n\n01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:27.120\nI can't go up there with a bunch of fetuses and hatch them and be one of them too.\n\n01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.120\nI have to pick cool people to end the hierarchy.\n\n01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.120\nI have to pick and choose out of the 7 billion people.\n\n01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.120\nYou have to pick and choose.\n\n01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.120\nIt's a flawed right there.\n\n01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.120\nIt's not a flawed.\n\n01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.120\nIt's the only way it's going to happen.\n\n01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.120\nThat's going to be your slogan you use.\n\n01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.120\nNo, I'm going to wait until someone else does it.\n\n01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.120\nThat's how it's going to happen.\n\n01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120\nHow do you pick?\n\n01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.120\nHow do you know what's the coolest 100 people?\n\n01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120\nI'm going to try.\n\n01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.120\nAnd you're pointing at the insinuation that I'm going to do something?\n\n01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.120\nIs the inherent flaw of doing it?\n\n01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.120\nI'm saying how do you know what the coolest 100 people are?\n\n01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120\nMaybe I won't, N-word.\n\n01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:05.120\nI'm going to fucking take a spectacular attempt.\n\n01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.120\nHow many black people out of 100 are you breaking?\n\n01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.120\n18%.\n\n01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.120\nNo, I don't know.\n\n01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:19.120\nI'm going to have to come up with a methodology that's going to make sure that there's some kind of ethnic blind.\n\n01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120\nI love the idea that you would try to do this.\n\n01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.120\nI just wonder, do you trust yourself to pick the right 100 people?\n\n01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:30.120\nThe truth is, because when you get into that, are you going to go to all seven continents?\n\n01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.120\nIt's going to be English speaking.\n\n01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.120\nIt's going to be American people.\n\n01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.120\nIt's going to be flawed because I want to get it done.\n\n01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.120\nI'm not going to do it perfectly.\n\n01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.120\nI'm going to just do it.\n\n01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120\nI'm not going to do it perfectly.\n\n01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.120\nI'm not going to answer to 1,000 people gathering around me going,\n\n01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:54.120\nwell, if you do it this way, isn't you going to, shut it, I'm doing it.\n\n01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:59.120\nWait, you're saying there's no hierarchy by telling people to shut it.\n\n01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120\nThere's insects people.\n\n01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.120\nA planet of fucking idiots.\n\n01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.120\nI don't like who you've become already, Dan.\n\n01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.120\nI think I might stay on earth for the first few years like breaking bad and waiting until it comes out on DVD.\n\n01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.120\nYou wait it out, but I'm telling you, when you get up there.\n\n01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.120\nIt's going to be great.\n\n01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:21.120\nNo, no, no, you're not getting a wristband to the one fancy restaurant we have.\n\n01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.120\nOh, there's one now?\n\n01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.120\nThere's wristbands!\n\n01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120\nHierarchy!\n\n01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.120\nJudas!\n\n01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.120\nIt starts with wristbands!\n\n01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.120\nLiterally things around your wrist that signify.\n\n01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.120\nIt's going to be for one nightclub that's going to be called Fuck With Jeff.\n\n01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.120\nFine.\n\n01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.120\nSo that when he gets up there, we're going to go, hey, come into the club.\n\n01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.120\nOh shit, you weren't here for the first two years.\n\n01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.120\nYou were waiting it out.\n\n01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.120\nWe just tattooed specific serial numbers on the people who can go.\n\n01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.120\nCan we play a little D&D right now?\n\n01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.120\nCan we try to enforce some of our new anarcho-syndicalism?\n\n01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.120\nCan we try out a little, like, try some of this philosophy?\n\n01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.120\nWhen we fight a spider?\n\n01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120\nYeah, I guess.\n\n01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.120\nHey, Spencer.\n\n01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.120\nHey, guys.\n\n01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120\nWhat do you think, Spencer?\n\n01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120\nDo you believe in me?\n\n01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.120\nI think that you'd run into a problem of you'd have a hierarchy police.\n\n01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.120\nThere'd be people that are like, oh, you're using wristbands, you got to get off the moon.\n\n01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.120\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.120\nBut then they're part of the...\n\n01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.120\nYeah, but that's going to happen because otherwise you'd have hierarchy, right?\n\n01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.120\nThere's got to be a way.\n\n01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120\nThe Vulcans figured out how to...\n\n01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120\nI think humans are fucked.\n\n01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.120\nPeople are clapping because Spencer hates humanity.\n\n01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.120\nYeah.\n\n01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.120\nBut it even sounds like inspiring when he says it.\n\n01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.120\nI mean, the thing is like, you know, like...\n\n01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:45.120\nIf it's true that humans are fucked, then what better way to spend the last decades of our fuckedness\n\n01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.120\njust fucked for the fuck of it, just fucking around with the idea that we're not fucked?\n\n01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.120\nWhy not just...\n\n01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.120\nFine, we're fucked.\n\n01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.120\nWe can be fucked by doing nothing or we can be fucked doing...\n\n01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.120\nTrying.\n\n01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.120\nWe could be fucked trying.\n\n01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.120\nI'm just playing devil's advocate here.\n\n01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.120\nWe're spitballing.\n\n01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.120\nWe're trying to get this right, you know?\n\n01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.120\nI'm asking you the tough questions now.\n\n01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.120\nWhat you guys did tonight was called spitballing.\n\n01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.120\nI felt very persecuted.\n\n01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.120\nAnd I'm really rethinking your moon status.\n\n01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120\nSee?\n\n01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.120\nThis is...\n\n01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.120\nThis is what we're up.\n\n01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120\nDan, I gotta tell you.\n\n01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.120\nYou guys are very hierarchical and it does not please me.\n\n01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.120\nDan.\n\n01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.120\nDan, the idea that you're not going to become a desperate up there, I think, is that you need to look into that.\n\n01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.120\nBecause you're almost certainly going to be disappointed and start making mandates and rules.\n\n01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.120\nWhatever, buddy.\n\n01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.120\nSpencer, what do you think about it all?\n\n01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:38.120\nI had a cat that I named based off of a promise I made ages ago.\n\n01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120\nThat's a really long throwback.\n\n01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.120\nThe bagel?\n\n01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.120\nYeah.\n\n01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.120\nWell, I wrote down one time, I used to carry a journal and I'd just write down thoughts and stuff.\n\n01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.120\nAnd I wrote down, cat named Jason.\n\n01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.120\nAnd then my friend was like, do you want a cat?\n\n01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120\nAnd I was like, okay.\n\n01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.120\nAnd it was a girl, but I named it Jason.\n\n01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.120\nAnd how long did Jason...\n\n01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120\nIs Jason still with you?\n\n01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.120\nJason's still with us.\n\n01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.120\nAnd Jason is great.\n\n01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.120\nShe's digging it.\n\n01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120\nOkay.\n\n01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.120\nAre there going to be animals on the moon?\n\n01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.120\nI'm sorry, I don't mean to go back into this.\n\n01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.120\nNo, that's a good question.\n\n01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.120\nI never thought about that.\n\n01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.120\nWould they get equal rights?\n\n01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.120\nNo.\n\n01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.120\nThe dog gets a vote.\n\n01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.120\nWe're eating kibble every day.\n\n01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:27.120\nNo, I wish that there was a way that we could never leave more than a footprint on another species that we crossed paths with.\n\n01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:37.120\nBut I believe that until we get our shit together, that the most prudent philosophy is to consider humanity to be the absolute most important thing.\n\n01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.120\nWhether or not there'd be dogs and cats up there, I don't know.\n\n01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.120\nThat's a good question.\n\n01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.120\nWe're not disagreeing with you.\n\n01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.120\nWe're challenging you to figure out how this is going to go.\n\n01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.120\nI don't like your dominance over animals already, man.\n\n01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.120\nWe're going to continue this.\n\n01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.120\nThis podcast has now become about colonizing the moon.\n\n01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.120\nWe're going to really do it.\n\n01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120\nHey, where's that guy?\n\n01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.120\nWhere's that guy that worked at that space factory?\n\n01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.120\nWhat was his name?\n\n01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.120\nJesus.\n\n01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.120\nJesus Diaz?\n\n01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.120\nHe moved to Long Beach.\n\n01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.120\nHe moved to Long Beach.\n\n01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.120\nWhich is the moon of Earth.\n\n01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.120\nSo he lived in...\n\n01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.120\nI know the moon is the moon of Earth.\n\n01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:19.120\nHe lives in Long Beach and can't make this show, but we're going to take him to the moon.\n\n01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120\nForget it.\n\n01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.120\nNobody from Long Beach is coming.\n\n01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.120\nI was born in Long Beach.\n\n01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120\nWell, no, but you've transcended it.\n\n01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.120\nThank you.\n\n01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120\nThank you, man.\n\n01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120\nYou know you have.\n\n01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120\nI'm sorry about the...\n\n01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.120\nDon't bring it up again.\n\n01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.120\nWell, that sounds cute.\n\n01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120\nIt sounds like a little robot.\n\n01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.120\nYeah.\n\n01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.120\nYou want to live in a society where that is okay to do, right?\n\n01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120\nI mean, it's funny because it's so wrong.\n\n01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120\nI mean, it's so not accurate, and it's mean, and it's...\n\n01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.120\nYeah, that's not the sound I was going to say we make.\n\n01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120\nDid...\n\n01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120\nDid...\n\n01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.120\nAre you leading in Pakistani culture?\n\n01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.120\nNo.\n\n01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.120\nWe're not, like, taught as kids to go, I'm not even going to do it.\n\n01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.120\nBut...\n\n01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.120\nIs there no...\n\n01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.120\nAre you leading there?\n\n01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120\nNo one does that?\n\n01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.120\nI never saw it once.\n\n01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.120\nOkay.\n\n01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.120\nI was there for 18 years.\n\n01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.120\nOkay, so did it...\n\n01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.120\nMaybe it was done secretly.\n\n01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.120\nOkay.\n\n01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.120\nBut Martin is secretly...\n\n01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.120\nAs long as we're apologizing, I'm sorry, Adam.\n\n01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.120\nI didn't mean...\n\n01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.120\nWhat I said when he stood up and he took a bow, I was just making the observation that it's\n\n01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120\na real problem.\n\n01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.120\nYou said you'd have a statue to him.\n\n01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.120\nHe's doing great.\n\n01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.120\nWhich he's referenced, but it came out...\n\n01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.120\nTheir audience reacted as if I was being a bully and saying,\n\n01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120\nSpine, does it work right?\n\n01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120\nIt's not.\n\n01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.120\nThat's not what...\n\n01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.120\nI'm sorry if it came across like that.\n\n01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.120\nWhat do you think, Adam?\n\n01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.120\nBloom wasn't very good.\n\n01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.120\nBloom, could you do some work?\n\n01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.120\nBut we still love your efforts.\n\n01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.120\nNow, Adam, we adore you.\n\n01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.120\nWe love you.\n\n01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.120\nThank you for coming.\n\n01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.120\nCan I...\n\n01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.120\nCan I share?\n\n01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.120\nI...\n\n01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.120\nI kind of like the boom joke.\n\n01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.120\nIt was better than anything I had.\n\n01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120\nHe came up with...\n\n01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.120\nWhat was the skeleton one the other day?\n\n01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.120\nBone viage.\n\n01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.120\nYeah, that will never be forgotten.\n\n01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.120\nBone viage.\n\n01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.120\nAll right, Spencer, catch us up and we'll do a little anarchist D&D right now.\n\n01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.120\nHold up.\n\n01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.120\nAnd...\n\n01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.120\nLast time on Harmontown.\n\n01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.120\nOur heroes were in the hall of the Jarl of Fornheim.\n\n01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.120\nOh, that didn't tick.\n\n01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.120\nThe frozen city.\n\n01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.120\nThe party hoped to gain some assistance in defeating Admiral Darkstar and ask the Jarl,\n\n01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.120\nLiv Dahl, for aid.\n\n01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.120\nBut the giant noticed right away that they had collected some of the fragments of power\n\n01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.120\nand wanted them for himself.\n\n01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:37.120\nThis remark incensed Sharpie, who railed against the unjolly blue giant, unleashing a verbal\n\n01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.120\nteeth-dicking.\n\n01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:44.120\nThe giant responded by stomping on Sharpie, leaving him dying.\n\n01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.120\nBroken and body, but not mind.\n\n01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:53.120\nMulraine, however, had suffered a broken mind.\n\n01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.120\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.120\nAnd began furiously courting the Jarl's favor.\n\n01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:05.120\nBut Christopher called him out on his bullshit, for which he also suffered a boot to the\n\n01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.120\nhead, but survived.\n\n01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.120\nWeighing the situation, Quark alternated between rage and bargaining, but Sharpie continued\n\n01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.120\nto hurl insults at the giant until the Jarl murdered the dying man, snuffing it out with\n\n01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.120\nhis blue thumb.\n\n01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.120\nAfter an insanity of commotion and action, settled at the same time, Quark decided to\n\n01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:28.120\ntrade shards for a skeleton army and Sharpie's life.\n\n01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:34.120\nAnd Liv Dahl resurrected the slain sorcerer before sending them on their way.\n\n01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:40.120\nNow.\n\n01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.120\nI forgot, that was really intense all we did in that throne room or whatever.\n\n01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.120\nRight, guys?\n\n01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.120\nWe all went through a lot.\n\n01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.120\nMy favorite moment, if I could step out of the thing, was you actually stood up and were\n\n01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.120\nlike, okay, guys, there was a lot of emotions going on.\n\n01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120\nThere were.\n\n01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.120\nThere was a lot going on.\n\n01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:03.120\nI don't think we'll forget the day within the D&D world and also in real life.\n\n01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120\nI know I won't.\n\n01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.120\nSo we have our skeleton army right now.\n\n01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:11.120\nIt seems a little hierarchical right now to have kind of soldiers.\n\n01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.120\nWell, we do the thing that Daenerys Targaryen doesn't give a thrones where they're like,\n\n01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.120\nyou're free, but you can totally still help us out.\n\n01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.120\nI'd say to the skeletons, hey, you're free, but blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:28.120\nYeah, you're free, but if you want to help us out, we did free you.\n\n01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.120\nWe did pick you to come to the moon.\n\n01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:38.120\nIf you want to do me a little favor, here's some wristbands.\n\n01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.120\nI feel like it's unfair to use the wristband.\n\n01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.120\nThat's my joke.\n\n01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.120\nI was joking.\n\n01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.120\nThe wristbands were ironic.\n\n01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.120\nAnd then you guys are like, wristbands, wristbands.\n\n01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120\nThat's the joke.\n\n01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:54.120\nBut the moment they became convenient for your joke, you put another wristband on, man.\n\n01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.120\nWait, I didn't understand that.\n\n01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.120\nHey, man.\n\n01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.120\nYeah, you never will, man.\n\n01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.120\nYou never will.\n\n01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.120\nYou got to hate wristbands to get that joke.\n\n01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:06.120\nYou got to wristband on your mind, man.\n\n01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.120\nYeah, the wristband's not on your wrist, man.\n\n01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.120\nAnatoly, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.120\nYou come from Mother Russia.\n\n01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:18.120\nYour grandparents didn't have hierarchy, kind of, except they had one big hierarchy over them.\n\n01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.120\nAnatoly, we're Tolstoy's books.\n\n01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.120\nTotally cool.\n\n01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.120\nYeah, I like them.\n\n01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120\nYou like them.\n\n01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120\nAll right.\n\n01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.120\nAll right, so we got our army.\n\n01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120\nWhere do we need to get to?\n\n01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.120\nAre we actually going to denierism?\n\n01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.120\nDo you want to make a speech there?\n\n01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120\nYeah.\n\n01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120\nI'm not.\n\n01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120\nI actually don't want to.\n\n01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.120\nI don't think we should do that because they're skeletons that were conjured by a frost giant.\n\n01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.120\nThey're not people.\n\n01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.120\nAre they just things and not people?\n\n01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.120\nDo they have personalities and names?\n\n01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.120\nThey are skeletons, you know.\n\n01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.120\nCan we name them one through 40?\n\n01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.120\nAnd that's how we sort of give them a little bit of...\n\n01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.120\nThat is something you could do.\n\n01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120\nAll right, we went through a lot.\n\n01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.120\nLet's just take our army and let's press forward.\n\n01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.120\nAll right.\n\n01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120\nOne through 40.\n\n01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.120\nWe tattooed the numbers on their wrists.\n\n01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120\nAll right.\n\n01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.120\nSo do we need to get...\n\n01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.120\nNot in a bad way.\n\n01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.120\nDo we need to get directions to where Admiral Darkstar's fortification is?\n\n01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120\nYeah.\n\n01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.120\nI mean, you're still in the giant city.\n\n01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.120\nYou're just not in that palace anymore.\n\n01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.120\nSo...\n\n01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120\nLet's walk to the...\n\n01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.120\nLet's exit the city and go to the Admiral Darkstar thing, right?\n\n01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120\nYeah.\n\n01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.120\nLet's drop by and pay the visit.\n\n01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.120\nYeah.\n\n01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.120\nLet's go.\n\n01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.120\nSo you leave the city heading north towards the Black Keep.\n\n01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.120\nSoon you come to a massive ice canyon, a great rift in the sheer cliff of ice.\n\n01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:37.120\nYou'll have to pass through the canyon in order to reach Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.120\nNo bridge?\n\n01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.120\nWell, no.\n\n01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.120\nIt's like...\n\n01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.120\nIt's like you're at the bottom of a cliff and there's like a canyon going through it.\n\n01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.120\nSo...\n\n01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.120\nSo we should walk into the canyon?\n\n01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.120\nOr you could try and climb up it, but it's hundreds of feet.\n\n01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.120\nYou need more rope, probably.\n\n01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120\nAll right.\n\n01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.120\nCan I climb up it or...\n\n01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.120\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.120\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff.\n\n01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.120\nRight.\n\n01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:59.120\nAnd the only way through the cliff is this canyon that's cutting through the cliff.\n\n01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.120\nOtherwise, you'd have to go up the cliff.\n\n01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.120\nOh, I see.\n\n01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.120\nSo we're being directed into like a tunnel.\n\n01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.120\nYeah.\n\n01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.120\nOkay.\n\n01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.120\nAll right.\n\n01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:11.120\nShould we take a vote with us and also the 40 skeletons?\n\n01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.120\nSkeletons, what do you think?\n\n01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.120\nThey look on.\n\n01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.120\nDead eyes.\n\n01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:22.120\nThe eyes are above the nose.\n\n01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.120\nWell, they're not...\n\n01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.120\nThat's accurate.\n\n01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:26.120\nYeah.\n\n01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.120\nThey're not going to climb anywhere with us.\n\n01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.120\nI mean, we're not going to be crafty.\n\n01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.120\nLet's just proceed into this canyon.\n\n01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.120\nLet's do it.\n\n01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.120\nLet's go.\n\n01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.120\nSkeletons first.\n\n01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:42.120\nInside the canyon, you can hear howling wind, but you feel cold beginning to sink in.\n\n01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:46.120\nYour lack of wintry clothing is beginning to take its toll on your bodies, numbing your\n\n01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.120\nfingers, and biting your skin.\n\n01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:51.120\nCan we take clothes from the skeletons?\n\n01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.120\nSure.\n\n01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.120\nAre they wearing clothes?\n\n01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.120\nThey're wearing heavy black cloaks.\n\n01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120\nYeah.\n\n01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.120\nThey're skeletons.\n\n01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.120\nThey don't have dicks to be ashamed of.\n\n01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:11.120\nThey don't have zipper scars on them.\n\n01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.120\nHow do you think cloaks work, by the way?\n\n01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120\nLike, what do you think?\n\n01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120\nThe cloaks are...\n\n01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.120\nAll right, let's take some cloaks.\n\n01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.120\nAll right.\n\n01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.120\nThat happens.\n\n01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120\nThank you, 37.\n\n01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.120\nThank you, 8.\n\n01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.120\nThank you, 13.\n\n01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:30.120\nYou feel warmer, but still, it's not doing it.\n\n01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.120\nYou're going to have to get out of exposure within the next evening or so.\n\n01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.120\nOtherwise, you might get too cold.\n\n01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:40.120\nIn the canyon, are there any caves that we can sort of...\n\n01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.120\nYou'd have to go deeper in the canyon to try and find something like that.\n\n01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.120\nHow much time do we have before nightfall?\n\n01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.120\nYou know, plenty of time.\n\n01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.120\nI said we press up.\n\n01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.120\nWe have to find shelter, you guys.\n\n01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.120\nLet's move along.\n\n01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.120\nImmediately, you hear a skittering, chittering, chirping sound coming from all around you.\n\n01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.120\nSee?\n\n01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.120\nWe found a forest.\n\n01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:03.120\nWhite, flittering shapes swoop down from above into the canyon.\n\n01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:08.120\nThousands of these strange, chittering, white shapes moving about as if a cloud of gnats.\n\n01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.120\nHello, fairies.\n\n01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.120\nAre you here to warm us?\n\n01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.120\nThat's positive thinking.\n\n01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.120\nThey are not.\n\n01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.120\nHow do we know that they're not?\n\n01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:23.120\nYou just get that sense after you ask the question.\n\n01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.120\nAre they coming straight for us?\n\n01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120\nThey're kind of descending.\n\n01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.120\nIt's kind of descending into the canyon all around you,\n\n01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:34.120\nand you kind of feel the wind whip up, and you feel kind of slashes.\n\n01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120\nI have an armlet of winter.\n\n01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.120\nThat's not going to help.\n\n01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.120\nIt's going to make things more cold.\n\n01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.120\nDon't you have armlets that we can do things with?\n\n01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.120\nI have an armlet of spring, but it's really...\n\n01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.120\nI need to be in a springy environment in order...\n\n01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.120\nI can summon armor of thorny vines,\n\n01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:50.120\nand I can command the vines to blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.120\nThese guys are so small, though.\n\n01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.120\nI don't know how we would...\n\n01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:58.120\nI mean, I'm assuming we have torches lit and stuff?\n\n01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.120\nI know.\n\n01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.120\nOkay, well, I would like to light a torch.\n\n01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.120\nOkay.\n\n01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.120\nAll right, and hold it aloft.\n\n01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.120\nAll right.\n\n01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.120\nYou do that.\n\n01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.120\nYou know, it's the winds whipping around pretty brilliantly,\n\n01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:14.120\nbut you've managed to create, like, the world's best wind block\n\n01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.120\nto light this torch, and that happens.\n\n01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.120\nBut the howling wind at the same time it kind of bites at your guys\n\n01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.120\nis, you know, heals and exposes skin.\n\n01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.120\nYou take two damage each.\n\n01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.120\nWhat the hell?\n\n01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.120\nOh, come on.\n\n01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.120\nAre the skeletons okay with them?\n\n01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.120\nWhat's somebody...\n\n01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.120\nThe skeletons are immune to cold.\n\n01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.120\nI'm using my tooth fillings of hearing voices\n\n01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.120\nto ask that person to repeat what he just shouted out.\n\n01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.120\nMagic.\n\n01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120\nMagic.\n\n01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.120\nElements.\n\n01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.120\nResist.\n\n01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.120\nResist elements.\n\n01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.120\nDo we have that?\n\n01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:50.120\nI don't think we have any magic people up here.\n\n01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.120\nI'm pretty sure Mulrainee does that as well.\n\n01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.120\nShe's watching Breaking Bad.\n\n01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.120\nMulrainee, cast Resist Elements.\n\n01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120\nIs she here?\n\n01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.120\nHow does this work when she's here?\n\n01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.120\nLet's have Anatoly play Mulrainee.\n\n01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.120\nAnatoly, get up here.\n\n01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.120\nTonight, the role of Mulrainee Tadana will be played by Anatoly.\n\n01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.120\nDo you want to give him this?\n\n01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.120\nAnatoly, say I cast Resist Elements.\n\n01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.120\nDon't do it.\n\n01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.120\nBe anarchical about it.\n\n01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:17.120\nOkay, yeah.\n\n01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.120\nI cast Resist Elements.\n\n01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.120\nGood Russian.\n\n01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.120\nOkay.\n\n01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:26.120\nYou guys feel like you're resisting elements.\n\n01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.120\nAll right.\n\n01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.120\nHey, good work, Mulrainee.\n\n01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.120\nWow.\n\n01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.120\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.120\nAll right.\n\n01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.120\nIs it my turn?\n\n01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.120\nYeah.\n\n01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.120\nOkay, this is going to sound crazy.\n\n01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:45.120\nI think we should put on a show.\n\n01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:46.120\nI love shows.\n\n01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.120\nLet's do it.\n\n01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:55.120\nOh my God, we put on a show.\n\n01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:59.120\nShe's going to be so pissed that we did a show.\n\n01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.120\nWe put on the best show ever.\n\n01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.120\nIt's like the Breaking Bad of D&D shows.\n\n01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.120\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:15.120\nWell, I come downstage and I set the stage for, like, it's a period piece.\n\n01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.120\nI go, it'll land without time.\n\n01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.120\nTwo peacocks fell in love.\n\n01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120\nOne from the house of Featherdom.\n\n01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.120\nThe other from the house of Raven.\n\n01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.120\nAnd then the camera cranes up and points down.\n\n01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.120\nAnd it's a Busby Berkeley shot of me like Esther Williams.\n\n01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.120\nAnd I'm swimming around in the snow.\n\n01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:41.120\nAnd all the skeletons are doing a kaleidoscope with their bones.\n\n01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.120\nAnd the gnats are swirling around.\n\n01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.120\nIt's a big, it's a big, huge, like, MGM kind of musical.\n\n01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:56.120\nOh, birds of a feather, never, never together.\n\n01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:02.120\nOh, when

01:36:12.120\nAnd then there's a little, like, a little ice pool.\n\n01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:19.120\nAnd then all the skeletons will land up and they all start diving in like that.\n\n01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.120\nI rub some snow on my face so I have a white beard.\n\n01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:26.120\nAnd then I open a mime door and I come in and go,\n\n01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:30.120\nYou knock it off! You owe me the rent!\n\n01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.120\nBut I can't pay the rent!\n\n01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.120\nYou must pay the rent!\n\n01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.120\nI'll pay the rent!\n\n01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.120\nThat's like, I made a snowman that looks like a hero.\n\n01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:44.120\nAnd then the camera widens out and I've made snowmen out of every character we've met in our entire campaign.\n\n01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.120\nAnd they're all there.\n\n01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.120\nSo it's like a big, huge production number where everybody we've met is just crazy.\n\n01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.120\nAnd I sing a song and everyone's like, oh, here he goes.\n\n01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120\nBut it's a new song.\n\n01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.120\nIt's not Lady in Red.\n\n01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.120\nAnd it's the best fucking song you've ever heard.\n\n01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.120\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:05.120\nIt's moving and funny and inspiring and a catchy tune.\n\n01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.120\nChris de Burgh, we had to come this far for you to be inspired to write a new hit.\n\n01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.120\nAnd all it took was putting on a show.\n\n01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.120\nThank God we had this idea.\n\n01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.120\nMulraine!\n\n01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.120\nAnd at this point...\n\n01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.120\nMulraine, I can't believe that you just sat there and watched it, joined the show at all.\n\n01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.120\nI'm doing nothing because I am after last week's show.\n\n01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:27.120\nSo I'm like, yeah, I have nothing.\n\n01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.120\nShe's not into it.\n\n01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.120\nAnd all the evil gnats are crying through smiles.\n\n01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:37.120\nSuffice it to say, it's a great show.\n\n01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.120\nWe should have a final line for the show, right?\n\n01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.120\nThe moral of the story.\n\n01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.120\nThe more you snow, the less you know.\n\n01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.120\nAnd it makes sense.\n\n01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.120\nIn the context of the show...\n\n01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.120\nMeaning don't snow so much.\n\n01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.120\nIt's too cold out here.\n\n01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.120\nOh my God, so moving.\n\n01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.120\nYou really feel not cold anymore.\n\n01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.120\nYes!\n\n01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:11.120\nOur show's so good, we changed the weather.\n\n01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120\nYeah, so...\n\n01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.120\nAlright, well let's...\n\n01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.120\nI mean, I have more, but that's a great time to end it.\n\n01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.120\nAlright, well is that it?\n\n01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.120\nLet's end it right now.\n\n01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:26.120\nDo you want to put on a cap on the...\n\n01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.120\nAnatoly, do you want to say...\n\n01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.120\nAnatoly, you came up here.
