{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.400\nWhat it is from downtown Los Angeles or downtown adjacent Los Angeles from\n\n00:10.400 --> 00:14.800\nMacArthur Park where Richard Harris sang a really really long terrible song\n\n00:14.800 --> 00:22.140\nabout Carman Town is now in session. Let's bring up. Don't think of it as losing a\n\n00:22.140 --> 00:45.200\ngame master. I think of it as gaining a Rob Schrupp.\n\n00:45.200 --> 00:54.500\nRob Schrupp behind the desk. Where I belong. Where you belong. Where you belong. Let's bring out a mayor for one time.\n\n00:54.500 --> 00:58.500\nYou know him. His name is Dan Harmon.\n\n00:58.500 --> 01:11.000\nThank you. It's cold. It's not cold out here.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:31.300\nThe top of this desk Daniel. The top of this desk is very cold. I'm just feeling air.\n\n01:31.300 --> 01:38.600\nOkay. Thank you. Ask not what you can do for your country.\n\n01:38.600 --> 01:49.100\nAsk what your country can do for you. Where is Spencer? Where is Spencer? What have we done?\n\n01:49.100 --> 02:00.200\nWhere is Spencer? Do we know? I didn't kill him. We just we just we just started\n\n02:00.200 --> 02:06.000\nhaving a big fight in the green room. You and me. I wasn't aware of this. Why? What\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:11.000\ndid you what did you do? It's a diehard. Like you just like I don't even want to\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:15.960\nforget it. I'm sorry I brought it up. What was the beef? It was it was just a\n\n02:15.960 --> 02:23.840\nRob is misremembering diehard stuff. And I just watched diehard again around\n\n02:23.840 --> 02:32.160\nChristmas time because as we all know it's a Christmas movie. And we were\n\n02:32.160 --> 02:36.240\ntalking about the number of times like the runner of John McClain rolling his\n\n02:36.240 --> 02:42.200\neyes at California culture as he arrives. He's going to cross the threshold. So so\n\n02:42.200 --> 02:48.040\nin no necessary order let's enumerate them. You're mixing and matching like\n\n02:48.040 --> 02:52.680\nthere are women hitting on him. That's about his marriage to Holly Gennaro.\n\n02:52.680 --> 02:58.160\nYes. Okay. The flight attendant. Yes. I almost called her a stewardess but that\n\n02:58.160 --> 03:03.680\nwould have been fine in diehard times. She gives him Google eyes and he's like\n\n03:03.680 --> 03:10.680\nwhatevs. I think that's just no he's he's my perception is he's like it's gonna be\n\n03:10.680 --> 03:16.440\ndifficult. It's gonna be difficult to to not fuck people that aren't my wife. He\n\n03:16.440 --> 03:22.080\nflew out to why are they getting a divorce? Why is because because she chose\n\n03:22.080 --> 03:27.280\nher career and went to New York and he was like in a like a silently abusive\n\n03:27.280 --> 03:30.920\nmale who was like not putting his hands on her but was like I'm a New York cop.\n\n03:30.920 --> 03:37.440\nHe explains this all to Argyle. Like he has no reason to lie. He explains it to\n\n03:37.440 --> 03:43.600\nArgyle. He goes I'm a New York cop. Like I got cases to solve. I'm not gonna up and\n\n03:43.600 --> 03:50.160\nleave for Los Angeles. Who's Argyle? Oh the the the fucking limo. See all right. I don't know. There was a guy in the\n\n03:50.160 --> 03:54.280\nin the in the in the plane that said take your socks off and I thought oh his\n\n03:54.280 --> 04:00.880\nname is Argyle that makes sense but I was wrong. Oh is that that it's kind of a\n\n04:00.880 --> 04:08.080\nDavid Lynch thing right? There's like one guy says take your socks off. My name is\n\n04:08.080 --> 04:11.960\nCommander Soxson like that that would be like a David Lynch thing like but you\n\n04:11.960 --> 04:18.960\nforget what I was you never got a chance to let me finish my thought that the\n\n04:18.960 --> 04:23.600\nwhole reason like there is a there is a the first person to play John McClane\n\n04:23.600 --> 04:29.480\nwas Frank Sinatra. Oh right yeah no that's very interesting to me. I'm not\n\n04:29.480 --> 04:35.320\nbeing sarcastic. Yes because they made they're okay so Die Hard is made on up\n\n04:35.320 --> 04:40.360\nis based off of a book. I don't know the name of the book. Somebody look it up\n\n04:40.360 --> 04:43.400\nall right. I'm sure it's out there somewhere. Anyway it's just snakes on a\n\n04:43.400 --> 04:52.240\nplane. Snakes on a plane. The original 1934 Joseph Conrad novel. Okay so there\n\n04:52.240 --> 04:57.320\nso Die Hard the book it's not called Die Hard the book but let's just say Die\n\n04:57.320 --> 05:05.040\nHard the book is a sequel to another story of another book featuring John\n\n05:05.040 --> 05:09.280\nMcClane that was already made into the into a movie starring Frank Sinatra. So\n\n05:09.280 --> 05:13.040\nthe character's name was John McClane? I think so but it's based off of the it's\n\n05:13.040 --> 05:16.600\nthe same series. I think they switched it up a little bit. I don't know. I haven't\n\n05:16.600 --> 05:24.840\nseen this movie. I would like to hang out with you. So Frank Sinatra played a\n\n05:24.840 --> 05:29.840\ncharacter in a film called John and the character's name was John McClane. It's\n\n05:29.840 --> 05:33.040\na I don't I think they might have changed the name or whatever. I don't know\n\n05:33.040 --> 05:38.160\nI don't have it in front of me but it is the thing the point is is that when they\n\n05:38.160 --> 05:42.880\nmade Die Hard they had to go to Frank Sinatra who I think was in his 70s at\n\n05:42.880 --> 05:48.080\nthe time and say hey do you want to play John McClane. Contractually they had to\n\n05:48.080 --> 05:54.280\ngo to him and he would what no and and they went oh okay because we already cast\n\n05:54.280 --> 06:01.760\nit with somebody else. Okay so some problems solve themselves. Well he was\n\n06:01.760 --> 06:06.040\n70 he's not gonna do Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker and shooting the glass and\n\n06:06.040 --> 06:11.680\nthe hose walking you know he's not gonna do that. He's 70 so Frank Sinatra but\n\n06:11.680 --> 06:15.920\nshe's 70 man. They got Sinatra Ranch a helicopter landed and like two guys could\n\n06:15.920 --> 06:21.200\ncome out in suits with take their hats off. Mrs. Sinatra is Frank home. She's\n\n06:21.200 --> 06:25.560\nlike she opens the door wider and he comes with the IV bag on the rack and\n\n06:25.560 --> 06:33.480\nhe's like what do you want baby and and they go Mr. Sinatra do you want to\n\n06:33.480 --> 06:42.640\nplay a 1982 action hero or 1986, 87 when was Die Hard? Do you want to play do you\n\n06:42.640 --> 06:48.480\nwant to do you want to pick up where the star wait were you either gonna use you\n\n06:48.480 --> 06:54.680\nor this or the star of the Seagrams wine cooler commercials. And he said ring a\n\n06:54.680 --> 07:00.200\nding ding Jack. Okay good we're glad you said that because Jesus Christ that was\n\n07:00.200 --> 07:06.800\na close one because we're halfway through shooting. Ring a ding ding Jack instead\n\n07:06.800 --> 07:12.760\nof Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker. This is kind of a sequel to last week's show\n\n07:12.760 --> 07:17.640\nbecause you were saying Yippee-ki-yay references. I was. Is that a question?\n\n07:17.640 --> 07:22.400\nYeah listen to the recording. Was I here? All right well I apologize for the\n\n07:22.400 --> 07:29.280\nshow tonight it's rainy no one wants to be here except you guys I'm sure and\n\n07:29.280 --> 07:32.240\nwe'll make it worth your while.

road of what the Adams family\n\n09:47.520 --> 09:51.240\nlike the bits they'd be doing it would be like I can't even I can't even riff\n\n09:51.240 --> 09:56.040\nexamples I'll get booed off the

whale of a Tesla coming to a halt and\n\n13:20.240 --> 13:24.200\nshe kind of like like lip-sync some stuff and I can't hear her because of my\n\n13:24.200 --> 13:30.680\namazing car that seals off all sound and air and she kind of like jogs away a\n\n13:30.680 --> 13:36.960\nmute a mute poor person calling her pointless cries into the filthy air\n\n13:36.960 --> 13:43.520\nthat I don't have to

and keep answering yeah\n\n19:58.960 --> 20:06.840\nso I just stuff like that and then my life and then my son and you know and my\n\n20:06.840 --> 20:11.680\nson has had had some very young when he was 20 and then he found out he had\n\n20:11.680 --> 20:17.440\nautism my time was 22 and and I kind of was just like I think I just had enough\n\n20:17.440 --> 20:21.000\nthings kind of tweak my brain where I was like oh I know what I want to do and\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:26.040\nI'm gonna just try to do this and and once I started getting a little it wasn't\n\n20:26.040 --> 20:29.840\nalways good I was a you know in my early 20s I wasn't like a great person I\n\n20:29.840 --> 20:34.480\ndidn't know I was doing I was a float just kind of being like a shitty nerd you\n\n20:34.480 --> 20:38.080\nknow when you know when you're like oh I get picked on and things have been bad\n\n20:38.080 --> 20:42.400\nfor me so my life owes me shit right you know and then I just had a point where\n\n20:42.400 --> 20:47.640\nI realized like nothing was coming to me I had to go and get whatever I was\n\n20:47.640 --> 20:54.760\ngoing to get and were there any moments like that you remember where you that\n\n20:54.760 --> 21:01.120\nwere like like external stimulations whether they were like events or\n\n21:01.120 --> 21:05.240\nconversations where you were like oh and from that and then that's when I\n\n21:05.240 --> 21:09.360\nrealized oh shit I've been doing this this way and I should do it this way\n\n21:09.360 --> 21:13.200\nnow instead like like were there any like defining moments is where it was\n\n21:13.200 --> 21:19.600\nwhere I don't know I'm I mean my is what I'll undercut and then I'll I mean the\n\n21:19.600 --> 21:25.480\nmost moment that I think that put me into like high gear and my most\n\n21:25.480 --> 21:30.760\nmotivating moment was a little bit after I found out my son was diagnosed with\n\n21:30.760 --> 21:35.600\nautism and then I went into this park that I had always taken my son to when\n\n21:35.600 --> 21:39.600\nhe was young and younger he was two at the time he was diagnosed so I'm just\n\n21:39.600 --> 21:43.480\nlike one or this is also the same park that I used to smoke weed in when I was\n\n21:43.480 --> 21:47.200\nin high school and me and my girlfriend would just go hang out and make out there\n\n21:47.200 --> 21:53.040\nwho eventually was my ex-wife and and we're there and we find out that you\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:56.160\nknow we're just kind of shell-shocked and just kind of talking about it and then\n\n21:56.160 --> 22:00.720\nwe see like a group of disabled adults and their caretakers kind of pull\n\n22:00.720 --> 22:05.960\nup to the park as well and the way that the caretakers spoke to them and\n\n22:05.960 --> 22:11.640\ntreated them was very dismissive and very cruel and you treat them more like\n\n22:11.640 --> 22:17.480\nif they were prisoners than then people to be looked after and at that point I\n\n22:17.480 --> 22:23.040\nwas like oh I have to figure out a career I have to figure out something this\n\n22:23.040 --> 22:27.840\nis bigger than me and whatever I'm doing like I guess this is before that you\n\n22:27.840 --> 22:34.200\nstarted doing comedy yeah so and then you chose comedy out of that epiphany\n\n22:34.200 --> 22:38.760\nyeah so were you I just want to it's where for you guys to be on other each side\n\n22:38.760 --> 22:46.520\nlike this the that just focusing in on that moment just to understand it you\n\n22:46.520 --> 22:53.560\nyou this caretakers being flippant abusive whatever as if they were like\n\n22:53.560 --> 22:58.720\nprisoners then we're yelling at where you was your epiphany because you felt\n\n22:58.720 --> 23:03.920\nlike oh that's a shitty person and then did you see a little bit of your like\n\n23:03.920 --> 23:07.440\noh I've been a shitty person other where you thinking like I never want to be\n\n23:07.440 --> 23:10.640\nthat person I was more like I don't want to be like that and it was more like I\n\n23:10.640 --> 23:14.480\ndon't want that for my son and it would I guess I'm I guess I'm not really fun\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:18.160\nokay when you're thinking it's more this is more motivating than me as a person I\n\n23:18.160 --> 23:24.720\nthink that anything is me as a person has been just well no way no that's good\n\n23:24.720 --> 23:27.880\nlike this story that's good that you're because I'm a narcissist so I'm thinking\n\n23:27.880 --> 23:32.800\nabout filing things oh you're a narcissist yeah really shocked you told\n\n23:32.800 --> 23:35.640\nthe story about you almost killed the lady you're like I could have been laid\n\n23:35.640 --> 23:48.320\nshe shouldn't have dressed like a ninja she had a bright white sweater on so like\n\n23:48.320 --> 23:52.360\nlike immediately caught myself revising I was like I'm gonna describe this story\n\n23:52.360 --> 23:55.800\nthis is something interesting to talk about she was dressed so darkly and like\n\n23:55.800 --> 24:02.880\nshe had a fucking white sweater on stop it but the but no the the idea that so\n\n24:02.880 --> 24:06.040\nyour answer the question is more interesting because you're feeling you\n\n24:06.040 --> 24:11.680\nfelt empathy for the disenfranchised in that moment and so what you were\n\n24:11.680 --> 24:20.280\nfeeling was those people need someone to be better for them and and only people\n\n24:20.280 --> 24:24.000\nthat are in a position to be better for them are people that have that option\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.120\nand that that invited you upward to that plane is what I'm kind of\n\n24:28.120 --> 24:31.280\ninterpreting well mostly it was just like I gotta make a lot of money so my\n\n24:31.280 --> 24:40.920\nson's never in this fucking position okay wow but did and you were what 22 you\n\n24:40.920 --> 24:47.400\nsaid at the time mm-hmm and so you said I gotta make this money and did you when\n\n24:47.400 --> 24:51.120\nwas the decision to go to comedy like were you already kind of leaning in\n\n24:51.120 --> 24:54.360\nthat direction that yeah I always wanted to do it you know it's just the thing\n\n24:54.360 --> 24:58.880\nthat I was interested in but I think it was a real job and so I was like I knew\n\n24:58.880 --> 25:02.960\nI needed a career and not just a job I was working at like this bank call\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:08.040\ncenter and I hated it and I knew that I couldn't stay there what part of town\n\n25:08.040 --> 25:13.400\nwere you in and Salem or again yeah and so do you start like like doing open\n\n25:13.400 --> 25:19.320\nmics and like yeah I start doing mics in Portland and and and then there's this\n\n25:19.320 --> 25:23.040\nChinese food restaurant in Salem that has this show but it's called Lucky\n\n25:23.040 --> 25:27.720\nFortune I've been there it's good in there yeah yeah so you know they would do\n\n25:27.720 --> 25:31.440\nshows and you get Chinese food and the guy would sell bootleg movies after the\n\n25:31.440 --> 25:36.640\nshows and it was just a good place for you to cut your crack cut your teeth you\n\n25:36.640 --> 25:41.800\nknow it was like they had an open mic there no just a show it was a show but\n\n25:41.800 --> 25:47.880\nit wasn't good and so much might as well he'd always just lie and be like I\n\n25:47.880 --> 25:56.200\nremember for years he he he was telling me that this this I already forgot the\n\n25:56.200 --> 26:01.520\nname another story gonna be horrible so never mind but what do you do I'm\n\n26:01.520 --> 26:06.520\ncurious so you you if you have that epiphany so it's like it's your Buddha\n\n26:06.520 --> 26:12.240\nmoment you're like okay I like like my kid I if he slips through my fingers\n\n26:12.240 --> 26:16.560\nhe's gonna end up a ward of people like this guy that you saw in the park and so\n\n26:16.560 --> 26:21.840\nthen you go I gotta do what I love not just I gotta go get a job managing a\n\n26:21.840 --> 26:25.880\nfactory floor like it's about money but it's also about following your bliss so\n\n26:25.880 --> 26:31.720\nwhat does somebody young do when they decide they want to take comedy\n\n26:31.720 --> 26:36.040\nseriously like what are your first steps what you're like sitting there with a\n\n26:36.040 --> 26:42.200\nmanila a legal pad and a pencil or like like like describe those days yeah I\n\n26:42.200 --> 26:47.200\nwould I mean back then I was like right out full scripts of my jokes and stuff\n\n26:47.200 --> 26:53.360\nand I'd like go over them and and try to memorize every word and did you include\n\n26:53.360 --> 26:57.760\npeople laughing in your head like like yeah and then I'll pause and then there'll\n\n26:57.760 --> 27:04.320\nbe all this laughter is it hold for applause and then I would even like fact\n\n27:04.320 --> 27:09.440\ncheck my jokes thing like oh if someone someone here's this joke they might call\n\n27:09.440 --> 27:17.160\nme out on the on the background so I better know about this that's very for\n\n27:17.160 --> 27:22.800\nthat for whatever that era was it's probably a little overly responsible of\n\n27:22.800 --> 27:30.200\nyou yeah no I over over prepare you were ready for today you're like vetting\n\n27:30.200 --> 27:37.120\nyour stand-up against the the ears of 25 million angry people what was a\n\n27:37.120 --> 27:42.800\nthreshold Ron from like being an open miker and then like did you did you move\n\n27:42.800 --> 27:49.280\nto LA right away or no that would have been a bad decision but the front the\n\n27:49.280 --> 27:53.360\nthreshold from being like I'm gonna try this out to going oh this is working and\n\n27:53.360 --> 27:59.280\nlike I'm I'm now like like you're you're headlining you you're being like top\n\n27:59.280 --> 28:05.280\nman I mean it took a little while you know I was doing shows and just going\n\n28:05.280 --> 28:10.160\naround the country and I had my friend Will who would drive us around in his\n\n28:10.160 --> 28:14.800\nmom's minivan and we would go and do shows and in book shows up and down\n\n28:14.800 --> 28:19.120\nSalem and in other parts of Oregon in the northwest we just go to\n\n28:19.120 --> 28:22.240\ndifferent bars and just try to convince them the book of show and that we could\n\n28:22.240 --> 28:25.540\nbring an audience in and we booked one show and then they realized that we\n\n28:25.540 --> 28:32.320\ncould not and so so we would just continue and move on that way and I did\n\n28:32.320 --> 28:35.360\nthat for a couple years and then just started getting better and getting more\n\n28:35.360 --> 28:40.720\nname for myself and I would just you're making deals you were like Jim\n\n28:40.720 --> 28:44.120\nhenshinning it like the way he like sold the Muppet show and syndication you were\n\n28:44.120 --> 28:48.800\ngood at it you didn't have an agent that was like this here's Ron Funches and I'm\n\n28:48.800 --> 28:52.560\ngonna book you on this circuit you're gonna open for so-and-so you work in\n\n28:52.560 --> 28:58.240\nthis business you I don't start with hey yeah no I had to book my own shows in a\n\n28:58.240 --> 29:01.440\nlot of my you're going to bars and convincing them to have a venue in the\n\n29:01.440 --> 29:03.920\nfirst place so that you could perform there and then you're making a deal with\n\n29:03.920 --> 29:08.040\nthem like take part of the door yeah yeah yeah me and my friend we kind of like\n\n29:08.040 --> 29:12.320\nwas my business partner and we just do that together he would we go scout\n\n29:12.320 --> 29:18.560\nlocations and just try to make deals and I ran around my own weekly show and\n\n29:18.560 --> 29:22.720\na coffee house and and those were them like the most pressure filled days\n\n29:22.720 --> 29:26.960\nbecause a lot of times that would be like I was like oh I need to pass this hat\n\n29:26.960 --> 29:31.480\naround for money so that I can come home and bring my son and my my ex-home food\n\n29:31.480 --> 29:36.560\nand stuff you know I didn't I wasn't making like any money at that time what\n\n29:36.560 --> 29:42.400\ndo you say I mean there is like there are people in the world probably half of\n\n29:42.400 --> 29:49.640\nmy listeners like the idea of inoffensive comedy like it sounds like a\n\n29:49.640 --> 29:54.880\npejorative in terms of comedy oxymoronic contradictory the idea that you could be\n\n29:54.880 --> 29:58.560\nfunny without hurting people without taking anybody down without like\n\n29:58.560 --> 30:03.240\nattacking without having without without wounding and things but you're pretty\n\n30:03.240 --> 30:11.800\nmuch like your stand-up is giggle fit is a comedy central you also got your well\n\n30:11.800 --> 30:15.400\nwe'll talk about getting better in a second but but but like you would you\n\n30:15.400 --> 30:19.200\nyou you characterize your goal when you get on stage or maybe not your goal but\n\n30:19.200 --> 30:23.720\nlike your MO is like you don't you're not you're not leaving a body count right\n\n30:23.720 --> 30:27.520\nyou're not you're not like you're not hurting people I never understood that\n\n30:27.520 --> 30:32.880\nas a theme of what comedy needs to be that there are I mean sure sometimes you\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:37.160\nattack things but I think your job as a comedian I'm a student of comedy I love\n\n30:37.160 --> 30:41.960\ncomedy I've loved comedy since I was a young child and everything every good\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:47.160\ncomedian I saw it was like you you you speak truth to power you take down\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:52.720\npeople bigger than you you point out the inconsistencies in the status quo you\n\n30:52.720 --> 30:57.560\ndon't just attack people to attack people you don't just go like okay like\n\n30:57.560 --> 31:01.920\nMexicans or this like that like you're that's building the status quo that's\n\n31:01.920 --> 31:07.160\nreinforcing like what people are saying when when when your job usually is that\n\n31:07.160 --> 31:11.200\nyou're as a jester you don't make fun of the towns people you make fun of the\n\n31:11.200 --> 31:15.120\nking you know so like I I take that job think that\n\n31:15.120 --> 31:22.080\nseriously so do you do some do you do some punching up in your opinion I mean\n\n31:22.080 --> 31:27.280\nis it like like it's it is punching but it's punching up I mean a little bit for\n\n31:27.280 --> 31:33.120\nmost part I'm also very I mean I guess I would say I'm narcissistic in my own\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:38.320\nways in the regard like I prefer just talking about me in my life and what's\n\n31:38.320 --> 31:43.880\ngoing on that's what's exciting to me I've never been excited about those type\n\n31:43.880 --> 31:48.520\nof things I mean I think my mom my mom just my mom just said she's like we're\n\n31:48.520 --> 31:55.360\njust she's like we're not very passionate people she's just explaining that\n\n31:55.360 --> 31:58.520\nto company when they come over yeah you have to understand the punches are not\n\n31:58.520 --> 32:04.240\npassionate people I don't care about much I care about my son I care about my\n\n32:04.240 --> 32:12.640\nfamily I care about few things but like I it would be very just not truthful of\n\n32:12.640 --> 32:17.280\nme to go up there and be this is what I'm talking about this is what I'm upset\n\n32:17.280 --> 32:21.640\nright I gotta I got ten minutes about about abortion legislation because I'm\n\n32:21.640 --> 32:25.920\nlike so focused on that because I have so many right like last year there was\n\n32:25.920 --> 32:29.920\nlike six comedy specials I watched a lot of comedy specials and stuff still\n\n32:29.920 --> 32:34.360\nlike six last year all with like he's Caitlyn Jenner jokes I know it's even\n\n32:34.360 --> 32:40.120\nhacked even talk about nothing but I was just like why did you guys care so much\n\n32:40.120 --> 32:46.320\nwho what did you give a fuck like who you that's how you spend your day yeah\n\n32:46.320 --> 32:52.440\nwe're sitting around thinking about Caitlyn Jenner and what Caitlyn Jenner\n\n32:52.440 --> 32:59.640\nnot a person worth talking about whoa shots fire I think this cycle that\n\n32:59.640 --> 33:03.800\nhappens my theory about it is from talking to my therapist about just like\n\n33:03.800 --> 33:07.680\ngenerally like about how positive and negative shit sticks and whatever and\n\n33:07.680 --> 33:13.840\nhow negative shit sticks so much easier and then so it's like jokes that we\n\n33:13.840 --> 33:21.400\nremember they're they're they're often attached to satire and like like like\n\n33:21.400 --> 33:26.160\nsomebody gets taken down a peg or something happens something shifts oh\n\n33:26.160 --> 33:30.920\nthat person made that joke and then that was like a kaboom yeah and and it\n\n33:30.920 --> 33:34.560\nsticks in your memory for the same reason that and if somebody says like oh\n\n33:34.560 --> 33:39.440\nyou're wearing that shirt again sticks yeah I like your shirt yeah which doesn't\n\n33:39.440 --> 33:44.720\nstick at all yeah and so I think when people are in the nation stages of\n\n33:44.720 --> 33:49.640\ntheir comedic ambitions they're kind of like how do I be funny and they and they\n\n33:49.640 --> 33:54.920\nand they sit by that stream of society and they go well most important thing\n\n33:54.920 --> 33:59.600\nis I'll sit here I'll watch some stuff and I'll try to think about like what\n\n33:59.600 --> 34:02.720\nwhat I might say that would be funny about it and they're gonna tend to slide\n\n34:02.720 --> 34:07.480\ninto well what would I say that would be taken this thing apart you know a kind\n\n34:07.480 --> 34:13.640\nof Joel McHaling the Kardashians or you know David spading the the whatever's\n\n34:13.640 --> 34:18.680\nlike and it because that's the stuff that kind of spikes on the on the EKG I\n\n34:18.680 --> 34:25.400\nguess it's it it sticks in your memory yeah but yeah like Steve Martin I my\n\n34:25.400 --> 34:29.880\nmemory of him is like he'd come out and he would just do this like weird one\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:35.360\nperson show it was just it was just humor it was absurd and well I just think\n\n34:35.360 --> 34:40.080\nit's easier you know it's easier to tear apart and to build you know so like\n\n34:40.080 --> 34:45.880\nwhen you're trying to actually build jokes that don't do that it just takes\n\n34:45.880 --> 34:51.360\nlonger it's harder sometimes people don't don't get them right away the beauty\n\n34:51.360 --> 34:55.360\nof Steve Martin stuff was that he was clearly intellectual but he was silly\n\n34:55.360 --> 35:01.720\nand so we got to watch an intellect be stupid like for us and it was so crazy\n\n35:01.720 --> 35:07.000\nto me to watch those old ones and be like this is a stadium yeah full of\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:15.280\npeople watching the guy put a arrow and he would go I'm a wild and crazy guy and\n\n35:15.280 --> 35:19.600\nthe whole place with like Madison Square Garden would cheer it's crazy you\n\n35:19.600 --> 35:22.040\nknow it's interesting though is talking about this family tree of comedy or\n\n35:22.040 --> 35:27.480\nwhatever you call it like the he was never personal he wouldn't go yeah so\n\n35:27.480 --> 35:31.680\nhere's what's going on with me neither was he political so George Carlin very\n\n35:31.680 --> 35:35.360\npolitical not a lot of personal to George Carlin right like George Carlin\n\n35:35.360 --> 35:38.720\nwouldn't like pause take a glass of water break down ago so anyways I'm\n\n35:38.720 --> 35:44.800\nmarried etc Bill Cosby drew all these stories from from marriage and children\n\n35:44.800 --> 35:49.520\nbut like how transparent was it you're very personal you talk about raising an\n\n35:49.520 --> 35:54.880\nautistic kid you talk about like like your life like I don't I have no\n\n35:54.880 --> 35:59.360\nquestion about this I just like wanted to like go into that area like like when\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:04.040\nyou're if you're sitting and you're going I think I'll share this thing about\n\n36:04.040 --> 36:09.680\nraising being a single dad raising autistic kid like are there ground rules\n\n36:09.680 --> 36:15.320\ndo you think to yourself like is my kid gonna be 30 and and and listen to this\n\n36:15.320 --> 36:19.160\non a hologram disc one day and get the wrong idea what are the thoughts that\n\n36:19.160 --> 36:22.920\ngo through your head in terms of filtration I probably should think more\n\n36:22.920 --> 36:31.640\nabout it and you should yeah but I just kind of I just like to talk about what I\n\n36:31.640 --> 36:35.400\nlove and I just try to talk about it with love you know I think that's been\n\n36:35.400 --> 36:39.840\nmy main goal is to make sure people you know talk about my son in particular I\n\n36:39.840 --> 36:43.920\njust want to make sure people knew that I wasn't making fun of him and I wasn't\n\n36:43.920 --> 36:48.760\ntrying to be like oh my son has this disability and this is what's funny\n\n36:48.760 --> 36:52.760\nabout it right it's more like this is just a part of my life this is my son he\n\n36:52.760 --> 36:57.120\ndoes some funny things all right and these are some just other misunderstandings\n\n36:57.120 --> 37:01.200\nthat have happened this is just a part of my life so I just always try to do\n\n37:01.200 --> 37:05.280\nthat same thing with my mom the same thing with anyone that I talk about I\n\n37:05.280 --> 37:11.440\njust try to make sure I don't you know you know Louie CK and just making\n\n37:11.440 --> 37:22.160\neverything you know ah my fucking kids yeah I I yeah I mean I have stuff to say\n\n37:22.160 --> 37:28.880\nabout that I like like Louie's style was is so like he would pace the stage like\n\n37:28.880 --> 37:31.920\na caged animal and he would talk like Charlie Brown and it had this like\n\n37:31.920 --> 37:40.040\nviscera to it and he like but it was like is it is it bad to do that if it if if\n\n37:40.040 --> 37:43.560\nit's not actually transparent if it's like a periscope that's bouncing off of\n\n37:43.560 --> 37:47.760\ntwo mirrors is it like yeah and does any of that matter if is it hockey of\n\n37:47.760 --> 37:52.360\nVellion where it's like well they're they laughed so but I'm like yeah but what\n\n37:52.360 --> 37:56.280\nif they're laughing at like because they think that you're real what if they think\n\n37:56.280 --> 38:01.520\nthat Tim Allen really does go home and go oh yeah and like like I don't know I\n\n38:01.520 --> 38:04.480\ndon't know what crimes are being committed when or what what comedy is\n\n38:04.480 --> 38:10.520\nsupposed to be I think you never want to be too far from your from you who you\n\n38:10.520 --> 38:14.600\nare there's a thing you know with any performance and performers I'm a big\n\n38:14.600 --> 38:19.920\neverybody who know me know I love wrestling and if any really good\n\n38:19.920 --> 38:24.680\nwrestlers are always like a turned up version of themselves and I feel like\n\n38:24.680 --> 38:30.120\nthat's what I try to be as a performer is that like you know you're usually\n\n38:30.120 --> 38:35.960\ncatching me at my happiest at my most jovial where I'm trying to have fun is\n\n38:35.960 --> 38:40.320\nthat me 24-7 not at all right but that's when what I'm trying to put forth at\n\n38:40.320 --> 38:45.920\nthat time you know and I just try to make sure that I I think when you're you as\n\n38:45.920 --> 38:51.000\na human get too far away from your act that's when things start to crumble and\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:54.880\nfall apart from you in all and life in all regards and I just that's why I\n\n38:54.880 --> 38:59.600\nwrite personally and that's why I try to change up my act and I'm never I\n\n38:59.600 --> 39:03.640\nalways when I first started I always hated when I see a comedian perform and\n\n39:03.640 --> 39:10.800\nit'd be like me and my girlfriend and then they go oh I'm single I got\n\n39:10.800 --> 39:16.960\nmarried recently tell me the truth now I don't trust anything that you're\n\n39:16.960 --> 39:21.360\nsaying it is weird like I'm willing to go with you on any ride as long as you\n\n39:21.360 --> 39:27.960\nset up the rules and then follow those fucking rules yeah it is it is weird\n\n39:27.960 --> 39:31.360\nbecause they were there was that wave of stand-up where it was like it was look\n\n39:31.360 --> 39:35.200\nwe're not gestures anymore we're not we're not wearing makeup we're not\n\n39:35.200 --> 39:39.360\nand it was even past then there was the you know past the Judy T'Nuta phase we've\n\n39:39.360 --> 39:44.600\nhad like we're I love to do that but I'm not bagging on that phase I like Bob\n\n39:44.600 --> 39:47.520\nGoldweights but you know was part what is it was like there was that phase of\n\n39:47.520 --> 39:50.640\nstand-up where it was like another form of purity where it was like fuck it then\n\n39:50.640 --> 39:54.680\nwe're all characters you know emo Phillips is an amazing joke writer and\n\n39:54.680 --> 39:58.240\nlike is he doing a character is he not you meet him in person you're like kind\n\n39:58.240 --> 40:03.400\nof the same guy etc like that kind of like pedal to the metal character\n\n40:03.400 --> 40:08.560\ncomedy where you're just performing in a more more of the Steve Martin tradition\n\n40:08.560 --> 40:14.120\nor or even like the Steve Allen or the like who was the guy with the fiddle\n\n40:14.120 --> 40:19.000\ngod damn it the Henny Youngman kind of like I'm gonna tell a joke anyways but\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:24.640\nthe coming out of that character phase going into the alternative like hands\n\n40:24.640 --> 40:29.320\nback in the pockets look at the look at the floor and be real phase and then it\n\n40:29.320 --> 40:36.200\nwas like it the exploitation of that was I found I always found very odd when I\n\n40:36.200 --> 40:40.640\nwas younger when people would say they would purposely exploit the audience's\n\n40:40.640 --> 40:45.840\nadaptation to the stand-up form by saying I recently got engaged in knowing\n\n40:45.840 --> 40:49.840\nthat everyone would actually applaud not because they believe in a construct but\n\n40:49.840 --> 40:54.600\nbecause they actually believe you because why would you stand on a stage in a\n\n40:54.600 --> 40:57.800\nsport jacket and tell people you got engaged unless you recently did and then\n\n40:57.800 --> 41:02.320\nfor your and then to say to a goat and like have everybody go I guess I'm a\n\n41:02.320 --> 41:05.760\npiece of shit like seems that yeah I guess I'm just beating your dead horse\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:10.680\nlike it's like why like I always found that yeah very odd but then again I was\n\n41:10.680 --> 41:14.840\na terrible stand-up I could never write a joke yeah to me just be like if a\n\n41:14.840 --> 41:18.120\nmagician was showing you this trick and then I was just like no I'm just fucking\n\n41:18.120 --> 41:25.440\nwith you what was your best closer when you when you fuck you my stand-up was\n\n41:25.440 --> 41:34.080\nhorrible give me a closer give me one of your close I was 17 years old I was to\n\n41:34.080 --> 41:40.640\nI was I was I was it was bad tropics very excited about this is you can't like\n\n41:40.640 --> 41:46.140\nlet's not even talk about it like we can't talk about it no it was give me a\n\n41:46.140 --> 41:50.760\ncloser I didn't have a fucking closer I would do a rap about masturbation nice\n\n41:50.760 --> 41:56.160\nraps are the first way you start it would make it would make the audience\n\n41:56.160 --> 42:02.160\nwould have applaud or I mean clap their hands no thank you so I didn't rap I\n\n42:02.160 --> 42:09.600\ndid a rap I did a game show that was stupid run what was your first like\n\n42:09.600 --> 42:13.920\nshitty closer like that my very first set I just talked about man boobs for like\n\n42:13.920 --> 42:19.080\nten minutes and then I was wearing a red thing because I was doing my research\n\n42:19.080 --> 42:23.600\nright I read a thing about how people would take pantyhose and cut off the\n\n42:23.600 --> 42:28.320\ncrotch put it over their head and wear it as like a t-shirt to combat man boobs\n\n42:28.320 --> 42:31.120\nand so then that my thing was like I would take off my shirt and I'd be\n\n42:31.120 --> 42:46.280\nwearing that because it's personal speaking of physique you and I both\n\n42:46.280 --> 42:52.280\nwe've been we've been bigger than either of us is now is that right grammar\n\n42:52.280 --> 43:04.760\nyeah that was yeah the beautiful you are clearly a writer do you want to do\n\n43:04.760 --> 43:10.400\nyou you

43:22.520\ncrash diet or what I have no idea I remember a deep past memory I don't know\n\n43:22.520 --> 43:28.720\nwhy you lost or how you did it either I just started eating like shitty like\n\n43:28.720 --> 43:37.080\ncarb no carb free alcohol sugar candy bars and then like doing crack leg lifts\n\n43:37.080 --> 43:44.480\nin my in my living room but but did you did you did you what what did you do\n\n43:44.480 --> 43:48.080\nwhen and what kind of results did you get or we can see or we don't have to\n\n43:48.080 --> 43:51.800\nmake it a fitness podcast that's okay we can talk about a little bit that's why\n\n43:51.800 --> 43:54.640\nI wasn't sure it was you at that airport I was like it looks like skinny run\n\n43:54.640 --> 44:04.400\npunches again okay wait okay let me ask you this is an easier question about\n\n44:04.400 --> 44:11.720\nthat same topic when you see a photo of yourself from years ago okay does it\n\n44:11.720 --> 44:17.960\ndoes it make you sad or happy when you see a photo of yourself where you were\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:24.640\nlike where you look way bigger than you are now in your mind's eye and so someone\n\n44:24.640 --> 44:29.000\ngoes like hey look at this photo from New Year's Eve years ago like it does it\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:33.440\ndoes it what what emotional impact does that have on it's a little range of\n\n44:33.440 --> 44:40.800\nemotions I mean I'm proud of myself for for making changes and for doing it you\n\n44:40.800 --> 44:45.920\nknow just doing the hard work to do that and that makes me proud it makes me sad\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:50.640\nsometimes that I ever let myself get to that point because sometimes I and it's\n\n44:50.640 --> 44:54.360\nnot about the way but I can like look at the pictures and I can see my my eyes\n\n44:54.360 --> 44:59.800\nand I can see it like oh you don't look healthy at all you know and and I just\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:04.160\nlook back and I go that was a bad time period in general just psychologically\n\n45:04.160 --> 45:08.760\nyeah like you're smiling and you're supposedly happy but you're yeah yeah\n\n45:08.760 --> 45:12.080\nI'm able to see and go like oh you're upset about your divorce you're worried\n\n45:12.080 --> 45:17.920\nabout your son you you're not you're healthy at all you know you worked out\n\n45:17.920 --> 45:22.640\nonce a year you know and so it's just like looking at that person and then\n\n45:22.640 --> 45:28.320\nbeing like oh I feel like you're a chameleon puppy I love you you know and\n\n45:28.320 --> 45:32.880\nbut now it just makes me focused to just keep at it and be healthy and my goal is\n\n45:32.880 --> 45:41.280\nto be I want to be my healthiest one turn I mean I'm 35 so I got you thank you\n\n45:41.280 --> 45:47.200\nI

and then I'm one coast from there do you have that I didn't occur to\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:18.360\nme to ask as we were talking about hurtfulness and like oh taking down\n\n46:18.360 --> 46:21.880\nother people hurting other people a lot of stuff but what about self abuse like\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:25.640\nlike what's your what do you struggle with any kind of like do you have the\n\n46:25.640 --> 46:30.440\ncapacity and you know like hurt yourself say bad stuff to yourself I've learned\n\n46:30.440 --> 46:34.480\nthat's been one thing I really have learned to just shy away from and I\n\n46:34.480 --> 46:40.960\ndon't really enjoy it around me like people who around me generally know\n\n46:40.960 --> 46:44.160\nthat like I don't like if you put yourself down around me I will be like\n\n46:44.160 --> 46:47.960\nhey we don't don't do that you can do that on your own time we don't do that\n\n46:47.960 --> 46:53.320\nhere to other people yeah because I just like I don't like it I don't enjoy it I\n\n46:53.320 --> 46:59.440\ndon't I used to do it a lot but it never served anything is it because so if I\n\n46:59.440 --> 47:05.920\nput myself down around you it are you is it just your empathy and going hey\n\n47:05.920 --> 47:09.680\ndon't put yourself down are you actually thinking you know what like Sarah\n\n47:09.680 --> 47:16.160\nSilverman told me at one point she's like you know self-loathing and self love\n\n47:16.160 --> 47:20.120\nor whatever the opposite supposedly is it's all the same bullshit your head\n\n47:20.120 --> 47:24.560\nway up your ass yeah like my way that is because she was working with young me\n\n47:24.560 --> 47:28.520\nand was like calling me out right away I was like yeah what the fuck is the\n\n47:28.520 --> 47:32.160\ndifference between you hating yourself and loving yourself it's all you go and\n\n47:32.160 --> 47:38.480\noh look at me and it's like who who are you to judge you you don't get the fucking\n\n47:38.480 --> 47:44.720\njudge and to me to when it's when I talk about the people around me or people I\n\n47:44.720 --> 47:49.760\ndated or thing around me I've always been like look I I like you I like being\n\n47:49.760 --> 47:54.600\naround you so if you don't yeah you're telling me this stuff are you telling me\n\n47:54.600 --> 47:59.760\nI'm wrong right like are you telling me I am a bad judge a character because one\n\n47:59.760 --> 48:03.200\nthing I've learned from my mom and from my mom being an abusive relationship and\n\n48:03.200 --> 48:07.920\nshit like that is if someone tells you who they are fucking believe them so if\n\n48:07.920 --> 48:12.800\nyou tell me you're a piece of shit I will believe you so you either do or don't\n\n48:12.800 --> 48:19.040\nright yeah you may as well just yes and them because like if you don't want to\n\n48:19.040 --> 48:23.480\nget into a tango with them where your job becomes to talk them out of it yeah\n\n48:23.480 --> 48:27.720\nthat's the way it's not gonna help them worry it's a waste of my energy where life\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:34.320\nis rough no matter why do we have to I and our brains are so fucking powerful\n\n48:34.320 --> 48:39.320\nyou know like I can't fight you can do things that change your reality but I\n\n48:39.320 --> 48:43.400\ncan't fight your perspective for you you know right I can't fight your brain you\n\n48:43.400 --> 48:47.520\nknow Spencer who's like a really big fan of yours it's a bummer he's not here I\n\n48:47.520 --> 48:53.760\nknow I love Spencer he he said something like many years ago which is like\n\n48:53.760 --> 48:59.280\nreally like he's he we kind of plucked him out of his parents basement and took\n\n48:59.280 --> 49:03.920\nhim on tour in the that sounds about myself I know there's nothing healthy\n\n49:03.920 --> 49:09.040\nabout any of it but but I remember him like in the context of that documentary\n\n49:09.040 --> 49:13.680\nlike like actually having a valuable takeaway from it which I never got which\n\n49:13.680 --> 49:21.720\nis you know everybody is so focused on themselves they have such shit to work\n\n49:21.720 --> 49:26.080\nout so many things to worry about with themselves they're not you you may feel\n\n49:26.080 --> 49:31.640\nlike they're thinking about you but they're not so caught up in you and\n\n49:31.640 --> 49:35.640\nthere's there's something there that's more like it's like you can you can\n\n49:35.640 --> 49:40.760\nunderstand that but realizing that IE making it real takes therapy it takes a\n\n49:40.760 --> 49:46.600\nbit are like just go take a piss in the street like legit like you could just do\n\n49:46.600 --> 49:55.880\nit see who stops you no one yeah go go broke and like and ask for a quarter and\n\n49:55.880 --> 50:00.080\nsee how many people are caught up in your yeah that I think that have a family\n\n50:00.080 --> 50:11.640\nmember die be a family member that dies see how quickly people move on there\n\n50:11.640 --> 50:15.520\nthey're teflon yeah you don't worry about your scrambled eggs dirtying\n\n50:15.520 --> 50:20.840\nanyone's pan you're gonna slip right up of them it's almost worse news than you\n\n50:20.840 --> 50:33.920\nthought but are you are you are you in therapy yeah shout out to Donna\n\n50:33.920 --> 50:39.520\nhow do you know like to do it my therapist at the end of my last couple\n\n50:39.520 --> 50:44.160\nsessions now this is not a humble brag because I obviously need more therapy\n\n50:44.160 --> 50:48.400\nthan anybody but I my therapist last couple of sessions is she's done this\n\n50:48.400 --> 50:52.720\nthing where she goes so you want to schedule what do you want to do you want\n\n50:52.720 --> 50:57.160\nto schedule next week next month and I kind of like I'm wondering like is it\n\n50:57.160 --> 51:02.160\nlike a chiropractor where eventually they go like look you're you know what\n\n51:02.160 --> 51:07.640\nyou're supposed to be doing like my job isn't to do it for you 50 minutes a week\n\n51:07.640 --> 51:12.800\nso why fucking coming in here yeah like I've tried do you go to your therapist\n\n51:12.800 --> 51:16.320\nonce a week or do you did you taper off and we taper off a little bit I was\n\n51:16.320 --> 51:20.680\nseeing her once a week for for a little bit and then now it's been like once the\n\n51:20.680 --> 51:26.120\nmonth once every few weeks just to check in every now and again or if I feel like\n\n51:26.120 --> 51:30.680\nI need more of course I'll be like hey let's schedule so I think it's just yeah\n\n51:30.680 --> 51:34.320\nI think it all just depends about what you need you know I kind of felt like\n\n51:34.320 --> 51:39.720\nmy personal journey like at this point from talking to her I'm like I said to\n\n51:39.720 --> 51:45.960\nher well look I'm I think it would be a mistake for me to like go oh I'll only\n\n51:45.960 --> 51:49.080\ncome to therapy when my life is so dramatic I have something to talk to\n\n51:49.080 --> 51:52.480\nyou about because it seems like my biggest challenge right now is I need to\n\n51:52.480 --> 52:00.080\nbecome a native of boredom I need to I need to stop I have the compulsion I\n\n52:00.080 --> 52:06.600\nfeel like like happiness has come to me and I have a neurological compulsion I\n\n52:06.600 --> 52:10.760\nwant to I want to make things dramatic so that I know what to do like I have a\n\n52:10.760 --> 52:15.520\nrole to play if somebody somebody tell me I'm behind schedule so I can fucking\n\n52:15.520 --> 52:19.880\ntell them it doesn't matter and it's like now like once you get things I think\n\n52:19.880 --> 52:26.080\nthat's part of the even the therapy right like even the the transition is a\n\n52:26.080 --> 52:30.520\nlot of it going like you gotta let go old realities and old pasts and things\n\n52:30.520 --> 52:34.880\nthat don't serve you anymore and if that's not true then then why do that if\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:40.120\nyou've worked so hard or fallen luckily into or whatever the situation be how\n\n52:40.120 --> 52:48.280\ndo you know you know I don't trust older white people how dare you not know how\n\n52:48.280 --> 52:55.200\nhard I clawed my way up 35 year old piece of shit\n\n52:55.200 --> 53:05.560\nI am Spartacus that's like we are we are you don't know what I've done no it's\n\n53:05.560 --> 53:08.280\ntrue I mean that's what the times have been these other it's like it doesn't\n\n53:08.280 --> 53:12.280\nreally matter like privilege not privilege the one thing that we all have\n\n53:12.280 --> 53:16.640\nin common is that someone implying that your privilege is deeply offensive to\n\n53:16.640 --> 53:23.040\nyou you can feel like you could be born on a pile of beautiful like cloud and\n\n53:23.040 --> 53:27.200\nlike it would still the most human part of you is the part of you that would be\n\n53:27.200 --> 53:32.160\nlike what are you talking about if somebody said to you hey you you you've\n\n53:32.160 --> 53:36.240\nhad it good like like the part of you that was like fuck what fuck you know\n\n53:36.240 --> 53:39.960\nthat would be the one part of you that's connected to everybody else which is\n\n53:39.960 --> 53:46.440\ndeeply unfortunate I I'm still trying to get accustomed to that I it's like like\n\n53:46.440 --> 53:50.480\nthat this underdog story that I've crafted for myself you know like\n\n53:50.480 --> 53:53.560\neverybody's an underdog in comedy we were just talking about that a minute ago\n\n53:53.560 --> 53:58.240\nit's like yeah that matter that's what I've been trying to transition from is\n\n53:58.240 --> 54:02.840\nthat you you work so hard especially if you're you don't live in LA you're like\n\n54:02.840 --> 54:06.240\nI want to get here get here get here and then like I have my story and it's like\n\n54:06.240 --> 54:10.520\nwell every fucking person that made it to where you are has a story so your story\n\n54:10.520 --> 54:13.440\ndoesn't matter it's almost like thank God for some of the most horrible people\n\n54:13.440 --> 54:17.720\nin the world thank God for incels thank God but for actually like taking that\n\n54:17.720 --> 54:21.920\noff of the plate taking that out of the buffet because you can't be outraged\n\n54:21.920 --> 54:26.920\nabout it's like oh that has a voice that has a face and it's not funny it's not\n\n54:26.920 --> 54:33.080\nheroic it's not noble the idea that oh you the you your unfuckability is\n\n54:33.080 --> 54:39.040\nhilarious yeah or dramatic yeah or a story at all maybe your unfuckability is\n\n54:39.040 --> 54:46.280\njust a thing that you need to work on yeah I it is about something get a craft\n\n54:46.280 --> 54:51.160\nget a passion as we look back through our comedic archive what we see are\n\n54:51.160 --> 54:56.200\nthings that would one day become manifestos of terrorists who like played\n\n54:56.200 --> 55:02.120\nout as like hilarious 10-minute stand-up sets in front of a brick wall well\n\n55:02.120 --> 55:08.160\nthat's dramatic well I guess what I'm saying is comedy does not age well and\n\n55:08.160 --> 55:14.160\nthe extent to which it does not age well increases by six years per month yeah\n\n55:14.160 --> 55:18.600\nrun like you've been doing stand-up for a long time do you look back at like\n\n55:18.600 --> 55:22.840\njokes that you did a long time ago and that shit that just didn't age well that\n\n55:22.840 --> 55:28.320\nyou like is there anything you regret or have you always kept it pretty like like\n\n55:28.320 --> 55:33.280\nyou didn't cross anything any art form right if you don't look back at it and\n\n55:33.280 --> 55:37.360\ngo oh I fucking in better now and I wish I'd done things better now you're not\n\n55:37.360 --> 55:42.760\ngrowing so it's like that's just part of it and I think I mean but I don't go\n\n55:42.760 --> 55:50.560\nback and go like oh I used to be a Nazi no I might not have been as good at\n\n55:50.560 --> 55:56.460\ncommunicating what I was doing I thought you were really funny back in your\n\n55:56.460 --> 56:04.600\nNazi era I mean politics aside it was actually just great craftsmanship thank\n\n56:04.600 --> 56:09.880\nyou yeah Philip Glass you know if you listen to if you if you decode his\n\n56:09.880 --> 56:14.960\nnumeric symphonies these days it actually ciphers into a horrible condemnation of\n\n56:14.960 --> 56:19.240\nhis earliest works he's like what was I thinking and there's just thought that\n\n56:19.240 --> 56:24.800\nI don't know I just know like the Beastie boy your joke was the Philip Glass of\n\n56:24.800 --> 56:29.640\njokes I just wanted to pick an artist I that would be funny if Philip Glass was\n\n56:29.640 --> 56:33.480\nlike I'm

languishing you've been very quiet it's kind of like I want to try\n\n59:48.960 --> 59:55.680\nto be better is it because you go in the reddit and you read don't go on the\n\n59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.080\nreddit I don't have to reddit comes to me how in what form no and just I don't\n\n01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.400\nknow it's just I what I always tell people don't go on the reddit there's\n\n01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:11.120\nan interesting topic like do you do you do you peruse do you self-google do you\n\n01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.560\nI don't usually self-google sometimes you find things randomly just on accident\n\n01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.320\nsomebody reviewed my special and I didn't like it cuz they they I don't care\n\n01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.760\nabout I mean that you let people do what they want but I didn't like the fact\n\n01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.160\nthat they they were like I think this guy is a phony and I think this guy isn't\n\n01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.040\nwho he says he is and then they call my son and then they go I know even though\n\n01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.600\nI never met him and then they and then they call my son weird and then I was\n\n01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.560\nlike fuck you I'm gonna fucking get your face online so they got they got they\n\n01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.600\ngot I don't want to say they got you or triggered yeah they triggered me and then\n\n01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.200\nthey were just happy because this was the first time anyone had fucking read\n\n01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.040\ntheir articles and so I was like oh I fucking it was an article where they\n\n01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.480\nsemi legit no it was some guy I would say first for real it was paced magazine\n\n01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:08.440\nwhich is not mean who cares exactly what is it well I died I died we care now\n\n01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.560\nbut the calm I didn't interview the shit with them before and the main comedy\n\n01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.040\nguy had always been cool with so it kind of that's what reason kind of triggered\n\n01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:21.760\nme I guess that guy went on vacation and they had an assistant comedy reviewer\n\n01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:27.360\nwho was some open Michael and he just fucking was like oh that answers every\n\n01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.520\nquestion doesn't he also said that he felt the only generations only good\n\n01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:38.280\ncomic was Lisa Lampinelli which it's just a weird thing to say I love Lisa\n\n01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.000\nLampinelli it's a weird thing to say whether you love Lisa or not yeah\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.840\nbecause it's like a weird thing why do you get to review comedy then yeah and\n\n01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.080\nwhy what how is that how is the art of the critic like supportive of the idea\n\n01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.760\nof like well here's the empirical statement will make well then you're not\n\n01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.800\na very good critic are you not at all you're more of a weird scientist who's\n\n01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.040\nlike practicing a medicine that doesn't exist his whole summary will he when he\n\n01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.120\ntweeted it out was like I reviewed Ron punches comedy special which was okay I\n\n01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.760\nwas like that is not a review either like it or not like it just saying it's\n\n01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:18.080\nokay it's just you're a fucking milk toast piece of shit yeah so it triggered\n\n01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:23.720\nme so to ask you a question yeah sometimes I look but do you just so do\n\n01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:29.480\nyou just so then do you do you pull back from that as a matter of yeah my\n\n01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.360\ngirlfriend's really good at that she tried to make me realize how blessed I am\n\n01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.960\nand how good I have it and to just she's like these people are just trying to\n\n01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:43.560\nknock you off your course and leave it alone this is something feel wrong about\n\n01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.720\nthat that that like as a person who wants to hold a microphone and connect with\n\n01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:55.840\npeople that you then by virtue of your chosen path that you in order to do it\n\n01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:02.920\nwell that you're not allowed to do what regular ass people do which is go on\n\n01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:11.640\nright at yeah I don't like it oh I don't like this I always like I mean I\n\n01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.120\nstill occasionally would do it because I just like to remind people that we're\n\n01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.880\nhuman beings I'm a person just

the episode because I came out here because the decision was\n\n01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:28.200\nit for the first time in my life and that's why it's all this stuff it makes\n\n01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.600\nme so sad because my my entire MO was always be as honest as possible always\n\n01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.960\nbe honest and for the first time in my life the way to fight dishonesty was to\n\n01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:46.000\nsay nothing and it just hurts so bad and I like came out here but it was the\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.440\nright decision after 48 hours of like you wouldn't believe the fucking calls\n\n01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.040\nlike hey Dan it's me Mike Thompson I got I got crisis interventionist the\n\n01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.360\nStafford Leo Maffop nothing he's a bit of a like people that are like hey so\n\n01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.520\nlisten here's the thing like does anybody know for sure you're a pedophile\n\n01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.920\nlike what are you talking about none of this is real like like just let me tell\n\n01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:16.320\npeople you've got any pictures of you not touching kid\n\n01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:24.000\nmeanwhile the 48 hour clock goes by so the New York Times the thing that made\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.240\nme lose hope in all of humanity was the day that the New York Times who had\n\n01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.240\ncontacted my publicist for a comment about it they're like hey what's going\n\n01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.520\non with this thing and my publicist said he's not commenting right now because\n\n01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:43.960\nI'm sitting in my kitchen like on a speakerphone going like okay so what do\n\n01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.600\nI do to not get fired by a cartoon network AT&T all this stuff like what\n\n01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:54.480\nare we doing how do we coordinate how do I get Cartoon Network to say we support\n\n01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.040\nhim so that they don't pull a Disney so that we don't continue this fucking\n\n01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:06.400\nslide and and we're brokering apologies and I finished brokering one in back\n\n01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.840\nappropriately by the fucking dumpster and behind this theater and then came out\n\n01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.840\non this stage and did a show where I said nothing and it basically said\n\n01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:23.120\nnothing until now and but but it was like in the 48 hours where so his Twitter\n\n01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.800\naccount is deleted and so then it's like the story is like Dan Harmon\n\n01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:36.200\ndeletes his Twitter account after video surfaces of him fucking a baby doll\n\n01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:45.680\nnine years ago oh yeah I remember this and it was like no that's not true Dan\n\n01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.000\nHarmon deletes his Twitter account therefore video surfaces but how\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.160\ncomplicated is that story well the New York Times like that was the point was\n\n01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.960\nlike the New York Times like like just kind of ran with that story like\n\n01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.200\ninherent in the headline like Dan Harmon deletes Twitter account after video\n\n01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.520\nsurfaces because they they got that from Breitbart from but like all of these\n\n01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:15.280\npeople it was like yeah cause effect timeline to it I'm like no Dan Harmon\n\n01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.880\ndeletes Twitter account because James Gunn got fired for tweeting about fucking\n\n01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.040\nkids and Dan Harmon knows that he's not gonna stand up to that test and Dan\n\n01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.800\nHarmon wants nothing to do with Twitter anymore and once Dan Harmon leaves it's\n\n01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.440\ntime to hit that pinata on the way out the door so Dan Harmon regrets leaving\n\n01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.880\nTwitter in the first place because he didn't know that you could shudder your\n\n01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.640\nwindow to fucking crystal knocked and have people just kick in your door like\n\n01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.920\nI like but there's no way to like come out and scream that without making things\n\n01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.160\nworse making things more clickable and the only way to win that fight which a\n\n01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.280\nfight I never wanted to have is to be silent yeah which is something I've\n\n01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:01.600\nnever done wait for the next thing to come along like like it was like oh so\n\n01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.520\nthis is how you living well as best revenge just just grin and bear it don't\n\n01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.000\nfuel the fire don't kick up dust around it your contract's not signed yet all\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.720\nthis stuff it was like like like like this isn't well then what am I then then\n\n01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.760\nwhat age have we entered where where honesty is no longer the best policy\n\n01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.000\nwhere the people whose names on their accounts on social media are the same as\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.140\ntheir birth certificate the people who say what went on with them yesterday for\n\n01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:38.600\nreal are like their word is weighed less than hordes of people with fake accounts\n\n01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.480\nthat just want to like if you if enough dust gets kicked up around you on the\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.520\ninternet you can get fired I I really I remain to this day every night I sit in\n\n01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.960\nbed playing cookie collector and Minecraft and just thinking about it I\n\n01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.360\nhave no idea where to file it I don't know how to feel yeah people get shot\n\n01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:05.480\nthough so who cares I mean yeah so so I mean good point so we've entered an\n\n01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:11.920\nera where I have to go from being happy about being honest to being thankful I'm\n\n01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.400\nnot shot yet yeah that's where we are that's really where we are as a country\n\n01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:28.720\nthat feels real real bad it does my favorite part though I know is I do I\n\n01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.080\ndon't mean to just kind of not be empathetic to what you're going through\n\n01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.640\nbecause that is horrible and I've only experienced it a very small way and I\n\n01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.400\nknow how it made me feel and how did you get like well what are you referring to\n\n01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.120\nnot just people just talking a lot of trash and you are just particular in\n\n01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.920\npeople like you know who you say you are I'm like I don't know how to prove this\n\n01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:52.960\nor make you think who I am who I am and so it's just small things but my thing\n\n01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.080\nmy favorite part about this story is that that you there was a moment that you\n\n01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:03.000\nmust have had where you were this James Gunn thing came out and then you went oh\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.800\nshit there's a video of me fucking a baby dog actually that was the last thing on\n\n01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.960\nmy mind no no I didn't think about that at all I was I was surprised I was like\n\n01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:20.280\noh that video I was like damn I did a good job mixing that sound if we go\n\n01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.640\nthrough a channel 101 stuff we all committed loads of crimes no I totally\n\n01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.600\nforgot about that I had deleted that video I shot that video in the community\n\n01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.800\noffices it was 2009 I was like it's a month after it was on channel 101 I was\n\n01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.280\nlike that needs to come down if I'm going to be in the business that Tina Fey\n\n01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.360\nis in like I am not I am a political figure now invisible I need to not be\n\n01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.160\ndoing this anymore I'm not Johnny Rotten anymore I can't I took it down and\n\n01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.080\nsomeone but someone had someone had some admirable fucking like Captain Crunch\n\n01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.560\nkept it in there Davy Jones locker for all that time next to their Crunch\n\n01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:03.880\nberries I was what I was thinking was more much more appropriately was nine\n\n01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:10.600\nyears of tweets I was I wasn't thinking about videos I was thinking about nine\n\n01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:16.920\nyears of being actively reacting to society in the moment no way I'm gonna\n\n01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.760\nhold up to that test no absolutely not yeah none of us really I mean maybe me so\n\n01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.720\nI thought maybe you yeah I thought briefly about like the idea of going\n\n01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.100\nthrough and like going this one know that one know that one and then it was\n\n01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:39.120\nlike no no no that would take three years to go through nine years of tweets\n\n01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.120\nand go oh this one no no and I was like no the only right thing to do here is\n\n01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.640\nlike abscond that's been one of the kind of like greatest tricks that's been\n\n01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.840\nplayed in the last few years is the shift of responsibility like it was our\n\n01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:59.640\njob not to necessarily be reckless and again to not be harmful and calls calls\n\n01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.040\npain but our job to test boundaries and have fun and to just say whatever\n\n01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.160\nreckless thing that we're say and then we're supposed to be checked in by the\n\n01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.040\nreal people who are in charge and now it's like the people who are in charge\n\n01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.720\njust say whatever the fuck and they lie and they do whatever and no one really\n\n01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.040\nchecks that and it's just like no you we're screwing nice you know but by the\n\n01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.560\nend of day it kind of lets me know that it's all kind of pointless because like\n\n01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:30.560\nif if it really had a power like then there'd be so many powerful people who\n\n01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.440\nhave been already like truly powerful people who had been taken down by you\n\n01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:40.560\nknow like I'll give it some time I'm okay I'll be patient I mean it is pretty\n\n01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.640\neasy to get somebody fired right now we haven't changed that part of our culture\n\n01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:50.120\nthat depends on their value I believe like if people it's like any sports team\n\n01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:57.400\nyou should be like they should not be able to get fired because a bunch of\n\n01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:06.120\npeople on Twitter well I mean I ideally I'm talking about yeah I'm saying like\n\n01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:14.840\nlike what your mailman shouldn't get fired because he tweets something that\n\n01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.680\ngoes viral that I just in an ideal universe that shouldn't be the case\n\n01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.720\nso many things like well you can go with that though because then by that stance\n\n01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:30.000\nif some if a cop that's like a racist cop knows to tweet out racist things\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.280\nshouldn't should they be held accountable for that I mean that's that's\n\n01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:42.880\ndumb applause no that's I mean a cop is like yeah it's like bring it back to\n\n01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.800\nmailman so I can control this but it's no that's I mean we talked about did you\n\n01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.800\nlike the weatherman I made the joke because the weatherman that stumbled\n\n01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.600\nover Martin Luther King's name and did you cognizant of that and I was like oh\n\n01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.640\nyou didn't know about that it was like he he there was there was actually two\n\n01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.800\nseparate guys it was like he was trying he said tried to say Martin Luther\n\n01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.640\nKing's name because he was saying like by the way there's a celebration in this\n\n01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.120\npark or whatever he said he said Coon instead of King and like while he was\n\n01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:21.640\nsaying the name and it went viral and the weatherman lost his job and I am like\n\n01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:26.440\nis that how we find out people are racist and then I made the joke of like\n\n01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.360\nisn't that the one job where you could safely be racist as a weatherman yeah\n\n01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.960\nlike what are you gonna do yeah like are you gonna not tell Mexican people it's\n\n01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:42.320\nraining you're like see I still I could still do stand up if I the white\n\n01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:51.200\nweather's okay 78 degrees again but you about I mean obviously yeah they say\n\n01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.440\ngreat it's like we don't we we want we we want our cops to not be racist\n\n01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:01.080\nobviously that's a truism therefore if a cop in his private life is on social\n\n01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.840\nmedia and and reflects racism on his Facebook page with some post or even a\n\n01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.600\nretweet then it's yeah it's rough it's just a slippery slope we're dealing with\n\n01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:22.760\nnew problems it's fun yeah I hope it stays fun I I don't want to live in a\n\n01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:33.360\nworld where it where the people that are in control of who profits who's plugged\n\n01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.600\ninto the the hive mind and who's excommunicated where I worry about\n\n01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:48.160\nbuying a ticket to this ride where it's and we've already seen I feel like the\n\n01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:54.360\nnefarious among us let's call them right wing people people who are nihilistic a\n\n01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.160\nlittle bit about politics and ideology and the way that we interact with media\n\n01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:05.760\nthat they can actually hack as it were the leftist mindset by for instance\n\n01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:11.840\nsaying hey what if I were to tell you that this person by your definitions is\n\n01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:18.400\ntechnically this or that wouldn't you want them to then by your own rules\n\n01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:23.800\nsuffer or divide or compartmentalized and they're enjoying that right now and\n\n01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:34.080\nit's really distressing to watch them troll yeah so what and I guess I I can\n\n01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:42.640\npredict what you're gonna say is yeah it's it's fun no that's not fun okay I\n\n01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.080\npredicted wrong yeah no it's not fun I mean there's lessons to be learned and\n\n01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:56.840\njust that like and overcoming that and I think overall like it gets so\n\n01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.800\ncomplicated when you break it down into like like all that type of stuff was\n\n01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.600\nright wing and social media but at the end of the day it's all about\n\n01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.800\nseparatism it's all about trying to separate people from from so that they\n\n01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.320\njust stay in these little boxes so that a small amount of people can screw the\n\n01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.280\nrest of us over so if you just like whether I'm going like oh I don't\n\n01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.720\ntrust you because you're a white man or you don't trust me because I'm black or\n\n01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.920\nwomen doesn't feel safe around around anyone then then like that's just\n\n01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.360\nkeeping us all separate and that's all allowing us to be taken advantage of it's\n\n01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:34.240\nit's it's through unity and through through quality and through diversity that\n\n01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.600\nwe're that we are able to fight those things and then you you can be like well\n\n01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.240\nI wouldn't believe those things about that person you know and maybe the best\n\n01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.480\nway to prove for ourselves if there was if you could call it a battle between\n\n01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:52.200\nthose two sides the the best way to to proof to prepare for that battle is for\n\n01:19:52.200 --> 01:20:02.960\nthe individual to have a funschian kind of like I'm not I'm probably not gonna\n\n01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:10.360\njudge this person like so much like like like like if we if we don't get caught up\n\n01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.240\nin the timber chopped down this tree I heard that this thing is happening so\n\n01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.800\nlet's off with their head oh yeah no I hate that I I've never been in the\n\n01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.480\nbusiness of throwing people away or calling people monsters I think that's\n\n01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.080\none that's another tool to separate people we're all capable of horrible\n\n01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:34.560\nchoices and horrible decisions and you have to have and I'm not saying that you\n\n01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.520\nyou excuse someone's actions excuse what they've done but to act as if you're\n\n01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:44.880\nbetter or you're right to grab that ticket isn't that kind of like not to\n\n01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:50.880\nover I'm doing a writer habit here I'm trying to connect it to the

book guy but I love scud like you give me the\n\n01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.960\ndominant buses and the whole thing it's it's beautifully drawn it's it's it's\n\n01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.560\nit's it's really wonderful it's it's very you it's it's what was it called it's\n\n01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.720\ncalled scud the disposable assassin oh and then they made a video game out of they\n\n01:23:46.720 --> 01:24:04.840\ndid it was not good game no it was not there were two games there was there was\n\n01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:11.560\nthe game you played and there was a PC version both were terrible but it's cool\n\n01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:18.400\nyeah but you have a game made a side scroller it was a side scrolling game\n\n01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:25.160\nlike when doom and Duke Nukem was hitting the scene yeah it was like about yeah\n\n01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:31.800\nbad timing but no it's it was it's very cool to watch all the like all the fans\n\n01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.200\ndo their version of the artwork it it's because it's really like it kind of\n\n01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.680\nchoked me up if it's very yeah yeah well I gotta say you know not to play the bad\n\n01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:45.680\nguy but scud the scud the disposable assassin is like it takes place in a\n\n01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.080\nfuture where you can buy a robot assassin out of a vending machine and you can\n\n01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.840\nassign it a target and then once it finishes killing the target itself\n\n01:24:53.840 --> 01:25:03.360\ndestructs kind of a rip off of mr.

consciously or unconscious I don't know nobody nobody recognized it\n\n01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:26.160\nlike I think later on it was like a fair amount of fan so you saw them making\n\n01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.880\nyour money and the opening up book scud kills his target and then is washing\n\n01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.800\noff his hands in the bathroom and sees his reflection in the mirror and reads\n\n01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.840\nthe warning on the back that says will this unit will self-destruct upon\n\n01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.400\ntermination so he goes out and has to kill everybody
