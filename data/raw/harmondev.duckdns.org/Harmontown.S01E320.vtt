WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
What it is from downtown Los Angeles or downtown adjacent Los Angeles from

00:10.400 --> 00:14.800
MacArthur Park where Richard Harris sang a really really long terrible song

00:14.800 --> 00:22.140
about Carman Town is now in session. Let's bring up. Don't think of it as losing a

00:22.140 --> 00:45.200
game master. I think of it as gaining a Rob Schrupp.

00:45.200 --> 00:54.500
Rob Schrupp behind the desk. Where I belong. Where you belong. Where you belong. Let's bring out a mayor for one time.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.500
You know him. His name is Dan Harmon.

00:58.500 --> 01:11.000
Thank you. It's cold. It's not cold out here.

01:11.000 --> 01:31.300
The top of this desk Daniel. The top of this desk is very cold. I'm just feeling air.

01:31.300 --> 01:38.600
Okay. Thank you. Ask not what you can do for your country.

01:38.600 --> 01:49.100
Ask what your country can do for you. Where is Spencer? Where is Spencer? What have we done?

01:49.100 --> 02:00.200
Where is Spencer? Do we know? I didn't kill him. We just we just we just started

02:00.200 --> 02:06.000
having a big fight in the green room. You and me. I wasn't aware of this. Why? What

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
did you what did you do? It's a diehard. Like you just like I don't even want to

02:11.000 --> 02:15.960
forget it. I'm sorry I brought it up. What was the beef? It was it was just a

02:15.960 --> 02:23.840
Rob is misremembering diehard stuff. And I just watched diehard again around

02:23.840 --> 02:32.160
Christmas time because as we all know it's a Christmas movie. And we were

02:32.160 --> 02:36.240
talking about the number of times like the runner of John McClain rolling his

02:36.240 --> 02:42.200
eyes at California culture as he arrives. He's going to cross the threshold. So so

02:42.200 --> 02:48.040
in no necessary order let's enumerate them. You're mixing and matching like

02:48.040 --> 02:52.680
there are women hitting on him. That's about his marriage to Holly Gennaro.

02:52.680 --> 02:58.160
Yes. Okay. The flight attendant. Yes. I almost called her a stewardess but that

02:58.160 --> 03:03.680
would have been fine in diehard times. She gives him Google eyes and he's like

03:03.680 --> 03:10.680
whatevs. I think that's just no he's he's my perception is he's like it's gonna be

03:10.680 --> 03:16.440
difficult. It's gonna be difficult to to not fuck people that aren't my wife. He

03:16.440 --> 03:22.080
flew out to why are they getting a divorce? Why is because because she chose

03:22.080 --> 03:27.280
her career and went to New York and he was like in a like a silently abusive

03:27.280 --> 03:30.920
male who was like not putting his hands on her but was like I'm a New York cop.

03:30.920 --> 03:37.440
He explains this all to Argyle. Like he has no reason to lie. He explains it to

03:37.440 --> 03:43.600
Argyle. He goes I'm a New York cop. Like I got cases to solve. I'm not gonna up and

03:43.600 --> 03:50.160
leave for Los Angeles. Who's Argyle? Oh the the the fucking limo. See all right. I don't know. There was a guy in the

03:50.160 --> 03:54.280
in the in the in the plane that said take your socks off and I thought oh his

03:54.280 --> 04:00.880
name is Argyle that makes sense but I was wrong. Oh is that that it's kind of a

04:00.880 --> 04:08.080
David Lynch thing right? There's like one guy says take your socks off. My name is

04:08.080 --> 04:11.960
Commander Soxson like that that would be like a David Lynch thing like but you

04:11.960 --> 04:18.960
forget what I was you never got a chance to let me finish my thought that the

04:18.960 --> 04:23.600
whole reason like there is a there is a the first person to play John McClane

04:23.600 --> 04:29.480
was Frank Sinatra. Oh right yeah no that's very interesting to me. I'm not

04:29.480 --> 04:35.320
being sarcastic. Yes because they made they're okay so Die Hard is made on up

04:35.320 --> 04:40.360
is based off of a book. I don't know the name of the book. Somebody look it up

04:40.360 --> 04:43.400
all right. I'm sure it's out there somewhere. Anyway it's just snakes on a

04:43.400 --> 04:52.240
plane. Snakes on a plane. The original 1934 Joseph Conrad novel. Okay so there

04:52.240 --> 04:57.320
so Die Hard the book it's not called Die Hard the book but let's just say Die

04:57.320 --> 05:05.040
Hard the book is a sequel to another story of another book featuring John

05:05.040 --> 05:09.280
McClane that was already made into the into a movie starring Frank Sinatra. So

05:09.280 --> 05:13.040
the character's name was John McClane? I think so but it's based off of the it's

05:13.040 --> 05:16.600
the same series. I think they switched it up a little bit. I don't know. I haven't

05:16.600 --> 05:24.840
seen this movie. I would like to hang out with you. So Frank Sinatra played a

05:24.840 --> 05:29.840
character in a film called John and the character's name was John McClane. It's

05:29.840 --> 05:33.040
a I don't I think they might have changed the name or whatever. I don't know

05:33.040 --> 05:38.160
I don't have it in front of me but it is the thing the point is is that when they

05:38.160 --> 05:42.880
made Die Hard they had to go to Frank Sinatra who I think was in his 70s at

05:42.880 --> 05:48.080
the time and say hey do you want to play John McClane. Contractually they had to

05:48.080 --> 05:54.280
go to him and he would what no and and they went oh okay because we already cast

05:54.280 --> 06:01.760
it with somebody else. Okay so some problems solve themselves. Well he was

06:01.760 --> 06:06.040
70 he's not gonna do Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker and shooting the glass and

06:06.040 --> 06:11.680
the hose walking you know he's not gonna do that. He's 70 so Frank Sinatra but

06:11.680 --> 06:15.920
she's 70 man. They got Sinatra Ranch a helicopter landed and like two guys could

06:15.920 --> 06:21.200
come out in suits with take their hats off. Mrs. Sinatra is Frank home. She's

06:21.200 --> 06:25.560
like she opens the door wider and he comes with the IV bag on the rack and

06:25.560 --> 06:33.480
he's like what do you want baby and and they go Mr. Sinatra do you want to

06:33.480 --> 06:42.640
play a 1982 action hero or 1986, 87 when was Die Hard? Do you want to play do you

06:42.640 --> 06:48.480
want to do you want to pick up where the star wait were you either gonna use you

06:48.480 --> 06:54.680
or this or the star of the Seagrams wine cooler commercials. And he said ring a

06:54.680 --> 07:00.200
ding ding Jack. Okay good we're glad you said that because Jesus Christ that was

07:00.200 --> 07:06.800
a close one because we're halfway through shooting. Ring a ding ding Jack instead

07:06.800 --> 07:12.760
of Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker. This is kind of a sequel to last week's show

07:12.760 --> 07:17.640
because you were saying Yippee-ki-yay references. I was. Is that a question?

07:17.640 --> 07:22.400
Yeah listen to the recording. Was I here? All right well I apologize for the

07:22.400 --> 07:29.280
show tonight it's rainy no one wants to be here except you guys I'm sure and

07:29.280 --> 07:32.240
we'll make it worth your while. And Spencer. The rest of the country is

07:32.240 --> 07:37.160
freezing freezing freezing it's been raining here. Oh my god it's so cold. I

07:37.160 --> 07:43.760
like the church has two seats taped off next to her like she doesn't like human

07:43.760 --> 07:52.920
contact. It's just seats reserved for your the the poles. Or the mania and

07:52.920 --> 08:04.560
depression reserved for like don't come near me. I almost hit I almost hit

08:04.560 --> 08:12.960
somebody tonight with my car. With your car. Thank you for your applause. Weird

08:12.960 --> 08:20.700
hallmark theater version of the devil. Oh I love where are they Adams family

08:20.700 --> 08:26.640
they like this soap this soup is cold I love it. What show? The Adams family sorry.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.760
What show? Never mind just come on. He met the monsters. No no it's the Adams

08:31.760 --> 08:36.200
family they're like they're like that's how do you like my dress it's it's dark

08:36.200 --> 08:43.040
it's tattered it looks like a funeral gown I love it. Gomez you were terrible

08:43.040 --> 08:48.200
last night please do it again. Do you think that extends to like do they end

08:48.200 --> 08:52.280
up just randomly inverting things like if the Adams family lasted 30 seasons

08:52.280 --> 08:57.360
but they just be like I'm standing in this chair because I love hate it and

08:57.360 --> 09:03.080
they're just like floating around the room like cubes are circles I see because

09:03.080 --> 09:09.800
they're not I sneezed backwards and drank all these boogers you seriously

09:09.800 --> 09:14.360
think about it you couldn't you couldn't make like you couldn't make the

09:14.360 --> 09:17.960
Adams family movie these days because there's too much like we feel like we're

09:17.960 --> 09:22.040
pressing up against the edges of evil right because the that was like a very

09:22.040 --> 09:27.080
Clinton era like kind of thing like you could be punk rock like let's remake the

09:27.080 --> 09:31.440
Adams family because who doesn't want to be it was like like like oh Lydia in

09:31.440 --> 09:36.280
Beetlejuice is Wednesday Adams so let's do the Adams family okay that's fun like

09:36.280 --> 09:40.080
who doesn't feel like an Adams in when they're in high school but the the the

09:40.080 --> 09:44.120
answer is everyone who's like feels like their life is in danger now it's like

09:44.120 --> 09:47.520
like if you were if you really go down the road of what the Adams family

09:47.520 --> 09:51.240
like the bits they'd be doing it would be like I can't even I can't even riff

09:51.240 --> 09:56.040
examples I'll get booed off the stage because of the examples the misfits the

09:56.040 --> 10:00.960
the ne'er-do-wells the people in the back of the bus the people the the square

10:00.960 --> 10:07.360
pigs the round holes of life these people that's who you're voting for when

10:07.360 --> 10:15.080
you turn 18 Wednesday who is the most divisive candidate good girl

10:15.080 --> 10:22.280
which which school would you like to go to Columbine oh you're such a oh you're

10:22.280 --> 10:28.760

10:28.760 --> 10:34.800
bloodiest place for school now see I told you and if I tell you you're not

10:34.800 --> 10:40.880
allowed to be offended it's called getting out in front of it look it up on

10:40.880 --> 10:45.360
your precious internet that kicked me off of it

10:45.360 --> 10:51.400
I got nothing to do now but collect cookies on my iPad and I was in the car

10:51.400 --> 10:54.520
with Dan on the way here and he was collecting all those cookies did he hit

10:54.520 --> 11:02.040
anybody oh yeah so I almost hit somebody it wasn't because I was caught

11:02.040 --> 11:07.440
there's the whole audience is now the guys in top hats delicious I just got

11:07.440 --> 11:12.960
controlled by Schrab somebody's got to take control somebody's got to get this

11:12.960 --> 11:17.880
train into the station somebody's got to keep the fucking bells ringing on time

11:17.880 --> 11:21.120
and I wasn't collecting cookies and I got a text I wasn't doing anything

11:21.120 --> 11:32.160
particularly say Rob has a text Rob has a text this comes from Kris Boruff in

11:32.160 --> 11:42.440
the sound booth your peas are popping my peas are popping no apparently the

11:42.440 --> 11:48.040
Frank Sinatra movie nothing lasts forever and that was written by Roderick

11:48.040 --> 12:05.440
Thorpe all right anyways I almost hit a young lady I like I I want to minimize it

12:05.440 --> 12:08.560
by saying she was dressed like a ninja but she was you know it was yoga pants

12:08.560 --> 12:12.520
and a sweater it wasn't the brightest sweater in the world it's look it's my

12:12.520 --> 12:18.160
fault I'm in the one in the vehicle but it's like it's a weird thing because I

12:18.160 --> 12:24.040
wasn't really doing anything irresponsible I just wasn't driving as if

12:24.040 --> 12:28.840
you might hit someone any moment like it just got too comfortable so used to

12:28.840 --> 12:34.040
like get off the freeway you doing the Tesla hands-free like no no no no it's

12:34.040 --> 12:39.280
just get off the freeway and like psychologically in like autopilot not

12:39.280 --> 12:43.920
actual Tesla autopilot like just sort of like this is what I do every day this is

12:43.920 --> 12:47.520
there's no no there's never pedestrians around here I just had that

12:47.520 --> 12:56.040
experience of like she was jogging and she I just sort of like I didn't I'm so

12:56.040 --> 12:59.400
used to taking this corner and I just kind of like yeah I slowed down but

12:59.400 --> 13:03.720
there's no stop sign there so I'm gonna I slowed out a little bit and then I'm

13:03.720 --> 13:08.000
gonna take this corner and as I'm taking this corner there there's this

13:08.000 --> 13:12.400
person and they're jogging and I slam into the brakes and she looks over her

13:12.400 --> 13:20.240
shoulder hearing the silent plaintiff whale of a Tesla coming to a halt and

13:20.240 --> 13:24.200
she kind of like like lip-sync some stuff and I can't hear her because of my

13:24.200 --> 13:30.680
amazing car that seals off all sound and air and she kind of like jogs away a

13:30.680 --> 13:36.960
mute a mute poor person calling her pointless cries into the filthy air

13:36.960 --> 13:43.520
that I don't have to breathe in my Tesla this story is getting charming but I

13:43.520 --> 13:48.720
just I was I was like very yeah I know it's like the sliding doors moment you

13:48.720 --> 13:54.120
know because I could have just tapped you know I might have just tapped her on

13:54.120 --> 13:58.720
her on her on her hip and surely she would have like full boom you know like

13:58.720 --> 14:04.040
all of it's like there's a zero-sum game when it comes to your car colliding with

14:04.040 --> 14:07.720
a pedestrian you either do it or you don't even if she hadn't been seriously

14:07.720 --> 14:13.360
injured like you just like kind of like if a car just slides into you at two

14:13.360 --> 14:18.400
miles an hour you like she would ragdolled off of my hood just imagine I

14:18.400 --> 14:22.400
wouldn't be here tonight imagine your whole life could it would be changed I

14:22.400 --> 14:34.280
don't know what my point is nothing matters vote for Ron Perlman zero sums game

you well less pleasant than you if we were to act like you usually do like it

16:05.120 --> 16:10.080

16:10.080 --> 16:14.560
were upset about something that makes sense oh if you were to act like me yeah

16:14.560 --> 16:20.640

you have a come to Jesus like John the Baptist holy shit like if we flash back

17:55.480 --> 17:59.280
to you there's an origin story where you're like putting thumbtacks under

17:59.280 --> 18:12.840

18:12.840 --> 18:17.400

me a question in there undercut my life tell me the deep dark secrets about who

19:32.160 --> 19:39.080
makes you who you are and then also I'm gonna make a bud Joe part part part

19:39.080 --> 19:44.800
you mean you eat a fart if you eat a fart sandwich yeah yeah yeah so I got what

19:44.800 --> 19:58.960
I deserve let it go and keep answering yeah

19:58.960 --> 20:06.840
so I just stuff like that and then my life and then my son and you know and my

20:06.840 --> 20:11.680
son has had had some very young when he was 20 and then he found out he had

20:11.680 --> 20:17.440
autism my time was 22 and and I kind of was just like I think I just had enough

20:17.440 --> 20:21.000
things kind of tweak my brain where I was like oh I know what I want to do and

20:21.000 --> 20:26.040
I'm gonna just try to do this and and once I started getting a little it wasn't

20:26.040 --> 20:29.840
always good I was a you know in my early 20s I wasn't like a great person I

20:29.840 --> 20:34.480
didn't know I was doing I was a float just kind of being like a shitty nerd you

20:34.480 --> 20:38.080
know when you know when you're like oh I get picked on and things have been bad

20:38.080 --> 20:42.400
for me so my life owes me shit right you know and then I just had a point where

20:42.400 --> 20:47.640
I realized like nothing was coming to me I had to go and get whatever I was

20:47.640 --> 20:54.760
going to get and were there any moments like that you remember where you that

20:54.760 --> 21:01.120
were like like external stimulations whether they were like events or

21:01.120 --> 21:05.240
conversations where you were like oh and from that and then that's when I

21:05.240 --> 21:09.360
realized oh shit I've been doing this this way and I should do it this way

21:09.360 --> 21:13.200
now instead like like were there any like defining moments is where it was

21:13.200 --> 21:19.600
where I don't know I'm I mean my is what I'll undercut and then I'll I mean the

21:19.600 --> 21:25.480
most moment that I think that put me into like high gear and my most

21:25.480 --> 21:30.760
motivating moment was a little bit after I found out my son was diagnosed with

21:30.760 --> 21:35.600
autism and then I went into this park that I had always taken my son to when

21:35.600 --> 21:39.600
he was young and younger he was two at the time he was diagnosed so I'm just

21:39.600 --> 21:43.480
like one or this is also the same park that I used to smoke weed in when I was

21:43.480 --> 21:47.200
in high school and me and my girlfriend would just go hang out and make out there

21:47.200 --> 21:53.040
who eventually was my ex-wife and and we're there and we find out that you

21:53.040 --> 21:56.160
know we're just kind of shell-shocked and just kind of talking about it and then

21:56.160 --> 22:00.720
we see like a group of disabled adults and their caretakers kind of pull

22:00.720 --> 22:05.960
up to the park as well and the way that the caretakers spoke to them and

22:05.960 --> 22:11.640
treated them was very dismissive and very cruel and you treat them more like

22:11.640 --> 22:17.480
if they were prisoners than then people to be looked after and at that point I

22:17.480 --> 22:23.040
was like oh I have to figure out a career I have to figure out something this

22:23.040 --> 22:27.840
is bigger than me and whatever I'm doing like I guess this is before that you

22:27.840 --> 22:34.200
started doing comedy yeah so and then you chose comedy out of that epiphany

22:34.200 --> 22:38.760
yeah so were you I just want to it's where for you guys to be on other each side

22:38.760 --> 22:46.520
like this the that just focusing in on that moment just to understand it you

22:46.520 --> 22:53.560
you this caretakers being flippant abusive whatever as if they were like

22:53.560 --> 22:58.720
prisoners then we're yelling at where you was your epiphany because you felt

22:58.720 --> 23:03.920
like oh that's a shitty person and then did you see a little bit of your like

23:03.920 --> 23:07.440
oh I've been a shitty person other where you thinking like I never want to be

23:07.440 --> 23:10.640
that person I was more like I don't want to be like that and it was more like I

23:10.640 --> 23:14.480
don't want that for my son and it would I guess I'm I guess I'm not really fun

23:14.480 --> 23:18.160
okay when you're thinking it's more this is more motivating than me as a person I

23:18.160 --> 23:24.720
think that anything is me as a person has been just well no way no that's good

23:24.720 --> 23:27.880
like this story that's good that you're because I'm a narcissist so I'm thinking

23:27.880 --> 23:32.800
about filing things oh you're a narcissist yeah really shocked you told

23:32.800 --> 23:35.640
the story about you almost killed the lady you're like I could have been laid

23:35.640 --> 23:48.320
she shouldn't have dressed like a ninja she had a bright white sweater on so like

23:48.320 --> 23:52.360
like immediately caught myself revising I was like I'm gonna describe this story

23:52.360 --> 23:55.800
this is something interesting to talk about she was dressed so darkly and like

23:55.800 --> 24:02.880
she had a fucking white sweater on stop it but the but no the the idea that so

24:02.880 --> 24:06.040
your answer the question is more interesting because you're feeling you

24:06.040 --> 24:11.680
felt empathy for the disenfranchised in that moment and so what you were

24:11.680 --> 24:20.280
feeling was those people need someone to be better for them and and only people

24:20.280 --> 24:24.000
that are in a position to be better for them are people that have that option

24:24.000 --> 24:28.120
and that that invited you upward to that plane is what I'm kind of

24:28.120 --> 24:31.280
interpreting well mostly it was just like I gotta make a lot of money so my

24:31.280 --> 24:40.920
son's never in this fucking position okay wow but did and you were what 22 you

24:40.920 --> 24:47.400
said at the time mm-hmm and so you said I gotta make this money and did you when

24:47.400 --> 24:51.120
was the decision to go to comedy like were you already kind of leaning in

24:51.120 --> 24:54.360
that direction that yeah I always wanted to do it you know it's just the thing

24:54.360 --> 24:58.880
that I was interested in but I think it was a real job and so I was like I knew

24:58.880 --> 25:02.960
I needed a career and not just a job I was working at like this bank call

25:02.960 --> 25:08.040
center and I hated it and I knew that I couldn't stay there what part of town

25:08.040 --> 25:13.400
were you in and Salem or again yeah and so do you start like like doing open

25:13.400 --> 25:19.320
mics and like yeah I start doing mics in Portland and and and then there's this

25:19.320 --> 25:23.040
Chinese food restaurant in Salem that has this show but it's called Lucky

25:23.040 --> 25:27.720
Fortune I've been there it's good in there yeah yeah so you know they would do

25:27.720 --> 25:31.440
shows and you get Chinese food and the guy would sell bootleg movies after the

25:31.440 --> 25:36.640
shows and it was just a good place for you to cut your crack cut your teeth you

25:36.640 --> 25:41.800
know it was like they had an open mic there no just a show it was a show but

25:41.800 --> 25:47.880
it wasn't good and so much might as well he'd always just lie and be like I

25:47.880 --> 25:56.200
remember for years he he he was telling me that this this I already forgot the

25:56.200 --> 26:01.520
name another story gonna be horrible so never mind but what do you do I'm

26:01.520 --> 26:06.520
curious so you you if you have that epiphany so it's like it's your Buddha

26:06.520 --> 26:12.240
moment you're like okay I like like my kid I if he slips through my fingers

26:12.240 --> 26:16.560
he's gonna end up a ward of people like this guy that you saw in the park and so

26:16.560 --> 26:21.840
then you go I gotta do what I love not just I gotta go get a job managing a

26:21.840 --> 26:25.880
factory floor like it's about money but it's also about following your bliss so

26:25.880 --> 26:31.720
what does somebody young do when they decide they want to take comedy

26:31.720 --> 26:36.040
seriously like what are your first steps what you're like sitting there with a

26:36.040 --> 26:42.200
manila a legal pad and a pencil or like like like describe those days yeah I

26:42.200 --> 26:47.200
would I mean back then I was like right out full scripts of my jokes and stuff

26:47.200 --> 26:53.360
and I'd like go over them and and try to memorize every word and did you include

26:53.360 --> 26:57.760
people laughing in your head like like yeah and then I'll pause and then there'll

26:57.760 --> 27:04.320
be all this laughter is it hold for applause and then I would even like fact

27:04.320 --> 27:09.440
check my jokes thing like oh if someone someone here's this joke they might call

27:09.440 --> 27:17.160
me out on the on the background so I better know about this that's very for

27:17.160 --> 27:22.800
that for whatever that era was it's probably a little overly responsible of

27:22.800 --> 27:30.200
you yeah no I over over prepare you were ready for today you're like vetting

27:30.200 --> 27:37.120
your stand-up against the the ears of 25 million angry people what was a

27:37.120 --> 27:42.800
threshold Ron from like being an open miker and then like did you did you move

27:42.800 --> 27:49.280
to LA right away or no that would have been a bad decision but the front the

27:49.280 --> 27:53.360
threshold from being like I'm gonna try this out to going oh this is working and

27:53.360 --> 27:59.280
like I'm I'm now like like you're you're headlining you you're being like top

27:59.280 --> 28:05.280
man I mean it took a little while you know I was doing shows and just going

28:05.280 --> 28:10.160
around the country and I had my friend Will who would drive us around in his

28:10.160 --> 28:14.800
mom's minivan and we would go and do shows and in book shows up and down

28:14.800 --> 28:19.120
Salem and in other parts of Oregon in the northwest we just go to

28:19.120 --> 28:22.240
different bars and just try to convince them the book of show and that we could

28:22.240 --> 28:25.540
bring an audience in and we booked one show and then they realized that we

28:25.540 --> 28:32.320
could not and so so we would just continue and move on that way and I did

28:32.320 --> 28:35.360
that for a couple years and then just started getting better and getting more

28:35.360 --> 28:40.720
name for myself and I would just you're making deals you were like Jim

28:40.720 --> 28:44.120
henshinning it like the way he like sold the Muppet show and syndication you were

28:44.120 --> 28:48.800
good at it you didn't have an agent that was like this here's Ron Funches and I'm

28:48.800 --> 28:52.560
gonna book you on this circuit you're gonna open for so-and-so you work in

28:52.560 --> 28:58.240
this business you I don't start with hey yeah no I had to book my own shows in a

28:58.240 --> 29:01.440
lot of my you're going to bars and convincing them to have a venue in the

29:01.440 --> 29:03.920
first place so that you could perform there and then you're making a deal with

29:03.920 --> 29:08.040
them like take part of the door yeah yeah yeah me and my friend we kind of like

29:08.040 --> 29:12.320
was my business partner and we just do that together he would we go scout

29:12.320 --> 29:18.560
locations and just try to make deals and I ran around my own weekly show and

29:18.560 --> 29:22.720
a coffee house and and those were them like the most pressure filled days

29:22.720 --> 29:26.960
because a lot of times that would be like I was like oh I need to pass this hat

29:26.960 --> 29:31.480
around for money so that I can come home and bring my son and my my ex-home food

29:31.480 --> 29:36.560
and stuff you know I didn't I wasn't making like any money at that time what

29:36.560 --> 29:42.400
do you say I mean there is like there are people in the world probably half of

29:42.400 --> 29:49.640
my listeners like the idea of inoffensive comedy like it sounds like a

29:49.640 --> 29:54.880
pejorative in terms of comedy oxymoronic contradictory the idea that you could be

29:54.880 --> 29:58.560
funny without hurting people without taking anybody down without like

29:58.560 --> 30:03.240
attacking without having without without wounding and things but you're pretty

30:03.240 --> 30:11.800
much like your stand-up is giggle fit is a comedy central you also got your well

30:11.800 --> 30:15.400
we'll talk about getting better in a second but but but like you would you

30:15.400 --> 30:19.200
you you characterize your goal when you get on stage or maybe not your goal but

30:19.200 --> 30:23.720
like your MO is like you don't you're not you're not leaving a body count right

30:23.720 --> 30:27.520
you're not you're not like you're not hurting people I never understood that

30:27.520 --> 30:32.880
as a theme of what comedy needs to be that there are I mean sure sometimes you

30:32.880 --> 30:37.160
attack things but I think your job as a comedian I'm a student of comedy I love

30:37.160 --> 30:41.960
comedy I've loved comedy since I was a young child and everything every good

30:41.960 --> 30:47.160
comedian I saw it was like you you you speak truth to power you take down

30:47.160 --> 30:52.720
people bigger than you you point out the inconsistencies in the status quo you

30:52.720 --> 30:57.560
don't just attack people to attack people you don't just go like okay like

30:57.560 --> 31:01.920
Mexicans or this like that like you're that's building the status quo that's

31:01.920 --> 31:07.160
reinforcing like what people are saying when when when your job usually is that

31:07.160 --> 31:11.200
you're as a jester you don't make fun of the towns people you make fun of the

31:11.200 --> 31:15.120
king you know so like I I take that job think that

31:15.120 --> 31:22.080
seriously so do you do some do you do some punching up in your opinion I mean

31:22.080 --> 31:27.280
is it like like it's it is punching but it's punching up I mean a little bit for

31:27.280 --> 31:33.120
most part I'm also very I mean I guess I would say I'm narcissistic in my own

31:33.120 --> 31:38.320
ways in the regard like I prefer just talking about me in my life and what's

31:38.320 --> 31:43.880
going on that's what's exciting to me I've never been excited about those type

31:43.880 --> 31:48.520
of things I mean I think my mom my mom just my mom just said she's like we're

31:48.520 --> 31:55.360
just she's like we're not very passionate people she's just explaining that

31:55.360 --> 31:58.520
to company when they come over yeah you have to understand the punches are not

31:58.520 --> 32:04.240
passionate people I don't care about much I care about my son I care about my

32:04.240 --> 32:12.640
family I care about few things but like I it would be very just not truthful of

32:12.640 --> 32:17.280
me to go up there and be this is what I'm talking about this is what I'm upset

32:17.280 --> 32:21.640
right I gotta I got ten minutes about about abortion legislation because I'm

32:21.640 --> 32:25.920
like so focused on that because I have so many right like last year there was

32:25.920 --> 32:29.920
like six comedy specials I watched a lot of comedy specials and stuff still

32:29.920 --> 32:34.360
like six last year all with like he's Caitlyn Jenner jokes I know it's even

32:34.360 --> 32:40.120
hacked even talk about nothing but I was just like why did you guys care so much

32:40.120 --> 32:46.320
who what did you give a fuck like who you that's how you spend your day yeah

32:46.320 --> 32:52.440
we're sitting around thinking about Caitlyn Jenner and what Caitlyn Jenner

32:52.440 --> 32:59.640
not a person worth talking about whoa shots fire I think this cycle that

32:59.640 --> 33:03.800
happens my theory about it is from talking to my therapist about just like

33:03.800 --> 33:07.680
generally like about how positive and negative shit sticks and whatever and

33:07.680 --> 33:13.840
how negative shit sticks so much easier and then so it's like jokes that we

33:13.840 --> 33:21.400
remember they're they're they're often attached to satire and like like like

33:21.400 --> 33:26.160
somebody gets taken down a peg or something happens something shifts oh

33:26.160 --> 33:30.920
that person made that joke and then that was like a kaboom yeah and and it

33:30.920 --> 33:34.560
sticks in your memory for the same reason that and if somebody says like oh

33:34.560 --> 33:39.440
you're wearing that shirt again sticks yeah I like your shirt yeah which doesn't

33:39.440 --> 33:44.720
stick at all yeah and so I think when people are in the nation stages of

33:44.720 --> 33:49.640
their comedic ambitions they're kind of like how do I be funny and they and they

33:49.640 --> 33:54.920
and they sit by that stream of society and they go well most important thing

33:54.920 --> 33:59.600
is I'll sit here I'll watch some stuff and I'll try to think about like what

33:59.600 --> 34:02.720
what I might say that would be funny about it and they're gonna tend to slide

34:02.720 --> 34:07.480
into well what would I say that would be taken this thing apart you know a kind

34:07.480 --> 34:13.640
of Joel McHaling the Kardashians or you know David spading the the whatever's

34:13.640 --> 34:18.680
like and it because that's the stuff that kind of spikes on the on the EKG I

34:18.680 --> 34:25.400
guess it's it it sticks in your memory yeah but yeah like Steve Martin I my

34:25.400 --> 34:29.880
memory of him is like he'd come out and he would just do this like weird one

34:29.880 --> 34:35.360
person show it was just it was just humor it was absurd and well I just think

34:35.360 --> 34:40.080
it's easier you know it's easier to tear apart and to build you know so like

34:40.080 --> 34:45.880
when you're trying to actually build jokes that don't do that it just takes

34:45.880 --> 34:51.360
longer it's harder sometimes people don't don't get them right away the beauty

34:51.360 --> 34:55.360
of Steve Martin stuff was that he was clearly intellectual but he was silly

34:55.360 --> 35:01.720
and so we got to watch an intellect be stupid like for us and it was so crazy

35:01.720 --> 35:07.000
to me to watch those old ones and be like this is a stadium yeah full of

35:07.000 --> 35:15.280
people watching the guy put a arrow and he would go I'm a wild and crazy guy and

35:15.280 --> 35:19.600
the whole place with like Madison Square Garden would cheer it's crazy you

35:19.600 --> 35:22.040
know it's interesting though is talking about this family tree of comedy or

35:22.040 --> 35:27.480
whatever you call it like the he was never personal he wouldn't go yeah so

35:27.480 --> 35:31.680
here's what's going on with me neither was he political so George Carlin very

35:31.680 --> 35:35.360
political not a lot of personal to George Carlin right like George Carlin

35:35.360 --> 35:38.720
wouldn't like pause take a glass of water break down ago so anyways I'm

35:38.720 --> 35:44.800
married etc Bill Cosby drew all these stories from from marriage and children

35:44.800 --> 35:49.520
but like how transparent was it you're very personal you talk about raising an

35:49.520 --> 35:54.880
autistic kid you talk about like like your life like I don't I have no

35:54.880 --> 35:59.360
question about this I just like wanted to like go into that area like like when

35:59.360 --> 36:04.040
you're if you're sitting and you're going I think I'll share this thing about

36:04.040 --> 36:09.680
raising being a single dad raising autistic kid like are there ground rules

36:09.680 --> 36:15.320
do you think to yourself like is my kid gonna be 30 and and and listen to this

36:15.320 --> 36:19.160
on a hologram disc one day and get the wrong idea what are the thoughts that

36:19.160 --> 36:22.920
go through your head in terms of filtration I probably should think more

36:22.920 --> 36:31.640
about it and you should yeah but I just kind of I just like to talk about what I

36:31.640 --> 36:35.400
love and I just try to talk about it with love you know I think that's been

36:35.400 --> 36:39.840
my main goal is to make sure people you know talk about my son in particular I

36:39.840 --> 36:43.920
just want to make sure people knew that I wasn't making fun of him and I wasn't

36:43.920 --> 36:48.760
trying to be like oh my son has this disability and this is what's funny

36:48.760 --> 36:52.760
about it right it's more like this is just a part of my life this is my son he

36:52.760 --> 36:57.120
does some funny things all right and these are some just other misunderstandings

36:57.120 --> 37:01.200
that have happened this is just a part of my life so I just always try to do

37:01.200 --> 37:05.280
that same thing with my mom the same thing with anyone that I talk about I

37:05.280 --> 37:11.440
just try to make sure I don't you know you know Louie CK and just making

37:11.440 --> 37:22.160
everything you know ah my fucking kids yeah I I yeah I mean I have stuff to say

37:22.160 --> 37:28.880
about that I like like Louie's style was is so like he would pace the stage like

37:28.880 --> 37:31.920
a caged animal and he would talk like Charlie Brown and it had this like

37:31.920 --> 37:40.040
viscera to it and he like but it was like is it is it bad to do that if it if if

37:40.040 --> 37:43.560
it's not actually transparent if it's like a periscope that's bouncing off of

37:43.560 --> 37:47.760
two mirrors is it like yeah and does any of that matter if is it hockey of

37:47.760 --> 37:52.360
Vellion where it's like well they're they laughed so but I'm like yeah but what

37:52.360 --> 37:56.280
if they're laughing at like because they think that you're real what if they think

37:56.280 --> 38:01.520
that Tim Allen really does go home and go oh yeah and like like I don't know I

38:01.520 --> 38:04.480
don't know what crimes are being committed when or what what comedy is

38:04.480 --> 38:10.520
supposed to be I think you never want to be too far from your from you who you

38:10.520 --> 38:14.600
are there's a thing you know with any performance and performers I'm a big

38:14.600 --> 38:19.920
everybody who know me know I love wrestling and if any really good

38:19.920 --> 38:24.680
wrestlers are always like a turned up version of themselves and I feel like

38:24.680 --> 38:30.120
that's what I try to be as a performer is that like you know you're usually

38:30.120 --> 38:35.960
catching me at my happiest at my most jovial where I'm trying to have fun is

38:35.960 --> 38:40.320
that me 24-7 not at all right but that's when what I'm trying to put forth at

38:40.320 --> 38:45.920
that time you know and I just try to make sure that I I think when you're you as

38:45.920 --> 38:51.000
a human get too far away from your act that's when things start to crumble and

38:51.000 --> 38:54.880
fall apart from you in all and life in all regards and I just that's why I

38:54.880 --> 38:59.600
write personally and that's why I try to change up my act and I'm never I

38:59.600 --> 39:03.640
always when I first started I always hated when I see a comedian perform and

39:03.640 --> 39:10.800
it'd be like me and my girlfriend and then they go oh I'm single I got

39:10.800 --> 39:16.960
married recently tell me the truth now I don't trust anything that you're

39:16.960 --> 39:21.360
saying it is weird like I'm willing to go with you on any ride as long as you

39:21.360 --> 39:27.960
set up the rules and then follow those fucking rules yeah it is it is weird

39:27.960 --> 39:31.360
because they were there was that wave of stand-up where it was like it was look

39:31.360 --> 39:35.200
we're not gestures anymore we're not we're not wearing makeup we're not

39:35.200 --> 39:39.360
and it was even past then there was the you know past the Judy T'Nuta phase we've

39:39.360 --> 39:44.600
had like we're I love to do that but I'm not bagging on that phase I like Bob

39:44.600 --> 39:47.520
Goldweights but you know was part what is it was like there was that phase of

39:47.520 --> 39:50.640
stand-up where it was like another form of purity where it was like fuck it then

39:50.640 --> 39:54.680
we're all characters you know emo Phillips is an amazing joke writer and

39:54.680 --> 39:58.240
like is he doing a character is he not you meet him in person you're like kind

39:58.240 --> 40:03.400
of the same guy etc like that kind of like pedal to the metal character

40:03.400 --> 40:08.560
comedy where you're just performing in a more more of the Steve Martin tradition

40:08.560 --> 40:14.120
or or even like the Steve Allen or the like who was the guy with the fiddle

40:14.120 --> 40:19.000
god damn it the Henny Youngman kind of like I'm gonna tell a joke anyways but

40:19.000 --> 40:24.640
the coming out of that character phase going into the alternative like hands

40:24.640 --> 40:29.320
back in the pockets look at the look at the floor and be real phase and then it

40:29.320 --> 40:36.200
was like it the exploitation of that was I found I always found very odd when I

40:36.200 --> 40:40.640
was younger when people would say they would purposely exploit the audience's

40:40.640 --> 40:45.840
adaptation to the stand-up form by saying I recently got engaged in knowing

40:45.840 --> 40:49.840
that everyone would actually applaud not because they believe in a construct but

40:49.840 --> 40:54.600
because they actually believe you because why would you stand on a stage in a

40:54.600 --> 40:57.800
sport jacket and tell people you got engaged unless you recently did and then

40:57.800 --> 41:02.320
for your and then to say to a goat and like have everybody go I guess I'm a

41:02.320 --> 41:05.760
piece of shit like seems that yeah I guess I'm just beating your dead horse

41:05.760 --> 41:10.680
like it's like why like I always found that yeah very odd but then again I was

41:10.680 --> 41:14.840
a terrible stand-up I could never write a joke yeah to me just be like if a

41:14.840 --> 41:18.120
magician was showing you this trick and then I was just like no I'm just fucking

41:18.120 --> 41:25.440
with you what was your best closer when you when you fuck you my stand-up was

41:25.440 --> 41:34.080
horrible give me a closer give me one of your close I was 17 years old I was to

41:34.080 --> 41:40.640
I was I was I was it was bad tropics very excited about this is you can't like

41:40.640 --> 41:46.140
let's not even talk about it like we can't talk about it no it was give me a

41:46.140 --> 41:50.760
closer I didn't have a fucking closer I would do a rap about masturbation nice

41:50.760 --> 41:56.160
raps are the first way you start it would make it would make the audience

41:56.160 --> 42:02.160
would have applaud or I mean clap their hands no thank you so I didn't rap I

42:02.160 --> 42:09.600
did a rap I did a game show that was stupid run what was your first like

42:09.600 --> 42:13.920
shitty closer like that my very first set I just talked about man boobs for like

42:13.920 --> 42:19.080
ten minutes and then I was wearing a red thing because I was doing my research

42:19.080 --> 42:23.600
right I read a thing about how people would take pantyhose and cut off the

42:23.600 --> 42:28.320
crotch put it over their head and wear it as like a t-shirt to combat man boobs

42:28.320 --> 42:31.120
and so then that my thing was like I would take off my shirt and I'd be

42:31.120 --> 42:46.280
wearing that because it's personal speaking of physique you and I both

42:46.280 --> 42:52.280
we've been we've been bigger than either of us is now is that right grammar

42:52.280 --> 43:04.760
yeah that was yeah the beautiful you are clearly a writer do you want to do

43:04.760 --> 43:10.400
you you you you you've been a lot bigger physically do you like I don't know

43:10.400 --> 43:15.240
anything about your like if you had epiphanies or if you like just went on a

43:15.240 --> 43:22.520
crash diet or what I have no idea I remember a deep past memory I don't know

43:22.520 --> 43:28.720
why you lost or how you did it either I just started eating like shitty like

43:28.720 --> 43:37.080
carb no carb free alcohol sugar candy bars and then like doing crack leg lifts

43:37.080 --> 43:44.480
in my in my living room but but did you did you did you what what did you do

43:44.480 --> 43:48.080
when and what kind of results did you get or we can see or we don't have to

43:48.080 --> 43:51.800
make it a fitness podcast that's okay we can talk about a little bit that's why

43:51.800 --> 43:54.640
I wasn't sure it was you at that airport I was like it looks like skinny run

43:54.640 --> 44:04.400
punches again okay wait okay let me ask you this is an easier question about

44:04.400 --> 44:11.720
that same topic when you see a photo of yourself from years ago okay does it

44:11.720 --> 44:17.960
does it make you sad or happy when you see a photo of yourself where you were

44:17.960 --> 44:24.640
like where you look way bigger than you are now in your mind's eye and so someone

44:24.640 --> 44:29.000
goes like hey look at this photo from New Year's Eve years ago like it does it

44:29.000 --> 44:33.440
does it what what emotional impact does that have on it's a little range of

44:33.440 --> 44:40.800
emotions I mean I'm proud of myself for for making changes and for doing it you

44:40.800 --> 44:45.920
know just doing the hard work to do that and that makes me proud it makes me sad

44:45.920 --> 44:50.640
sometimes that I ever let myself get to that point because sometimes I and it's

44:50.640 --> 44:54.360
not about the way but I can like look at the pictures and I can see my my eyes

44:54.360 --> 44:59.800
and I can see it like oh you don't look healthy at all you know and and I just

44:59.800 --> 45:04.160
look back and I go that was a bad time period in general just psychologically

45:04.160 --> 45:08.760
yeah like you're smiling and you're supposedly happy but you're yeah yeah

45:08.760 --> 45:12.080
I'm able to see and go like oh you're upset about your divorce you're worried

45:12.080 --> 45:17.920
about your son you you're not you're healthy at all you know you worked out

45:17.920 --> 45:22.640
once a year you know and so it's just like looking at that person and then

45:22.640 --> 45:28.320
being like oh I feel like you're a chameleon puppy I love you you know and

45:28.320 --> 45:32.880
but now it just makes me focused to just keep at it and be healthy and my goal is

45:32.880 --> 45:41.280
to be I want to be my healthiest one turn I mean I'm 35 so I got you thank you

45:41.280 --> 45:47.200
I don't wear it my success level is quick

45:51.200 --> 45:56.520
that's the greatest compliment we can give your generation yeah fuck you yeah

45:56.520 --> 46:04.360
you think you're doing get off my lawn that's what I am now I love it but my

46:04.360 --> 46:09.000
goal is I just want to be my healthiest and when I turn 40 that's my goal and I

46:09.000 --> 46:14.520
want to see and then I'm one coast from there do you have that I didn't occur to

46:14.520 --> 46:18.360
me to ask as we were talking about hurtfulness and like oh taking down

46:18.360 --> 46:21.880
other people hurting other people a lot of stuff but what about self abuse like

46:21.880 --> 46:25.640
like what's your what do you struggle with any kind of like do you have the

46:25.640 --> 46:30.440
capacity and you know like hurt yourself say bad stuff to yourself I've learned

46:30.440 --> 46:34.480
that's been one thing I really have learned to just shy away from and I

46:34.480 --> 46:40.960
don't really enjoy it around me like people who around me generally know

46:40.960 --> 46:44.160
that like I don't like if you put yourself down around me I will be like

46:44.160 --> 46:47.960
hey we don't don't do that you can do that on your own time we don't do that

46:47.960 --> 46:53.320
here to other people yeah because I just like I don't like it I don't enjoy it I

46:53.320 --> 46:59.440
don't I used to do it a lot but it never served anything is it because so if I

46:59.440 --> 47:05.920
put myself down around you it are you is it just your empathy and going hey

47:05.920 --> 47:09.680
don't put yourself down are you actually thinking you know what like Sarah

47:09.680 --> 47:16.160
Silverman told me at one point she's like you know self-loathing and self love

47:16.160 --> 47:20.120
or whatever the opposite supposedly is it's all the same bullshit your head

47:20.120 --> 47:24.560
way up your ass yeah like my way that is because she was working with young me

47:24.560 --> 47:28.520
and was like calling me out right away I was like yeah what the fuck is the

47:28.520 --> 47:32.160
difference between you hating yourself and loving yourself it's all you go and

47:32.160 --> 47:38.480
oh look at me and it's like who who are you to judge you you don't get the fucking

47:38.480 --> 47:44.720
judge and to me to when it's when I talk about the people around me or people I

47:44.720 --> 47:49.760
dated or thing around me I've always been like look I I like you I like being

47:49.760 --> 47:54.600
around you so if you don't yeah you're telling me this stuff are you telling me

47:54.600 --> 47:59.760
I'm wrong right like are you telling me I am a bad judge a character because one

47:59.760 --> 48:03.200
thing I've learned from my mom and from my mom being an abusive relationship and

48:03.200 --> 48:07.920
shit like that is if someone tells you who they are fucking believe them so if

48:07.920 --> 48:12.800
you tell me you're a piece of shit I will believe you so you either do or don't

48:12.800 --> 48:19.040
right yeah you may as well just yes and them because like if you don't want to

48:19.040 --> 48:23.480
get into a tango with them where your job becomes to talk them out of it yeah

48:23.480 --> 48:27.720
that's the way it's not gonna help them worry it's a waste of my energy where life

48:27.720 --> 48:34.320
is rough no matter why do we have to I and our brains are so fucking powerful

48:34.320 --> 48:39.320
you know like I can't fight you can do things that change your reality but I

48:39.320 --> 48:43.400
can't fight your perspective for you you know right I can't fight your brain you

48:43.400 --> 48:47.520
know Spencer who's like a really big fan of yours it's a bummer he's not here I

48:47.520 --> 48:53.760
know I love Spencer he he said something like many years ago which is like

48:53.760 --> 48:59.280
really like he's he we kind of plucked him out of his parents basement and took

48:59.280 --> 49:03.920
him on tour in the that sounds about myself I know there's nothing healthy

49:03.920 --> 49:09.040
about any of it but but I remember him like in the context of that documentary

49:09.040 --> 49:13.680
like like actually having a valuable takeaway from it which I never got which

49:13.680 --> 49:21.720
is you know everybody is so focused on themselves they have such shit to work

49:21.720 --> 49:26.080
out so many things to worry about with themselves they're not you you may feel

49:26.080 --> 49:31.640
like they're thinking about you but they're not so caught up in you and

49:31.640 --> 49:35.640
there's there's something there that's more like it's like you can you can

49:35.640 --> 49:40.760
understand that but realizing that IE making it real takes therapy it takes a

49:40.760 --> 49:46.600
bit are like just go take a piss in the street like legit like you could just do

49:46.600 --> 49:55.880
it see who stops you no one yeah go go broke and like and ask for a quarter and

49:55.880 --> 50:00.080
see how many people are caught up in your yeah that I think that have a family

50:00.080 --> 50:11.640
member die be a family member that dies see how quickly people move on there

50:11.640 --> 50:15.520
they're teflon yeah you don't worry about your scrambled eggs dirtying

50:15.520 --> 50:20.840
anyone's pan you're gonna slip right up of them it's almost worse news than you

50:20.840 --> 50:33.920
thought but are you are you are you in therapy yeah shout out to Donna

50:33.920 --> 50:39.520
how do you know like to do it my therapist at the end of my last couple

50:39.520 --> 50:44.160
sessions now this is not a humble brag because I obviously need more therapy

50:44.160 --> 50:48.400
than anybody but I my therapist last couple of sessions is she's done this

50:48.400 --> 50:52.720
thing where she goes so you want to schedule what do you want to do you want

50:52.720 --> 50:57.160
to schedule next week next month and I kind of like I'm wondering like is it

50:57.160 --> 51:02.160
like a chiropractor where eventually they go like look you're you know what

51:02.160 --> 51:07.640
you're supposed to be doing like my job isn't to do it for you 50 minutes a week

51:07.640 --> 51:12.800
so why fucking coming in here yeah like I've tried do you go to your therapist

51:12.800 --> 51:16.320
once a week or do you did you taper off and we taper off a little bit I was

51:16.320 --> 51:20.680
seeing her once a week for for a little bit and then now it's been like once the

51:20.680 --> 51:26.120
month once every few weeks just to check in every now and again or if I feel like

51:26.120 --> 51:30.680
I need more of course I'll be like hey let's schedule so I think it's just yeah

51:30.680 --> 51:34.320
I think it all just depends about what you need you know I kind of felt like

51:34.320 --> 51:39.720
my personal journey like at this point from talking to her I'm like I said to

51:39.720 --> 51:45.960
her well look I'm I think it would be a mistake for me to like go oh I'll only

51:45.960 --> 51:49.080
come to therapy when my life is so dramatic I have something to talk to

51:49.080 --> 51:52.480
you about because it seems like my biggest challenge right now is I need to

51:52.480 --> 52:00.080
become a native of boredom I need to I need to stop I have the compulsion I

52:00.080 --> 52:06.600
feel like like happiness has come to me and I have a neurological compulsion I

52:06.600 --> 52:10.760
want to I want to make things dramatic so that I know what to do like I have a

52:10.760 --> 52:15.520
role to play if somebody somebody tell me I'm behind schedule so I can fucking

52:15.520 --> 52:19.880
tell them it doesn't matter and it's like now like once you get things I think

52:19.880 --> 52:26.080
that's part of the even the therapy right like even the the transition is a

52:26.080 --> 52:30.520
lot of it going like you gotta let go old realities and old pasts and things

52:30.520 --> 52:34.880
that don't serve you anymore and if that's not true then then why do that if

52:34.880 --> 52:40.120
you've worked so hard or fallen luckily into or whatever the situation be how

52:40.120 --> 52:48.280
do you know you know I don't trust older white people how dare you not know how

52:48.280 --> 52:55.200
hard I clawed my way up 35 year old piece of shit

52:55.200 --> 53:05.560
I am Spartacus that's like we are we are you don't know what I've done no it's

53:05.560 --> 53:08.280
true I mean that's what the times have been these other it's like it doesn't

53:08.280 --> 53:12.280
really matter like privilege not privilege the one thing that we all have

53:12.280 --> 53:16.640
in common is that someone implying that your privilege is deeply offensive to

53:16.640 --> 53:23.040
you you can feel like you could be born on a pile of beautiful like cloud and

53:23.040 --> 53:27.200
like it would still the most human part of you is the part of you that would be

53:27.200 --> 53:32.160
like what are you talking about if somebody said to you hey you you you've

53:32.160 --> 53:36.240
had it good like like the part of you that was like fuck what fuck you know

53:36.240 --> 53:39.960
that would be the one part of you that's connected to everybody else which is

53:39.960 --> 53:46.440
deeply unfortunate I I'm still trying to get accustomed to that I it's like like

53:46.440 --> 53:50.480
that this underdog story that I've crafted for myself you know like

53:50.480 --> 53:53.560
everybody's an underdog in comedy we were just talking about that a minute ago

53:53.560 --> 53:58.240
it's like yeah that matter that's what I've been trying to transition from is

53:58.240 --> 54:02.840
that you you work so hard especially if you're you don't live in LA you're like

54:02.840 --> 54:06.240
I want to get here get here get here and then like I have my story and it's like

54:06.240 --> 54:10.520
well every fucking person that made it to where you are has a story so your story

54:10.520 --> 54:13.440
doesn't matter it's almost like thank God for some of the most horrible people

54:13.440 --> 54:17.720
in the world thank God for incels thank God but for actually like taking that

54:17.720 --> 54:21.920
off of the plate taking that out of the buffet because you can't be outraged

54:21.920 --> 54:26.920
about it's like oh that has a voice that has a face and it's not funny it's not

54:26.920 --> 54:33.080
heroic it's not noble the idea that oh you the you your unfuckability is

54:33.080 --> 54:39.040
hilarious yeah or dramatic yeah or a story at all maybe your unfuckability is

54:39.040 --> 54:46.280
just a thing that you need to work on yeah I it is about something get a craft

54:46.280 --> 54:51.160
get a passion as we look back through our comedic archive what we see are

54:51.160 --> 54:56.200
things that would one day become manifestos of terrorists who like played

54:56.200 --> 55:02.120
out as like hilarious 10-minute stand-up sets in front of a brick wall well

55:02.120 --> 55:08.160
that's dramatic well I guess what I'm saying is comedy does not age well and

55:08.160 --> 55:14.160
the extent to which it does not age well increases by six years per month yeah

55:14.160 --> 55:18.600
run like you've been doing stand-up for a long time do you look back at like

55:18.600 --> 55:22.840
jokes that you did a long time ago and that shit that just didn't age well that

55:22.840 --> 55:28.320
you like is there anything you regret or have you always kept it pretty like like

55:28.320 --> 55:33.280
you didn't cross anything any art form right if you don't look back at it and

55:33.280 --> 55:37.360
go oh I fucking in better now and I wish I'd done things better now you're not

55:37.360 --> 55:42.760
growing so it's like that's just part of it and I think I mean but I don't go

55:42.760 --> 55:50.560
back and go like oh I used to be a Nazi no I might not have been as good at

55:50.560 --> 55:56.460
communicating what I was doing I thought you were really funny back in your

55:56.460 --> 56:04.600
Nazi era I mean politics aside it was actually just great craftsmanship thank

56:04.600 --> 56:09.880
you yeah Philip Glass you know if you listen to if you if you decode his

56:09.880 --> 56:14.960
numeric symphonies these days it actually ciphers into a horrible condemnation of

56:14.960 --> 56:19.240
his earliest works he's like what was I thinking and there's just thought that

56:19.240 --> 56:24.800
I don't know I just know like the Beastie boy your joke was the Philip Glass of

56:24.800 --> 56:29.640
jokes I just wanted to pick an artist I that would be funny if Philip Glass was

56:29.640 --> 56:33.480
like I'm sorry I didn't know what I was doing like he was like I'm sorry that was

56:33.480 --> 56:43.840
really bad of me oh when you went yeah what was I doing all right so you got

56:43.840 --> 56:49.960

57:35.160 --> 57:40.280
on a because I see from the clips I see the themes do seem to surround actually

57:40.280 --> 57:45.120
getting better not just idle chit-chat like you actually are specifically

57:45.120 --> 57:50.000
talking to people about self-improvement yeah how they were worse than they are

57:50.000 --> 57:53.520
now and what where they got to and how they and how they got there and where

57:53.520 --> 57:58.400
they want to go to and they continue struggles from achieving your dreams

57:58.400 --> 58:03.000

59:38.880 --> 59:46.240
success never ever let's let's talk to Rob Schrab about something yes sitting

59:46.240 --> 59:48.960
over here languishing you've been very quiet it's kind of like I want to try

59:48.960 --> 59:55.680
to be better is it because you go in the reddit and you read don't go on the

59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.080
reddit I don't have to reddit comes to me how in what form no and just I don't

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.400
know it's just I what I always tell people don't go on the reddit there's

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:11.120
an interesting topic like do you do you do you peruse do you self-google do you

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.560
I don't usually self-google sometimes you find things randomly just on accident

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.320
somebody reviewed my special and I didn't like it cuz they they I don't care

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.760
about I mean that you let people do what they want but I didn't like the fact

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.160
that they they were like I think this guy is a phony and I think this guy isn't

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.040
who he says he is and then they call my son and then they go I know even though

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.600
I never met him and then they and then they call my son weird and then I was

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.560
like fuck you I'm gonna fucking get your face online so they got they got they

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.600
got I don't want to say they got you or triggered yeah they triggered me and then

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.200
they were just happy because this was the first time anyone had fucking read

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.040
their articles and so I was like oh I fucking it was an article where they

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.480
semi legit no it was some guy I would say first for real it was paced magazine

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:08.440
which is not mean who cares exactly what is it well I died I died we care now

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.560
but the calm I didn't interview the shit with them before and the main comedy

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.040
guy had always been cool with so it kind of that's what reason kind of triggered

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:21.760
me I guess that guy went on vacation and they had an assistant comedy reviewer

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:27.360
who was some open Michael and he just fucking was like oh that answers every

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.520
question doesn't he also said that he felt the only generations only good

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:38.280
comic was Lisa Lampinelli which it's just a weird thing to say I love Lisa

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.000
Lampinelli it's a weird thing to say whether you love Lisa or not yeah

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.840
because it's like a weird thing why do you get to review comedy then yeah and

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.080
why what how is that how is the art of the critic like supportive of the idea

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.760
of like well here's the empirical statement will make well then you're not

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.800
a very good critic are you not at all you're more of a weird scientist who's

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.040
like practicing a medicine that doesn't exist his whole summary will he when he

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.120
tweeted it out was like I reviewed Ron punches comedy special which was okay I

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.760
was like that is not a review either like it or not like it just saying it's

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:18.080
okay it's just you're a fucking milk toast piece of shit yeah so it triggered

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:23.720
me so to ask you a question yeah sometimes I look but do you just so do

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:29.480
you just so then do you do you pull back from that as a matter of yeah my

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.360
girlfriend's really good at that she tried to make me realize how blessed I am

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.960
and how good I have it and to just she's like these people are just trying to

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:43.560
knock you off your course and leave it alone this is something feel wrong about

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.720
that that that like as a person who wants to hold a microphone and connect with

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:55.840
people that you then by virtue of your chosen path that you in order to do it

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:02.920
well that you're not allowed to do what regular ass people do which is go on

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:11.640
right at yeah I don't like it oh I don't like this I always like I mean I

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.120
still occasionally would do it because I just like to remind people that we're

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.880
human beings I'm a person just like you you can't just tell me you can't just say

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.160
anything to me or you can just you're right but I will respond to you right but

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.040
then the whole thing but then it becomes stupid because then you respond and then

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.040
I see you know there's some fucking blog there's like oh man you've gone round bunches is on a

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:39.560
tirade and then people like who the fuck is round bunches goddamn man hey sunny

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:46.040
I'm older than you yeah I've like any any fight that is the fucking worst when

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.280
you're like like the reddit was like cuz you would your inbox and then you would

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.360
just go like hey what if you just respond to go human being over here or

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.960
whatever and then it was like oh shit this did make a really handy like click

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:05.520
and drag over to look over here to what Dan Harmon said to a fan they're like

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:11.840

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:12.800
the shit and then I came back home and like got on Instagram and there was an

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.880
Instagram comment from somebody saying hey just letting you know sure don't kill

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.760
a messenger but everyone's saying that you deleted your Twitter account because

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.000
you're a pedophile and you did this thing and all this stuff and and and then

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.240
I like found out about this like it was like like these like like four chain

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:39.920
people like I deleted my Twitter account yes because James Gunn got fired so

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.000
therefore go ahead and link it to yeah and I did it was it was like they were

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.560
like why did Dan Harmon just deleted his Twitter account and then someone goes

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:56.440
why did he do that what does he have to hide lol and then someone responded with

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.640
maybe this and then they started pushing it out and my account was already

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:07.560

with this so and I was I was in the back alley of this show there's a show I

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.400
wish I could mark the episode because I came out here because the decision was

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:28.200
it for the first time in my life and that's why it's all this stuff it makes

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.600
me so sad because my my entire MO was always be as honest as possible always

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.960
be honest and for the first time in my life the way to fight dishonesty was to

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:46.000
say nothing and it just hurts so bad and I like came out here but it was the

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.440
right decision after 48 hours of like you wouldn't believe the fucking calls

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.040
like hey Dan it's me Mike Thompson I got I got crisis interventionist the

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.360
Stafford Leo Maffop nothing he's a bit of a like people that are like hey so

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.520
listen here's the thing like does anybody know for sure you're a pedophile

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.920
like what are you talking about none of this is real like like just let me tell

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:16.320
people you've got any pictures of you not touching kid

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:24.000
meanwhile the 48 hour clock goes by so the New York Times the thing that made

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.240
me lose hope in all of humanity was the day that the New York Times who had

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.240
contacted my publicist for a comment about it they're like hey what's going

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.520
on with this thing and my publicist said he's not commenting right now because

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:43.960
I'm sitting in my kitchen like on a speakerphone going like okay so what do

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.600
I do to not get fired by a cartoon network AT&T all this stuff like what

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:54.480

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.040
him so that they don't pull a Disney so that we don't continue this fucking

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:06.400
slide and and we're brokering apologies and I finished brokering one in back

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.840
appropriately by the fucking dumpster and behind this theater and then came out

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.840
on this stage and did a show where I said nothing and it basically said

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:23.120
nothing until now and but but it was like in the 48 hours where so his Twitter

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.800
account is deleted and so then it's like the story is like Dan Harmon

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:36.200
deletes his Twitter account after video surfaces of him fucking a baby doll

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:45.680
nine years ago oh yeah I remember this and it was like no that's not true Dan

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.000
Harmon deletes his Twitter account therefore video surfaces but how

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.160
complicated is that story well the New York Times like that was the point was

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.960
like the New York Times like like just kind of ran with that story like

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.200
inherent in the headline like Dan Harmon deletes Twitter account after video

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.520
surfaces because they they got that from Breitbart from but like all of these

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:15.280
people it was like yeah cause effect timeline to it I'm like no Dan Harmon

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.880
deletes Twitter account because James Gunn got fired for tweeting about fucking

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.040
kids and Dan Harmon knows that he's not gonna stand up to that test and Dan

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.800
Harmon wants nothing to do with Twitter anymore and once Dan Harmon leaves it's

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.440
time to hit that pinata on the way out the door so Dan Harmon regrets leaving

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.880
Twitter in the first place because he didn't know that you could shudder your

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.640
window to fucking crystal knocked and have people just kick in your door like

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.920
I like but there's no way to like come out and scream that without making things

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.160
worse making things more clickable and the only way to win that fight which a

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.280
fight I never wanted to have is to be silent yeah which is something I've

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:01.600
never done wait for the next thing to come along like like it was like oh so

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.520
this is how you living well as best revenge just just grin and bear it don't

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.000
fuel the fire don't kick up dust around it your contract's not signed yet all

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.720
this stuff it was like like like like this isn't well then what am I then then

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.760
what age have we entered where where honesty is no longer the best policy

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.000
where the people whose names on their accounts on social media are the same as

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.140
their birth certificate the people who say what went on with them yesterday for

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:38.600
real are like their word is weighed less than hordes of people with fake accounts

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.480
that just want to like if you if enough dust gets kicked up around you on the

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.520
internet you can get fired I I really I remain to this day every night I sit in

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.960
bed playing cookie collector and Minecraft and just thinking about it I

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.360
have no idea where to file it I don't know how to feel yeah people get shot

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:05.480
though so who cares I mean yeah so so I mean good point so we've entered an

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:11.920
era where I have to go from being happy about being honest to being thankful I'm

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.400
not shot yet yeah that's where we are that's really where we are as a country

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:28.720
that feels real real bad it does my favorite part though I know is I do I

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.080
don't mean to just kind of not be empathetic to what you're going through

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.640
because that is horrible and I've only experienced it a very small way and I

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.400
know how it made me feel and how did you get like well what are you referring to

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.120
not just people just talking a lot of trash and you are just particular in

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.920
people like you know who you say you are I'm like I don't know how to prove this

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:52.960
or make you think who I am who I am and so it's just small things but my thing

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.080
my favorite part about this story is that that you there was a moment that you

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:03.000
must have had where you were this James Gunn thing came out and then you went oh

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.800
shit there's a video of me fucking a baby dog actually that was the last thing on

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.960
my mind no no I didn't think about that at all I was I was surprised I was like

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:20.280
oh that video I was like damn I did a good job mixing that sound if we go

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.640
through a channel 101 stuff we all committed loads of crimes no I totally

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.600
forgot about that I had deleted that video I shot that video in the community

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.800
offices it was 2009 I was like it's a month after it was on channel 101 I was

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.280
like that needs to come down if I'm going to be in the business that Tina Fey

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.360
is in like I am not I am a political figure now invisible I need to not be

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.160
doing this anymore I'm not Johnny Rotten anymore I can't I took it down and

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.080
someone but someone had someone had some admirable fucking like Captain Crunch

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.560
kept it in there Davy Jones locker for all that time next to their Crunch

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:03.880
berries I was what I was thinking was more much more appropriately was nine

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:10.600
years of tweets I was I wasn't thinking about videos I was thinking about nine

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:16.920
years of being actively reacting to society in the moment no way I'm gonna

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.760
hold up to that test no absolutely not yeah none of us really I mean maybe me so

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.720
I thought maybe you yeah I thought briefly about like the idea of going

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.100
through and like going this one know that one know that one and then it was

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:39.120
like no no no that would take three years to go through nine years of tweets

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.120
and go oh this one no no and I was like no the only right thing to do here is

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.640
like abscond that's been one of the kind of like greatest tricks that's been

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.840
played in the last few years is the shift of responsibility like it was our

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:59.640
job not to necessarily be reckless and again to not be harmful and calls calls

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.040
pain but our job to test boundaries and have fun and to just say whatever

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.160
reckless thing that we're say and then we're supposed to be checked in by the

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.040
real people who are in charge and now it's like the people who are in charge

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.720
just say whatever the fuck and they lie and they do whatever and no one really

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.040
checks that and it's just like no you we're screwing nice you know but by the

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.560
end of day it kind of lets me know that it's all kind of pointless because like

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:30.560
if if it really had a power like then there'd be so many powerful people who

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.440
have been already like truly powerful people who had been taken down by you

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:40.560
know like I'll give it some time I'm okay I'll be patient I mean it is pretty

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.640
easy to get somebody fired right now we haven't changed that part of our culture

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:50.120
that depends on their value I believe like if people it's like any sports team

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:57.400
you should be like they should not be able to get fired because a bunch of

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:06.120
people on Twitter well I mean I ideally I'm talking about yeah I'm saying like

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:14.840
like what your mailman shouldn't get fired because he tweets something that

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.680
goes viral that I just in an ideal universe that shouldn't be the case

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.720
so many things like well you can go with that though because then by that stance

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:30.000
if some if a cop that's like a racist cop knows to tweet out racist things

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.280
shouldn't should they be held accountable for that I mean that's that's

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:42.880
dumb applause no that's I mean a cop is like yeah it's like bring it back to

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.800
mailman so I can control this but it's no that's I mean we talked about did you

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.800
like the weatherman I made the joke because the weatherman that stumbled

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.600
over Martin Luther King's name and did you cognizant of that and I was like oh

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.640
you didn't know about that it was like he he there was there was actually two

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.800
separate guys it was like he was trying he said tried to say Martin Luther

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.640
King's name because he was saying like by the way there's a celebration in this

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.120
park or whatever he said he said Coon instead of King and like while he was

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:21.640
saying the name and it went viral and the weatherman lost his job and I am like

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:26.440
is that how we find out people are racist and then I made the joke of like

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.360
isn't that the one job where you could safely be racist as a weatherman yeah

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.960
like what are you gonna do yeah like are you gonna not tell Mexican people it's

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:42.320
raining you're like see I still I could still do stand up if I the white

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:51.200
weather's okay 78 degrees again but you about I mean obviously yeah they say

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.440
great it's like we don't we we want we we want our cops to not be racist

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:01.080
obviously that's a truism therefore if a cop in his private life is on social

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.840
media and and reflects racism on his Facebook page with some post or even a

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.600
retweet then it's yeah it's rough it's just a slippery slope we're dealing with

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:22.760
new problems it's fun yeah I hope it stays fun I I don't want to live in a

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:33.360
world where it where the people that are in control of who profits who's plugged

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.600
into the the hive mind and who's excommunicated where I worry about

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:48.160
buying a ticket to this ride where it's and we've already seen I feel like the

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:54.360
nefarious among us let's call them right wing people people who are nihilistic a

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.160
little bit about politics and ideology and the way that we interact with media

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:05.760
that they can actually hack as it were the leftist mindset by for instance

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:11.840
saying hey what if I were to tell you that this person by your definitions is

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:18.400
technically this or that wouldn't you want them to then by your own rules

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:23.800
suffer or divide or compartmentalized and they're enjoying that right now and

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:34.080
it's really distressing to watch them troll yeah so what and I guess I I can

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:42.640
predict what you're gonna say is yeah it's it's fun no that's not fun okay I

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.080
predicted wrong yeah no it's not fun I mean there's lessons to be learned and

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:56.840
just that like and overcoming that and I think overall like it gets so

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.800
complicated when you break it down into like like all that type of stuff was

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.600
right wing and social media but at the end of the day it's all about

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.800
separatism it's all about trying to separate people from from so that they

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.320
just stay in these little boxes so that a small amount of people can screw the

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.280
rest of us over so if you just like whether I'm going like oh I don't

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.720
trust you because you're a white man or you don't trust me because I'm black or

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.920
women doesn't feel safe around around anyone then then like that's just

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.360
keeping us all separate and that's all allowing us to be taken advantage of it's

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:34.240
it's it's through unity and through through quality and through diversity that

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.600
we're that we are able to fight those things and then you you can be like well

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.240
I wouldn't believe those things about that person you know and maybe the best

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.480
way to prove for ourselves if there was if you could call it a battle between

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:52.200
those two sides the the best way to to proof to prepare for that battle is for

01:19:52.200 --> 01:20:02.960
the individual to have a funschian kind of like I'm not I'm probably not gonna

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:10.360
judge this person like so much like like like like if we if we don't get caught up

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.240
in the timber chopped down this tree I heard that this thing is happening so

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.800
let's off with their head oh yeah no I hate that I I've never been in the

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.480
business of throwing people away or calling people monsters I think that's

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.080
one that's another tool to separate people we're all capable of horrible

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:34.560
choices and horrible decisions and you have to have and I'm not saying that you

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.520
you excuse someone's actions excuse what they've done but to act as if you're

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:44.880
better or you're right to grab that ticket isn't that kind of like not to

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:50.880
over I'm doing a writer habit here I'm trying to connect it to the beginning

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.640
mm-hmm that guy in that park when you're having your epiphany who's being

01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:02.600
abusive to his charges is going like you fucking people I'm like that guy felt

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:11.960
licensed to be abusive to his mental health flock because he felt like oh

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:17.960
I'm I've got the high ground here yeah and we're gonna continue to be tempted in

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:24.040
that direction like we're always gonna be told as primates by Twitter by Newsweek

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.440
by this ringing thing in our pocket we're gonna constantly being told hey

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.480
there's somebody out there that's worse than you that you could punch down on

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:37.120
right now if you take this opportunity or they're trying to take what you have

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:42.880
or trying to stop you from getting your goals and at the end of the day like you

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:48.480
you meet so many people that you're like we all have the same goals we all just

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.720
kind of want the same shit no matter what we all just want to be happier and

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.440
make a little bit more money and have more time with our fucking family and do

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.400
vacations and shit and work less we all just want to pool yeah maybe one more

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:07.320
bedroom yeah I love one more bedroom one day we get DJ equipment that I won't

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:14.320
use there should be a political party or the chant is one more bedroom yeah like

Schrab scud 25 years anniversary thank you very much I've one of my pet peeves is

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.520
when somebody's Instagram feed is a thousand things over and over but I've

01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.800
been really enjoying all of the fan art that that the people have done for your

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:05.560
it's pretty amazing it's fucking great I'm the catch up a mustard one with the

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:13.840
somebody that's Joey Garfield that's Joey Garfield Joey Garfield from their first years Ron I did a comic book with Dan

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:22.880
like back in 1994 and it was the reason why we moved out here and it just turned

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:28.640
25 last last Tuesday it's the only comic book it's the only comic book that I've

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.080
ever actually read I'm not a comic book guy but I love scud like you give me the

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.960
dominant buses and the whole thing it's it's beautifully drawn it's it's it's

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.560
it's it's really wonderful it's it's very you it's it's what was it called it's

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.720
called scud the disposable assassin oh and then they made a video game out of they

01:23:46.720 --> 01:24:04.840
did it was not good game no it was not there were two games there was there was

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:11.560
the game you played and there was a PC version both were terrible but it's cool

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:18.400
yeah but you have a game made a side scroller it was a side scrolling game

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:25.160
like when doom and Duke Nukem was hitting the scene yeah it was like about yeah

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:31.800
bad timing but no it's it was it's very cool to watch all the like all the fans

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.200
do their version of the artwork it it's because it's really like it kind of

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.680
choked me up if it's very yeah yeah well I gotta say you know not to play the bad

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:45.680
guy but scud the scud the disposable assassin is like it takes place in a

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.080
future where you can buy a robot assassin out of a vending machine and you can

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.840
assign it a target and then once it finishes killing the target itself

01:24:53.840 --> 01:25:03.360
destructs kind of a rip off of mr. Meeseeks yeah oh shit you fire you

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:11.880
fucking stole scud it wasn't my idea who's was it no it was mine just a Justin

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.400
was Justin consciously or unconscious I don't know nobody nobody recognized it

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:26.160
like I think later on it was like a fair amount of fan so you saw them making

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.880
your money and the opening up book scud kills his target and then is washing

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.800
off his hands in the bathroom and sees his reflection in the mirror and reads

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.840
the warning on the back that says will this unit will self-destruct upon

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.400
termination so he goes out and has to kill everybody as a as a like a hit man

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.920
for hire to keep his first target alive like a life support system yeah the

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:57.680
