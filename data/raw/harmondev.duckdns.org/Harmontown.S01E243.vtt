{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.000\nMake some noise for yourself, you look so goddamn good tonight.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:08.000\nHow do you feel?\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:15.000\nWelcome to the first inaugural show here, we're so fucking happy to be here.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:19.000\nThis session of Harmontown is now in full effect.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:31.000\nWelcome to the stage, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:36.000\nThe mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nShow him some love.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:41.000\nThank you.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:46.000\nI am Brandon Johnson, I will be guest comptrolling for the lovely Jeff Davis.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:51.000\nI'm nervous, I don't want to blow it, Jeff Davis.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nBig jerk shoes, he wasn't here for the premiere.\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:01.000\nHe knew this was coming for months and then he's out there fucking Ryan Styles or whatever.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nI thought he was on the BET Kings of Comedy tour.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:10.000\nWe were going to do, I don't want to start on a sour note.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:13.000\nI don't want to start on a more sour note than starting without music.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:16.000\nSorry about that, that was a little awkward.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nIt was all quiet, it was like church.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:20.000\nThat's why we wore this outfit.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:23.000\nWe're going to be working out some kinks.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:25.000\nAnd then we're going to be bringing out the kinks.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:26.000\nWhat?\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nWhat was it?\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:35.000\nWell, I know, okay, so not to start off on a sour note, but we were going to, you know, we were waiting.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nWe kept waiting to play a new...\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:41.000\nWe kept waiting, oh yeah.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nWhy do that at Meltdown?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nYou know, why would we do that at Meltdown?\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.000\nOh, I don't want to wait until the big day.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:48.000\nRight.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:54.000\nLike a week ago, Jeff was like, oh, I forgot, I got a show for a month or whatever, he's just gone.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nSo it's like, yeah, it's just the worst.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:00.000\nAnd it's just, it's just, it's just, that's what Burbank's about.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nIt's about sadness and...\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nWe're just underneath five freeways and...\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nWhose idea was it to move to this awful location?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nWe could go to Ikea.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nIt was my idea.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:14.000\nIt was my idea.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nBecause hopefully the live stream experience is a little more friendly.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nOh, great.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nThanks, Dan.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nThat's what we love, the people that pay to come see the show.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:25.000\nWe want to make sure that the live stream is...\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nThere was a guy that tweeted...\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nI don't know, I don't know.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:36.000\nNot that I want to, like, grease the stinky wheels, but there was a guy that tweeted in response to us tweeting out that we were going to be here.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nHe said, I can't remember what his wording was.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:39.000\nOh, man.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:40.000\nIt was like, oh, great.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nFollowing the Cookie Cutter podcast track, I see...\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:45.000\nWhat?\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:51.000\nAre you co-opting your animation studio's extra building for a location to shoot it out of?\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nThe old cookie cutter.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:59.000\nThe old cookie cutter path.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nIn podcasting.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nWhat do you say?\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\nIt was something like that.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nThat guy is so grumpy.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nHow do you get that grumpy?\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nIs he just like...\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nWhere do you get the impression of the cookie cutter podcast path?\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:16.000\nHow can a path be cookie cutter?\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nIt sounds delicious.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nIt sounds like a thing.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:23.000\nAll right, so I'll be calling out some notes because we have to live test the venue and stuff.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nFirst things first.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nI don't know if this is going to work.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nThis is blinding me.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:31.000\nBut I guess there's always going to be lights.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nThe second thing is that, you know...\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nYes, there's always going to be lights.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nLet's not get too cocky.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nThere might not always be lights.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nYay.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:52.000\nWell, with the Santa Ana's blowing through, how about that weather, L.A.?\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhat kind of podcast is this?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:55.000\nHow about the weather?\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nWhat is he looking at?\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nWhat's he looking at on his phone?\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nIs his agent calling?\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nIs he telling him, great job?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nWhy is he being self deprecating?\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nHe moved his podcast here.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nIs the cookie cutter a podcaster?\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:16.000\nThis is weird to say, but I feel more at risk of being shot here than the last venue.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nI don't know what that is.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nThat's so racist.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:22.000\nI'm so sorry about that.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nYou're the one that bought a gun.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nThat's how racist it is.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nWe have to move all the way to Burbank to find out Spencer's racist.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nYou just mean, yeah, just clearer shots.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:40.000\nYeah, I don't know. Maybe it's just that thinking that it's like a place of nerd dumb puts you at ease or something.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nI don't know, but just, oh man.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nYeah, I guess it feels more like a town hall now.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:53.000\nSo somebody could walk up the middle aisle and say, get your hand out of my pocket.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:56.000\nNow I really will be racist and ask you, do you know what that was about?\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nWhat did that mean?\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:05.000\nThat is the thing that the FBI agent yelled to cause a distraction in the back of the hall when Malcolm X was speaking.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:12.000\nIt was actually confirmed that the guy, because I saw Malcolm X in the movie and all I saw was a guy just started yelling that out.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:18.000\nIt didn't say like, this is an FBI agent or anything or maybe I was mine crafting during the movie.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:29.000\nBut is that like, what? I'm continuing to be racist by going to you as if you're some kind of like Malcolm X movie expert.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:34.000\nYou watched it nine times. Come on. This was your ghostbusters.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nMalcolm X was my uncle.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nThis was your gremlins too.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nThis was your ghostbusters.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:49.000\nI think I probably watched it once back when it was like on a pay-per-view.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nI found myself very confused by that scene.\n\n05:52.000 --> 06:02.000\nIt smacked of like, oh, there must have been mass chaos and there's like accounts of people saying different stuff and that Spike Lee was just being faithful to the confusion.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nBecause it was just a confusing thing.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nIt was organized confusion.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt was so that everyone would be diverted to the guys who were arguing and then no one would see the shooters.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:15.000\nAll right. But they grabbed that guy that said, get your hand down the way pocket.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nGoddamn, that was February?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nAll right.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:25.000\nThis wasn't on my list of things to talk about anyway.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:30.000\nI really am finding out. This election has really made me aware of how racist I am.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nI gave you some black nerd shit just in keeping.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nOh, that's good. Thank you.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nThat's one of those weird facts that, like, nerds, no.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:43.000\nAll right.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:53.000\nI just, what the fuck is this thing? Let's do it.\n\n06:53.000 --> 07:03.000\nSo for those of you just listening, oh my god.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nI have to suit fool you.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:12.000\nFor those of you only listening and not looking, again, you can look for $5 a month.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nBut also, I'm not going to turn my back on you if you're just listening.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:27.000\nSo I'll tell you, there's a plastic wrapped, a polka dot plastic wrapped six foot tall human sized gift on the stage that was brought by,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\ndoes anyone want to identify themselves as the gift bringer?\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nYou're both the gift, you're dual gift bringers.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nWhat are your names? Can I ask?\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nI'm Spencer.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nFuck.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nSpencer and Zoe.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:44.000\nThis sucks.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nDo you want me to just open it up here? Is that okay?\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nOr do you want me to open it privately?\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:49.000\nOr do you want to help me open it?\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nOkay.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nThere's a ribbon.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nOkay.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:53.000\nAt the top.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nYou can just undo it.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nYou don't need the knife.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nOkay.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nAll right.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:01.000\nYou don't need the knives, Brandon.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:14.000\nYou don't need the knife.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nThere's a second.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nOh shit.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nThere's a mannequin.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:36.000\nIt's got paper flowers over its privates and it's wearing a panty hose.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:41.000\nBrandon just cocked the chest right.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nNo shoes.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nThat's good.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:48.000\nThey know what I like.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nShe's not wearing high heels because I like comfortable women.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nI don't know if you know that about that.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nNo high heels?\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nI love sleepy, comfortable women.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:02.000\nI like Ugg boots or nice flats.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:11.000\nAnd then of course, tights or stockings because women are very comfortable in those.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:15.000\nNow we have this.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nThank you, Zoe and Spencer.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nThis is very thoughtful and probably a great deal of work.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:26.000\nThanks for giving me more.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nOkay.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nThank you.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nOkay.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:34.000\nThere's a hosiery to go with it.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.400\nIt's dream girl brand.\n\n09:36.400 --> 09:40.000\nOne size fits most, it says, at the bottom.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nYeah.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nAll right.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nWell, this is making me...\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nThank you and good night.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nThank you so much.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:55.000\nYou're such thoughtful people.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nI got to say, we did our last show.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nAnd so there'll be other people brought gifts to that as well.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:03.000\nAnd one of the people brought a...\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nIt was like a slightly scaled down.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nIt wasn't the same sizes in the Christmas story, but it was like one of those...\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nIt was a replica leg lamp with the fish net on it.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:13.000\nBut he...\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:17.000\nThis is like how you know you've really found your audience.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:21.000\nLike after doing a show for five years, he put a little pant leg over it to not objectify\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nit in public.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:30.000\nLike it had a little tasteful slack around it for public.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nWhich is, you know, because he didn't want to trigger people next to you.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nHe didn't want to like brandish it around.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nLike, look at me.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nThis is what I think your standard should be.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nHe just...\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nTrigger.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:46.000\nHe put a little leg tarp on it.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nI was going to say burka, but then I was like, no.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nThen you'll get in trouble because you don't know how to use that term properly.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nYou'll hurt somebody.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:55.000\nHas anybody watched that show?\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nPatriot?\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nYou guys watch that show on Amazon?\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nWhat do you mean, do you watch it in the present tense?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nIt's just a thing that just sits there on the internet.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nThat's how TV is now.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:03.000\nYou just go...\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:09.600\nHas anybody gone and turned over that Amazon rock and like taken just whatever you want\n\n11:09.600 --> 11:12.000\nfrom underneath it?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nIt's appointment viewing.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nIt's a little...\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nBut it's great.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nI watched like...\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nI watched the whole show.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI really like it.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nIt's a bad podcast, but Patriot's great.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nYou should go watch it.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nWell, we got some stuff.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nYeah.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:30.000\nSo, all right.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:40.000\nThis is the one thing I wanted to talk about, and then I'll bring my guest up.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:45.000\nI know you're going to be like...\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nSome people are going to be like, oh, what's the big deal?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nOr maybe there's press here.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nMaybe variety came.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nI'm like, oh, what's my angle on this piece?\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nDan Harmon takes streaming to the mainstream or something.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:57.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nBut there's going to be judgment from each other.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:06.000\nBut I just like...\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nYour boogers get like...\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:14.000\nI feel like 90% of my waking hours are spent picking my nose now.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nIf you've found that you get more boogers as you get older,\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nand you have to...\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nIt's like an air filter.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nIt clogs faster.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:28.000\nAnd so it gets a little bit like, oh, you spend 10 seconds when you're 6 years old.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nYou spend 10 seconds picking your nose,\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nand you're like bummed out when you're done.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nAnd...\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nWhy are you bummed out?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nBecause you're a kid and you love boogers,\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nand you're like, hey...\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nOh, no, now I'm going to breathe clearly for another two days\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nuntil I get enough boogers to have fun with.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnd then just cut to you just like...\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nYou're like twice a movie.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nI'm like, more?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nLike...\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nThis is just awful.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nIs that because you're growing more hair in your nose?\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nBoom.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nBoom.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nMore hair.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nIs that because your body knows that you're becoming more vulnerable to death?\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nAnd so it's just like, it's just throwing the cheapest solution at it,\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\njust going like, just don't let anything in.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:15.000\nGet off my microbiotic lawn.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nYour body becomes against you at a certain age,\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nand it makes us look fucking ridiculous.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:23.000\nIt makes us the people we used to laugh at.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nYeah.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nRemember when you were a kid, you were like, you were this high\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nso you could see up in the old people's noses,\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:32.000\nand you were like, look at this old boogernose motherfucker trying to give me advice.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nNever going to be this motherfucker.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nAnd then today.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:42.000\nDid I talk last time about that documentary,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:46.000\nthe Texas University shooting, the sniper guy,\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nthere's like a movie out.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nDid I talk about that last time?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nOkay.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nYeah.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nWell, this is related.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nThe boogers.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nIt's really cool.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nI can't remember what it's called, but you should check it out.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nI don't know where you can find it,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nbut again, just go flip some rocks over and Google it, whatever.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nIt's just laying there.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:12.000\nBut it's a kind of like second by second witness account, multiple witnesses.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nEverybody, survivors of this, what was it in the 70s,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nthe Texas University guy went up in the clock tower,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nand he just started.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nHe shot like 30-something people.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nMany of them lived.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nMany of them died.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nAnd the ones that lived, obviously, are the ones telling the story.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nBut they did this thing.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nThey did this kind of like thing that almost made me turn it off,\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.000\nbecause it was like this kind of like waking life,\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nwhat's that movie called?\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nThe rotoscopy like vectory kind of thing.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nAnd thank you.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:51.000\nOur guest, our guest is champing at the bit to get up here.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nAnd you figured it out who the guest is.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nAnd they're like, he's a guest?\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nYou call him a guest now?\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nIt's just like when Buddy Hackett was on Carson,\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nit was just like, okay, who can we get?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:05.000\nOkay, but...\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:10.000\nYou are going to pay for that.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:15.000\nBut the thing is, so then you realize as it goes,\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nand you should keep watching it,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:24.000\nbecause it just continually gets more and more enthralling\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:27.000\nand heartbreaking and terrifying and interesting.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:30.000\nAnd there's heroic stories, and there's also people going.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nAnd that's when I realized I was a coward,\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:37.000\nwhich is really just as uplifting and interesting to hear.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:43.000\nBut all of the people were like the age they were during the incident.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nAnd I realized it's because we're agist.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nThey hired actors, like 25-year-old actors,\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:54.000\nand animated interviews so that they weren't necessarily\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\njust having fake people on video.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nSo they kind of split the diff, I think.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nThis is my assumption of why they were doing this, artistically.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:05.000\nBut they were doing this rotoscopy thing of younger people\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:10.000\nreading the accounts of the people that have survived it.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nAnd then they start cutting to the people toward the end\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nand revealing that those people are still alive\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nand that this was their story.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nThey're all, of course, 30, 40 years older.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nAnd it really dawns on you.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nYou're like, oh, now I see why they did that,\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nbecause we don't like old people.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nWe don't believe that there are people,\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nI'm including myself among them at this point,\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nbut it was like melting people telling you,\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:38.000\nwell, then this thing that really happened, it was real bad.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:43.000\nAnd you're just like, yeah, that's what you rock lords always say.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:47.000\nYou're always referring to how life was rocky.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:52.000\nEverything's made of granite and flint.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:57.000\nEveryone looks like Michael Chickless in an oven.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nThe ears are the same size as their head,\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:04.000\nand the lobes are resting like epaulets on their shoulder pads.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:12.000\nAnd their teeth are old baseballs signed by Mickey Rooney.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:16.000\nMickey Mantle.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nWhich means they got that when they were very young,\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nand he was still a child star.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nBut it was really effective, because they include the images of the old people,\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nand so it really brings you to the precipice of realizing that.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:31.000\nAnd then you're like, yeah, it seems like a dumb thing to have to remind yourself,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:34.000\nbut 65-year-old people were once 25,\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:37.000\nand they were probably pretty hot when they were,\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nand you probably, therefore, really listened to everything they said.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nYou're like, man, I want a soda pop!\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nAnd you're like, whoa, that's amazing, Brittany!\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd then she's later just like, I want a soda pop!\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nAnd you're like, we can fuck you, yeah.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nLike, piece of shit.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nGet back in your whole grandma's.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nYou piece of un-fuckable shit!\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nYou offend me!\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nIt's true.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nWe really blame people.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nWe blame, we blame, when women get pregnant,\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nwe look at them as like, oh, you're glowing,\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:11.000\nwe're like pregnant, but you can't work here, get out of here, go home!\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:15.000\nNo, you can't get paid while you're at home having a baby,\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nyou fucking gross baby-maker.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nAnd then as we all get older, like, you old fuck,\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:23.000\nyou gross piece of shit.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:27.000\nWe worship youth, and when are you the youngest,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nwhen you're fucking stupid, like, we're kind of like,\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nwe split the difference, like, oh, I love 25-year-olds,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nbut really, you know, you can tell from our culture,\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nbut I really like a nice 19-year-old.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nOh, shit.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:41.000\nYou know.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nIt's like, you don't know nothing when you're that age,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nand so those people have all the capitalistic power.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nWe're like, what do you think?\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nWhat do you think about the weather today?\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nOh, it was brand new.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:55.000\nHe's right, he's right, it's never happened this weather.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nWe used to have that respect for old people\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nwhen we were cavemen, because they looked at melty people,\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nand they'd be like, dude, it's melting.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nLike, do you know how many saber-toothed tigers\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nhe hasn't been bitten by?\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nYeah, but you know, old people kind of got mean\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nand sent us off to war, so it changed the shit, maybe.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nYeah.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nBecause when I see an old person, I'm like,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nyou fucking did acid and fucked up the country for us.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:19.000\nYeah.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nThat's the generation.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nYeah, there was the silent generation,\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nthe greatest generation of the baby boomers.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nRight.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nBeetles and fake butter and AIDS.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:41.000\nThat was our reference to the community\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nand the community Christmas episode,\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nwhere they'd say, and I believe one of those things,\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:49.000\nDonald Glover helped out with that.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:53.000\nHe came up with fake butter and AIDS, I think.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:59.000\nDonald was, he was really going places back then.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:03.000\nIt's a shame to see these kids waste their future, you know.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nI wish she would have stayed after that.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nJust fell in the wrong crowd.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nA bunch of rappers.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nI told them, I told them,\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nis it Donald that we're going to regret this\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:17.000\nnot moving to Yahoo with us?\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nWhere are you going?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nTo rap.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nHa!\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nTo rap.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nAtlanta.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:25.000\nWho's ever heard of the place?\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nGo ahead, make your silly show.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\nHa ha ha, Donald Glover.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nI'll see you again, my friend.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nKicking on my door in the rain.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:40.000\nPlease, one more season, sir.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:45.000\nCan we do it for Alta Vista?\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:49.000\nDoes crack, does crack to have a discretionary fund?\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:54.000\nWe could shoot it in your apartment.\n\n20:54.000 --> 21:00.000\nHa, I don't know, Donald, I'll think about it.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nWhat am I looking at?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nI'm not looking at anything.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:07.000\nI'm trying to find my notes and I'm a little nervous\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.000\nbecause it's my, let's try out some of the technology.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:14.000\nSpencer, tell people, oh, let's bring up Rob Schwab.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:19.000\nRob Schwab, ladies and gentlemen, Rob Schwab.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:26.000\nShe's got a backpack on.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:35.000\nCareful, careful.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:41.000\nOh, no.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:46.000\nOh, my God.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:50.000\nWhy is there a mirror under her?\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's like a mirror under her.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nHe's wearing a backpack.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nWill you talk to people for a second?\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:08.000\nThe backpacks are the only way we could power the show.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:15.000\nYou want me to talk to people while you go backstage for a second?\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:30.000\nNo, I was just going to...\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nOh, for people listening, we have to,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nsomething we can't, we tried to clear the mannequin\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:37.000\nand I ended up fondling the legs and I...\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\nThat's it, that's it.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:44.000\nIt's good to be here.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:49.000\nHow are you?\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nI'm nervous, I'm happy to be here.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nHow was your week?\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nWhat?\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nI'm not doing good, guys.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nYou got a case of the Ds.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nI got the Ds, man.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:05.000\nI don't know, this writer strike is scaring me.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nI mean, we were talking about it backstage.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:13.000\nThat's going to suck, man, but it can't work.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:17.000\nYou've got to do it to stay solid.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:23.000\nThis setup, it's such a big stage, but it's just full of stuff.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nWe're going to figure it out.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nOkay, good.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:35.000\nThank God you brought the really comfortable chairs.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nAlright, so we're going to do this in real time.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:47.000\nSo somebody tell me, how do I hook my thing up to the thing?\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:54.000\nCan you use a deeper voice?\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nI'll shut you right up.\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:01.000\nOkay, now I've got to tell you about an hour before the show\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:05.000\nare dimmer blue, so we can't dim the lights,\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:14.000\nwhich might make it hard to view a projection.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:19.000\nHow is dimmer?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nAlright, so this is...\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nWe're going to try it.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nWe're just trying it.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nAlright.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:37.000\nOh, shit.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nThis isn't the writer's room.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nCome on.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:43.000\nThis is my Minecraft world.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nI'm playing a Skyblock mod pack.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:48.000\nNow, if you're listening to the free version of the podcast,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nagain, $5 a month, but also...\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nYou know, I'm not going to...\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nI just want to try out some of the visual stuff.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nGet the gold!\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nGet the fucking gold!\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\nI'm going to use my jet pack, so I want to show you guys one thing.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nGet the fucking gold!\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nNow, it was just nighttime, and now it's daytime.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nCan you explain what happened?\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nI right clicked on the bed, and the sun came out.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nGreat.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nAlright, Spencer, look at my wither farm.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nYou were talking to Cody about this on Instagram.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nOh, that's right, yeah.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:23.000\nOkay, so these are refined storage constructors.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:27.000\nAnd then over here is a refined storage system,\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nand I have soul sand in there.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nSo soul sand is going to...\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nWhat happened?\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:37.000\nI just feel my life just draining away.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:43.000\nThat's the soul sand.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nAnd then these are placers,\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nand they have little tiny wither skeleton skulls in them.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nYou know what?\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nThis is too cool for you guys.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:53.000\nSo those things make a wither?\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:54.000\nThose things make a wither.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nIf you play Minecraft,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nthen you know that when you get soul sand...\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nThey love withers.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nDon't encourage a T-formation.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nIf you stack up soul sand in this T-formation,\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nand then you place wither skeleton skulls on top,\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nit creates a wither,\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:08.000\nwhich is the most dangerous creature in all of Minecraftia.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nAnd it's called a wither.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nAnd these are placers, so I can do it remotely.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nThe wither skeleton skulls are in here.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nThis is all wither-proof obsidian block.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:17.000\nWither-proof.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nMake it do.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nSo then over here,\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nI have a switch.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:24.000\nIt's a 10-second self-resetting lever.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:29.000\nIt goes down to conduit here.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nDo you want to explain the redstone logic\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nthat controls this self?\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nJust think of redstone as like electricity.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nSo this is redstone conduit,\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nso this lever is going to activate,\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nis going to send energy down these things,\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nand it's going to split to the left and the right.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nOn the left, it's going to go over here\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nand up to these placement things\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nthat's going to place wither skeleton skulls\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\non top of the soul sand.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nAnd then on the right,\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nthis is going to make a force field\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nover the top of this,\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nbut it has to do it after the wither gets created\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nand falls down below the force field level.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nSo I used a mod called...\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nOf course.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nSuper...\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nDoes anybody have another mannequin?\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:13.000\nDid they want to bring up it?\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nThis is a small circuit I made.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nThere's a mod where you can make your own circuits\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nand you can get really elaborate,\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nbut all this does is it sets a little tiny delay in there,\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nlike a five-second delay.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nTiny delay.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nSo, with one lever pull,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nwhat you're going to see happen,\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nI don't know if we have...\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nEveryone in the audience,\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nwe got to say pull that lever.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.000\nOkay.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\nOkay, on three.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nWell, wait, wait, wait.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nIf you want sound,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nyou got to change the source in your audio.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\nDon't listen to them.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nI'm just so worried that\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nanything in this laptop is going to...\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nOkay.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nDo we have money for this?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nDecimator?\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:53.000\nDo we have enough time in the show?\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.000\nThe thing is,\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:57.000\nit's hard to know what sounds like what.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nI don't hear any sounds.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nThese guys would be buying and moving.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nThese are my animals.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nThat's a cow.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nAnd even clucking, if I understand.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nThat's a chicken.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nThis stuff's, you know,\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nI don't probably...\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nThis may be for another day.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:15.000\nThese are generating cobble and flint and sand\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nand they're each going through all the things\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nand then they pass it off to the next thing\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nand then, you know, there's just a lot of...\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nYou get iron and stuff.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nYou guys don't care.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nI got a pull the lever.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nOkay.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nAll right.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nSo here's...\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nNot yet!\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nWhat have I done?\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nBecause you have to know what to look for.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nBecause it doesn't look like much.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nThere's going to be a wither.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nI have to tell you what's happening\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nso that you can be impressed.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nBut really, there's no...\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nThere's no sound.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nI don't...\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nBecause the wither makes this crazy sound when it gets created.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nAll right, whatever.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nI'm going to pull the lever.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nHe did try changing it to decimator.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nI just have to be really careful because...\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nBecause it'll explode.\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nOr headphones?\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\n12%.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nOh, try headphones.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nNo, it's not going to be headphones.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nWell, who cares?\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nLet's figure this out.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nThey can hear it.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nThe cheers are outweighing the noise.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\nDon't change that much.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nYeah, no, you got the noise.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nYeah, them some cows, baby.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nOh, no!\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nOh, no!\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nTesting the sound.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nYou lost the audience.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nAll right.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nOkay.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:33.000\nMercy for animals.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nThe wither's going to get created.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nIt's going to fall down.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nI'm going to go down here so you can watch it.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nIt's going to be in there.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nAnd then...\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nOh, shit, yeah, we're running out of power.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nAll right, let's do it.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nWell, I just want to tell you, though, that...\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nIt's going to...\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nIt's also...\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nThere's more down here because after the wither dies...\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nOh, shit, low battery.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:56.000\nGet my...\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nGet my power!\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nLet's get Schrab up here.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nCome on, let's...\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nLet's get Schrab up here, really.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nLet's start the show.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nImagine being on, like, the Tonight Show.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nAll right, let's...\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nHere comes Alec Baldwin.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nSit down.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nTalk about something completely different.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nAll right.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nPlay a game, ignore him.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:36.000\nI think it's time to pull that lever.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:37.000\nOkay, see it?\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nThey're creating the wither.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nOkay, now he's falling down.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.000\nGo to the wither.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nNow watch the force field.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nThe force field's there.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nIt's protecting me.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nYou should have made a lighter coat first.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nWait.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:48.000\nHe's down there.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:49.000\nHe's bleeding out.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nOh, he got mortalized.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nAnd now it's going to...\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nThe stuff he drops goes into this chest,\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nand then the chest has an import bus on it,\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nand then it goes to this computer,\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nand there it is, a delicious nether star.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nHe got a nether star!\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nWoo!\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:12.000\nOkay, and now there's another thing I wanted to share.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nNot Minecraft related.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nDan was actually really cool.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nThat was super cool.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nAt first I thought it was boring,\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:25.000\nbut it really got me after a while.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nI just really got engaged.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:34.000\nDan?\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nOkay, so if you're listening at home...\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nThis is called friendship.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nIt's a presentation.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:44.000\nIt's a

keep telling each other that we suck dicks.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nWe'll take an audible on that\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nwith our gay listeners.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nI found

01:37:41.000\nand they were like, I don't know if I see it.\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nAnd then we won because they were tired,\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nand\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nKing George was mad,\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nand so they were like,\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nfine, good luck having a country, whatever.\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nAnd then we were like, fine.\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nAnd then 1812 happened, and there was a war\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nthat no one understands with Canada or something.\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nAnd then the whole time\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nthere were slaves, the whole time we were\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000\njust going to Africa and going,\n\n01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nthese people seemed like they wouldn't know\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nwhat fair pay was,\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nand they were like, okay, let's do it.\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nAnd they were like, how much am I bid for this?\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nAnd that was kind of fucked up,\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nand I don't want to dwell on this part, but...\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nNo one ever does.\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nI got three minutes,\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nthree minutes and 20 seconds left.\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nWe're almost done.\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nI was like...\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nAnd then that one guy\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nwas a slave for 12 years,\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nand then he got freaked out.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nAnd...\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nAnd then Abraham Lincoln,\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nwho I think,\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nsome people say was\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nhalf black, but\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nthat's maybe a conspiracy theory,\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nbut he was running for president,\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nand he was like, we should free the slaves,\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nand then there was a federalist movement,\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nand then the south states were like,\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nyou shouldn't do that.\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nWe built the whole country on slavery,\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nand now you're saying you just want to use\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nthe pants we made for free\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nfor black people, and then you don't want to,\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nbut you want to read poetry in them,\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000\njust because you made a machine that can make pants now?\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nThat's not fair.\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nWe were like, we don't care, you're dumb,\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nand your teeth look dumb.\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000\nAnd let's go to war.\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nAnd then we fought,\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nand then Abraham Lincoln halfway through the war\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nwas like, by the way, the slaves are free.\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nAnd we were like, yay!\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nAnd then France was like, I'm going to do it too then,\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nbecause I hate everything.\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nAnd then that's why we won,\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000\nbecause we were the north one,\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nnot we, the federalist one,\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nand then we unified the country,\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nand then Abraham Lincoln got shot,\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nand then it was spending too long on that two-year period.\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nSo then everything was fine,\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nand we ate potatoes and corn and stuff,\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nand then we made a bunch of smokestacks,\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nand then Henry Ford was like,\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nwhat if you did pay people,\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nbut if you paid them so little,\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nthey were basically slaves anyway,\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nand you made each person do one little thing,\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nand then you bought everything.\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nBut I made the light bulb,\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nand he's like, no,\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nand then everybody was making things\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nfor a while, everybody's making stuff,\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nand then\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nbecause everybody was making things,\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nthey knew how to put gunpowder\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000\ninto smaller compartments,\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nand so everybody was like, I can't wait to use these,\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nI can't use them, because we're not in a war,\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nand everybody was like, I know, right?\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nI want to use it.\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nAnd then Archduke Ferdinand was like,\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nwhat happened?\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nI'm freezing for me, I can't wait forever.\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nEverybody was like, boom, boom, boom, boom,\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nand they're like, mustard gas,\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nshoot them in the kneecaps,\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nand it was like fucked up,\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nand all quiet in the western front,\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000\npeople were eating rats,\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nand everybody had herpes all over their face,\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nand everybody died at 35,\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nbut they wrote nice poetry,\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nand it was kind of like nice quiet people,\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nthey didn't talk about it,\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nthey did trenches everywhere, and were done,\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nand then there was peace for a while,\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nand they didn't eat shit, because you caused this,\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nand they were like, well, we're kind of sick of hearing that,\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nand then Hitler's like, Jews, am I right?\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nAnd they were like, yeah.\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nAnd then everybody was like, here we go again,\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nexcept America was like, yeah, we'll be right with you,\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000\ncash on the barrel head for bullets and oil,\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nand England was like, for real?\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nAnd we were like, yeah, you shouldn't have fucked with us\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nin the first place, should have let us go back in 1612,\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nor something, and they were like,\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nthat's fucked up weird justification,\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nbut okay, we'll just hang out in the subway while they bomb us,\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nhello, and then we were like, and
