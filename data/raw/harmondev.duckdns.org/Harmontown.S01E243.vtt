00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Make some noise for yourself, you look so goddamn good tonight.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
How do you feel?

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Welcome to the first inaugural show here, we're so fucking happy to be here.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
This session of Harmontown is now in full effect.

00:19.000 --> 00:31.000
Welcome to the stage, Spencer Crittenden.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
The mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Show him some love.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Thank you.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
I am Brandon Johnson, I will be guest comptrolling for the lovely Jeff Davis.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm nervous, I don't want to blow it, Jeff Davis.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Big jerk shoes, he wasn't here for the premiere.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
He knew this was coming for months and then he's out there fucking Ryan Styles or whatever.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I thought he was on the BET Kings of Comedy tour.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
We were going to do, I don't want to start on a sour note.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't want to start on a more sour note than starting without music.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Sorry about that, that was a little awkward.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
It was all quiet, it was like church.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
That's why we wore this outfit.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
We're going to be working out some kinks.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
And then we're going to be bringing out the kinks.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
What?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
What was it?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
Well, I know, okay, so not to start off on a sour note, but we were going to, you know, we were waiting.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
We kept waiting to play a new...

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
We kept waiting, oh yeah.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Why do that at Meltdown?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
You know, why would we do that at Meltdown?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh, I don't want to wait until the big day.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Right.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Like a week ago, Jeff was like, oh, I forgot, I got a show for a month or whatever, he's just gone.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So it's like, yeah, it's just the worst.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
And it's just, it's just, it's just, that's what Burbank's about.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
It's about sadness and...

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
We're just underneath five freeways and...

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Whose idea was it to move to this awful location?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
We could go to Ikea.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
It was my idea.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
It was my idea.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Because hopefully the live stream experience is a little more friendly.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh, great.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Thanks, Dan.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
That's what we love, the people that pay to come see the show.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
We want to make sure that the live stream is...

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
There was a guy that tweeted...

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I don't know, I don't know.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
Not that I want to, like, grease the stinky wheels, but there was a guy that tweeted in response to us tweeting out that we were going to be here.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
He said, I can't remember what his wording was.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh, man.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
It was like, oh, great.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Following the Cookie Cutter podcast track, I see...

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
What?

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Are you co-opting your animation studio's extra building for a location to shoot it out of?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
The old cookie cutter.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
The old cookie cutter path.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
In podcasting.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
What do you say?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
It was something like that.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
That guy is so grumpy.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
How do you get that grumpy?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Is he just like...

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Where do you get the impression of the cookie cutter podcast path?

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
How can a path be cookie cutter?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It sounds delicious.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
It sounds like a thing.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
All right, so I'll be calling out some notes because we have to live test the venue and stuff.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
First things first.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I don't know if this is going to work.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
This is blinding me.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
But I guess there's always going to be lights.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
The second thing is that, you know...

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Yes, there's always going to be lights.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Let's not get too cocky.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
There might not always be lights.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yay.

03:41.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, with the Santa Ana's blowing through, how about that weather, L.A.?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
What kind of podcast is this?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
How about the weather?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
What is he looking at?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
What's he looking at on his phone?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Is his agent calling?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Is he telling him, great job?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Why is he being self deprecating?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
He moved his podcast here.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Is the cookie cutter a podcaster?

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
This is weird to say, but I feel more at risk of being shot here than the last venue.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I don't know what that is.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
That's so racist.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm so sorry about that.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
You're the one that bought a gun.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
That's how racist it is.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
We have to move all the way to Burbank to find out Spencer's racist.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You just mean, yeah, just clearer shots.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's just that thinking that it's like a place of nerd dumb puts you at ease or something.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't know, but just, oh man.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah, I guess it feels more like a town hall now.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
So somebody could walk up the middle aisle and say, get your hand out of my pocket.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Now I really will be racist and ask you, do you know what that was about?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
What did that mean?

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
That is the thing that the FBI agent yelled to cause a distraction in the back of the hall when Malcolm X was speaking.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
It was actually confirmed that the guy, because I saw Malcolm X in the movie and all I saw was a guy just started yelling that out.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
It didn't say like, this is an FBI agent or anything or maybe I was mine crafting during the movie.

05:18.000 --> 05:29.000
But is that like, what? I'm continuing to be racist by going to you as if you're some kind of like Malcolm X movie expert.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
You watched it nine times. Come on. This was your ghostbusters.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Malcolm X was my uncle.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
This was your gremlins too.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
This was your ghostbusters.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
I think I probably watched it once back when it was like on a pay-per-view.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I found myself very confused by that scene.

05:52.000 --> 06:02.000
It smacked of like, oh, there must have been mass chaos and there's like accounts of people saying different stuff and that Spike Lee was just being faithful to the confusion.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Because it was just a confusing thing.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It was organized confusion.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
It was so that everyone would be diverted to the guys who were arguing and then no one would see the shooters.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
All right. But they grabbed that guy that said, get your hand down the way pocket.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Goddamn, that was February?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
All right.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
This wasn't on my list of things to talk about anyway.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I really am finding out. This election has really made me aware of how racist I am.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
I gave you some black nerd shit just in keeping.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, that's good. Thank you.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's one of those weird facts that, like, nerds, no.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
All right.

06:43.000 --> 06:53.000
I just, what the fuck is this thing? Let's do it.

06:53.000 --> 07:03.000
So for those of you just listening, oh my god.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I have to suit fool you.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
For those of you only listening and not looking, again, you can look for $5 a month.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
But also, I'm not going to turn my back on you if you're just listening.

07:16.000 --> 07:27.000
So I'll tell you, there's a plastic wrapped, a polka dot plastic wrapped six foot tall human sized gift on the stage that was brought by,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
does anyone want to identify themselves as the gift bringer?

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
You're both the gift, you're dual gift bringers.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
What are your names? Can I ask?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm Spencer.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Fuck.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Spencer and Zoe.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
This sucks.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Do you want me to just open it up here? Is that okay?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Or do you want me to open it privately?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Or do you want to help me open it?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Okay.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
There's a ribbon.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Okay.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
At the top.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
You can just undo it.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
You don't need the knife.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
All right.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
You don't need the knives, Brandon.

08:01.000 --> 08:14.000
You don't need the knife.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
There's a second.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Oh shit.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
There's a mannequin.

08:23.000 --> 08:36.000
It's got paper flowers over its privates and it's wearing a panty hose.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Brandon just cocked the chest right.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
No shoes.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
That's good.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
They know what I like.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
She's not wearing high heels because I like comfortable women.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't know if you know that about that.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
No high heels?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I love sleepy, comfortable women.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
I like Ugg boots or nice flats.

09:02.000 --> 09:11.000
And then of course, tights or stockings because women are very comfortable in those.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Now we have this.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Thank you, Zoe and Spencer.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
This is very thoughtful and probably a great deal of work.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Thanks for giving me more.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Okay.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Thank you.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Okay.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
There's a hosiery to go with it.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.400
It's dream girl brand.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.000
One size fits most, it says, at the bottom.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
All right.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Well, this is making me...

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Thank you and good night.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Thank you so much.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
You're such thoughtful people.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I got to say, we did our last show.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And so there'll be other people brought gifts to that as well.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
And one of the people brought a...

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It was like a slightly scaled down.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
It wasn't the same sizes in the Christmas story, but it was like one of those...

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
It was a replica leg lamp with the fish net on it.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
But he...

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
This is like how you know you've really found your audience.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Like after doing a show for five years, he put a little pant leg over it to not objectify

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
it in public.

10:22.000 --> 10:30.000
Like it had a little tasteful slack around it for public.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Which is, you know, because he didn't want to trigger people next to you.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
He didn't want to like brandish it around.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Like, look at me.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
This is what I think your standard should be.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
He just...

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Trigger.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
He put a little leg tarp on it.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I was going to say burka, but then I was like, no.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Then you'll get in trouble because you don't know how to use that term properly.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
You'll hurt somebody.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Has anybody watched that show?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Patriot?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
You guys watch that show on Amazon?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
That's pretty cool.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
What do you mean, do you watch it in the present tense?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
It's just a thing that just sits there on the internet.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
That's how TV is now.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
You just go...

11:03.000 --> 11:09.600
Has anybody gone and turned over that Amazon rock and like taken just whatever you want

11:09.600 --> 11:12.000
from underneath it?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It's appointment viewing.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
It's a little...

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
But it's great.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I watched like...

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I watched the whole show.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I really like it.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It's a bad podcast, but Patriot's great.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
You should go watch it.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Well, we got some stuff.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
So, all right.

11:30.000 --> 11:40.000
This is the one thing I wanted to talk about, and then I'll bring my guest up.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
I know you're going to be like...

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Some people are going to be like, oh, what's the big deal?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Or maybe there's press here.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Maybe variety came.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
I don't know.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm like, oh, what's my angle on this piece?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Dan Harmon takes streaming to the mainstream or something.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I don't know.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
But there's going to be judgment from each other.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
But I just like...

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Your boogers get like...

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
I feel like 90% of my waking hours are spent picking my nose now.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
If you've found that you get more boogers as you get older,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
and you have to...

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It's like an air filter.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
It clogs faster.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
And so it gets a little bit like, oh, you spend 10 seconds when you're 6 years old.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
You spend 10 seconds picking your nose,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
and you're like bummed out when you're done.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
And...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Why are you bummed out?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Because you're a kid and you love boogers,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
and you're like, hey...

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Oh, no, now I'm going to breathe clearly for another two days

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
until I get enough boogers to have fun with.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And then just cut to you just like...

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
You're like twice a movie.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I'm like, more?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Like...

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
This is just awful.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Is that because you're growing more hair in your nose?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Boom.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Boom.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
More hair.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Is that because your body knows that you're becoming more vulnerable to death?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And so it's just like, it's just throwing the cheapest solution at it,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
just going like, just don't let anything in.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Get off my microbiotic lawn.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Your body becomes against you at a certain age,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and it makes us look fucking ridiculous.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
It makes us the people we used to laugh at.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Yeah.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Remember when you were a kid, you were like, you were this high

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
so you could see up in the old people's noses,

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
and you were like, look at this old boogernose motherfucker trying to give me advice.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Never going to be this motherfucker.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And then today.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
Did I talk last time about that documentary,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
the Texas University shooting, the sniper guy,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
there's like a movie out.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Did I talk about that last time?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Okay.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Well, this is related.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
The boogers.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It's really cool.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I can't remember what it's called, but you should check it out.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I don't know where you can find it,

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
but again, just go flip some rocks over and Google it, whatever.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
It's just laying there.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
But it's a kind of like second by second witness account, multiple witnesses.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Everybody, survivors of this, what was it in the 70s,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
the Texas University guy went up in the clock tower,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
and he just started.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
He shot like 30-something people.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Many of them lived.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Many of them died.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
And the ones that lived, obviously, are the ones telling the story.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But they did this thing.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
They did this kind of like thing that almost made me turn it off,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
because it was like this kind of like waking life,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
what's that movie called?

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
The rotoscopy like vectory kind of thing.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
And thank you.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
Our guest, our guest is champing at the bit to get up here.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
And you figured it out who the guest is.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
And they're like, he's a guest?

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
You call him a guest now?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
It's just like when Buddy Hackett was on Carson,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
it was just like, okay, who can we get?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Okay, but...

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
You are going to pay for that.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
But the thing is, so then you realize as it goes,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
and you should keep watching it,

15:17.000 --> 15:24.000
because it just continually gets more and more enthralling

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
and heartbreaking and terrifying and interesting.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And there's heroic stories, and there's also people going.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And that's when I realized I was a coward,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
which is really just as uplifting and interesting to hear.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
But all of the people were like the age they were during the incident.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And I realized it's because we're agist.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
They hired actors, like 25-year-old actors,

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
and animated interviews so that they weren't necessarily

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
just having fake people on video.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So they kind of split the diff, I think.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
This is my assumption of why they were doing this, artistically.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
But they were doing this rotoscopy thing of younger people

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
reading the accounts of the people that have survived it.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
And then they start cutting to the people toward the end

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and revealing that those people are still alive

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
and that this was their story.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
They're all, of course, 30, 40 years older.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And it really dawns on you.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
You're like, oh, now I see why they did that,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
because we don't like old people.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
We don't believe that there are people,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I'm including myself among them at this point,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
but it was like melting people telling you,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
well, then this thing that really happened, it was real bad.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
And you're just like, yeah, that's what you rock lords always say.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
You're always referring to how life was rocky.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
Everything's made of granite and flint.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
Everyone looks like Michael Chickless in an oven.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
The ears are the same size as their head,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
and the lobes are resting like epaulets on their shoulder pads.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
And their teeth are old baseballs signed by Mickey Rooney.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Mickey Mantle.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Which means they got that when they were very young,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
and he was still a child star.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
But it was really effective, because they include the images of the old people,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
and so it really brings you to the precipice of realizing that.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
And then you're like, yeah, it seems like a dumb thing to have to remind yourself,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
but 65-year-old people were once 25,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
and they were probably pretty hot when they were,

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
and you probably, therefore, really listened to everything they said.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You're like, man, I want a soda pop!

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
And you're like, whoa, that's amazing, Brittany!

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
And then she's later just like, I want a soda pop!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And you're like, we can fuck you, yeah.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Like, piece of shit.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Get back in your whole grandma's.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You piece of un-fuckable shit!

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
You offend me!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
It's true.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
We really blame people.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
We blame, we blame, when women get pregnant,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
we look at them as like, oh, you're glowing,

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
we're like pregnant, but you can't work here, get out of here, go home!

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
No, you can't get paid while you're at home having a baby,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
you fucking gross baby-maker.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
And then as we all get older, like, you old fuck,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
you gross piece of shit.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
We worship youth, and when are you the youngest,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
when you're fucking stupid, like, we're kind of like,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
we split the difference, like, oh, I love 25-year-olds,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
but really, you know, you can tell from our culture,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
but I really like a nice 19-year-old.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Oh, shit.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
You know.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
It's like, you don't know nothing when you're that age,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
and so those people have all the capitalistic power.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
We're like, what do you think?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
What do you think about the weather today?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Oh, it was brand new.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
He's right, he's right, it's never happened this weather.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
We used to have that respect for old people

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
when we were cavemen, because they looked at melty people,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and they'd be like, dude, it's melting.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Like, do you know how many saber-toothed tigers

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
he hasn't been bitten by?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah, but you know, old people kind of got mean

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
and sent us off to war, so it changed the shit, maybe.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Because when I see an old person, I'm like,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
you fucking did acid and fucked up the country for us.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
That's the generation.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, there was the silent generation,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
the greatest generation of the baby boomers.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Right.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Beetles and fake butter and AIDS.

19:30.000 --> 19:41.000
That was our reference to the community

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and the community Christmas episode,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
where they'd say, and I believe one of those things,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Donald Glover helped out with that.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
He came up with fake butter and AIDS, I think.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
Donald was, he was really going places back then.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
It's a shame to see these kids waste their future, you know.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I wish she would have stayed after that.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Just fell in the wrong crowd.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
A bunch of rappers.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I told them, I told them,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
is it Donald that we're going to regret this

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
not moving to Yahoo with us?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Where are you going?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
To rap.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Ha!

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
To rap.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Atlanta.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Who's ever heard of the place?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Go ahead, make your silly show.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Ha ha ha, Donald Glover.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I'll see you again, my friend.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Kicking on my door in the rain.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Please, one more season, sir.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
Can we do it for Alta Vista?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
Does crack, does crack to have a discretionary fund?

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
We could shoot it in your apartment.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
Ha, I don't know, Donald, I'll think about it.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
What am I looking at?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm not looking at anything.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm trying to find my notes and I'm a little nervous

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
because it's my, let's try out some of the technology.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Spencer, tell people, oh, let's bring up Rob Schwab.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Rob Schwab, ladies and gentlemen, Rob Schwab.

21:19.000 --> 21:26.000
She's got a backpack on.

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
Careful, careful.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
Oh, no.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
Oh, my God.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Why is there a mirror under her?

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
It's like a mirror under her.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
He's wearing a backpack.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Will you talk to people for a second?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
What are you going to do?

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
The backpacks are the only way we could power the show.

22:08.000 --> 22:15.000
You want me to talk to people while you go backstage for a second?

22:15.000 --> 22:30.000
No, I was just going to...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Oh, for people listening, we have to,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
something we can't, we tried to clear the mannequin

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
and I ended up fondling the legs and I...

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
That's it, that's it.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
It's good to be here.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
How are you?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
I'm nervous, I'm happy to be here.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
How was your week?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
What?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I'm not doing good, guys.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
You got a case of the Ds.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I got the Ds, man.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
I don't know, this writer strike is scaring me.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I mean, we were talking about it backstage.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
That's going to suck, man, but it can't work.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
You've got to do it to stay solid.

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
This setup, it's such a big stage, but it's just full of stuff.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
We're going to figure it out.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay, good.

23:26.000 --> 23:35.000
Thank God you brought the really comfortable chairs.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Alright, so we're going to do this in real time.

23:37.000 --> 23:47.000
So somebody tell me, how do I hook my thing up to the thing?

23:47.000 --> 23:54.000
Can you use a deeper voice?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I'll shut you right up.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Okay, now I've got to tell you about an hour before the show

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
are dimmer blue, so we can't dim the lights,

24:05.000 --> 24:14.000
which might make it hard to view a projection.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
How is dimmer?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Alright, so this is...

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
We're going to try it.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
We're just trying it.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Alright.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Oh, yeah.

24:30.000 --> 24:37.000
Oh, shit.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
This isn't the writer's room.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Come on.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
This is my Minecraft world.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I'm playing a Skyblock mod pack.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Now, if you're listening to the free version of the podcast,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
again, $5 a month, but also...

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You know, I'm not going to...

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I just want to try out some of the visual stuff.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Get the gold!

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Get the fucking gold!

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm going to use my jet pack, so I want to show you guys one thing.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Get the fucking gold!

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Now, it was just nighttime, and now it's daytime.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Can you explain what happened?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I right clicked on the bed, and the sun came out.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Great.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Alright, Spencer, look at my wither farm.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Oh, yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You were talking to Cody about this on Instagram.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh, that's right, yeah.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
Okay, so these are refined storage constructors.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
And then over here is a refined storage system,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and I have soul sand in there.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
So soul sand is going to...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
What happened?

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
I just feel my life just draining away.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
That's the soul sand.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And then these are placers,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
and they have little tiny wither skeleton skulls in them.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
You know what?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
This is too cool for you guys.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
So those things make a wither?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Those things make a wither.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
If you play Minecraft,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
then you know that when you get soul sand...

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
They love withers.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Don't encourage a T-formation.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
If you stack up soul sand in this T-formation,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and then you place wither skeleton skulls on top,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
it creates a wither,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
which is the most dangerous creature in all of Minecraftia.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And it's called a wither.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And these are placers, so I can do it remotely.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The wither skeleton skulls are in here.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
This is all wither-proof obsidian block.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Wither-proof.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Make it do.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
So then over here,

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I have a switch.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
It's a 10-second self-resetting lever.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
It goes down to conduit here.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Do you want to explain the redstone logic

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
that controls this self?

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Just think of redstone as like electricity.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
So this is redstone conduit,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
so this lever is going to activate,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
is going to send energy down these things,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
and it's going to split to the left and the right.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
On the left, it's going to go over here

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
and up to these placement things

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
that's going to place wither skeleton skulls

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
on top of the soul sand.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And then on the right,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
this is going to make a force field

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
over the top of this,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
but it has to do it after the wither gets created

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
and falls down below the force field level.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So I used a mod called...

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Of course.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Super...

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Does anybody have another mannequin?

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Did they want to bring up it?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
This is a small circuit I made.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
There's a mod where you can make your own circuits

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
and you can get really elaborate,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
but all this does is it sets a little tiny delay in there,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
like a five-second delay.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Tiny delay.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So, with one lever pull,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
what you're going to see happen,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
I don't know if we have...

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Wait, wait, wait.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Everyone in the audience,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
we got to say pull that lever.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Okay.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Okay, on three.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Well, wait, wait, wait.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
If you want sound,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
you got to change the source in your audio.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Don't listen to them.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I'm just so worried that

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
anything in this laptop is going to...

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Okay.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Do we have money for this?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Decimator?

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Do we have enough time in the show?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
The thing is,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
it's hard to know what sounds like what.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I don't hear any sounds.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
These guys would be buying and moving.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
These are my animals.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
That's a cow.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
And even clucking, if I understand.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
That's a chicken.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
This stuff's, you know,

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I don't probably...

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
This may be for another day.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
These are generating cobble and flint and sand

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
and they're each going through all the things

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
and then they pass it off to the next thing

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
and then, you know, there's just a lot of...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
You get iron and stuff.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
You guys don't care.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
I got a pull the lever.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Okay.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
All right.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So here's...

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Not yet!

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
What have I done?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Because you have to know what to look for.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Because it doesn't look like much.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
There's going to be a wither.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I have to tell you what's happening

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
so that you can be impressed.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But really, there's no...

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
There's no sound.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I don't...

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Because the wither makes this crazy sound when it gets created.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
All right, whatever.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I'm going to pull the lever.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
He did try changing it to decimator.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I just have to be really careful because...

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Because it'll explode.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Or headphones?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
12%.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Oh, try headphones.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
No, it's not going to be headphones.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Well, who cares?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Let's figure this out.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
They can hear it.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
The cheers are outweighing the noise.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Don't change that much.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Yeah, no, you got the noise.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah, them some cows, baby.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Oh, no!

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Oh, no!

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Testing the sound.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
You lost the audience.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
All right.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Okay.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Mercy for animals.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
The wither's going to get created.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
It's going to fall down.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I'm going to go down here so you can watch it.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
It's going to be in there.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And then...

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Oh, shit, yeah, we're running out of power.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
All right, let's do it.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Well, I just want to tell you, though, that...

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It's going to...

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
It's also...

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
There's more down here because after the wither dies...

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Oh, shit, low battery.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Get my...

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Get my power!

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Let's get Schrab up here.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Come on, let's...

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Let's get Schrab up here, really.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Let's start the show.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Imagine being on, like, the Tonight Show.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
All right, let's...

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Here comes Alec Baldwin.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Sit down.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Talk about something completely different.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
All right.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Play a game, ignore him.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
I think it's time to pull that lever.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Okay, see it?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
They're creating the wither.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Okay, now he's falling down.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Go to the wither.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Now watch the force field.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
The force field's there.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
It's protecting me.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
You should have made a lighter coat first.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Wait.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
He's down there.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
He's bleeding out.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Oh, he got mortalized.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
And now it's going to...

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
The stuff he drops goes into this chest,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
and then the chest has an import bus on it,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and then it goes to this computer,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and there it is, a delicious nether star.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
He got a nether star!

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Woo!

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Okay, and now there's another thing I wanted to share.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Not Minecraft related.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Dan was actually really cool.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
That was super cool.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
At first I thought it was boring,

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
but it really got me after a while.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I just really got engaged.

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
Dan?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay, so if you're listening at home...

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
This is called friendship.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
It's a presentation.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
It's a powerpoint.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
I just want to make sure...

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
If you're listening at home and you're like,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
oh, so the podcast is always going to be so visual,

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
now I'm never going to listen.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
First of all, here's the smallest violin

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
for your lack of money.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You would be able to see it

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
if you paid $5.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
But that's not why I'm doing it.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm not trying to blackmail you into...

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I like that you cut your carrots

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
and are poor and want to listen to something.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I like being in your ears.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I got to cut them carrots.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Schrab, you going to feel bad for all the stuff?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
You said when you see this video.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah, so Schrab, look,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
I know I've tried to whip together

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
a powerpoint up in the green room,

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
and I took pictures of you,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
because I wanted to do a quick powerpoint.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
Friends are friendly.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The R is for really friendly, whatever.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I bailed on that.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
It's a chart that's a number of letters and friends.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
So I gave up.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Here's Schrab, my best friend.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
Here's a picture I took of him with his mouth open.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And then...

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
This is the end of my slideshow,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
because the key to friendship

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
is understanding.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Schrab, do you remember the thing

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
that you made for me?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
I said this to...

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I said this to Neil to...

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's like, hey, do you need a title sequence

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
for the Harmontown documentary?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I think I got it covered.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Here's what he sent me.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
I thought that would have worked.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
All right, I think I'm going to...

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
That'll be it.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
That's enough visuals for tonight.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
It sounded like the action news soundtrack.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
All right, all right.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
So, well...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I feel so exposed.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
All right, so now we have like

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
an hour and a half more to fill.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I feel so exposed.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Schrab, who's playing?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Schrab.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Schrab.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I feel so exposed.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Schrab, who's backpack is that?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Huh?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
That's not your backpack, is it?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
My backpack, I'm going to third hour.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Oh.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
You came up with a backpack just to...

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
You thought that would be enough to just make fun of me

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
for wearing my backpack up on stage.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It seemed to work.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I don't know if anybody...

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
You're talking about it.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't even like to...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
We'll figure out what we're doing up here.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Let me take a look at my notes.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Okay.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I really thought I'd be able to air play stuff

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
for my phone and show you pictures of my dogs.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
That's what I keep saying, is like...

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The dream.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
That's the big dream, pictures of my dogs.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
But we'll just do a regular show.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Because what we've got right now is the HDMI plug

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
and we've enjoyed the hell out of that.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Brandon, do you don't sit down

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
when you control?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I never know what's going to happen.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I might have to run out of here.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Um...

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Burbank.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Brandon, I didn't understand

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
the ending of the...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
All right.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
While you do that, I'm going to turn my chair around.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Wait, where is that?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Are you sick cool?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I keep finding...

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
So cool, sick cool.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
All right. Okay.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
All right. So these are the only things

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I have to talk about tonight.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
The idea of getting

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
naked because you're so high.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Yeah.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Like, you always hear stories about that?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Like, somebody gets...

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
They smoke so much crack

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
or they do so much acid that they...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
They take off...

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Rob's going to die.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
They take off all their clothes

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
and, like, what...

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Like, if you...

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I can understand trying that,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
but, like, if it didn't work,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
wouldn't you put your clothes back on right away?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I think, eventually, they do.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah. All right. Moving on.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Are you...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Are you worried about what you're going to do

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
when you get to that moment of being high?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Yeah, I don't... Well, I just don't think

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I would ever get so high that I would take off all my clothes.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Well, let me...

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
The second time I got high,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I showed my friend my dick.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Let us all settle in for this.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
It was the second time I got high

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
and we were in my friend's car

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
and I showed him my dick.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Did he... Was he asking?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
No.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Was it... Was it, like, the beginning

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
of the Twilight Zone movie

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
where Dan Akraed goes,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
hey, you want to see something really scary?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
And you turn around

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and you pull out your dick and it's all blue

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
with white hair.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Did it say, thanks for getting me high

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
and Sharpie on it or something?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And there was, like, a comedy

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
whistle noise.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Was there something wrong?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Like, were you asking for advice?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
No, no, I was giving him advice in a way.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Like, what to do with your dick?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Yeah.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Show it.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Yeah, check this out.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Was it... Was it...

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
erect? No, no.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
That was why it was funny, probably.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I don't want to analyze myself in that moment.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's a different punchline.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
If you show your friend a hard dick.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
The first time you got high

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
did you think, I'm going to...

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I can't do it yet, but I'm going to do it.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
The first time I got high, I whipped

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
down my dick and then I was like,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
no, no, not yet, and I put it away.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
And I didn't tell anybody.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Sharp, why don't you...

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I'm not showing you my dick.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
You be Spencer's friend

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and I'll be Spencer.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
You're driving.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
You know, it's just like, you know,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
my mom and dad don't understand

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
what I'm trying to say with my life.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Oh, yeah.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You know what?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I mean, that's why I hang out with you

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
and what I'm trying to do.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Oh, yeah, I got all the...

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Man, I got so much understanding.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It's crazy.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Hey, uh...

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
You mind if...

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Sorry, left or right here?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Turn left, but then...

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Okay.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I've got some advice for you.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Bring it on, bro.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Zip.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
And...

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Spencer.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Your dick is beautiful.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Let's take it easy.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Do you know why I pulled you over?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Oh, God.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Keep your hands up.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
We don't want to get shot.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Why?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
It's a flashing zone.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I don't know, I don't know.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Take a look at his cock.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
It's gorgeous.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Insane.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I wasn't sure if we should end it.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Thank you, thank you.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
There's a...

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
But there's a post-credits sequence.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
There's a blooper reel.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Sam Jackson is back in Spencer's kitchen.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Oh, so you showed your dick, huh?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
We'll get ready for a wild ride next summer.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
That's the last movie I ever saw in a theater.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
The Iron Man.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
The Iron Man.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Millennials.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
It was called The Iron Man.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I liked The Iron Man.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I'll take two for

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
the Iron Man.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I'm still working on some kinks in my home automation system.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
One of my dreams

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
is to have a nice little house

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
and be able to control...

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
the speakers and stuff in every room

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and blah, blah, blah.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
So there's multiple audio sources.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
One of the audio sources is an iPod.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
In case the Internet goes out, it's got a little iPod

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
that's full of music.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
There's a laptop, and it's like,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
you know, all that Apple crap.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Everything syncs together.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
So the iPod, and I've been meaning to fix this,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
but the iPod just has all my voice memos on it.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Which I record all my therapy sessions.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Fuck.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Not a good idea.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
That sounds bad.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And so I just looked today

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
because I was like trying to play

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
the sneakers soundtrack,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
which Danny Jelladette gave me as a gift.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Because you can't get it online.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
There's no sneakers soundtrack on Spotify.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
It's a good soundtrack.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Remember, you gave me the CD in the 90s

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
in Milwaukee, and I lost it.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Wyndon Marcellus.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Brandon?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Brantford?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Brantford?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Brandon?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Was it Marcellus?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Marcellus Wallace.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
So I'm listening.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I'm like, oh, can I play this?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
There's no CD player anymore.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
It's a Blu-ray player, and then I'm like

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
looking at the different menus and things.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It's like, oh, I'm going to play this

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
sneakers soundtrack everywhere.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
And then I see, and you know how

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
would you find out your zipper's been open?

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
But you said you have no idea how it could have been days

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
that your zipper was...

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
If you wore your pants that long, yeah.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It's like, I look and I see lit up.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
It's like, the back patio

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
is playing my iPod.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Oh, no.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Is it playing your therapy out to your neighbors?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
And like, you know,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
and like, drunken fights

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I'd have with my ex-wife, you know?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Like where we'd go.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
You would go to your therapist drunk

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
and record it? No, no, no.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I record all my therapy sessions.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I'm just listing the other and bear it.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
There's a lot of like community ADR.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
It's like me going like,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
cool, cool, cool.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
You know, like doing multiple takes

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
of like, like, like dings or Rick and Morty lines

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
or something that like, I'm handing to an editor

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
to like, scratch in.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
And then interspersed with that, it's like,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
eight-minute sound files that are like...

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I'm not yelling at you!

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Yes, you are! You're always yelling!

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Ah!

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I'm recording, you know!

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Go ahead, I'm recording you!

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Oh, no.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Wow.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Oh, my God.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I'm hanging in my backpack.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
But I don't really know.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And you're like, I'm going to record this

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
because it's going to make me look like a real hero.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah, no, I don't.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Because we're both drunk.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
We're both, you know, like...

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Oh!

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Let me get out my phone!

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Well, that's something a drunk person does.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Memo?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
If you're drunk and you're in a fight with another drunk person,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
like you're both thinking like you're like,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
totally stone cold sober and like,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
you're yourself right now.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I'm going to Hasselhoff's daughter you so hard.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Yeah.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
And then you get up the next morning

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and you're like, okay!

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Let's listen to it together.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Let's listen to it.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Let's just listen to it.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
No, no, no.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Do your neighbors treat you differently?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Has any shit gone down?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Oh, you were like, what if you woke up the next morning?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Oh, no, I don't...

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
How long it was playing?

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I don't know if it played anything specific.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I didn't hear anything blaring for the speakers.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And I think our neighbors are full of shit!

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Yeah.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Those neighbors over there

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
with their trees

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
growing shade on my lawn

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
causing the sun

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
to not grow my grass.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
All right, let's do a segment.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
My neighbors...

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I keep thinking we're going to be cutting to

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
like some puppet show over here

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
with this...

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Lady Elaine's going to come out of the attic

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and go, hello, Dan!

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Let's do a segment.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Get a sound cue ready.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
We'll do a segment.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
This is an old classic.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Things that Dan has to complain about

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
that he can't really complain about

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
without sounding like a dick.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And he said...

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
When you're 44

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
and you have money

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
your problems are different

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
than when you were 20

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
until

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
when you are also an attention

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
or it's hard to complain

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
about the stuff that makes you mad

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
because all the people listening

45:18.000 --> 45:30.000
are poor and sad.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I really got my finger in the pulse.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Okay, so here's the thing.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I'm sick and tired

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
of doing these...

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
these...

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
these...

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Cosby Impressions!

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I'm sick.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I'm not doing any more

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
interview requests for publications

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
that are part of a roundup where they're like,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
yeah, everybody sound in

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
about your favorite genre.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I never get chosen.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I spend hours on my quotes

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and email them in and they never use me.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
They're just using me to like

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
get Joss Whedon to say he'll do it.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Are you the gateway to Joss Whedon?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
No, I'm not the... Yeah, that's why I paused in my throat.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I just mean like,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
they're using me to maybe he'll go like,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
oh, gross, I'll do that.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I don't know why he would do that.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Are you telling me you're waiting to talk on topics

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
and these people have not reached out?

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Wait, no, I'm saying like...

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I lost you.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I'm just saying like,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
that's because it's an unrelatable thing

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
that only I can complain about.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
When your publicist calls you

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
and says like, oh...

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
You know when your publicist calls you

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
and your publicist calls...

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Hey Dan, this is your publicist.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Hey, do you want to do this thing?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Joss Whedon is going to do it.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Will you do it?

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Yeah, it's...

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
What do you like?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
The self-deprecation buttress?

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Yes.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Your yes-and-ing self-deprecation?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
This is me, I'm the self-deprecation buttress.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Hey, Joss Whedon won't do this.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Will you do this?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Will you do this?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Will you be on the $10,000 pyramid

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
with, uh,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
SuperSales

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
and Peewee Harmon?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Will you get on Peewee Harmon

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
with SuperSales?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Hey Dan Harmon, I'm your publicist.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Oh! Oh, I'm...

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I'm going through a tunnel.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I'm going through a tunnel.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm sorry, Dan. I'm sorry, Dan.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You're breaking up, Dan. I'm your publicist.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm going through a tunnel.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I'm going through a tunnel.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Hey, did you get that?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Did you get that email?

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
You never ruled me back.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Anyway, Joss Whedon won't do this.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Will you do it?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Joss Whedon won't do it.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
You know who else won't do it?

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
A lot of other people.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Hey, Chris Pratt won't call me anymore.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
He won't call me anymore.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
He doesn't call me.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Chris Pratt won't call you anymore?

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Chris Pratt does not call me anymore.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
He does not call me anymore.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
He does not like my Instagram pictures.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Why are you...

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
You're a publicist. Why do you have an Instagram at all?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I mean, except for your personal life.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Why do you want Chris Pratt to...

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I have a personal life and I want to Instagram it.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And I have that right.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And I'm going through a tunnel right now.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
You see, you're...

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It would just...

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Be nicer to my...

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
If you want to be famous,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
why did you become a publicist?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Why would you apparently live in a tunnel?

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
That's...

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
That's where all the food is.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I'm hungry. I'm starving.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
You could...

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
A publicist is supposed to...

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Don't open your laptop.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I am, because I want to...

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I just want to...

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Because you're being a dick and I want to show...

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I am not a...

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Just wait. Don't broadcast anything yet,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
because I'm so scared that my laptop's going to have...

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It's more for other people than for me.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
You don't have to bring on this laptop.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Just don't...

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
You're not broadcasting anything, right? Okay.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Alright, just let me find something...

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
You're not broadcasting anything.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Well, whatever.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
You don't have to make me feel like a piece of shit.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
So Rob...

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Rob, you were going through a tunnel.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I'm going through a tunnel.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Thank you.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
It's a long tunnel.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
There's no light at the end of it.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You...

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
You just have the two clients or...

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I have two clients.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
One is my Instagram account.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
What do you mean?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Create...

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
It has to be created.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
You can't just...

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
What do you mean?

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Now's the time to figure it out.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Just take a second.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Just take a second.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
Holy shit.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Wow, that fast and furious movie

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
is really lighting up the box office mojo.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Fate and the Furious.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
More like Great Date and the Furious.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
You're right.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
That's a good first date, Fate of the Furious.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Hey. Hey.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Sasha, would you like to go on Fate

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and the Furious with me?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It's our first date.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Oh, hide sidebar. There we go.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Hide sidebar.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
OK.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Spencer, you're Sasha.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Oh, sure.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
All right.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
We're standing in line to see the fate of the Furious.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Hey, hey, would you like some...

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I lost it again.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Popcorn?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Sure, and I'll have a soda as well.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
We'll have a popcorn and soda, please.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Welcome to AMC.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
OK, we're not even in yet.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
All right.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
But I'll remember your request.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Sir, welcome to AMC.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Sir and ma'am.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Let's hear it now.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Ma'am, I can't look your date in the eye, sir.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Please don't.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Welcome to AMC.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
We say that in every part of the interaction.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Sasha, you're beautiful.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
You're so beautiful.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Thank you for going out on a date. I'm desperate.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
All right, you can bring out...

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I'm just going to show some photos for those of you listening.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
We'll come back to Sasha and Schrab

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
on a date seeing Fate of the Furious

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
after these messages.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
It's a gun store.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
That's a photo of me buying my gun.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
There's my gun.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Oh, no!

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I'm trying to kill something.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I still haven't picked it up.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
America!

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Oh, it's better that you haven't picked it up yet.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Crossing America!

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Pacific Dining Car in Burbank

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
has yellow mustard.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
They put it on the table.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I told you I should have picked it up.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Okay, so that's...

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
That's how I was trying to make

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
my Mass Effect character.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I got the gray afro.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
This is the best I could do.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Can we get more light here?

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Like right here, is there a spotlight

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
that we could put on the screen?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
No, that's the opposite.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
That's my Mass Effect character.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Okay, there's nights on.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
That's the picture I took

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
when I was really high at an Easter barbecue.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
And I...

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I was like, look at the leaves.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Kind of looks like Abraham Lincoln.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
There's me in a beard and a suit

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and there's the dogs.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I had to watch this while jerking off.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
This is a guy testing my intercom system

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
and he was down there all day.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
That's right next to my bed

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and so I was jerking off.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Sophia Cleans, you were jerking off to Sophia Cleans?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
This is Ken Seely,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
my favorite interventionist on intervention.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
He looks like...

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
There's a little Jim Carrey.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
There's a little Jim Carrey in there.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Don't get me wrong, I love my Candy Finnegan

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
and my James Van Vondren.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
If only for his last name.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Van Vondren, come on.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
That guy must have smoked a lot of crack.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
He lost his last name.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
This is another thing.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I was high again at a restaurant

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
and I was like, look at that beautiful chandelier.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
The pictures never really work.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Look at this.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Look at these phone booths.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Look at all the wires in there.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
How many things do you need for a phone?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Look at this thing.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I used to feel bad for phones.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I used to feel bad for phones too.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
But then I woke up.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
There's Seth Green at a signing

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
and this guy looks like Seth Green in disguise

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
so I took a picture.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I was so...

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
He looks a little like meth green.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
There's people that asked me to draw stuff for Rick and Morty

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
so this is Morty sucking capitalism as a dick.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
By the way,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
if you're gay and you love to filate

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
or whatever, it doesn't...

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Or a woman.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
They've got enough problems.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I'm just...

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I don't know, the whole dick-sucking thing

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I just want to specify.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I want to put an asterisk on that.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It's really underrated.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I hope it's not a homophobic sentiment

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
when we keep telling each other that we suck dicks.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
We'll take an audible on that

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
with our gay listeners.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I found out

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
the ultimate drug to take

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
at a signing is MDMA.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I took this little tiny hit

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
that Duncan Trussell gave me

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
and then we went to this signing.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I'm sorry if you were there with your family

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
and you had me sign a thing. I was rolling.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
He licked my face.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
The kids call Molly or whatever.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Sorry, but it was...

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Why is that the ultimate drug? Why?

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I usually take a little Adderall

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
to get through a signing.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
It just makes me talk about myself a lot.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Right now, I'm on Adderall and vodka

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
and I'm going, look at me.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
You're kind of abusive.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
But MDMA

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
it's a perfect blend

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
because people are like, oh, I came from Phoenix

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
and you're like, wow, how is Phoenix?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Yeah.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
And it's just enough.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
You're not like, give me your phone number.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
It's just like, oh, Phoenix is cool.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And it's like, it is the truth

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
and how you feel.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
It's just hard to get to that place

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
in such a strenuous environment.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I read something online that Duncan Trussell

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
went off on a heckler

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
or something. Did you hear about this or whatever?

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
He was doing a show here at Andy Dick came.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Is that what you're talking about?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I don't know. Maybe this is old news.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Anyway, go back.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Speederscout.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Let's talk about more ecstasy.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
You were on ecstasy

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
when you were talking to people?

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Well, don't make it sound like that.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I was on ecstasy when I was signing

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
action figures.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Oh, yeah, look at this. I got one of these fucking things.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Stupid virus or something.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Oh, the system scan.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
But then they took me in the back

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
and look, this guy made it.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
He bought some kind of garbage speederscout.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It's not interesting.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Let's close the laptop.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
What was the...

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Man, the reason I opened it up

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
was because I thought I had an album

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
full of the mean shit that you text to me.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I don't text me.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah, but...

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Then I open the slack and then it's like

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
there's shit all over the place. There's the whole slates on there.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
What do you mean?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
You're making a Puff the Dragon movie?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I'm going to tell Holly Wookie.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Puff the Dragon out this fall.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
All right, let's get down to business.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
You're doing great.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
We've cooled off the crowd.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
All right, so...

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
How's it going, Schrab?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
You were taking voice classes before?

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I stopped for a bit

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
because I'm busy working on a rewrite

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
right now of a script I'm working on.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Okay, was your voice getting lower?

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Um...

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Yeah.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
When do you break out the lower voice?

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Like, what if you see somebody...

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
This is the lower voice.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
You should hear it when it's not low.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
If you see somebody from your past,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
are you going to pick your old voice

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
or your new voice?

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Like my mom?

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Why would you see her?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Why would I see her?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Ever again?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Holidays and stuff?

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I'll probably revert back

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
to my regular voice

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
that's talking through my nose and stuff.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Let's change the subject.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
What do you think of this one?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
What do you think of this?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
All of a sudden I'm listening to you.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Do I command your attention?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
He didn't even need a coach

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
for any of this.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
He's just changing his voice all around.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I would like to do business with you.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
All right.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I would like to give you business tips

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and strategies.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Give me the top five business tips.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Tip number five for a direct

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
and communicative business strategy.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Close

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
before you open.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Too many closers claim

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
all right, it's 9-11.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
It's a great tradition.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Yeah.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Close before you open.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Number four.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
Always be closing.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
I'm hearing

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
closing.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Like close.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Number three, listen carefully.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Number two, listening is for closers.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Number one, business tip

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
for a communicative business strategy

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
for success in the marketplace

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
in the modern era.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Open your ears

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
before you close.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
You're listening.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
This is great, great

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
vocal coach advice.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
But now it's me.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
This is what I sounded like before.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I have terrible business advice.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Oh my god.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
I'm going to do the opposite of what you say.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
So the top five

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
bad choices

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
in business.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
These are the top five.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
The bottom five

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
business strategies

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
for direct communicative business

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
environments.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Number five.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Reverse the order of your lists.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Start with

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
number one.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
And make

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
that the worst one.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Descendant.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Number four.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Clarify.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
For instance

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
you make

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
your points

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
come to

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the...

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It's like baby's fucking.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It's like baby's fucking.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It's like baby's fucking.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I like to watch babies cook.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I had a girlfriend

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
that wanted to

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
put clothes pins on her

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
nipples, but we never did it.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Ah.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Gross.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
How do you pass up that opportunity?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
They were her nipples, so

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
for me it would have been doing laundry.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It wasn't

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
like, oh, I've always wanted to...

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I'd want her to be happy, but I just...

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Where do you get clothes pins?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I had a girlfriend

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
that had a tooth and her pussy.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Oh, no.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It was like a bone ridge, right?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Elaborate.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Don't use such a fancy word

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
for such a dirty moment.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Elaborate on this vaginal

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
tooth.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
It was like a...

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Yeah, I feel like a...

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Yeah. Well, it was like

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
either like a tooth

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
or like a...

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I would sometimes describe it as like...

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
a cat

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
finger.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Cats don't have fingers.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'm telling you what it felt like.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And you only have the things

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
your dick has touched as a metric.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Lots of...

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
It was like a...

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It was like a child's bonnet.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I didn't say that. Don't do that.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Don't do that. Don't do that.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
See, I'm in the back of a child's bonnet.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
A bonnet.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Like, child's...

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Where's a bonnet?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Sorry. Okay.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Okay. Come on. Let's...

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Are you guys watching the

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Handmaid's Tale?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
No.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I saw the original movie.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Oh, there was a... I didn't know there was another

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
adaptation of it. Robert DeVall back in

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
like, I want to say the 80s, late 80s.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I want those Handmaids!

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
That's my Robert DeVall impression.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
You got to bring me those Handmaids.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
You better bring me those Handmaids!

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I just caught... This is... I just caught

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Big Little Lies.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Many Big Little Lies ladies out there.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I watched the first one of those

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and then I was like, I always give up

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
too quick on things. Like, I watched the first

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
of the first season of Fargo and then I was

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
like, it's too much like Fargo.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And then everyone's like...

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I wanted something different from the

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Fargo television series.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It was too much like

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Fargo, the movie!

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I mean, come on!

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Then I watched the first Big Little Lies

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and I was like, I...

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I like all the people that are in it

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
and I liked... I was interested in all the stories,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
but I just couldn't...

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
There's a penniness in me that's like...

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I was like, when they kept cutting to the people

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and like, she was stone cold,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
you know what I mean? And I was like,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
stop doing that. I don't like that.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I feel like creatively bullied by that.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Like, I feel like... I feel like

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
stop elbowing me. Like, so hard.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Like, just like fucking...

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
like, cup me.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
What...

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
What...

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
What do you mean, cup you?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I just sort of like, cup your balls.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Like, support. Like, be there for the parts

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
of me that would otherwise sag

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
and like...

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But don't like be like, huh?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Think about it. Like, no, you think about it.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
You made a TV show.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Why do you even think about it?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Your elbow, you're hurting my ribs.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I just want to watch the show.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
You don't think Nicole Kidman can carry a story

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
in a straight narrative?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Like, she's...

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
But I know, it's the petty part of me.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I will say, Patriot,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
it's turned me around now

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
and I'm surprised.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
There's no voice over in it, but

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I get it. I'm an old fogey.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Like, if my craft is like Gilligan's Island

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
or Knight Rider and like, it doesn't...

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
It's modular and it's like,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
it's from an old world and...

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Next week we have Rob Corddry.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
He's good.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
He's good.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
He's a good...

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
He's a good guest.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
He's a good version of a guest.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
He's a good Rob.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Too easy.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
How's your butt hole?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You...

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
You...

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
My butt hole? How is my butt hole?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yeah, you're offended.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
How dare I mention your butt hole?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
You've shared with us that you

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
obsess about your butt hole.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
You've burnt it with a...

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Is that true?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Okay, yeah. My butt hole is fine.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
My butt hole is...

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
How did you burn your butt hole?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You haven't heard this story.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
It's on the list.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
No, I...

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Dan, do you want to help me out here?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Schrab when he was a kid.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
No. No.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
You don't even know what I'm going to say.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Okay, fine.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
When he was a kid,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I'm saying if I wrote the biopic about this...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Okay, okay, fade up, fade up.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Hold open before the titles.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Schrab when he was a kid,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
he used to not wipe his butt very much or something.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Now, I will say either did I,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
but I didn't go to this path.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Like, he...

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And then when we were in our 20s,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I guess in the little comedy sports locker room,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
someone looked at Schrab's underwear

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and was like, what the fuck?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Don't you ever wipe your ass?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I was like, oh, wait,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I always used to say I felt like my butt was itchy

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
and my...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Your mom wouldn't say, then wipe your ass more.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Somehow you blamed your mom, but...

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So in your 20s,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
you started to...

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Overcompensating.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
You started going like, oh, you're supposed to keep your butt clean

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and you kind of became like very embarrassed

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
and fastidious about your butt

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and it became like kind of a fixation.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And so you started like

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
very fastidiously cleaning your butt,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
taking a lot of showers every day.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And then you had a girlfriend that was supportive of that.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
She got you a special shower head

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
that you could reach down there.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
My wife.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But she would...

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
She became my wife.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
She worked at Bed Bath and Beyond.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Not really.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Kind of related.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
She bought me like a shower snake.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Yeah.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
After taking a shit,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I would have to take a shower and clean out my butt.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And then you started doing it with more and more hot water.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Because that's what I was taught.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
How you get dishes clean.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Yeah, exactly. And it's not untrue.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's not...

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The hotter the temperature...

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
The tighter the sweater...

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
The boys depend on us.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Right.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So then you scalded your butt hole.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
A little bit and most of my balls

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and upper thigh region.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And then you went to the doctor.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And then the doctor said,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Holy shit, what did you do to yourself?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Good God, are we third?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And I don't know why I'm doing this.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
But is it third degree? How burned?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Are we burned, burned? It was probably third degree.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Good God!

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
No, it was third degree.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I don't know what third degree is.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Third degree means Freddy Krueger.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Well, I mean, it wasn't third degree.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But it was enough that

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
the doctor went,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
What did you do to yourself?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
We were watching this...

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
We did a marathon

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
of the old Freddy Krueger show.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
There was a show on in the 90s when

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Nightmare on Elm Street 4 was out.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
There was like the peak of Freddy Fever.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Like Freddy had like a breakfast cereal.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
He was hosting Friday night videos and whatever.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And there was this show

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
called...

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
It's an anthology show.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
It was like an anthology called

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
A Nightmare on Elm Street series.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
No, no, no.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
A Nightmare on Elm Street

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
colon

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
the series.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So there was like two colons in this show.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It was like a joke.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Freddy's Nightmares colon.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
A Nightmare on Elm Street

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
colon the series.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
We decided it must have been

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
a rights thing.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
This wouldn't be a surprising thing

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
if there was people who had

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the rights to Freddy the character

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
and then people who had the rights to Elm Street

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
or something.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Because that's what would happen with it

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
if any of you are old enough and none of you are.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
That Friday the 13th had

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
an anthology series that didn't have

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Jason Voorhees in it.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It was like a shop

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
of cursed objects.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Because

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
somebody owns Friday the 13th

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and another

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
group owns Jason.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Which by the way, Friday the 13th

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
the series with that cursed antique shop

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
totally ripped off the Scooby-Doo

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
the 13 ghosts of Scooby-Doo.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Vincent Price hired

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Scooby and Shaggy to work at his store

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
or whatever and they dropped a vase

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
or something and he's like,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
no, that had ghosts in it.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I want you to go out and round

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
up those ghosts.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
How many are there?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
As many as in a

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
standard network

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
order.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
But also a very spooky number.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
13.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
In the 13th episode

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
do you think Scooby brings in the

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
ghost and then he drops the back

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
nine ghosts?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Go get the back nine ghosts

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
for a total of 24.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Those are the mid-season

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
ghosts.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
You counted the pilot ghosts.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Everyone does that.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You're not supposed to do that.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Anyways.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
If you're out there and you created

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Friday the 13th the series, you know

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
what you did.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
But also

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
the

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Night of the Living Dead franchise

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
we met

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
with George Romero when we were much

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
younger.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It was interesting.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
One of the things that was fascinating was hearing

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
how the reason

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
that movie is famous

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
was because of a bunch of mishaps.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It was originally called Night of the

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Flesh Eaters and at the last minute

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
they changed the name, the title

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
card, but they forgot

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
to put copyright information on it

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
and it became public domain.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
That's why everybody was allowed to put it

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
at their drive-in theaters for free.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So they all did, which was the ultimate

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
distribution tool.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
The most famous, most successful

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
making movie in the world, but Romero

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
didn't really get any money.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
They didn't make any money. That's why they've been remaking it

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
every 10 years.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
The other reason why you notice with the Night of the Living Dead

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
it's splintered into

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I think Rubenstein

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
owned.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
How did it divide?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Anything that's of the dead is

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Romero's property and anything

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
that's a time of the day

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
is...

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Living Dead is owned by...

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't believe it. Anybody, horror fans out there?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Who?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
What are you looking for?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
What am I looking for?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Well, because they don't want to advertise false

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
expertise and...

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
What?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
That's helpful.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
What did he say?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Sharpie Buttsalot.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I'm just jumping out stuff.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Anything to stretch the time at this point.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I got so nervous

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
about the visuals, I was like

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
can I see photos of my dog and

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
everybody's like, yeah, but not if you

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
use the trackpad or something

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
and I was like, oh god, what are we going to do?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And then the first 10 minutes it's like, just burnt out

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
our energy with all those visuals. There's a mannequin

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
with pantyhose on it.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Now what are we doing? It's like

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
listening to a golf tournament.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
People enjoy that.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Harmon moves up to the bit.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Stands in front of the bit.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
There's a cricket in here.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Is there a cricket in here?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Yeah, it sounds like it's over there.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Well, that's nice. Maybe that's the meltdown

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
cricket he followed us.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
People always think it's a fan.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It's a fucking cricket.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Ladies can be crickets.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Oh, shit.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
There's a secret might drop.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I haven't dropped it yet.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
No, no, I haven't dropped it yet.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
What are we talking about? Horror movies, Freddy Krueger,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
and your butthole.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Yeah, you know, my grandpa

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
had third degree birds all over his body.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
He's gone now, but he

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
blew up in an oil tank.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Not in the war, but after he got back.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
He was already a pretty old guy.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
He was already my grandpa.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And he blew up

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
while he was welding

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
the inside of a gas tank.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Oh, don't do that.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Underneath gas stations.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
If you do that, no, no, no, don't do that.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
If you were to

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
excavate all the earth around a gas station,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
you'd see these giant tanks where all the gas

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
goes down there and they need maintenance down there.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So I guess you go down with a blow torch

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and sometimes they haven't left the fan on

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
long enough overnight to get all those gas fumes out of there.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Big explosion.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
They said that the tools were melted

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
to the floor of the gas tank.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That's how hot it was in there.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
The rungs of the ladder to get out were like melted.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
And he was in there as a human being

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
made of meat.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And I remember

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
being a kid and going to the hospital

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and being terrified

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
of my own grandpa.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And he was like, don't be scared.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Which I thought was kind of cool

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
because he should have been like ouch.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And he was

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
worried about me being scared.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
He should have been like, be scared.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm terrified.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Go to college.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And not for welding.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
But he

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
ended up

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
by the time he died, he looked

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
totally...

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
You would never have known from looking at him.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But I thought it was like 90% of his body

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
was like third degree burns. So I don't even understand

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
how they did that. There was the talk of skin graft

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
from his butt or something. But like, can you

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
skin graft and wait for skin

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to grow back? Why are you asking me?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I don't know. What am I supposed to ask

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
the fucking surgeon general?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Yes, you can do that.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
It's an out loud rhetorical question.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
His question, settlement?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
You know what?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I don't think so.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I never even heard a thing about that.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Somebody should have said something.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Don't do that.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Maybe it was like his idea

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
to go in while there was gas in there or something

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
so he couldn't sue anybody. I don't know.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Don't do it!

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I want to go down there.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I want to do some welding.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
No, come on.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
The fans!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Don't do it!

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I'm sure he would have been like, no,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I'm not going to sue him.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
He lied about his age to go fight

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
World War II.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Couldn't get in there fast enough.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I'm sure he didn't want to.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Maybe the lawyer called him

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
and he'd probably be like, fuck you.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Good God. The Harmon's cut from a steel cloth.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Yeah.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
That generation's all gone now.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It's all pussies now.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Hey, what is the hardest?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
The manlier your grandparents are.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
The more...

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
It's like the microcosm of the nation

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
that protected us and fought Nazis for real.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Yeah, and then we joined

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
improv troops when we're 35.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Just compliant improv.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
This twinkie's too soft.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I want my money back.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
We take you to this intelligentsia.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Hey, uh...

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I'm going to hashtag this twinkie

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
until you get sued and fired.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I'm a snowflake.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Who, like, has the hardest job

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
in your family?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Definitely me.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Really?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Hardest job.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Who followed in his footsteps?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I'd have to say the next

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
closest manliest thing

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
would be my uncle that airbrushes

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
the sides of vans.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
What?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
There's really nobody...

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I'm sure somebody's offended in my family

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
listening, but I can't...

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Didn't he do a jacket?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Didn't he airbrush a jacket for you?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
He airbrushed lots of jackets.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Now he's passed away.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
He got brain cancer.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
So lucky.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
What?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Sorry, it's been a rough week.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
No, I don't...

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
It's not a...

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
It was my great-grandma

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Buscha.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Buscha's Polish for grandma.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
She's the son of Mima.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
But Buscha...

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
She was...

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I think it's okay to say

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
she murdered a guy.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
She was a vaudevillian

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
and she probably murdered a guy

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
in the Navy.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
But I'm sure he deserved it.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Break this shit down.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Like, she did it with her act

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
or she did it in the middle of an act.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I told the story before.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I feel like every time I go back

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
to my parents, I find out I'm wrong

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
about all these details.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
But I felt like my great-grandma

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
she was like...

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
She was living with a guy

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
or he was like...

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I just remember the story

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
was that people were watching a football game

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
and then they broke into the football game

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
and said like an 83-year-old woman

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
is being questioned in the

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
stabbing death of a man

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
and everyone joked like,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
83, that's gotta be grandma Buscha.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Because

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
she was just like a...

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
She was really salty.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Very, very salty.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I've told the stories

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
about her that I have.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
They questioned her and she said

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
he fell on the scissors several times

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
and

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
they let her go

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I assume because they were like

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
she's almost dead and then she lived

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
for like 20 more years

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
leaving a trail of bodies

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
as long as the Route 66.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
But she, along the way

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
between that and her natural death

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
at like very late 90s

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
if not, I think she might have broke 100, did she?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Maybe, I don't know.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But between that

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
questioning for the homicide

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and the actual death, she got her throat

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
slashed by somebody that broke into her house

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
to take her microwave because she owed them money.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Shit!

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
And there's like a...

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I've talked about this, I've talked about this.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Yeah, I didn't know about this.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
No wonder why we moved

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
to Burbank.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
So you can start your criminal empire.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
My parents have the news footage

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
on VHS of the

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
doctor because it's like she got

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
her throat slashed.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And she hung out

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
at her house bleeding.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
After her throat was slashed?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
And then she realized nobody was going to be around for a while

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
after a neck and a towel

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and walked to the hospital.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
And then

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
it was like

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
there's news footage of

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
they go like a woman

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
got her throat slashed and then walked herself to the hospital

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
with a towel wrapped around her neck.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And then they show like an interview

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
in the hospital lobby with the doctor

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
who performed the stitching.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
And he's

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
doing this interview and he's like

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
he's going like

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
a woman

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
came in

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
a woman came in

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
her

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
throat had been

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
slashed.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
She was 91

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
years old, whatever older she was.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I stitched it closed.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
He's like marvel.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
He's like am I a genius?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Or is she Frankenstein's monster?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I don't know what he's like

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
he's trying to figure it out.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
What was going to happen in school?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But he's like I did what I'm supposed to do.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It's not supposed to

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
work under those circumstances.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But you know I took an oath

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
to try and it worked

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
and she left.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
She walked out.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
He's like he's going like

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
that's the answer to your question.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I know you're going to not believe me,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
but he's like

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
he's just marveling at it and he's a doctor.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
He's seen it all.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And she used to

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
and I don't want to slander her because

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
she's lived it.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
She'll come back and fuck you up.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
She used to hit.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
She was very amorous with the

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
grandkids stuff.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
She liked young men and

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
she went out

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
functional.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
She was like

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
she wasn't like retired

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
in the

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
sexual department.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
She liked to get down.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
She would like nude sunbathe

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
or like 95 year old took us

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
in the sun.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
With the battle scar.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Beautiful visual for all the

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
home listeners.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And she was a vaudevillian and my parents would always tell me

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
you're the other performer in the family.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
You should talk to grandma Boucher about vaudeville

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and everybody was like you should talk to grandma Boucher

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
about vaudeville and I finally

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
went up to her at Easter

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
and said grandma Boucher what was vaudeville like?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
It was good.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Vaudeville was the best.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
she was like

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
what do you want to know?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
What was it like?

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
It was a stage.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
She was just like

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
fuck you man, fuck you.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
I didn't even want to ask.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I could go ask grandpa

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
about Iwo Jima next.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I'm just doing this for you guys.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I don't know what these words mean.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
How was making your own baseball

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
out of cork?

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Uncle Tony told me to ask.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Apparently the answer is

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
it's hard, it's easy.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I'm seven.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Well you take the cork

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
and you wrap string around it.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I'm going to appreciate this

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
when I'm almost dead.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
That's when I'm going to be like whoa making your own baseball

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
holy shit.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
It's going to take a while

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
for me to appreciate this stuff.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I think you'd appreciate the fucking knife thing more.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
That is crazy.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Did they catch the guy who did that?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
It was a woman.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Yeah because it was a microwave.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
So that makes sense.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Because women use microwaves.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Oh hate me.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I got to defrost this stuff.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I got to defrost this fruit.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Gimme this.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Gimme this.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I'll give you back my microwave.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I got to defrost this fruit.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Mosha.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Gimme the microwave. I got to defrost this fruit.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
No, no, no.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Scissors mother fuck.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Cutting your throat.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Gimme that. I'm going to defrost this fruit

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
and plug it in in my kitchen.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I can't get the door open.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I'm going to defrost this fruit.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I'm going to defrost this fruit

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
in my butcher's microwave.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
This is my house.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I'm going to plug it in.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Okay.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I want some grapes.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And some banana slices.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Two minutes should probably do it.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
We'll fast forward.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Nope, nope, not enough.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Meanwhile, at the board of

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
banana and grape farmers

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
gentlemen, we have a problem.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
The microwave culture is upon us

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
and our fruit takes too long to microwave.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
It takes too long.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I'm willing to kill people.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Jesus, it's a nice, wielding woman.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Give me some.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Don't freeze it anymore. Why you got to freeze it?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Just take it off the tree.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Put it in a bowl and give it to me.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I'm starving.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Oh, you're so strong.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Your hands are so strong.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Oh, your hands are so strong.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
They look like little bananas.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
No, God, no.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I know you love them so much

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
that you'll stab them.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Oh, my throat.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I'm taking every banana.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Oh, and every grape.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And I'm going to run away

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
and they're already defrosted.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Get me a towel.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I know how this works.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Why am I dying?

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Because you know, got that bush of blood.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And that's how it happened.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Yeah, you can't kill a Harmon, I guess.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
They don't really die.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I mean, not before like a thousand or whatever.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I mean, when you drink yourself to death,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
you're maybe like...

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Midwest people got good genes.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
You know, we live long.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
We don't want to.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
But we live long.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Yeah.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I know.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
What kind of life is it?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
You get these like erasers on your collar bone,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
like fucking skin tags and stuff

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
if you're Polish descended.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I have these things like come off

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
and look like little fucking erasers

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and then I'll be like, is that cancer?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And then like a week later, fall off

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
or something when I sleep.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Hair growing out of your ears.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And your nose.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Nose fills up with barbed wire.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Ears getting all big.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
That ear thing really freaks me out.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
You see people's giant ass ears.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Why do your ears get so big?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Your head actually shrinks.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Are you doing a bit?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Your head shrinks?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Your head gets smaller and your ears stay the same.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Shut up.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
It's because it's like soft tissue

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
and it's gravity.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
But it's like you think they would just

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
lower, you know, like they just like droop

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
lower? Like how come the tops of them

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
you look like Ferengi.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You get old enough.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Isn't that the right alien I'm thinking of?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yeah, you're looking at a senator.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Hey, is it pronounced omniscient

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
or omniscient?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
You can pronounce it

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
omniscient. Don't take my girlfriend's side.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Hahaha.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
There's a lot of words

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I only learned in print.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
My dad always used to say

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
measure instead of measure

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
and be a real asshole about it

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
and he'd get out the dictionary

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and see there's a little line

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
over the A in the pronunciation

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
guide. It's major

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
and then everyone would hate him.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Then he moved

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
to Columbia.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
My dad would say,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
he's alive.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
My dad says

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
What the fuck is that? What moon

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
is he from?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
People in St. Louis say

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Warsh and Fark. My dad says

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Quata and Warsh, but he's not

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
from fucking Delaware or anything, but he says

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Warsh sometimes.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Antaner is another one.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Look at that car, Antaner.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Like a R? No.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
People malign me for my

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
pronunciation of the word baggle,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
but I don't

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
ever, what's that?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Baggle. Whatever.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Baggle, baggle, baggle.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
My dad did? No, he didn't.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
You didn't deserve that.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
You didn't.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
All right.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Spencer,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
what about your

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Ham grandma, your baloney grandma?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Oh, my baloney grandma.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Spencer's got kind of a nutty

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
grandma. Is she still with us?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
My baloney's got a first name.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It's G-R-A-M-A.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Can you tell us a little bit about your

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
baloney grandma? Yeah, no, she's still

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
with us. Where is she right now?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
She's behind you.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Oh, no.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
She went crazy.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
She has had bipolar

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
disorder, but

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
New space, new jokes.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
But most recently, it's manifested

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
in pyromancy.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
No, pyromania. What?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Pyromancy's magical creation

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
of fire.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Does she wave her hands in a

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
magical manner? Yeah.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
She knows burning hands.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Whoa.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
No, okay, so she ended up getting

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
kicked out of my grandpa's house

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
because she would... Were they related?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
By marriage, yeah.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
She would strike matches

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
and throw them onto the ground

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
where there was sometimes carpet.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
She would light on pieces

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
of paper on fire and just toss them

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
into waste paper baskets and walk away.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Now, I'm going to say something to you

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
that really fed me up when I would tell

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
people about Boucher.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
But

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I feel, that sounds like the coolest

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
grandma ever.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
She's setting fires.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I'd put people to be like,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
your grandma stabbed a guy, that's amazing.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
When your grandpa was like,

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
oh, what the fuck are you doing?

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
What are you doing?

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
What are you going to do about it?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Are you going to stop me?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
It would have been cool if we saw that.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Your grandma had...

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Don't light the garbage on fire.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
She had adult

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
onset pyromania.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
How far?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
How far did it go?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
What's the biggest shit she ever burned out?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
To the top, right?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
No, I don't know. I don't think she really burnt anything down.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It was weird. I don't understand it,

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
but it was basically explained as a compulsion.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
She just did it for fun

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
and absentmindedly.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
She didn't really clock that she was doing it.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But who knows?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
She was like Donald Sutherland's character in Backdraft.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
That's what I was telling my mom.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Yeah.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Grandma, what would you do if we let you out?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Burn it. Burn it all.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
But

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
she decided she wanted to own a hostel.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
So she moved to Nevada

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
and she bought a hostel.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
It's bad.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
She's gone kind of nuts.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
One time the police picked her up in Sacramento

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
because she was just handing out $20 bills

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
on the corner.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Hey, stop doing that!

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
What are you doing?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I'm not doing anything.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Hey, hey!

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Stop it.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm going to arrest you for handing out $20 bills.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Will you arrest me

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
if I don't wave this 20 past your eyes?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Are you trying to

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
anti-bride me?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Yeah.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
But when she set up the hostel,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
it was like with swindlers

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
because usually it's good people

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
that want to own a hostel, I think.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But these were swindlers

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
and they took a bunch of money from her.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
But no, we were going to get lunch

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
to visit her one time because it was crazy.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
The whole state of Nevada

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
smells like cigarette smoke, by the way.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
But we were driving around

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
looking for food and she was like,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
oh, you want food? I can help you out.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And we were like, oh, what a

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
ominous sense.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And she reaches

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
into her own

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
on her foot boot

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
and pulls out a package

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
of 79-set Carl

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Buttig Honey Baked Ham.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Oh, no.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And I don't know what it says

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
about her circulation

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
or about, I don't know,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
thermodynamics, but it was still frozen.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
No.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Despite, like, no meat in my shoe

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
would stay frozen.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Yo, your grandma's

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
your grandma's circulation is so poor

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
she could keep cold cuts

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
in her boot. Grandma, come on.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Come out to the car. We're leaving.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
One second.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
To camera.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I'm probably going to need this.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Just in case

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
just in case

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
the opportunity arises.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
You got a crazy grandma, Brandon?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I mean, no.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I don't either.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
My grandma was the head of the Democratic Party

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
for Missouri.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Yay.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
There is no

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I wish

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
now, though, I do kind of wish

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
that she'd had some fucked-up shit

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
just to be in, you know, the company of.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It would be useful for this exact scenario.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Yeah.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Why is your family so political?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
You have a sister that's like a hardcore activist, right?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
My sister's pretty nuts. She'll call me from

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
fucked-up locations.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
They shouldn't.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It's the craziest.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
It's the craziest thing.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
You said your sister has a hard time

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
earning her way into these troubled spots

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
because she

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
has a very put-together

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
vibe and

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
you could take it from me anytime

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
before I stick my foot in my mouth.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
No, no, no.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I love your diatribes on black women.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
You know, we came from the suburbs

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
so when you're trying to help people

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
in a different neighborhood and they hear you

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
talk like this, it can be a little

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
confusing.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Unless you're like, the last time they had

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
some shit like this was on the Jefferson's

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
when they would go down to the Help Center.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Do you remember that?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Oh, those episodes, what?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I thought he just ran a laundromat.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
All the old black people over 65 were referencing

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
the Jefferson's.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
They would go down to the Help Center.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Yeah, on the Jefferson's they used to go down

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
because they were rich black people so they felt

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
like the Help Center and they would do all sorts

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
of shit.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
That seems like a shark jump, though.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I thought George Jefferson was kind of a stingy

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
like...

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
This is that storytelling that you crave so much.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
The Jefferson's definitely

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
were not like the Freddy Krueger the series

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
show.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
We had Norman Lear on the show.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
She goes into some crazy locations

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
where when they hear her talk

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
they're a little suspect.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
She might be saying

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
put your hand out my pocket.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Yeah, she's there to create a diversion.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Yeah.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Yeah, what the fuck are we going to do?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I heard the March

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
the latest March went well.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
The climate March.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yeah, it went well.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
The climate's better now.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
But good turnout

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
or whatever.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I was

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
looking on Twitter

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
and just

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
watching the

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
conservative tweeters going

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
like, what are they going to have a March

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
every week?

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
So far, yeah.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
There's May Day tomorrow, so

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
yeah.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Yeah.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And with the looming

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
writer's strike, it's kind of an important

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
May Day. Or is the Trump supporters

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
like to call it Loyalty Day?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Well, let me lay my ignorance

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
on the altar for the benefit of

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
everyone listening so you can explain what May Day

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
is to me. I have no idea

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
what it is. What is May Day?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I could be totally wrong, but I thought May Day

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
was International Workers Day, right?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
All right, see, I'm glad I asked.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I'm brave

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
for admitting I don't know anything.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
You are brave.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I'll tell you everything I know about America

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
in five minutes. Let me time myself.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I'll take you through the whole

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
history of the country. Okay, here we go.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Let's see.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I can make this a new segment.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Stopwatch. Okay, I'm going to go...

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I'm going to set it wait.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
We're going to say two minutes to figure out how my phone works.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
And then...

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Nope, zero hours.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Let's try it this way.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Let's just say...

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Hey, Siri.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Hey, Siri.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Hey, Siri!

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Hey, can you

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
set a five-minute timer, please?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Okay.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Five minutes and counting.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Okay.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
In 1492,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Columbus came over,

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
and there were three other boats,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and then they landed on Plymouth Rock,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
and then they had Thanksgiving with all the pilgrims

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
and the Indians that were here already.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And then the Salem people

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
came over, and they were a peerage,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and so they burned all the witches because they were on LSD.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
And then

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
things just kind of blossomed from there,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
and they were always eating potatoes and corn,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and it was fine.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
But there was taxation without representation,

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
so we started to get ornery,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
so a bunch of the college-educated folk got together

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
in a place that had a broken bell,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
or they broke it later,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
and they said,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
we should give tyranny your death

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
or give it to me that way in that order.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And then

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
they did the Declaration of Independence,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
and then England was like, you can't do that,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
and they came over and they had red coats,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
and they were like, I don't know if I see it.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And then we won because they were tired,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
and

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
King George was mad,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
and so they were like,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
fine, good luck having a country, whatever.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
And then we were like, fine.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And then 1812 happened, and there was a war

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
that no one understands with Canada or something.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And then the whole time

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
there were slaves, the whole time we were

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
just going to Africa and going,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
these people seemed like they wouldn't know

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
what fair pay was,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
and they were like, okay, let's do it.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
And they were like, how much am I bid for this?

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And that was kind of fucked up,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
and I don't want to dwell on this part, but...

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
No one ever does.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I got three minutes,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
three minutes and 20 seconds left.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
We're almost done.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I was like...

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And then that one guy

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
was a slave for 12 years,

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
and then he got freaked out.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And...

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And then Abraham Lincoln,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
who I think,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
some people say was

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
half black, but

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
that's maybe a conspiracy theory,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
but he was running for president,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and he was like, we should free the slaves,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
and then there was a federalist movement,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
and then the south states were like,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
you shouldn't do that.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
We built the whole country on slavery,

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
and now you're saying you just want to use

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
the pants we made for free

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
for black people, and then you don't want to,

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
but you want to read poetry in them,

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
just because you made a machine that can make pants now?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
That's not fair.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
We were like, we don't care, you're dumb,

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
and your teeth look dumb.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And let's go to war.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And then we fought,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
and then Abraham Lincoln halfway through the war

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
was like, by the way, the slaves are free.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And we were like, yay!

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And then France was like, I'm going to do it too then,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
because I hate everything.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And then that's why we won,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
because we were the north one,

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
not we, the federalist one,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
and then we unified the country,

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
and then Abraham Lincoln got shot,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
and then it was spending too long on that two-year period.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
So then everything was fine,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
and we ate potatoes and corn and stuff,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and then we made a bunch of smokestacks,

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
and then Henry Ford was like,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
what if you did pay people,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
but if you paid them so little,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
they were basically slaves anyway,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
and you made each person do one little thing,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
and then you bought everything.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
But I made the light bulb,

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
and he's like, no,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
and then everybody was making things

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
for a while, everybody's making stuff,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
and then

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
because everybody was making things,

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
they knew how to put gunpowder

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
into smaller compartments,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
and so everybody was like, I can't wait to use these,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I can't use them, because we're not in a war,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
and everybody was like, I know, right?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I want to use it.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And then Archduke Ferdinand was like,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
what happened?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I'm freezing for me, I can't wait forever.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Everybody was like, boom, boom, boom, boom,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
and they're like, mustard gas,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
shoot them in the kneecaps,

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
and it was like fucked up,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
and all quiet in the western front,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
people were eating rats,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
and everybody had herpes all over their face,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
and everybody died at 35,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
but they wrote nice poetry,

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
and it was kind of like nice quiet people,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
they didn't talk about it,

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
they did trenches everywhere, and were done,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
and then there was peace for a while,

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
and they didn't eat shit, because you caused this,

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
and they were like, well, we're kind of sick of hearing that,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
and then Hitler's like, Jews, am I right?

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
And they were like, yeah.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And then everybody was like, here we go again,

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
except America was like, yeah, we'll be right with you,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
cash on the barrel head for bullets and oil,

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
and England was like, for real?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
And we were like, yeah, you shouldn't have fucked with us

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
in the first place, should have let us go back in 1612,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
or something, and they were like,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
that's fucked up weird justification,

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
but okay, we'll just hang out in the subway while they bomb us,

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
hello, and then we were like, and profit,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
and then we're like, we won the war,

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
you owe us a billion dollars, and everyone was like,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
yay, and we formed the United Nations,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
we're like, plan an America, and everyone was like,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
that's great, and we're like, the next 50 years

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
is all planned out, and then we just went 50 years,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and everybody got better shoes, and TV shows,

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
and built skyscrapers, and then,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
the meanwhile, the Middle East was like,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
what about us, and we were like,

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
we can't hear you, make us our oil,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
and then they were like, not they,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
but some of the, okay, that's where we are now,

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
that's my five minutes.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I don't know why you're,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I mean, I know you're applauding that,

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
because it's a thing that ended that lasted five minutes,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
but it wasn't a good thing,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
it's like, it really is, it's not like I was rushing,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
it's like, that was all the information I have,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
like, I don't really have, like, extra details,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
like, you know, like, Greg Proops knows

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
stuff about Cleopatra and stuff.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
She was from Iowa.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Now, you do it.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Now, you do it.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
You do it.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
You do it.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
No, okay, now I'm good.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Are you sad? Are you sad?

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
You seem a little sad.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm fine.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Why?

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
I don't know, you sounded sad.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Just now? Yeah, I was like, you did it,

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
and you were like, no, I don't want to.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Well, you wish the show was a little shorter.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Well, that was exhausting.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It's a big country.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Sure is, man.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
On this episode of Friends.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Well, are you going to bail out

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
on our Thursday night

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
hangout again?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
You know, you have a right to text me

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
when we're, are you,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
do you just wait for me to ask you

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
if we're going to hang out on Thursdays?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
No, Steve Levy scheduled it.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It's like, comes up

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
in my calendar saying

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
like, weekly

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
hangout with Harmon. Yeah.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Mine says, Schrab. Right.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And you bailed last week.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Well, but to find that,

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I never even got a text from you.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Steve Levy told me,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
he said, Dan can't make it tonight.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And I said, okay, I figured

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
he, you guys are talking to each other.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Oh, shit. Here comes Steve Levy.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Where is he?

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
What's up, Steve Levy?

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Doesn't matter.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
You were, you were available Thursday

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
and you just found out now

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
that you canceled? No, I think I was doing something,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
but I can't remember, but it doesn't, it doesn't matter.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
We, we, we stretched until 10, 10 p.m.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
It was Cody's family

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
came to town. Cody's family

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
came to town. Oh yeah, yeah.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I went out with Cody's family. Okay.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
That's where that chandelier picture was.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Okay, great. Moving on.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
She's out of here. Are you going to bail?

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Hey, she, she left her,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
she left her purse though, so.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Yeah. Open the purse.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Open the purse.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Open it. Open it.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Open it. Open it.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
And he's going to go over

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
her much publicized blog.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Open Taken Shits at Harmontown.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
A look, a look from the can

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
at the cans and canots.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Don't look in the purse.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Reach in and grab

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
grab the first thing.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And then read it.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
That is totally okay.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I don't actually know that

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Annie's taking a shit. That's an invasion

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
of her privacy. It could be a,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
it could be a peepee, a cigarette. She might vape.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
We don't know.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
She could be a crime fighter.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
What's it say? What's it say?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Oh, it's a phone. What does it say?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Are you going through her shit?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
You're her friend, are you her friend?

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Well, Rob told her to.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It is.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
What? No, we can't play D&D.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Yeah, let's bring out Jeff.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Maybe next week we'll...

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
We'll think about it.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I said the same thing.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Next week we'll...

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Why don't you play...

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I don't know how many shows Jeff's going to miss.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Why don't you play Dragons and Dungeons?

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
All right.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Let's do a quality,

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
concise goodbye wrap

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
for our first show here.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Let's make it good.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Sure, I make it good.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And jump in there

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
because you're better at it and that's not racist.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
It's based on friendship.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
It's not a snap judgment I'm making.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
You're very good at it.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
You should jump in there.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I have to pee so bad.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Will Schrab be joining us as well?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Schrab's going to come in with...

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Samples.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
From various films and television.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Jam.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Chick jam.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Chick jam, jam.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Chick jam, jam.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Get the ham, ham.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Get the ham, ham.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Chick jam, jam.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Put the beef in the pants.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Motherfuckers get pants in.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
In the place to...

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
pee.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I'm going to fuck your mama like me.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Okay, no more.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
No more mama fucking.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Yo, my name is MC...

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
microphone.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
In the rap game, I am known as...

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000
all alone.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Because I don't spend a lot of time on my name.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Because rhyming is the majority of my game.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I don't believe in self-promotion.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
I only believe in the rapping motion.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I like to move my lips in my little tiny tongue.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I fucked your mama so hard she became a nun.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Afterward.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Not because she was traumatized.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I like to think I spiritualized her pussy.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
With my dick.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And gave each titi a lick.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
And when I did, it was a trinity.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
And I fucked her so hard she wants more of me.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So I'm going over there next Wednesday,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
as my dad would say.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Take it!

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I don't know if I could beat that.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I beat your mom's room for baseball bat.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Next Wednesday, Tuesday.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
We getting down, got her on her knee.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
No more fucking mamas.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Mamas need a lot of respect.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Mama wrote you the damn first check.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Mama gave you your first kiss on your lips.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
You used to hug your mom round the hips.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Mama, stay in school and drink your milk.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
No more fucking mamas.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
No more fucking mamas.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
No more fucking mamas.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Mamas need some respect.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Outer space.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
On the moon.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
