00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
From Hollywood, California, just down the road from where the Oscars are happening and

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
horrible things are going down.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Black people are being admitted to the record.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
My name is Jeff Davis of Capitola, I'm happy to be back. Let's bring up some friends that are kidding me.

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
Rob Schwab!

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Rob Schwab!

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
Rob Schwab!

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
The mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
It's weird coming out so early.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
So we're bringing Schwab out at the top.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I started looking at vines and the...

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
The Bible tells us, Dan, don't keep your light under a bushel.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Bring me Schwab out as soon as possible.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
The kids like him.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
You love him too, Dan.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
Historically, more often than not, but it's been a long time.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Yes.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
What would that graph look like from, like, what, 1991?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay, we'll go on to yours. Do it.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
So there'd be some valleys and some peaks. I mean, same as any friendship.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Do you think right now...

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
That was the potential of that setup.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Are you...

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Pretend I said this before he just said that.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Are you feeling a Schwab peak or a Schwab valley right now?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't know. I just lost an Oscar.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
To that fucking movie about the kid's brain.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
The Big Short?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
They tell you something about Pixar movies.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
They have, like, eight million people making them.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
If all of them vote for who gets an Oscar, that's how they do it.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay, like, eight people worked on my fucking sweatshop movie.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
For three years, we moved puppets a millimeter at a time.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
That movie was about adults eating pussy in a hotel room.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It was about the futility of monogamy.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It was about our obsession with the other.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
And the human condition. Pixar is fine.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Stop giving them shit.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Don't encourage them. Scare them.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
They will do better movies.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
When they made Toy Story, they were scared.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
They were scared it would be bad.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
So they made it amazing.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Toy Story 3.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
They were scared it was going to be as shitty as Toy Story 2.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
So it was great.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Wait a minute. You thought Toy Story 2 was shitty?

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
I've never seen it. I thought they thought it was.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I've obviously misread the site.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Dan, I'm so sorry you worked really, really hard on that movie.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I, the executive produced for years.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
You were there with your sleeves rolled up every day.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
There's one thing I know when Dan's involved with anything animated. He rolls up his sleeves.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
And just is like, what can I do to help?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
What do you need? You need a sandwich? You need some water?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
You need any kind of snacks? I know it's two o'clock.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
I know we don't fill the refrigerator here at Star Burns, but I'm here.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
We'll take care of it. You guys miss your wives and children?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
What can I do? What can I do?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
What can I do? Dan, what can I do?

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Harmon, what can I do for you animators?

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
What can I do for you working on something that my name goes before your name?

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
Harmon, what can I help you? How can I help you work for me?

04:28.000 --> 04:36.000
What can I do? What can I do? Does your eyes hurt?

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Spoken like an animator. Does your eyes hurt?

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm from Cartoon Town. I don't know that everything starts with a script.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
I was making the script better for your cartoon.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
You can just draw a picture and have people go...

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
What were you writing when you did Schrab Asshole?

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
You were being very mean to me. Justified. This sucks.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
You're catching me on a theft night. Here's the thing.

05:18.000 --> 05:28.000
Do your eyes hurt?

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Do they hurt in the first act? Do you cross a threshold into a world where they hurt in a different way?

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
You were really right. This is what you were doing. Well, I never mind.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
You obviously wrote something there. Let's see what happened.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Let's see what you got.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
What are you talking about? You're looking at...

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I just have a little set list here.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
You wrote it.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
What was I saying?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Story structure.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Here's the thing. Pixar. Racist.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
That's the thing. I called Chris Rock because he's sitting back there with the envelopes.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Just get us out of there. I don't feel comfortable.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
In a year, when too many fucking white people are...

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I said, give it to Pixar. They don't give a shit about black people.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
He was like, are you sure? I said, yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
That's the other thing about this. First of all, they don't deserve it.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Second of all, they're racist.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
I didn't realize the corruption that you could call Chris Rock up and change the way the Oscars go.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
You saw those ticker tapes. Everybody knows who's going to win.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
You saw that. They did the little teletype thing.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
I hated it.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
Nothing different is ever going to play like, cool. That's so cool that they did that different thing.

07:03.000 --> 07:10.000
It reminded me of my space when there was your top five.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Back in my day, it was five.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Whatever number it is, the top blank.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
The people that get zing around there...

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
It was an argument starter, what I'm saying, back home or tomorrow morning.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
How come you didn't thank me on the mic?

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
The teletype is genius because it's all the shitty people that will just get mad if you don't thank them when you win an Oscar.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
And the old pros are like, oh, this person did wardrobe for this thing and it's like she's been working for 30 years.

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
She gets to have a fucking huge ticker tape that goes like, yes, stinky, stymie, poopy, toony.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, you're so important, but honestly, they play you off in 10 seconds.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
So let me tell my little story and make my...

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Excuse me, it's top eight, not five.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Sorry, I just have to interrupt you right there, Mr. Schwab.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Actually, your free number's off.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Please continue.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
For all of you.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
All of them.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah, for all of you.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Welcome to a special Axe Grinderers edition of Primate Town.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
I thought they had some cool, innovative ways to keep the Oscars shorter this year.

08:23.000 --> 08:32.000
I could make a suggestion for next year, you could shorten, you could take a half hour off the ceremony by having a separate Mad Max award ceremony.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
That's a little joke I wrote in here.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I didn't draw it.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I wrote it.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
You know, you could really speed it up by cutting out white people.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
They'd be fucking speeding right up.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Schwab loved that one.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Here's something I will agree that they did different this year that I thought was just like, don't do that.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
When the people are standing and they're talking about the nominated movies.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
The way they cut to the clip.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
The camera.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Moving stuff behind you?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
No, that's that.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Okay, we'll do my bit later.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm talking about the steady cam thing where they have the presenters and then the presenters talk and then the camera move.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Instead of them cutting to a clip, the camera would move.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, I liked that tip.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
You liked it?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I thought that was horrible.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I liked it.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I hated it.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I liked it.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
You liked it.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
I thought that was cool.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
See, okay.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Director and writer.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I just thought, I just thought, I was like, it looks like.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
Did you love it when all over that, all over that visual stuff, they were typing the words over it?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Seat up, Eric.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Sips his coffee.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
You must have been like, fucking yeah.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
That's what the movie should have been like.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
She smiles, looks at her keyboard and goes, ooh.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
That's where the real art is.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I do.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I like watching.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Nobody else does, so I never get to do it except when I'm by myself.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I put the closed caption on.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
I forget who the presenters were, but they did say a thing about writers like the backbone of all films are the writers.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Very true.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Very true.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I liked that.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
They dealt with that nicely.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Very true.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I've never said it wasn't.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Well, obviously, fraudulent Oscars this year, as I said.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Except for Fury Road, that was pretty badass.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I think you can discount all those awards when you look across the board, whether or not the awards were distributed fairly.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I think Anomalyza should have won.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
That's the shame, is that now we have to question every single Fury Road award.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
I agree.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
It's like, who are these people?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
What are they thinking?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah, but the animation people aren't voting for the other shit.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Fair.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
I like that Whoopi Goldberg dressed up as Ursula from Little Mermaid.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
She looked like Ursula from Little Mermaid, right?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Did you guys, okay, go for it.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It's your show, go ahead.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Too much chatter, Red Tooth.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
All right.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
That's an original Star Wars reference.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Red Tooth.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Who's Red Tooth?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Red Tooth.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Red Tooth.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Red Tooth.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Red Tooth.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Cut the chatter, Red Tooth.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Cut the chatter of Blue Tooth.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Am I Blue Tooth or the red one?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Wait, what the hell?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
What did we say before?

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
I had to be like one of those weird pirates from the show that yells at the people for being bad pirates.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Little Mermaid.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Little Mermaid.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Whoopi Goldberg.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
So, Benicio del Toro.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Benicio del Toro.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Did you see the bear bit and the thing?

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
And then for like a solid eight seconds, we all got to see what Benicio del Toro looks like when he's amused.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Kind of stepped on the...

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Not a real sneeze, just sabotage.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Knock, knock.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Who's there?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Dwayne.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Dwayne.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That's great.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Keep going.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Dwayne who?

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Anyways, Benicio del Toro.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Benicio del Toro.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Was it Dwayne the chap I'm drowning?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Yeah.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Alright, moving on.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
It's not like I have jokes on here.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
That was the Oscars. You get any Oscar opinions? You don't care.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Oh, no. I don't really watch the Oscars. It's all...

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
It's all white people, it's Pixar, racist.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
They're just awards. It's like, what does that mean? You like what you like.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Isn't that the thing that matters? Who cares what other people like?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
That's not... I'm not doing it for that.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
I'm just... I just never understood it.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It's like, if it's great, then it lines up with your opinion,

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
and if it's a bunch of dumb idiots, then why do you care what they have to say?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Right, but on top of that, if someone says,

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
hey Spencer, come take this statue,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
we decided you're the most awesome person this year,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
are you going to tell them to go fuck themselves?

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, I'm not in that... I don't care. I'm not in that world.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I don't make things that are going to get awards.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And then Whoopi Goldberg comes out.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
I was like, I want to steal your voice.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I want to steal your voice, Mermaid.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Did you watch her stuff when she was talking?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
She was wandering around with the empty seats.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
She's just wandering around. I was like, look at here.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Whoopi Goldberg's here. Hello, Whoopi.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Did they roll out every black person they could find to make it

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
for the amount of non-black nominees there were?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
There was a lot of...

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Lewis Gusset Jr. was out, like, Lewis Gusset Jr.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
There was a lot of attention paid to that stuff,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
to the point where we were all in a fugue state watching it.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
Every time we saw something, and maybe this is appropriate,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
we had to watch tonight's Oscars through a racial lens

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
for every single second of it.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
So it didn't really matter whether they were actively doing a bit

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
of an actively being proactive about in some ham-handed way.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
But the bummer of that is that, for instance,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
if the guy that played Apollo Creed's kid is out there

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
and he's having a good year, and he's like,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
wait, now I don't know.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
I had to look at that and I was like, wait, who's who

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
and what moves and what is part of a facade

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
and what is part of an actual honor?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
There was certainly a dedicated apology

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
to the lack of black nominees.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.000
All I knew is that it was oppressive

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
that I was supposed to have an opinion.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I didn't know.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I kind of feel like white people still haven't figured out

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
how to respond to being called racist.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I think that we still don't handle it quite,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
no matter what aspect or part of the spectrum

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
where we still don't handle it well.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
You have declared Pixar racist for not making your movie.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Because calling people racist destroys them.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm being a regular person destroying my enemies.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Because I don't care about race.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I use race to kill people.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
See, he's deposing me.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
You're racist. See?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
If somebody, you're at dinner with somebody,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
you hope they would pick up the tab.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
They don't pick up the tab.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Tell your friends later that they're a little racist.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
There's always a dot you can connect.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
It's not a bell you can unring.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
It doesn't matter if it applies.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Lady, you're racist.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
It's going to stick with you for ten minutes.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
It's just a strong, strong thing.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It's a useful thing. It's like a crowbar.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Use it to open things.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I lost an Oscar.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Pixar's racist.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
I feel better.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Pixar doesn't care.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Black people...

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
What could we do for them?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Pixar's racist.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I feel better.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Couldn't one of your main puppets in Anomalisa

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
have been a black puppet?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I've just executive produced it.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I didn't really work on the movie.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Oh!

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Interesting.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Very interesting.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
You're revealing.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I definitely lost an Oscar tonight,

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
but if you have a racial problem with the movie,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I talked to Charlie Kaufman.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
The real racist is Charlie Kaufman here, right?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I mean, it's on record.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
That guy hates...

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
The real racist is everybody.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Uh...

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Rob, are there going to be any black Lego characters?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
All of them.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
All of them?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
The whole movie?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, all of them.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
That saves you a lot of money in toy manufacturing.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
You make all the Lego pieces black pieces.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I'm not about the money.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I get paid in fun.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Like the last season of Community.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
I'm saying I had a fun time doing that.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And you made no money.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
No, I made plenty of money.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Spencer, would you rather be paid in money or fun?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
It depends on the exchange rate.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Let's say it's even...

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
It's like Canada and the U.S. about six years ago,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
when it was pretty close to even.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Wait.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I'm saying the exchange rate is like a dollar of fun

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
equals a dollar of money.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Oh, fuck.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Don't examine this premise too closely.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Especially if you're the ghost of Julia Child.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
What does that mean?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It's just broccoli.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
What does that mean?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Excuse me.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
For those of you listening...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
A little red wine.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
She has a handkerchief.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Excuse me.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
A very talky audience tonight.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
They're a little chatty.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
But that's okay.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
We have an active audience.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
That kind of bit us in the ass at the Chicago show.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
We have 800 people.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
When you go to a different city,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
people in cities that aren't Los Angeles,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
that aren't jaded and numbed down and cool.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
We're all cool in LA.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
We were used to like...

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
So when you go to a different city

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and it's like, holy shit, Harmontown's coming.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Number one, that means you can fill in 800...

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
What are you talking about?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
If I put a gun to your head and asked you that question,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
what would you say?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
What Chicago show?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
The Chicago...

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
I would pretend that you have to guess.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And you tell me.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
What Chicago show, Rob?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Or your family's going to die?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
What do you think?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
It's like a jigsaw.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
It's a saw movie.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
What Chicago show?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
What am I talking about?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
There's a spinning blade.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm about to say you did a show in Chicago.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Okay. Yes, I did.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And you could do that in your head next time.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
That whole process.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Well, you did a show Saturday.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I don't know what that is.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
It doesn't matter.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
You're not Sherlock.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Everything happened?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Well, this is what happens when you bring me out this early.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
He brought you out!

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And he did it to fuck with me.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Look at him!

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So mean.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I think things are going just fine.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
He's a mean person.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
So mean.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Chicago show is weird.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Why was it weird?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Dino told a story about the greatest

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
dream of all time called

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Hot Rod Parade.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
That was fucking fantastic.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
When it was over, you hadn't paid attention

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
to it at all.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
You were like, let's just move on.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, that's my crap.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I was too drunk and too preoccupied.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
800 people.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
If I feel like the show's not going well,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I get too spun out.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
In my head.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And then we saw this in the movie, the Harmontown movie.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
That's what happened

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
on the Arizona show when we went out on the road.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I was like, if I start to think

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I'm failing in my job somehow,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
then I'll be thinking about that.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Ironically, I'll be like, how do I make the show good?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
How do I make the show good?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Gotta work harder.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
What do they need?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
What do my people need?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
People are under me.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm working so hard. How can I help them?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I feel so responsible.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I'm back on your...

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I'm on your side now.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I don't like what's going on.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I'm going to give myself...

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I didn't get an Oscar today,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
but I'm going to give myself an award.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
My therapist told me

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
my problem is

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
toxic shame.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I'm not going to feel shame by default.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
You're trying to provoke my sense of shame.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
It's like, I work hard,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
but I'm not going to defend myself.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Nobody works harder than me.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Let's bring Steve Levy out here.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Ask him how hard I work.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Steve to the Levy.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I mean, I...

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Hello.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
It was a rhetorical suggestion.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I don't even know what...

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It was like saying, let's bring the Native American out here

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
and ask about...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Let's bring him out.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Native American person.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Steve, tell Rob...

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Tell Rob...

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Tell Rob

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
your opinion of my work ethic.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
He works harder than anybody I've ever met

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
in my entire life. That's true.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
He's a fucking bargain, Hollywood.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
It's crazy.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
He's way better than anybody.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
He's the most creative person I've ever met.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
You're not doing the hype man thing right now either, right?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
No. This is actual truth.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
This is passion.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I love you.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
He said freestyle.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Put a pin in it.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Thank you. Thank you.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I have a question about the Chicago shy was not at.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
What was that beat, that awesome rap beat?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Was that you Spencer that played that one?

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
No, no. I had no idea.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
We need to get that one back because that was a goodie.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I don't have that beat.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
It's a goodie. I need to get that one on it.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Steve Levy.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Tell us about your famous

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Buttermilk Biscuits.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Oh, yeah.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Wait, is it clear that I work hard?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Are you hearing that? Does that register?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I think you work very hard

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
because our friendship

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
is falling by the way because when I call you up

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
you're always working. Yeah, there are people suffering

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
because I work too hard.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Does that make you happy

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
or does that feel like a burden to you?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I'm working through it.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I got to do more

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
work to deal with my attitude toward

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
work.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And this guy, this guy's the only guy

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
which guy?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
It's a podcast over there.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
He just insinuated that I don't work hard,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
but because I'm working in therapy

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
very hard.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
You didn't even go to therapy.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
My therapist told me.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I thought you went to the same therapist, no?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Yes, we do.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Not together.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Although that would probably be helpful.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I'm okay

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
paying for your couples therapy.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Only if we can shoot it.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I want to shoot it on video.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
It'd be in

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
the Harry McSally coach.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
For real, if I pay for it

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
would you guys go to couples therapy and film it?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
We're both paying for it already and our therapist

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
who's the same therapist, she says

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
if you want to bring someone else in

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I'm going to go in with my new

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
girlfriend just because

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
as a preemptive, it's like, whoa, let's

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
weatherproof this thing.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
And the therapist is like, yeah

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
bring anybody you want to, bring your mailman

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
in.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Would you in trouble go in the couples therapy

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
just for kicks if I pay for it?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
You don't have to pay for it.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I want to be involved in some way.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Yes.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Would you go fund me or a kickstarter or some shit?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
The only thing that would be perfect

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
that won't happen is if our

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
therapist that we see separately

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
that would be great to have her

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
on the podcast.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I know that she would never do it.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
That sounds really unethical.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
She would never do it.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
She's too professional.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I'm quite willing

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
to write the check for you two to be filmed

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
going to therapy together.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
All right. Okay, Steve

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
here's the thing.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Take a shirt off.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Just show the ladies.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
You know, we got two

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
guests that we're going to bring out.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So I just thank you for coming out

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
and bouncing off of this guy.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Are you kicking Steve Levy out the stage?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Yeah, because

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
delegation is part of the fucking daily

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
shit I have to put up with.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
This podcast, you know,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
great minds on the

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
history channel.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Rick and Morty.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Is community still

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
happening somewhere?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Is it on C-SPAN now?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I'm probably working on that.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
And I'm writing like 900

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
things.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Do you ever spend time

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Dan just smelling the roses,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
swinging in the hammock in the breeze?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Yeah, never just kick up your feet and just

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
relax. See what he's doing?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
He thinks that I'm lazy.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I'm just asking.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
How insane is that?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Dude, he thinks

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I'm lazy.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
You play a lot of Minecraft.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Dude, you guys are fucking nuts, man.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Dan, I'm on your side so far.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Rob is being an antagonist right now.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I am, I am, I am.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Dan, I'm sorry.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
I'm not proud of...

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I wrote it.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I'm not proud of the fact that I work hard

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
so I'm not defending myself

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
from these ridiculous

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
allegations.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
You do kick up your feet because

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I asked you today. You said you were going to

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
have brunch today and I said you want to go out

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
and have a drink. I'm going to go home

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
and play a little Xbox. That's you kicking up your feet.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
That's you relaxing

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
of a Sunday afternoon.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
It just needs to turn off the brain

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
for a bit.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I'm not...

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It's all the buzzing.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's very therapeutic.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Because we did bits and fought with each other,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
we didn't talk about the KKK rally in Anaheim

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
or the very important

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Apple FBI privacy issues.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
You'll have to listen to some other podcast

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
that has a little

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
more control over itself

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
to get an insight into these issues.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Google it and educate yourself.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I don't know. I don't know.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I wrote coughing and farting. Oh, that's important.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Before we bring our guests out.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
This is an important question.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Because this happened to me today.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I coughed and I farted

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
and I was with my girlfriend.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
So I was like...

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Simultaneously? Exactly at the same time?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
No, in all terms.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Was it like cough art or exactly at the same time?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Of course at the same time.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Talking to her.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It's great to be in love

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
and have respect for each other

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
and to not have our opinions

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
about each other be affected by anything.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
It happened at the same time.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
When you cough,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
your cough is loudest to you.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Your fart,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
you know you farted.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
What you don't know is if the person

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
is a foot away from you.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
If they heard the cough louder than the fart.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
So here's the dilemma.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
This is why I always go...

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
First I'm going to say what I always do

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
and then I'm going to explain why.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I always, when that happens,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I go...

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I farted when I coughed.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
The reason I do that

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
is because what if they heard it

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and I ignored it?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
You want to get in front of that news cycle?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
What if they... Yes.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
What if they heard it and they thought

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I was coughing to cover a fart

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
instead of leaving the room?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
The truth is it was an accident.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
If I had to fart, I would have left

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
the room and farted and come back.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I would never do something like that.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Be dishonest and go like...

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Are you saying the cough made you fart?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Of course the cough made me fart.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
What's the alternative to that?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
They could have been independent of each other.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
What?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
You could have coughed and farted

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
and they had nothing to do with each other.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
What are the odds of that happening?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
That's insane.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Do you...

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
cough when you fart?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
No, I...

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Do you fart separately sometimes?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I...

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I fart separately all the time

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
and cough separately.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
That's that dumb of a question then.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
You guys...

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I think of a cough as more of an

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
upper body thoracic kind of thing

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
and the farts being more of a lumbar and below.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But when you get your balls groped

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
by the doctor, he says turn left

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
and you fart on them.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
But I'm saying your balls are closer

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
to your ass than your chest.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Right.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
At least mine are.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Humble brag.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Picks or it didn't happen, Rob.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
All right.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
So when you cough, you may fart.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I can't believe this is...

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Am I going to find out I'm weird this way?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I have a little more core strength

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
than you maybe.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I won't deny that at all.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
My chiropractor's all over me about my core.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
But that probably is a thing.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
How are you and your chiropractor doing?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I'm down to once a week

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
and I'm on a vitamin D prescription.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Thanks to my doctor and everything's going great.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I've lost weight. I know it doesn't look like that.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
But...

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
and everything's doing great.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
My doctor's very happy about how my diet's going

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
and I'm doing great.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I know I look like a big, sweaty, gross slug.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And I'm saying that I...

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
when I cough, I fart.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Every time I cough, I don't fart.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
But I think it's insane.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Not all the glitters is gold.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
All right. Let's just...

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Okay. So you're coughing and farting?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Well, I think I'm... I guess we're done with that.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I just get... I feel like I don't want to...

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I just...

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
You coughed and farted in front of your new girlfriend

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and what was the upshot of that?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I wanted to know

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
because this happened today

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
and it made me remember that

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
regardless of how long I've been dating somebody,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
it doesn't matter

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
regardless of who the other person is,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I've always win that happens

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
when I cough and I fart.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Full disclosure.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I always go and I just go

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
and I have to make this decision in my head where I go,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
there's a good chance

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
that now I'm just going to be telling a person

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
that didn't want to know that I farted.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
However, to me,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
it's sort of like the legal systems philosophy

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
that's like, it's better to

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
to let ten innocent men

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
go... go... or ten guilty men

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
go free than the idea of one

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
innocent man going to prison.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
To me, it's better

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
to have nine people go like,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
why is he always telling us

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
when he farts

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
after a cough than to have

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
one person go,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
do you know that fucking guy did the other day?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
He had to fart so he faked

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
a cough.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
He didn't get up and go away.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
He thinks I'm so stupid

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
that he could just cover his farts

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
and Andy wanted me to just sit in a fart.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I don't want anyone thinking that.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
They let ten guilty men

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
They're supposed to.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
We don't really approach it that way.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
They're supposed to let

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
ten guilty men

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
go.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
That's philosophy that we learned

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
in high school.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
They should change that.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
They're trying.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Did you find out if you were busted

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
on the fart or not?

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I've done it before too

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
and she's like, why do you keep telling me

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
when that happens?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
She said, I didn't know you farted.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I said, well, I didn't know you didn't know

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
so I had to tell you.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
That makes you a good person though.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
That's what I told her.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
It also makes you a guy with no core strength.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That's true and I'm going to work on that.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Our next guests

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
you've probably seen

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
these bus stop ads

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
around for this very funny

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
new show that's being

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
drawn at a really, really cool

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
hard working animation studio

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
in Burbank called Starburns Industries.

33:11.000 --> 33:31.000
You see these little ads.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't even know. I don't even know what you're doing.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
That was the

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
the greatest

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
protest I've ever seen

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
in my life.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Totally unrelated question.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
How old are you?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Just unrelated.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Totally unrelated.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
It wouldn't be a great time for everyone

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
to just go around their room

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
and just state their age.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And then the guy that just did that

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
should go last.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And you'd be like

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Whoa!

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
That behavior

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
that really

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
you've walked the earth

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
that long.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
You've made and witnessed

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
that many mistakes.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
You got to push harder.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
What?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
You got to push harder.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
This is what you do Dan.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Excuse me.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
This is what you do Jeff.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I can't make it.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
You have to have the

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
You get the microphone real close.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
You have to have the soul

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
of a six year old.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
It's like Thor's hammer.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Like no one else can

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
fuck up.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Oh my god he's scraping.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
He's like scraping the...

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I am. I'm ruining this.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I wouldn't look it.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Obviously it's had a few

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
days. I just do this.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Alright.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Jonah Ray is going to be going

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
What the fuck man?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
What the fuck man?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Anyways

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
What the fuck man?

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I can't tell who to root for anymore.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
What the fuck man?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
What the fuck man?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
There's this really funny

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
show on HBO on 1130.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
On 1130 on Fridays.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
And it's called Animals.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
And it's all your favorite comedy people

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
doing these little sketches.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And they're drawn as these little animal people.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
And animal people.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
They're in the back going he's never seen the show.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I have not that much.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
But I know they're not animal people.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
They're animals.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I'm not going to define their show.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
They love working at Star Burns.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
They think it's amazing how hard

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I work.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I don't really talk to them.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
There's a difference between them.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Let's bring out the creators of HBO's Animals.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Mike Luciano and Phil Matarice.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Hi.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Hi everybody.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I'm Phil.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I was going to say

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
they're going to come out and sit.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And Phil's going to sit here and Mike's going to sit here.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
You nailed it.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Make that clear off the bat.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
It's easier to say Mike and Phil.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
But I just want everyone to know

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
when you see the credit it's created by

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
it's not alphabetical.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
But if you're talking to friends and everything you say

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Mike and Phil you know it's totally fine.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
If you guys commit to this glasses no glasses thing

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
there's not going to be a problem.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Like I'm always going to know from now on

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Mike, Phil, easy.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And we're also different people too.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
That's also the other part of it.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Looking at what my face looks like.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I don't know. Maybe that.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Take off your glasses

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
for a second.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Either Phil or Mike.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Now look at this shit. Come on.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Now imagine if they had the same haircut

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
which they did a week ago.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
You know what?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I don't don't. Fuck you guys.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Come on down.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I confuse people that are

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
way less identical than you guys.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I get in trouble like all the fucking time.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
This sounds like a damn problem then.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Doesn't it?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Yes it is. And I've been honest about that.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
My face?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
You guys have put up with a lot.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I should obviously.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
But I swear to God there was one time

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
when you guys were coming over

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
and we were going to go to Comic-Con.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
And I said to my then wife Erin McGathy

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I said they're going to be here in a half hour

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
you need to help me with something.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
These two guys

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
fucking look the same.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Come on, grow up and google them

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
and figure it out. And I said okay.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
And then I came back in and I said

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
come here for a second.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And I sat there and I said you fucking tell me

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
give me a mnemonic device.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
And she was like fill hat

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
because it was like a

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
south by interview or something

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
where it was like a person and it was like a perfect setup

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
because it was like so what's it like when you do the thing

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
and there's like one of you

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
in a single and it's got your name and then the other

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
and Erin went oh boy.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But she was like

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
for Pride's sake she was like well

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Phil's ears are

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
farther up.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Yup, that's it.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
And whatever she said

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
we did say

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
she was like okay

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
fuck it was something with the ears

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
and whatever it was I swear to god

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I'm not doing it as a bit like you guys showed up

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
and I looked at ears

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
and we had ear muffs on.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Hi Dan.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
And based on ears like did this thing

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
where I was like this is Mike and you went I'm Phil.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And the ear thing

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
alright so that's the end of my story.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
The glasses thing is fucking great.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
This is good. You gotta keep them on baby.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Alright so for me

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
it's Phil right? I'm Phil.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
You're Phil. Phil

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
you look a little bit more like Andy Garcia

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
than Mike.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Thank you so much.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
That's how I'm gonna go along with that one for now.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
You look a little bit more like Jewish Hans Gruber.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Okay.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I'm not Jewish but I'll take it.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
You're not Jewish but I'll take it.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
That fucks me up because you guys both look like

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Jewish Hans Gruber.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I'll take it back. You're Andy Garcia

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
you're not Andy Garcia.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Let's talk about it. Thank you Jeff.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Thank you Phil. Right?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
See? Yeah.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I'm writing in my notes. Phil.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
He's got it.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Phil Andy Garcia.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Because when I walk in a room they're always both there

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
so I always go well if it isn't Mike and Phil.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
That's good.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Bring it in. That's real good.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It's in no particular order.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Enough about that. Let's talk about

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
you guys. How important is it

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
to be a writer especially in animation

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
to have a beard?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I think it's a necessity. You have to.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Am I the only guy in Hollywood

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
that doesn't have a beard?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
It's the reason why I don't want to get up in the morning

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
to write is because I can't grow a good beard.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I grow a very patchy Johnny Depp.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Who is that Asian guy

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
in the red carpet who had the worst patchiest

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
beard of all time? I grow that kind of beard.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Stucky Chan.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
If I grow sexy beard

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
would I be a better writer?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Is the question I have.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Yes. Yes.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Says Dave Plein who has a giant beard.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Alright, so like what was it

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
a year and a half ago?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
You guys had this thing on the internet.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Animals, dry comedy

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
like eight frames per hour

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
in terms of like

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
glacial. Because it's just like

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
drawing of animal doing setup

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
like doing kind of like

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
very organic and kind of improv style.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I'm going to get a soda.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
He's so jealous because there's people that draw

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
up here.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I mean I'm just sitting here and it's hot.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm going to get a soda. No offense.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
None to.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Come back though. I'll come back

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
quietly and I won't interrupt.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I get it. No, I get it.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Got the old Harmontown standbys up here.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Then these two young guys

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
walk in. So it all for

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
a loop. I'm sorry, I'm not

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
kumail you guys.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
No, me.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
We have an special too though.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
If you're all very quiet.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
If you're all very quiet.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
You can see something you very rarely see in nature.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
What?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
The Rob Schrab going out to get a soda.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Right.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
To be an artist and to invoke

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
the Schrab passive aggression is like

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
that strongman belly ring.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Right to the top.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
He wouldn't be intimidated if he just doodled

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
something on an African. He was

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
like fuck, what am I doing with my wife?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I'm going to go to...

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Two baby, that's good.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
But you guys are self starters.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
You're like the weekend, the guy.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Not the two day.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
The one guy.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
This is post internet

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
like these guys on the internet

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
do the thing. Now it's really is the way

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
it works. Like you guys are self starting

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
internet dudes. Like you started

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
doing this thing as it is on the internet

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
following your passion. Making yourself laugh.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Channel 101. Then went to

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Channel 101.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
New York baby. Then went to

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
New York take. What was it

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
the New York TV Festival? Yeah.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Where Mitch Hurwitz was like you guys are

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
awesome. Duplass brothers were like

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
you guys are awesome.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
What is Mitch's steak now?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
He did a voice

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
in two episodes. He's

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
my dad in an episode. But he...

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Does he like... Do you guys have to send

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
money from the budget to the show?

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
To him? No. He's got nothing

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
to do with it anymore. We partnered with the Duplass

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
bros. So those guys are

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
executive producers and how we were able

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
to make a bunch of episodes independently

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
for like a year

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
before we partnered with Starbucks to finish it

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
out and sell it to HBO.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
And we just gave you a little home to keep you off the street.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
You did. And I think it's nice that I

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
don't do anything on your show. I think it's

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
kind of cool because we just kind of passed in the halls

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and especially when Rick and Morty was there too it's

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
just like... I don't know it's a little gang.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah. It was lovely. And you see me and you go

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
boy there's Dan

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
like he doesn't... He's not going to come

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
in here and tell us how to draw an animal. Yeah.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Well that wouldn't be any of my business.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Yeah. I'm not lazy.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
No you're not. You're there late

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
and I've seen you there very early

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
from like the night before. It seems

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
like Dan you're a little hands-off on the show.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
I mean you don't know.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
That's a good thing. It's a good thing.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
He came up to us. I thought

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
you were a workaholic. I thought that was your gimmick.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
You care too much.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
You work too hard. Well the first

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
time he came up to us he rolled up his sleeves and

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
he was like what can I do that? I did.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I did. I did. A sandwich.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And then you know... I did have that meeting with

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
you guys. He doesn't...

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I don't know. He's cool. He's nice.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
But then I didn't see him for a long time.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Is Dan a permanent PA here? Dan doesn't

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
have sleeves. Dan's never had sleeves.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah. But did you

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
remember that conversation? Because we talked

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
for a half hour and I was like these guys seem like cool guys.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
You already had it. They're already

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
guys in the building. It's like a different relationship.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
It's like you guys said like the Duplass brothers

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
were like you guys should do your thing. They were

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
your benefactors and you guys tried as hard

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
as you could to do it literally by yourselves.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And then it was like holy shit we're going to go insane.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
So it's just really

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
they're more tenets. It's not like

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
they're not a brain child

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
of Starbucks. A building

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
where they get to work. But

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
nevertheless

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
because I love creativity

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and because I'm sort of a...

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I'm just a wonderful person.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So good. And because you never know

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
you guys could give me a job one day.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I don't have no idea. That's what Hollywood's

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
about. You don't

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
say no to anything like bringing in my office.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I said if there's ever anything

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I can do and you guys are really great

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
but you've never needed anything.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
No not really.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I mean part of why are we with you guys.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
It's a building.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
When we went around

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
to try to like find the animation

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
studio that was going to help us because initially

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
we made the first two episodes of our show

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
that just aired on TV

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
two weeks ago. Literally in an apartment

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
that Phil and I lived with.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Four weeks ago and it started whatever it was.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
And I would listen to Harmontowns when I was

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
making it. So it's very bizarre to be up here.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
It was really sweet.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It's a weird thing.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Shut up you.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I know you.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I listen to Harmontowns.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I'm on the subreddit.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
You're not going to take this away from me.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I work too hard for this.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Oh my god. Mike Luciano

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
was the first person to realize

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
that Adam Goldberg is in the audience.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm Phil.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
You called me Mike.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Phil is Andy Garcia.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Phil is Andy Garcia.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Mike is Neil Berkeley.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
You see what you did?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Mike Neil Berkeley, Phil Andy Garcia.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
This is the problem that keeps happening.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
My mnemonic device keeps being

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
the guy that doesn't look like

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
a Phil is the Phil.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
And I keep flipping it forward.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
So I look like a Phil?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I read it and it was like, you look like a Mike.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Thank you.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Phil is an asshole name.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Every dumb dad or every fucking fool

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
in a commercial is named Phil.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
It's kind of hack.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I named Phil as hack.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
It's like a main character named Phil.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Now Dan, just invert that in your mind.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
He's the non-intuitive Phil.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
That's your connection now.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I mean the original thing.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
I started panicking that first meeting.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I remember I was looking at your shoes

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
and I saw you were wearing nikes.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
What are the odds he'll continue

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
to wear nikes?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
And then they fucking like...

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
We go all crazy.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Because obviously it's the first thing that happens

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
when you get successful.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
You're like, how many shoes can I get?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Exactly.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I have so many shoes.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I am Novi Orish.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
So I'm trying to buy up the whole shoe store.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Mike and Phil, how do you guys know each other?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
What's your origin story?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Weekends, nights.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
It's sort of snowballed.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
And what's the dynamic between the two of you?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
One guy is the more of the dry guy

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
and one guy is the over-the-shoulder comedy guy.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
A lot of attention, generally.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Just a friendship tension.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
What did you say? Oh, tension.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Who's the Schrab and who's the harmless?

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I'm the Schrab and I wouldn't say he's the

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
harm necessarily because I want to be the harm.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Yeah, I do the drawing.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Mike does the editing

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
of the dialogue

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
because it's improvised our show.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
So that's actually a huge

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
or it's like a big

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
big step, I would say.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
And we write it. We write everything together.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
We write all the episodes.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Do you guys ever fight? Do you guys have tension

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
in the edit bay?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
We're writing season two now and that's the most

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
difficult part.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
So much of writing is sitting there

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
quietly resenting the other person

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
for not agreeing with everything you're saying.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It's so fundamentally

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
how do you like, how do you experience?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I heard you and Justin

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
at that one live record.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
That was amazing. That made me feel so good

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
knowing that you guys like eating each other too.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Not to pull rank in a

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
format sense, but this is essentially a sketch

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
show. I know you guys do

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
larger things, but like fucking

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
story breaking.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
It's an exercise

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
in frustration. It's an Asperger friendly

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
format.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
When I say Asperger friendly,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I don't mean that it's like it causes

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
joy.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
You have to have an attention surplus

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
to story break.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
If you have an attention deficit and I'm not

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
saying that anyone clinically does,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Justin!

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Did you just fart two times?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I just farted.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Why are you fucking farting?

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
But Justin is like,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
you guys have hung out with Justin.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
His genius is from

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
his fucking like, he cannot

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
get bored so quickly.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
He gets so bored.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
He's a bored guy.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Rob Schratz back everybody. Welcome back, Rob.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Rob, do you want to tell us briefly about

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
your adventures while you were away?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I got a

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
delicious, actually incredibly

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
refreshing, sprite drink

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
from the concession

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
area over there.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
They offered not to

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
let me

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
pay for it, but I gave them

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
a tip anyway. That was fun.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
And then I saw

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Ovid Gaith there. We shook hands.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I think Ovid had a

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
thing, like I invited him to the show

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
because he had a thing you wanted to talk about.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Oh, you farted.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
That was gross to see that this close.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
When you burp, do you also pee?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
What happens?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
What happens?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I hide in a three stooge's bathroom.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Not everything is connected to a lateral

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
thing. I don't always

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
fart when I cough.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
We're trying to find out how the plumbing works.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Doesn't everyone

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
every once in a while, while you're

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
coughing, fart? Isn't that something

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
that happens?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
My question was

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
when that happens and you're

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
one foot from someone

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
what is your, like

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
do you say? If you cough and

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
fart, you should disclose that I

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
farted so you're not trying to bury the lead

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
on that one. I think you're being a good

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
person for that. But sometimes

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
the context can come in

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
like you could be on a first date, like

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
just try not to cough, I guess.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Coughs are dangerous.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
But you know at first dates

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
what am I talking about?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Fucking first date, if that's what's going to

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
happen.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
That was

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
the chair, that was the chair.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Who's chair? Now you do the first

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
thing, the first thing you go, I swear to God

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
no, baby!

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Wait, what am I

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
curious about with the animals?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
What kind of animals do you get?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
This is what I'm curious about as a writer

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
because I've seen the show,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
a lot of these people probably see the show.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
How many people have actually seen it?

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Cool, great, thank you.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
That's not enough.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
For the listeners that only are hearing

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
this podcast out on audio,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
more people raise their hands than clap.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I didn't specify so

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
much.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
What I am curious about because it's got that

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
very organic style, there's obviously

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
clearly a lot of improv happening,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
and I'm very curious because you guys have all these

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
A-list comedy people coming in

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
to the Starburns recording booth

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
in beautiful downtown Burbank.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
What A-listers?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Aziz Ansari, Chelsea Peretti,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Molly Shannon, Jessica Chastain,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Danny McBride,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Minzoopis, yeah, Kroll.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
John Lovitz is a good friend

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
of mine now.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Yeah, great friend.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
He's got to come on this show.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
He's so awesome, dude.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
He was unbelievable.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Thank you, buddy.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
So the question is, are you going to kill me?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You're like,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
barely too drunk.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
There's a contentiousness coming from

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
that general vicinity.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Go ahead, sorry.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It's magnified though when you're under lights

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
and you hear voices from out there,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
it...

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
that dynamic adds

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
10 pounds of content.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Yeah. Oh, so maybe I'm hearing it wrong.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Because you always are thinking like,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
why am I talking to a microphone if you hear anybody

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
could be going like, I'm diabetic

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
and I'm going into shock right now or something like that.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
If you just hear a voice, you're like, hey, fuck you, lady.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Shut the fuck up.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Um, because you just hear the word

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
shock and you're like, shock? Fuck you.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I don't care about your politically correct bullshit.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
What do you want to trigger warnings?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
I was like, no, I need insulin.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Shock and awe.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I shouldn't have done that.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I want to finish one.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Because I had an actual, this is the first for me.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I have an actual question for people

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I'm interviewing that I'm actually interested in.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Because I really want to know...

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Rob, how's your sprite?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Is it delicious? Yeah, it's really good.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
So good. It looks really good.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It's still chilled. Cold and refreshing?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I prefer it in the aluminum can.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I'm more of a 7-up guy, but you like sprite?

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I prefer 7-up,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
but it's just not as common as you prefer 7-up.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
You prefer 7-up?

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Here's something that I noticed

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
on a... who's that guy?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Liv Shriver.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
What's this guy?

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Liv Shriver.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Do you know who I'm talking about?

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Liv Shriver.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
He always looks put off.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
He came out and he went...

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Because he said...

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
We lost Dan.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
We lost Dan to Rob.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I wasn't even going to bring it up because

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
it was such a nuanced thing because

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Liv Shriver came out and I said to Cody

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I was watching the Oscars because

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Liv Shriver said like...

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Production design is very important

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
in Hollywood and when he said it

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
his face looked like he really...

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
the reason he was saying it is like,

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I don't get why.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It was a pet peeve of his.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Like as if he was saying like...

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Misogyny is

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
as American as Apple Pie.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Like he was making a...

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
He was being upset.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Like production design is...

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
He was like...

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Liv Shriver has something going on with him.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
He's very put off.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Maybe he's nearsighted and he's having trouble with the prompters.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
It could be. But I also...

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Benicio del Toro looking amused

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
is the most terrifying he's ever looked

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
which could be the secret of this thing.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
He goes like, oh god, that's not good Benicio.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
We caught him tonight

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
because they did a prep bit with a bear

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
and they cut back to him and he was like...

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And it was like, oh,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Benicio, mystery

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
gone.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Do you think he thought it was like

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
a Wolfman reference?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And he was like...

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
He's an actor. He thought

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
what does a cat think when you run the can opener?

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
He thought

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
he thought there's food

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
and he's like...

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Or are there any actors in the audience?

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I'm sorry.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
You were making a point just before that.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
No, I wanted to interview

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
our fucking guests.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
One question.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
This is not a tangent.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
The reason I was talking about what is this?

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Liv?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
He looks like he smells like

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Cherry Seven Up.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
He looks

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
like he smells like it?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
He looks like he smells like Cherry Seven Up.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I haven't been next to him,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
so I look at him on TV

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
and it's like he might smell like Cherry Seven Up.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
They do that. Let's exercise.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
They do it at art school.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I want you to draw something that looks

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
like it smells like something.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Mr. Straub, what are you...

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Do you have

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
do you have something better to do

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
than draw

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
something that smells like something?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
What is it you're drawing?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Let's just share it

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
with the class!

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
It's a perfect drawing.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
He's drawing robots!

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
It's Liv Schreiber to a T.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Man,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
it's so weird being inside of a Harmontown

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
and just having it happen around you.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
My question was

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
when you guys

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
and I

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
because there's

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
it's a ton of organic

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
improvised kind of material

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
you guys have both parties in a booth

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
if you're doing a two person scene, right?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
They go back and forth and we're in it too.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
What do the scripts look like when they're ready to be recorded?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
It's like 12 to 15 pages

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
and it has

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
just general scene breakdowns

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
and then like a few sentences

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
for each beat that we need to get to

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
and then also with kind of an idea of maybe

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
the joke that needs to be handed

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Yeah, we'll tell them at the front and sit down with them.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
This is what happens. You're a tiny turtle

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
and then a mechanical frog

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
which we've heard rumors about

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
maybe that's probably similar to what a curb your enthusiasm

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Yeah, that's what we heard.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Mark Duplass was on the league

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
and that show is very similar in that kind of case

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
so he was able to transpose a lot of stuff

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
from that entire show.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
But yeah, we're in the booth. That's one of the

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
main selling points of Star Burns

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I think in general is you guys have the biggest booth

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
which is so

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
insane. We've had

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
eight people in there recording at once

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
How big is the booth?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Like from the stage

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
even bigger than that, probably from that thing to that

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Damn, that's a big booth

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
That's why she got a big booth, y'all

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
That is a big booth

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
That is a big

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
booth

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
You know why? Cause I

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
in my biopic when I'm starting

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
my studio and I'm going like

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I want the booth to be big and they're like

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
well, then the sound kept really good. Sound is everything

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Podcasts are everything

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
We need a podcast friendly booth

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Put politicians in on wheels

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
if the people need to be compressed

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
and I want these rivets to be

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
flush, flush, flush, flush

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
The best booth in the fucking city

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
What actor is playing you?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
What country or

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Caprio, so he did an accent to make sure

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
he's nominated for something

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Even though I'm not

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Southern, he just had to add

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
something. Did Leo win?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
He did? He won Best Actor for Revenant

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Also, who gives a

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
shit? That's true too

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Fuck him. So Tom Hardy must be pissed off

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
He's like, I did the exact same thing

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
he did for an entire movie

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Who

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I'm Best Director?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
In utero, whatever

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Really? Yeah

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Who was it? Revenant, dude

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Revenant, dude

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
You said racist earlier

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
and now you said Mexican and you've got a

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Southern handsome Latino vibe to you

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I appreciate it

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Thank you

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Who won the Best Director?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Oh, Alejandro

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Is it the Revenant? Yes

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
He did the

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
What else did he do?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I'm pointing at the Latino guy

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
What did your friend do?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
He's getting up

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I got something here to say

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
How does Mad Max get

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Best Production Designer

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Best Sound, Best Editing

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Sweeps Everything

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And the guy that told all those people to do that

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
The Director doesn't get Best Director

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
How the fuck does that happen?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Good point

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Because you're still accountable if people think you're a prick

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
So watch it

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Good point too

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
I thought George Miller was a prick

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I thought I would get a laugh

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Fuck you

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
You just saw what a producer is

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
and what a director is

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Very true

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Very true

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
What's the other movie?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Birdman

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Goddamn it

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Birdman Gravity

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
He's awesome

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Gravity sucks

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Don't get me fucking going on

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I think there needs to be a new stereotype

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
about Mexican directors

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Is Alma Duvara's

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Mexican right?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Or is he Spanish?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Okay

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
New stereotype

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Let's start it

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Mexicans, great directors

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
They have an extra muscle in their eyeball

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
A lot of

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Mexico sending a lot of the rapist directors up here

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Yes

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Mexicans, great directors

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And I'm sure some of them are nice people

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
A lot of rapists

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
They have to put a director-sized hole in a wall

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
around a mess

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
There used to be a director-shaped hole

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I'm going to build a beautiful lens

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It's going to be a very, very, very good lens

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I'm going to talk to the best lens makers ever

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And I'm a negotiator

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I've done a very good job

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I've made lenses for things

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I've gotten awards for their scene

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Is this Leo DiCaprio playing this character too?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Yes, I'm a Leo DiCaprio

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
in Trump

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Oh my god

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I'm going to very, very do the thing

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Spencer, who would you cast

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
as Dan Harmon in the Dan Harmon biopic

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
If you had anybody you wanted

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
All the budget

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You know

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I think

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Robert Downey Jr.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Just go with the obvious choice

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
There's no shame in going with the obvious choice

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Stop being a producer for one second

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
He just seems to go with

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
RDJ if it works

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Mike and Phil, who would you cast

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
as Dan Harmon

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
if you had to make a biopic

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
If you had anybody you wanted

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You know

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
For people who have an improvised show

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
We should have had a joke

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Ready at hand

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
We can edit ourselves back

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Let's bring it into your wheelhouse

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
What animals should I play when I do your show

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's got to be New York City based

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Probably a dog

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Like Golden Doodle

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Yeah, that'd be fun

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Spiritually I am

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Not that this would make a funny sketch

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Just to make me a sea otter

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
They float on their back

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And they eat food on their stomach

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And they're just like

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Shilling

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But they don't build dams

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
They're almost beavers, but they don't work that hard

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And they're just like

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
What's that?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
When they have sex, they grab on to the female's nose

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And rip off their nose sometimes

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Wow

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I hate when that happens

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Otters do that

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
They rip off their

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Women snout

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Right

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
They should stop swimming and just

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Fuck

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Put that shit on dry land

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
You know what I'm saying

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Swim to shore

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Don't have to be

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Biting on the nose, it should get on the beach

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Do that otter

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Swimming

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Swim fuck

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Get on the beach

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Rob has a fight in the stand-up set

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Y'all biting the nose

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Get on the beach and fuck

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Why are you

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Fucking in the water

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Get on the beach and fuck

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
We didn't have more

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Out of nose

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Per capita

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I think Rob's got the part

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Make him an otter

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Rob just hit for the otter

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I'll be a golden doodle

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Anything else

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
You guys want to pump out

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
There's another guy

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I gotta get up here

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Let's watch

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It's on HBO Go

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It's on HBO Now

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It comes out a day before Fridays

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So every Thursday

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
If you're at work or whatever

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
There's a new episode out

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And I think our show's gonna have to be

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
A word of mouth sort of thing

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So the more

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
We just need cool people

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
To tell other cool people about it

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
But we're not getting enough

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Stop, it's not for old people

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It's for young people

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
They get two seasons if they get three

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
That's helpful for everybody

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
It is a really funny show

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And it's like everybody having fun

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And it's awesome

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And we get to hire all these awesome

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Cool people who all have their fingerprints

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
On the show and we all get to work

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Music people too, we got Curvile

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Sapprocky

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So it's a fun eclectic mix

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
What style of animation is it?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
How are you doing it?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
We're doing it in harmony

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
People call it like lo-fi

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Because the mouths don't move or anything

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And it's kind of stop-motion-y

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
In a way, but it's a really weird

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Eclectic mix

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Some of our backgrounds are photo-realistic

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Looking, it's a mixture of

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
High art and low art

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Hi

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Little on the nose

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Little on the nose

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It was a little on the nose

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It was a little on the nose

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Thank you

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Thanks so much guys

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Thank you guys

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It's on

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It's on

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Slightly earlier on HBO Go

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And then that drives traffic

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
To the HBO Go Plus

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Turn style

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Which makes a wheel spin

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Which I think Universal then makes a chicken

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
You get a free dope

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Pop quiz

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Who was the one sitting closer to you?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Okay, I got to flip it

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Okay

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
It was

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
This was Phil

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You did it

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But I had to flip it three times to remember it

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It's not about me being a bad person

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I just

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
My therapist had stopped

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
My therapist told me

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
You back yourself into a corner

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Because that's where you have won

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Your greatest victories

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Because you were

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
In your youth were in an environment

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Where you were back into a corner

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
For real

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And nobody else around you understands

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Because they look at you and they go

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
That's a six foot tall fucking bear guy

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Like that has no that no one wants

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
To do anything bad to

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And from their perception

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
You're just a dick

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Because when I

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I'm going like I'm using

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I'll actually like pull people

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I'll trick them into like cornering me

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And then I'll go

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I'm in a corner, thanks for joining me

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
What? And I got blood all over my face

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And everyone's like you're such a dick

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And I'm like are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I was outnumbered

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And they're like no you dragged them into a corner

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That's what a serial killer does

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I'm going I'm working through it

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
With therapy I'm realizing all this

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Now I'm crying every week

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I'm crying every week

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Are you crying happy or

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Crying sad?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Just fucking like what is

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Beyond that Jeff that's the

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Binary heteronormative shit

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
My fucking tears are just

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Tear fucking energy

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Is it epiphanic tears?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It's like it's all of the above

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's like oh shit she's right

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Tears like it's a you're not happy

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Or sad you're like fucking that's it

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Dan I cry like

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Three times a week

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Fag

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Our next guest

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Is gay

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Who has never cried

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Until Dan just said that

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Uh

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You guys

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Don't react

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I'm not going to make you corner me

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I'm just going to say

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
You're dumb for not laughing at that

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
That's my judgment of you

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Put yourselves in your...

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Alright

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Alright so

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
He almost certainly ruined that

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Our uh

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
What's what

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Is Abed here Abed are you here

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Abed Gheith

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Okay

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Oh Abed

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Abed I haven't seen you in a while

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
You're looking

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Because I don't have a job and I'm broke

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Well okay well

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
It's not above everyone else

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I have some of your delicious vodka

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Yes of course

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
You and I are always like

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Well I don't want to insult you by saying this

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I think me slightly more

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
But you and I are always fluctuating

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Like I never know when I see you

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
You said last time that I lost weight

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Which was very flattering

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Maybe every time I see you I just think you look good

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Oh thank you well you look good too

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Actually you're looking great

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
This is real Abed

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But don't let the name fool you

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I feel like the character I made

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
For a community is more dimensional

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That's my new laugh

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
When's the last time we hung out

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It was a while ago

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I just needed to siphon off some character points

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And I went off to NBC

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Should I sit next to Rob

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Or is that we need a buffer zone

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I think this is fine

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
How are you doing

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
After not being the dictator

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Of Cuba

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
No I mean

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Hey

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Hey what

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
What

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It's like a siphon reaction

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I was going to say

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I lost weight

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And then I was like

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I need a cool look that makes me attractive

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And I was like

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I don't like my head

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
And I was like

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I was like I need something

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So I decided

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I decided

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I did something

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I have this hat from this thing I made

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Called the Pop

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Shot Spider Gluto

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Well you take off your hat

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I want to see your

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
You got me

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
You got me

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
So you're saying

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
You do look good with the hat

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
But how do you

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
What are your feelings about

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Because I've been friends with Schrab for 30 million years

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
30 million

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Really long time

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Schrab started

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
When I met him

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Schrab was

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
He was a bald guy

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
But he was young

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And through my friendship with him

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I actually became

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I didn't even realize

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The attention

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
We're paying and how it feels

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And all the different perspectives

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And so I'm curious

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Like you're wearing a hat

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Because you're saying like

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I look better with the hat on

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And it's because the fact that you're bald

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Is covered or because the hat is

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
A better looking thing than hair

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
In the 40's everyone wore hats

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And so bald people kind of

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Look like everyone else

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And I want to look like everyone else

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Like I want to be attractive and cool

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
People with hair

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
What the fuck is happening

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
This is like

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I feel like we're in therapy right now

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
But I mean like it's a crazy reunion

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I'm gonna pay for this for you to go to therapy

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
This is not fair, this is like the therapy hour

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I want to look like everybody else

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I want to be attractive

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Sometimes you meet somebody

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And they go oh you're bald

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
You're inadequate

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
If I have the hat

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And I just go

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
This is everything

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
You've ever wanted

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Look man

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Karma fucking happens

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And like

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You got 10 minutes before I have to go to Kate's show

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So make it good

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Let's wrap this up

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Make it fun for somebody

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Let's put a pin in the hat conversation

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Because it's like

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Obviously when we watched

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
What was that guy in the bus of love

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
The fucking like heavy metal guy

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yes

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
There's like certain personalities

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That we see where they have like a scarf

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And it's like Jesus Christ

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
This guy wants to make us

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Think he's not bald

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
But that's different from wearing like a Clark Kent

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Like fucking like from an era

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
When everyone I tried doing that

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I tried doing that and then I think

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Justin said dude you look like a douchebag

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
He's like don't be that guy

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
That comes with that hat

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I was like oh shit he's right

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I want to try as hard as I can to not care about physical things

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
But I guess I mean

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You look great

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Shit

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I'm super psyched

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Maybe it is the Castro thing

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You look like a

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Like a young Middle Eastern Hemingway

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Like I

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I'll take it

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I would read a novel that you wrote

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Alright so Abid you're on a high

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
So I brought you here

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And you texted me

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
You had a birthday recently

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
That was Justin's idea by the way

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Did you have a birthday party?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I told him the story

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And then he goes text Dan

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Tell him about it

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Tell Justin

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I promised him that I would give him credit

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I just want credit for

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Inspiring you

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
You texted me and said

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
What's Jeff doing over there?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I'm ordering a beer

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
So I didn't go to your birthday party

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Apologies you had a karaoke place

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It was interesting

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
You're down the street

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Because Ridley came

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah but it's like there's a lot of

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
There's construction

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
On that street

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I've never seen you sing a karaoke

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But it's a new environment

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
There's a lot of weirdos there

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
You would probably be uncomfortable

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I'm sure

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
People will be judging you

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
On your song choice

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Well

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Dan is pretty

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
You do well in karaoke

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
You have some wheelhouse songs

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
He does a great George Michael

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
His faith is fucking unbelievable

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I'm a big fan of that version

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You texted me

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And you said

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Is Jeff going to be on the show

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
On Sunday

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And you said

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
He was at my birthday party

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And I think it would make a good story

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And I said

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Why don't you come down to the show and talk about it

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I didn't want to hear anything about it

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I texted Jeff and said

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Abed's coming to the show

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
He said some shit went down

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And Jeff was like that's going to take a minute to talk about

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
But Abed trying to explain something

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Is Abed at his most

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Societally

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Especially if Rob Schrab is on stage

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
What has happened

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I totally forgot

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
He's going to be here

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I've drawn a frame

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Here's Abed explaining

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I know nothing about this

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Some shit went down

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It was crazy

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I was super drunk first of all

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The first moment when we started

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
That party at the Holiday Inn

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Shout out

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And Jeff comes in

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Shout out to Burbank

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
This show is about Burbank

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
So Jeff comes in

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
And I'm excited that he came

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I've been trying to get Jeff to come to the show

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
For a while

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
There's some insane characters there

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
There's a guy

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
He dresses like Bono

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And he only does Bono songs

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And then there's a guy that's got a giant beard

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Like a white beard

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And he's a coal miner guy

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And he sings cowboy songs

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And it's like waiting for Guffman

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
You just got to see these people

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Or true stories

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Or people who just dress

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Like people that sing like those people

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's fun

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
It's a fun time

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I've been to so many videos of these people

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And these people exist

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I've seen the videos of these people

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Which karaoke place is this?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
It's Holiday Inn in Burbank

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
It's Friday nights at 9

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Is it hardcore or is it just weird?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
There's all these regulars and they all go

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Are they hardcore about it?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Are they good singers?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And they're all dressing up like the characters

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So it's like one of those places

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Where you're like this is hardcore karaoke

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
These are regulars

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I go because I never know what I'm going to see

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And I jump into the midst

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You set the scene

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
This is the Nazi Germany of Schindler's List

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Here comes the story now

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Take us further in

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
You're setting it up so big

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So anyway

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
We started off at the top

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Which is a cool bar

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And then we went down the cool glass elevator

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And we go, it's like a Willy Wonka situation

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And then we go into the actual

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Where they're doing the karaoke

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
This is just a yelp review

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
This is what happens to you when you

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Any consumer that goes to these places

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You have to go through the motions

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
So then we're there and it's like

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
There's nobody there, I'm all excited

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
All my friends are going to sing

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
We're going to have a blast

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
The night's starting off good

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
And people are buying me drinks because it's my birthday

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Can you tell us how old you are?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Oh man, alright, I'm 37

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I'm old

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It's the new 27

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You thought I was 27, thank you

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
No, I said it's the new 27

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
But if you told me you were 27

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Look at your thick black fucking marker beard

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
A girl at that karaoke said I was 26

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
So that's pretty

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
She probably didn't see that you were bald

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
She would have thought you were 900,000 years old

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I was wearing the hat

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Shucks, you got me

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Well, so then

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
No, I got Schrab, I'm not trying to hurt you

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I'm trying to hurt Schrab

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I feel like you should be cutting in more

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
He's like, is he alright?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
He'll find, you're doing...

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
So anyway, the night is going great

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I can't remember what song I put in

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I always have three songs in my pocket

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
One of these I'm going to do

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Like literally?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I think about what I'm going to sing

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
But you're patting your pocket

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I'm showing you that

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
But you mean in your head

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Yeah, there's nothing in your pocket

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
How did your pocket...

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I write down the song

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
He means he writes down three that he has ready to go

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
You actually write them down on a slip of paper

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Weird, weird

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
That's how it works

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Already weird

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Are you being sarcastic? Because I do think that's weird

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It is weird

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
You have to write them down on a slip of paper

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Before you get there

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I'm asking him

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I had one from last time

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I didn't do

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Prove to me right now that you don't have a song in your pocket

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I wrote the same pants

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Got me, I didn't wash them

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Is there a chance of the song

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Is there a chance of the song at large

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
In your pocket right now?

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
No, there's not

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
There might be one in my wallet, but I don't want to look

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I just wanted a record that was important for me to focus in on

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
That thing, because it's an important detail

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Callie, you're saying, oh yeah, you have to write

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
That was the chair

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's all karaoke

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
You have to write it on a slip of paper

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
You're saying you literally

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
You had unsung songs

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Written on slip of karaoke

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
In case I get stumped

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
And I need something like a reserve

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I got it there

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Like the teletype in tonight's Askers

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Could be the best thing, could be the worst

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I can't even tell

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
At least you're innovating

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I've been doing that karaoke place for five weeks

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
And everyone's good

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I'm trying to like

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I'm trying to compete with these people

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
So I'm really trying to like bring my A game

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And so I have reserves, because I'm like

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Oh, maybe I'll do better on Happy Together

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Maybe Super Call of Fragileistic XBI

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Docious will be better

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Always, always a fucking doozy

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Yeah, that's always a doozy

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
That one's hard, dude

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You squeeze off a little Mary Poppins

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
In a fucking hardcore karaoke place

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
So you practice these songs at home?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
No, I mean, I love Mary Poppins

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So you memorize this song?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Yeah, I mean, that song will never leave me right now

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
No, fuck that, never, never

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
No, come on

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Call of Fragileistic XBI will be better

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Is this really writing a trocious?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I'm not gonna do it

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Please stop doing it

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Please stop, don't ever do that again

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So anyway, I keep getting distracted here

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So I'm

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I'm excited

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I think I put in Nina Cherry's Buffalo Stance

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Oh nice

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
This is one of my favorite

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Because rap is easy, you can just rap

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
You don't have to sing good

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
It's not always easy

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But you can just be like

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I mean

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
You're

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Nice try

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I mean, rap is like

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I'm this guy, I'm doing this

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Here I go, bubba blue

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
We were at karaoke in New York

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And we rented one of those rooms

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And New York karaoke gets more

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Lost in translation

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
It's New York and it's compressed

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
You go to places and it's more

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Or OG Asian style

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Or a little, you're in a tiny room

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And there was a

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
There was a young lady that came

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It was a friend of a friend

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
And she had clearly

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
This is the first time I ever saw somebody

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It was like, oh well you've prepped this

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You've practiced doing karaoke before

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And this is like your hits

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Oh she could have been fucking wrapped the fuck out of it

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
She did like a Buster Rhyme song

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
She did a Buster Rhyme song

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
But she fucking nailed it

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
That's a new way to have fun

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Never looked at the words, knew it the whole time

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I got you all in check, that one

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I don't know

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It doesn't matter

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I don't know why I was saying it doesn't matter

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I interrupted, continue your story

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I think I went up pretty early

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Is he alright?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I think Schrab has to go see us

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Schrab had a hard out

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
You know the story, alright

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I'll tell you later buddy

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
He's been disruptive

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I love him, I love him

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I love him

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I love him

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I love him

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I love him

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I love him

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
I love him

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I love him

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I love him

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I love him

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I love him

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I love him

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I love him

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I love him

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I love him

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I love him

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Now I want him to leave every week

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I can use to sing Sheng Oldleg Zined with Rob Schrab

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Xavier with Rob Juding

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
It's very exciting

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Old Rob Schrab

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Old Rob Schrab

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Old Rob Schrab

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Old Rob Schrab

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.440
You guys are more excited when he left than when he came, it's like funny.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.840
I hate to see him leave, but I love to watch him walk away.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.320
Poor Rob, he's great, he's great, we love him.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:08.760
I'm just trying to have his back, so anyway, I was, I think I did do Nina Cherry, you signed

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.760
up?

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.920
I think I did do Nina Cherry, and like, you know, it was exhausting, it's like six minutes,

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:13.920
so I'm up there just fucking moving.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.520
Buffalo Stance, Buffalo Stance will take it out of you, man.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.760
No, she's got a lot of, she does a lot of rap, but then she's got that hook, what's

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.760
the hook?

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.760
What is she like?

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:28.680
Oh, the hook is, who's looking good today, who's looking good in every way, like don't

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.680
mess with me.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.680
That's a fun one.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.960
And I'm not a girl, so I'm singing it like a girl, so it's fun, you know, I'm having

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960
fun.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960
Alright.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960
I'm trying to be fun.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960
Anyway, so I did my song.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960
Hashtag singing like a girl.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.200
Yeah, I'm singing like a girl.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:44.120
Anyway, I did my song, it's fine, whatever, we, you know, I think, I can't remember who

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.120
came after me.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.120
I did it to great acclaim, I think, I think the crowd was quite pleased.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.120
Okay.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.200
Yeah, I heard you talking on the video, and you were, you were like going, oh, look

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.200
at all of it go.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200
Like, oh yeah.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.880
Well, I was all, I was on board.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.880
Alright.

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.880
So, alright.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.880
Big fan, yeah.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:23:59.880
Carry up your place.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:00.880
Had a fun time.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880
You did it?

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880
I came off stage, having a great time.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.880
The night is going great.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:06.600
And then I think I saw Jeff, like they called your name, right?

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.600
No.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.600
They never called your name?

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.600
No.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.600
You're getting the spoiler off.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.000
Kali, Kali Kazoo, get up here, Kali Fontecchio, come on the stage.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
She was there.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Fontecchio.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I mean, like, I was super thrilled.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
She's the Bernstein to his word, word.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Let's fucking get this right.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Let's back up.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Okay.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
First thing.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.480
First of all, Cali's saying the, Cali's new album is out, and her song was the one

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.480
that was playing in the beginning.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.480
Thank you.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.480
I'm playing her song all night long.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.480
What's the new record called?

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.280
Contrary to Pop Your Belief, and that song was called Hey Look, and you can check out

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.640
the music video online, which has Willie Roberts in it, and DeMorge Brown.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.640
And I was cut out.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.640
And Kate Freund.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.640
I was also cut out.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.640
All that was cut out, but yeah.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.140
I was in the video, but I was cut out.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.140
Thank you.

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.140
It's fine.

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.140
It's fine.

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.140
Now work for my interest.

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.140
Yeah.

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.600
No, I mean, I was, it's good that I was cut out because it'd be another thing to explain

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.600
to my parents.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600
Oh.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600
Everyone was dressed as a woman.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600
Yeah.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600
Because I was dressed like a woman.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600
All right.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600
Enough.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.600
It's been plugged.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600
Enough.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.600
It's been plugged.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600
Yeah.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600
So, first thing we do, there's only a few people in this room.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.360
You do live karaoke, not, you know, it's similar to this.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.640
You're on the stage and whatever.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.640
Jeff walked in.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.640
It's not like a private room.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640
Okay.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.640
Yeah.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.640
I just wanted to clarify that.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640
It's a big, big room, you know.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640
Yeah.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.200
A bar room in a hotel.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.700
First thing Jeff does is he goes and he puts money in the tip jar.

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.700
He puts $5.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.100
Well, there's, there's a stipulation.

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.640
Some people said he put more than $5.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640
What?

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.640
That I've talked to people about the story.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640
Okay, can I just say?

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.640
Who said he put more than $5?

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640
Uh, Weissel.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.640
Weissel said he put more.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:33.140
I can, I can settle that part of it right off the bat.

01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:37.140
When we got there, there was only about maybe 10, 15 people there total.

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.140
Right.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.640
Then a little later, there was maybe 30 people.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.640
It started to fill up.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.640
I signed up fairly early on and when I signed up, I wrote down a song, gave it to, there's

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.140
a guy in a gala there.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.640
I gave them a $5 bill.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.640
I put a $5 bill in their little jug and that was the only money in that, in that jug.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640
He was the first tipper.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640
It was early in the night.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.640
So then I sat down and then time passes.

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.140
And then all bed goes on and I go on and we put in our slips of paper at the same time

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.140
as Jeff.

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.140
And then like tons of people were going on and Jeff's like, well, what's going on?

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.640
How come I'm not getting caught?

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.640
So he walks over and he has a little discussion.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.140
Me and Avid don't understand what's going on.

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.640
He goes onto the stage and says, worst karaoke place ever.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.140
We're like, oh, you're making a joke?

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.140
There was a conversation that happened in between.

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.140
So that's what, we didn't find that out until he came over to us.

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.140
I was like, is he joking?

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:27.140
And then we realized as he walked over, I was like, oh, just mad.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.640
I walked over and it's a place where there's regulars there.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.140
They're going to get preferential treatment.

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.140
I understand that.

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:37.140
I'm all for that because I go to other karaoke places where I am the beneficiary.

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.140
I'm the beneficiary of that preferential treatment.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.140
Right, right.

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.140
So I dig that.

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:44.140
So somebody comes in after I signed up and they got up first, hooray.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.140
But now I think some people sing twice in front of me.

01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:49.140
And also there's people that came in way after me.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.140
I think you're paying too much attention to who's singing when.

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.140
Well, I was like, I'm really drunk and I'm just calling my name.

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:54.140
No, thank you.

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:55.140
It was.

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:56.140
So I walked over.

01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:02.140
I walked over and I have to say, I was in all good faith and all good, good climate,

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:05.140
walked over there and said, I was excited to see you go up.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.140
I said, I just want to check how far away am I?

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.140
And she showed me the list and I was nowhere fucking anywhere on it.

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.140
I go, what?

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:14.140
She goes, did you sign up?

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.140
I'm like, yeah, I signed up like a while back.

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.140
And the guy's like, yeah, I don't think you did.

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.140
And so they showed me.

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.140
Then he put my name down at the bottom list.

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:26.140
I'm like, no, like I was here like when there was nobody here.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:29.140
And they're like, yeah, you're on the list now.

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.140
I said, do you see the $5?

01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.140
Do you remember that conversation that happened where I walked up when there was nobody?

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.140
And I signed up and handed you.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:42.140
We all spoke to each other and I gave you a $5 bill and it went into this tip jar.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.140
And they're like, well, yeah, but yeah, I don't remember.

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.140
You're on it now.

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:49.140
And so I was like, yeah, but now you're just lying to me.

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:52.140
And the woman takes the $5 bill and hands it back here.

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:58.140
I took it and I went, I took it and went rip, rip, rip and threw it in her face.

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.140
Oh my God, here's your $5 bill.

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:04.140
And she took the shreds and she snorted them and then she like, shit them out.

01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.140
Just being fucking shit.

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.140
I didn't see that.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.140
Fucking wait.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.140
This is what she told me about it.

01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:11.140
I was just being lied to.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.140
They go, well, you're up next.

01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:16.140
They said, you're not going on.

01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.140
I took the mic.

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:20.140
Everybody, shittiest karaoke place in the universe.

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.140
And walked up there.

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.140
We thought it was a joke.

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.140
We're like, what's happening?

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.140
No.

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.140
I thought you said you thought he was making fun of the guy before him.

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.140
No, I was making fun of the two assholes running karaoke.

01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.140
There was like a fake ass who rose up before him.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.140
So poor guy just finished doing Elvis.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:43.140
His therapist convinced him to go out and risk judgment in a safe way.

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:46.140
Wise men say.

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.140
It's like the stand up guy falling in love with you and then Jeff comes up.

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:53.140
Worst karaoke place ever.

01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:59.140
He just crushes a bag of potatoes and pours them all over his face.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.140
It was to an empty stage.

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:05.140
Then I got my shit together, told a couple of people that were there.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.140
So I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to be here anymore.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:13.140
What I didn't find out is that you were in the hallway with like a security guard and

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.140
the lady for a long time.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.140
It's scary.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:20.140
I went right out and called the lift to bone the fuck out.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:26.140
And I got out in the hallway, leaving the bar, leaving the hotel and a guy with the

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.140
ear monitor and the suit.

01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.140
Burbank, California.

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:34.140
Comes up to me and he goes, with a woman, I think it was also probably like some sort

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.140
of manager at the hotel.

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:38.140
And I'm like, sir, you have to go.

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.140
I'm leaving.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.140
I'm calling my car right now.

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:45.140
I saw a long conversation and then I asked Cali, should I go over there?

01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:47.140
You have to go.

01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.140
I wouldn't stay here on a bet.

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:54.140
I said, and believe me, I'm sorry if this ever involves you.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.140
I'm not going to cause any trouble.

01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:59.140
I'm simply leaving.

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.140
I'm just calling a car.

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:03.140
We can walk outside to where the car is coming.

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.140
And that was the end of the story.

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:09.140
However, I've never ripped up currency and thrown it in somebody's face.

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.140
That was shocking.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.140
That is amazing.

01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:12.140
That shocked me.

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.140
I've never seen Jeff so angry.

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.140
They lied to me.

01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:18.140
They lied back to me and you were just like, fuck this place.

01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:21.140
There was five fucking dollars in that fucking jar.

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.140
I've never seen you mean.

01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.140
And they pretended like we had never met.

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.140
I've never seen Jeff angry.

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:27.140
On stage telling everyone to fuck off.

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:34.140
I don't presume that five dollars in the plastic Costco pretzel jar that you took the

01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:38.140
label off and scrubbed it down so it didn't look like there was a pretzel label on there.

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:40.140
That is your shitty tip jar.

01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:45.140
I don't presume that five dollars in that jar entitles me to shit.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:51.140
But just don't fucking pretend that we never spoke because it was within the hour.

01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.140
And we were fucking there.

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:57.140
You know, what's funny is every time I read it, I'm like, here's your money.

01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.140
I'm like, here's your fucking money, lady.

01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:02.140
Also, Jeff is the only six-foot guy in a suit.

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.140
Right, right, right.

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:06.140
Everyone else was just like Bono.

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.140
I'm not saying I'm here.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:11.140
I was ashamed of myself.

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:13.140
I still did not feel good about that.

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.140
I'm not saying I'm a good guy.

01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:20.140
What I did do is fuck off into Koreatown, went to a karaoke place where it was fucking

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:22.140
a groovy Tuesday, man.

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:23.140
Oh, sure.

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.140
I'm sure.

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.140
See what's a better one.

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.140
We should have all gone there.

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.140
Five fucking minutes after you left.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.140
Jeff D is Jeff D there.

01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.140
Well, yeah, they're Jeff D.

01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:34.140
They didn't even know.

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.140
I wasn't on that list.

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:36.140
I saw the list.

01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:39.140
They showed it to me and they gave me the fucking short shrift.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.140
It was an accident is what I'm thinking.

01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.140
There's no accident in karaoke.

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.140
I want to point out that if...

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:45.140
No, they called him twice.

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:48.140
If Jeff had done that on Twitter, it would be called a meltdown.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.140
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.140
That's called a meltdown.

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:52.140
I honestly...

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.140
He melted down.

01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:56.140
I never tipped until that night.

01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:58.140
No, Dan, you would have always got up.

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.140
Dan, you would have taken $1,000, $5 bills and torn it up.

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.140
No, I would have fucking...

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:05.140
I mean, believe me, I'm not.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.140
There's a couple...

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:09.140
There's a lot of fascinating things are happening.

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.140
I brought Abbot up here to exploit him.

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.140
I thought he was going to be the guy in the jar.

01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:15.140
You are definitely the...

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.140
You are...

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.140
I'm not saying I'm not on your side.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:19.140
No, I'm fucking Batman.

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:20.140
But you were wrong.

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.140
This is worth talking about.

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.140
This was worth talking about.

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.140
That's what I texted you.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:28.140
I feel like you should know this.

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.140
Gwen, baby.

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.140
Gwen, get up here.

01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.140
Gwen, baby.

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.140
Gwen, where are you from?

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:34.140
Delaware?

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.140
Iowa.

01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:39.140
I have an interesting story about that.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:40.140
Gwen, get up here.

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.140
I got an interesting story.

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.140
This is Gwen, baby, everybody.

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140
About you guys.

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140
I...

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140
Hey, Jeff, real quick.

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.140
That applause is very apprehensive.

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.140
Everyone's like, what the fuck is happening?

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.140
I was buying a drink.

01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:56.140
I was at the bar buying a drink and you were there with your two friends.

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:59.140
I didn't know them, but they were talking about you.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.140
Right.

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:02.140
And I was eavesdropping because they didn't know that I knew you.

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:03.140
Okay.

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:07.140
And they were saying, like, who wears a suit to a bar like this?

01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.140
Right.

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.140
And I thought that was funny.

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:14.140
But people want to know if Gwen's the bouncer at the karaoke party they need to know.

01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:15.140
Gwen is from Iowa.

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.140
I met her.

01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.140
You're traveling.

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:22.140
I met her at the drawing room and that day I said, my friend, Abed, real Abed from community.

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:24.140
He said, oh, I know community.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.140
Real Abed from community.

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.140
Well, Jeff was building me up, yeah.

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.140
I was saying, we're talking about karaoke.

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:35.140
I said, I'm going to do karaoke with my friend Abed, who is famously the inspiration for Abed

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.140
from community.

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:40.140
We went, but Gwen, you texted me today and said you have been kicked out of three places

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.140
in two nights?

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.140
Yeah.

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:47.140
I've never been kicked out of a place and I came to LA for one day and I've been kicked

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.140
out of three.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.140
Including a Holiday Inn in Burbank, California.

01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:53.140
Yeah, but yours was my favorite for sure.

01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:54.140
Yeah.

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:57.140
Because I destroyed, I destroyed Lincoln's effigy.

01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.140
What a birthday.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.140
What a birthday.

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.140
Good job.

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.140
I'm sad though because it is a cool karaoke place.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.140
There's some weirdos there and you got like the worst end of it.

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:07.140
I didn't like the sound set up.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:12.140
You should say, before all the Jeff crazy shit happened.

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:13.140
Bad speakers.

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.140
My friend Ben Page, you know Ben Page.

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.140
I know Ben Page.

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:21.140
Yeah, he's a karaoke genius and he went up and he did like Pink Floyd the wall, like

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.140
one of the songs and then like they had some sort of like the version of it was shitty

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.140
and in the middle of the song, he just walked off the stage.

01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.140
Shit.

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:32.140
Yeah, and he's like, that version sucks.

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:33.140
It was an off night.

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:37.140
Yeah, and I'm like, you can't just walk off the stage in the middle of the song, dude.

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:38.140
Like I felt bad.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:41.140
I was like, sounds like I'm kind of a hero for not going to your birthday.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.140
It's quite a secret.

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:45.140
Yeah, Dan, you're off the hook, man.

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.140
You're off the hook.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.140
Try staying there and doing karaoke after that happens.

01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.140
It's impossible.

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.140
It's like nobody's having fun.

01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:58.140
All right, but what other ideas do you have that you could try to explain?

01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.140
What ideas?

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:02.140
I didn't know I didn't have ideas coming on here.

01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:06.140
Do you have any, you know, you're famous for having pitched a restaurant idea.

01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:07.140
Oh, yeah.

01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.140
Yeah.

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:09.140
Oh, he wants more ideas.

01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:11.140
Do you have any inventions or a shit you want to lay on this?

01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.140
It's just a hope.

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.140
It's just a hope.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.140
He's hoping for something.

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.140
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.140
Don't make up on the things you don't have.

01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.140
I talk about my spec I'm writing.

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.140
No.

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.140
Because that's kind of an idea.

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:23.140
Will you talk about the cop that hit on you?

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.140
Oh, the cop.

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.140
But that's, I'm saving that for GVP though.

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:28.140
Should I?

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:31.140
First of all, they're GVP now.

01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:35.140
I was saving that for their episode.

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.140
But all right, I'll do it.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.140
I'll talk about it.

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:41.140
When grandma's virginity starts churning out once a week, they can have exclusives.

01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.140
Justin and Ryan really.

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.140
Can I get a hit of that?

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.140
What is that?

01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.140
That's medication.

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:49.140
I have a prescription in that.

01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:55.140
I pulled it out and it was, I don't want to cause chaos.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.140
Let's all ground ourselves.

01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.140
Well, you want the cop story, the lady cop story?

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.140
I'd like it.

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:04.140
And also, I want to place a super fight like you guys played in Chicago too.

01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:05.140
Can we do that tonight or now?

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.140
I want to hear about getting kicked out of three places in one.

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.140
Okay.

01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.140
What were the other two joints that you got bounced out of?

01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:15.140
How did you get kicked out of the karaoke place?

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:19.140
I kicked myself out of a holiday in Burbank.

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.140
He left.

01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:22.140
He was like, he was done.

01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:23.140
All right.

01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:27.140
Well, let's pick, just so everybody understands, let's create like a Starship Troopers graphic

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.140
package where would you like to know more?

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.140
Okay.

01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.140
We're going with Gwen getting kicked out of three places.

01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.140
Okay.

01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.140
Let's go there.

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.140
So let's all go there together.

01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.140
Eyes wide open.

01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.140
Gwen.

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:38.140
Starship troopers?

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140
Starship troopers.

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.140
I don't remember that part.

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.140
All right.

01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:42.140
Put a pin in it.

01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:44.140
I'm going to have to look that up later.

01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:45.140
Okay.

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.140
Because Gwen, three places in how many days?

01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:50.140
It was like two.

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:51.140
Okay.

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.140
And I don't know.

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:57.140
Bottomless mimosas aren't bottomless, first of all.

01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.140
Shots fired.

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.140
That's true.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:02.140
She's saying what we're all thinking.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:06.140
And the other place that we got kicked out of was because of the bottomless mimosas.

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:11.140
You found out that you drink too many mimosas and like, okay, bottomless is a subjective

01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.140
term.

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.140
They came out and said, this has to eventually end.

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.900
They said, wow.

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:17.900
That's amazing.

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:23.020
That's like, you're in World War II and Nazis come out and they go like, look, we get it.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.020
You love freedom.

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.300
That was a terrible example.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.300
You couldn't find the bottom.

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:31.020
I feel like the glass was really low.

01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:32.020
Gwen, okay.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.020
Let's just take us through.

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:36.500
So as a person who got kicked out of three places in two days, take us first one, second

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.500
one, third one.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.500
Number one.

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:39.500
Right.

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.500
Okay.

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:41.500
How did that kick you out?

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:42.500
Number one, me tearing up money at the Halloween.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.500
I ended up going to that place three times.

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500
But I understand.

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:45.500
How did you get kicked out?

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Yeah.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.500
Exactly.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.500
When I did that, I knew.

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.500
No, we know you.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.500
Why her?

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.500
Because she was with me.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.500
She was his boss.

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.500
We don't know that.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.500
We don't know that.

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.500
Jeff had a date.

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.500
No, no, no, no.

01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.500
We don't know that.

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.500
There was her and her two friends.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.500
It was like a whole group.

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:00.500
Yeah.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.500
Jeff had a platonic date.

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.500
Wait.

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.500
So you guys.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500
I brought a woman from Iowa with her friends up to the bar.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500
They already knew that you were going to be there.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.980
They talked to the bar like they didn't know you.

01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:11.500
I met Gwen that day at the drawing.

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500
I bet you didn't know this was going to happen.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500
You're going to be talking about it in front of all these people.

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:16.500
I eavesdropped.

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.500
It sounded like they didn't know who you were.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:18.500
And they were making fun of you.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.500
I bet does anybody truly know who I am?

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.500
Yeah.

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.500
I'd like to know you.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.500
So you think if they knew who he was, he'd get better treatment?

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.500
Is that what you're saying?

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.500
No, I don't know.

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.500
I don't think they cares it.

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.500
All right, all right, all right.

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.500
So that's the price is right.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.500
Gwen's second place you got kicked out of.

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.500
The place with the mimosas.

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.500
I don't know what the fuck that was.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:39.500
You drank them out of champagne and orange juice.

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.500
All right.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.500
Okay.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.500
And then the other place, we walked down the street like two bars down.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:50.500
And then Logan fell asleep on the bar and we had to go.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.500
Fall asleep on the bar.

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.500
Yeah.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:54.500
Logan, you son of a bitch.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.500
For like 45 minutes.

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.500
What bar?

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Was that the guy?

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:58.500
Was that the guy that was with you guys?

01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:59.500
Not a very good bar.

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.500
That was the guy that was with you guys, right?

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.500
No.

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.500
Logan's the girl.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.500
Oh, Logan's the girl.

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.500
You?

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.500
Okay.

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.500
Logan.

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:07.500
I thought that was a man's name.

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.500
Well, it's Wolverine.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.500
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.500
No.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.500
I mean, my Wolverine brain went to like that.

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.500
I pictured a dude at first too.

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.500
Yeah.

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:16.500
We're on the same page.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:20.340
So you were asked to leave or gently left places that you probably shouldn't have stayed

01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.340
in.

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:22.340
It was go both times.

01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:26.660
And it was someone who really didn't, both times it was someone I felt bad for them having

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.660
to do it.

01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:28.660
Glenn, okay.

01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.660
Now I'm remembering.

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.660
Glenn has an awesome story.

01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:34.260
Can we talk about your origin story of you, you and Iowa?

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:41.980
She's famous in this very small part of Iowa for being like, just in the movie Footloose.

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:44.140
She's like all the Kevin Bacon's in the world.

01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.700
Wait, the remake or the old classic?

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.860
Can we talk about this or is this bad?

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:49.860
Are we adding flame?

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.860
Yeah.

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.860
It's fine.

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860
No, it's totally okay.

01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.860
The classic.

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:54.860
I don't think anyone in Iowa knows that this exists.

01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:55.860
It's okay.

01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.180
Do you want to tell it?

01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.180
You can start.

01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.180
I don't know where to start.

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:00.180
Well, I met her.

01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:02.260
She grew up, correct me if I'm wrong.

01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:07.460
You grew up in a very, not evangelical, but fundamentalist Christian time where you had

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.540
to wear a head covering.

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.020
Dancing was prescribed like illegal, right?

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.020
Yeah.

01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.020
And you had to wear a head covering.

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.820
You can still do square dancing.

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820
That's fine.

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.180
Because you're not touching.

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:24.740
But at her school, her mother was the vice president or principal of the college.

01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:28.860
And of a very fundamentalist Christian school, where there's lots of rules, you're not allowed

01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.780
to be in a car alone with a boy.

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.780
That's grounds for expulsion.

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:33.900
Yeah, that's like my dad always said that.

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:34.900
All right.

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:40.660
So he was like, no girl, you and just a girl, you know, like none of that.

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:41.660
All right.

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:44.660
Well, your dad was just protecting the community.

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:45.660
Ouch.

01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:46.660
Ouch.

01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:52.180
I'm not a, you win, you win, you win this round.

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.180
How old were you?

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:58.100
What was the first, uh, transgression?

01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.660
The first time you got rumbled at school.

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.980
Oh, I blew a dude and he told on me.

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:03.980
Oh, I hate when that happens.

01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:04.980
I wouldn't tell.

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.980
He falsely had sinned.

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:09.620
I'm like, what the heck is this?

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:14.620
In his defense at that age, if you get blown, I mean, and you don't tell anybody, did it

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620
even happen?

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:20.100
He probably didn't even mean to get you in trouble.

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:22.700
He was just like, oh my God, that felt so good.

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:24.220
Now, God damn it.

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.420
I'm sure they've ever met it.

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:27.420
Yeah.

01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:32.820
But he told to like expiate his own sins, but also that sent you up the river.

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.820
Yes.

01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.820
Oh God.

01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:35.820
That's awful.

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:36.820
And then your, and then the second one was what?

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:43.420
I drove some kids to a party and I like had a hit from a joint and then I got told on.

01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.420
All right.

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:45.420
So you got told on twice, kicked out of the school.

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:49.380
She was like Bill Clinton, you know, took a hit, got in trouble.

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.660
She was also hit her own Monica Lewinsky.

01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:52.660
Yeah.

01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660
Oh yeah.

01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.260
She had both, she's liked Bill Clinton.

01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:57.260
Yeah.

01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.260
Female Bill Clinton.

01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.260
Wow.

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:03.620
So you, so both times you got told on by male students, right?

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620
Yeah.

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.420
And they probably didn't suffer any consequences because that's.

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.420
Probably less.

01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:09.420
Male privilege, right?

01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:11.060
I remember the word harlot being thrown around.

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:12.060
Oh.

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.660
So you're the Hester Prynne of this town.

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.260
Wait, wait, was it for the blowjob or the weed?

01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:17.260
Both.

01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.260
Okay.

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:19.260
That, that makes you a harlot.

01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.260
You can't just do one.

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.260
Because she's a female.

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.260
I'll bet.

01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:25.820
No, I mean, I didn't even think of in that zone.

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.820
All right.

01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:27.820
You're right.

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.820
You're right.

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:29.820
Fair enough.

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:30.820
Fair enough.

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.820
I'm going to step aside here.

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:37.140
So before I get, you take it down 20%, she goes up 20%.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.620
That's like, we're doing a symphony.

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:39.620
It's all math.

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.620
Yeah.

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:41.620
You're right.

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.620
You're right.

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:43.620
All right.

01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.460
So you're the top brass at the.

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.100
No, not really.

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:48.100
Just me.

01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:49.100
It just, yeah.

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.700
But it didn't, it didn't affect her like standing in the community or?

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.700
No.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:54.700
No.

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.700
No.

01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.700
But you still live in the community.

01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.700
Yeah.

01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.700
And now when people find you, if people run into you, they either think, oh, I didn't

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.740
know that you actually, you're like Paul Bunyan.

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:02.740
Like you're an actual folk more.

01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:03.740
There's two.

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:04.740
There's, I think there's rules.

01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:05.740
Paul Bunyan.

01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:09.980
There's rules at the school now because of me, but there's also, there's also, I work

01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:14.740
at a bar and people will come in and it will be one of two, not to drink because it's coffee

01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:15.740
after any day.

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:16.740
It doesn't matter.

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:22.540
But they go to the school and they'll come in and I either get, oh, I, there's another

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.820
one and they think I'm my sister or.

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:25.820
Are you twins?

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:33.860
No, she's three years older than me, but, or it's, oh, oh, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:35.100
know that was real.

01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.220
Like that's, yeah.

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:38.220
So it's kind of, yeah.

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:39.220
I'm folklore.

01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:40.220
Like, yeah.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:43.740
But you mean, well, meaning that they didn't know it was real, that you got punished, that

01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:44.740
you were just kind of.

01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:45.740
That existed.

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:46.740
Or, or that.

01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:47.740
I think.

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:49.740
That this is a folkloric tale to scare people off of getting blown in a car.

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:50.740
Sorry.

01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:51.740
Sorry.

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.740
Sorry.

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:53.740
Sorry.

01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:54.740
Sorry.

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:55.740
Sorry.

01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.740
Sorry.

01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.740
Sorry.

01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.740
Sorry.

01:43:58.740 --> 01:43:59.740
Sorry.

01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.740
Sorry.

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:01.740
Sorry.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:02.740
Sorry.

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:03.740
Sorry.

01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:04.740
Sorry.

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:05.740
Sorry.

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:06.740
Sorry.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.740
Sorry.

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:08.740
Sorry.

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:09.740
Sorry.

01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:13.620
So, so, I was still steeped in such medieval hypocrisy, this was like, this was like, five

01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.720
years ago.

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.020
Like, so I wasn't clear.

01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.340
I, they obviously meet you.

01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.780
And they go, oh, I didn't know you really existed.

01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:20.960
I didn't know they really happened.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.860
I didn't know I wanted to be clear, but they weren't synthetic.

01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:28.000
Oh, I didn't know it was real that we accidentally got to person.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.720
Johnny clarification over here.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:30.720
Hmm.

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:31.720
Yes.

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.480
And that's a bottle.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.240
I'm really good, right?

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:40.760
I kind of want to talk about how sensitive I was to the idea of like, I feel like I've heard

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:47.080
versions of that just like that little bazooka joe comic like that little it's not even a story

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:53.880
it's just like a little sliver of like like it's adolescent like encounters with misogyny that

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:59.880
phrase was like I blew a dude and he told on me like that in one form or another that happens

01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:04.200
constantly that that's like the first encounter and it's like the thing that always fascinates me is

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:11.080
like I don't know women don't have like a like like like it's like it's like if you're if you're

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.360
like you're selfless enough to like like you're like with a guy and you're like like I really want

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:24.040
this person to you're like like like how does that well it's either you want his dick or you don't

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:30.040
I've been stop it I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm hurting myself enough I don't I can't

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:37.240
have you know I got it I got it kind of it's kind of tricky with that way yeah it's not like

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:42.040
it's like women have a ton of like young girl from their adolescence in small towns where they do

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.800
get hester print like like there's not there's not a ton of stories where girls go I was so

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:54.280
horny that I jumped on a dude and made myself come on his dick and then they told on me it's like

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:59.560
they go I blew a dude like like I don't not saying women don't get pleasure out of giving

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:03.240
that goes that looks like like everybody's having fun when everyone's having fun but isn't that I

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:09.560
mean I was excommunicated from testing for eating too much pussy that see that doesn't happen it's

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:17.720
like I ate a girl's pussy and she told me first of all she never tells fucking betrayed me it's

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:23.160
kind of like sucking a dick is like a power trip right it's kind of like it's like a domination

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:29.400
thing I think you're no yeah I think it's called a blowjob because it's a job you have to like

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:35.000
really try to suck that dick make it feel good a lot of girls don't like that dick I think you're

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.640
coming you're you're swirling around my point but I am but also surrounding my point is like

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:46.440
why it's called a blowjob let me talk like a six-year-old for a second and just bound through

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:50.840
this minefield I'm not gonna try to be politically correct or win any points my when I hear that

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:56.840
stuff I just go but a woman sucking your dick is the biggest favor she could ever do you

01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:03.000
in your life and the the idea that that also makes you a slut instead of a saint is insane

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:09.800
like I just that a young that a young guy like she's it's not like it's not like she's indulging

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:16.520
her impulses it's like she's indulging a natural like like oh that's such a highly evolved person

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:22.920
that at that age she wanted to give something to someone but in a community that repressed

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.920
that the guy can go oh I feel really guilty about this I'm gonna turn us both in and she's the one

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.360
that gets in trouble not me I think that's fucked honestly as a dude and having been that age like

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:40.680
I said as a joke but it's like still it's like I think the the the original the foundation of it is

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:47.800
if you're a dude and you find out that it's possible for a girl to like you enough to give of herself

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.640
to you you can't you start to get obsessed and you go like but what if no one ever knows this

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:59.320
happened and I got hit by a bus and when that thought hits you unfortunately you're in a locker

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.000
room in the middle of pickpickipsy or whatever Gwen Gwen do you think there was any braggadocio

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.320
or do you think it was just guilt in him trying to because you're religious right he was religious

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.080
there's no difference between guilt and braggadocio by the way let's just like so that's the same

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:18.520
thing bless me father for I've sinned I fucking like a chick fucking thought I was hot like oh I'm

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:24.440
just dying about it because like she she said like she had fundamentalist like it's pretty hardcore

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:29.800
religious it's like you know he actually felt bad yeah growing up Muslim we never got but I mean

01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:33.240
when you're bragging about someone blowing you don't usually tell like the president of your

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:40.440
college so you said he was also kind of like a huckster car salesman he kind of yeah yeah

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.520
so he was full of shit that's kind of like level two and it's like it's like the joke that

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.120
where an old guy goes in a confessional and the priest opens the door and it's a very old man

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:52.120
and the priest says how can I help you and he says I've been happily married for 50 years

01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:58.200
never cheated on my wife once until last night and I had just filthy crazy sex with a 18 year old

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:03.960
cheerleader every position all night long just wild crazy sex and and the priest says oh my god

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:07.720
that's really serious he should do a hundred Hail Marys and 200 Our Fathers and the guy says

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.480
I'm not Catholic I'm Jewish and the priest says why you telling me is it telling you I'm telling

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:19.240
everybody and that is that is actually that's what I believe is the root of that's that's that's

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:26.680
the root of the earliest encounter with misogyny that that like a like that women have is like

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:33.640
