{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, just down the road from where the Oscars are happening and\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:15.000\nhorrible things are going down.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:19.000\nBlack people are being admitted to the record.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:26.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:31.000\nMy name is Jeff Davis of Capitola, I'm happy to be back. Let's bring up some friends that are kidding me.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:41.000\nRob Schwab!\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:45.000\nRob Schwab!\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:54.000\nRob Schwab!\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:03.000\nThe mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nHello.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nIt's weird coming out so early.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nYeah.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nSo we're bringing Schwab out at the top.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:17.000\nI started looking at vines and the...\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:22.000\nThe Bible tells us, Dan, don't keep your light under a bushel.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nBring me Schwab out as soon as possible.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:27.000\nThe kids like him.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:29.000\nYou love him too, Dan.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:35.000\nHistorically, more often than not, but it's been a long time.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nYes.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:43.000\nWhat would that graph look like from, like, what, 1991?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\nOkay, we'll go on to yours. Do it.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nSo there'd be some valleys and some peaks. I mean, same as any friendship.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:52.000\nDo you think right now...\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nThat was the potential of that setup.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nAre you...\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nPretend I said this before he just said that.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:06.000\nAre you feeling a Schwab peak or a Schwab valley right now?\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:10.000\nI don't know. I just lost an Oscar.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:15.000\nTo that fucking movie about the kid's brain.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nThe Big Short?\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nThey tell you something about Pixar movies.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nThey have, like, eight million people making them.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nIf all of them vote for who gets an Oscar, that's how they do it.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:31.000\nOkay, like, eight people worked on my fucking sweatshop movie.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:36.000\nFor three years, we moved puppets a millimeter at a time.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nThat movie was about adults eating pussy in a hotel room.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nIt was about the futility of monogamy.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nIt was about our obsession with the other.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\nAnd the human condition. Pixar is fine.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nStop giving them shit.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nDon't encourage them. Scare them.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nThey will do better movies.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:59.000\nWhen they made Toy Story, they were scared.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:02.000\nThey were scared it would be bad.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nSo they made it amazing.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nToy Story 3.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nThey were scared it was going to be as shitty as Toy Story 2.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nSo it was great.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:17.000\nWait a minute. You thought Toy Story 2 was shitty?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:22.000\nI've never seen it. I thought they thought it was.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nI've obviously misread the site.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:29.000\nDan, I'm so sorry you worked really, really hard on that movie.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nI, the executive produced for years.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:36.000\nYou were there with your sleeves rolled up every day.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:42.000\nThere's one thing I know when Dan's involved with anything animated. He rolls up his sleeves.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nAnd just is like, what can I do to help?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:49.000\nWhat do you need? You need a sandwich? You need some water?\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nYou need any kind of snacks? I know it's two o'clock.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:57.000\nI know we don't fill the refrigerator here at Star Burns, but I'm here.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nWe'll take care of it. You guys miss your wives and children?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:06.000\nWhat can I do? What can I do?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nWhat can I do? Dan, what can I do?\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:15.000\nHarmon, what can I do for you animators?\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:21.000\nWhat can I do for you working on something that my name goes before your name?\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:28.000\nHarmon, what can I help you? How can I help you work for me?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:36.000\nWhat can I do? What can I do? Does your eyes hurt?\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nSpoken like an animator. Does your eyes hurt?\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:47.000\nI'm from Cartoon Town. I don't know that everything starts with a script.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:53.000\nI was making the script better for your cartoon.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:59.000\nYou can just draw a picture and have people go...\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nWhat were you writing when you did Schrab Asshole?\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:11.000\nYou were being very mean to me. Justified. This sucks.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:18.000\nYou're catching me on a theft night. Here's the thing.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:28.000\nDo your eyes hurt?\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:33.000\nDo they hurt in the first act? Do you cross a threshold into a world where they hurt in a different way?\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:38.000\nYou were really right. This is what you were doing. Well, I never mind.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nYou obviously wrote something there. Let's see what happened.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nLet's see what you got.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nWhat are you talking about? You're looking at...\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nI just have a little set list here.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nYou wrote it.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:59.000\nWhat was I saying?\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nStory structure.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nHere's the thing. Pixar. Racist.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:13.000\nThat's the thing. I called Chris Rock because he's sitting back there with the envelopes.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:18.000\nJust get us out of there. I don't feel comfortable.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:23.000\nIn a year, when too many fucking white people are...\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nI said, give it to Pixar. They don't give a shit about black people.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nHe was like, are you sure? I said, yeah.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:36.000\nThat's the other thing about this. First of all, they don't deserve it.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nSecond of all, they're racist.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:45.000\nI didn't realize the corruption that you could call Chris Rock up and change the way the Oscars go.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nYou saw those ticker tapes. Everybody knows who's going to win.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nYou saw that. They did the little teletype thing.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nI hated it.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:03.000\nNothing different is ever going to play like, cool. That's so cool that they did that different thing.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:10.000\nIt reminded me of my space when there was your top five.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:14.000\nBack in my day, it was five.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:20.000\nWhatever number it is, the top blank.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nThe people that get zing around there...\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:29.000\nIt was an argument starter, what I'm saying, back home or tomorrow morning.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nHow come you didn't thank me on the mic?\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:37.000\nThe teletype is genius because it's all the shitty people that will just get mad if you don't thank them when you win an Oscar.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd the old pros are like, oh, this person did wardrobe for this thing and it's like she's been working for 30 years.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:49.000\nShe gets to have a fucking huge ticker tape that goes like, yes, stinky, stymie, poopy, toony.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nYeah, you're so important, but honestly, they play you off in 10 seconds.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nSo let me tell my little story and make my...\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:00.000\nExcuse me, it's top eight, not five.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nSorry, I just have to interrupt you right there, Mr. Schwab.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nActually, your free number's off.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nPlease continue.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nFor all of you.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nAll of them.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nYeah, for all of you.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:18.000\nWelcome to a special Axe Grinderers edition of Primate Town.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:23.000\nI thought they had some cool, innovative ways to keep the Oscars shorter this year.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:32.000\nI could make a suggestion for next year, you could shorten, you could take a half hour off the ceremony by having a separate Mad Max award ceremony.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:37.000\nThat's a little joke I wrote in here.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nI didn't draw it.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI wrote it.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nYou know, you could really speed it up by cutting out white people.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:50.000\nThey'd be fucking speeding right up.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nSchwab loved that one.\n\n08:53.000 --> 09:00.000\nHere's something I will agree that they did different this year that I thought was just like, don't do that.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:04.000\nWhen the people are standing and they're talking about the nominated movies.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nThe way they cut to the clip.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nThe camera.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nMoving stuff behind you?\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nNo, that's that.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nOkay, we'll do my bit later.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:22.000\nI'm talking about the steady cam thing where they have the presenters and then the presenters talk and then the camera move.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:25.000\nInstead of them cutting to a clip, the camera would move.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nOh, I liked that tip.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nYou liked it?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nI thought that was horrible.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nI liked it.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nI hated it.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nI liked it.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nYou liked it.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nI thought that was cool.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nSee, okay.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nDirector and writer.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nI just thought, I just thought, I was like, it looks like.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:49.000\nDid you love it when all over that, all over that visual stuff, they were typing the words over it?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nSeat up, Eric.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nSips his coffee.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nYou must have been like, fucking yeah.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nThat's what the movie should have been like.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:02.000\nShe smiles, looks at her keyboard and goes, ooh.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nThat's where the real art is.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nI do.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nI like watching.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nNobody else does, so I never get to do it except when I'm by myself.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nI put the closed caption on.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:19.000\nI forget who the presenters were, but they did say a thing about writers like the backbone of all films are the writers.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nVery true.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nVery true.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nI liked that.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nThey dealt with that nicely.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nVery true.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nI've never said it wasn't.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:30.000\nWell, obviously, fraudulent Oscars this year, as I said.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nExcept for Fury Road, that was pretty badass.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nWell, I mean, I don't know.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:39.000\nI think you can discount all those awards when you look across the board, whether or not the awards were distributed fairly.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nI think Anomalyza should have won.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nThat's the shame, is that now we have to question every single Fury Road award.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.000\nI agree.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nIt's like, who are these people?\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nWhat are they thinking?\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nYeah, but the animation people aren't voting for the other shit.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nFair.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:56.000\nI like that Whoopi Goldberg dressed up as Ursula from Little Mermaid.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nShe looked like Ursula from Little Mermaid, right?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:02.000\nDid you guys, okay, go for it.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nIt's your show, go ahead.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nToo much chatter, Red Tooth.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nAll right.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nThat's an original Star Wars reference.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nRed Tooth.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nWho's Red Tooth?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nRed Tooth.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nRed Tooth.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nRed Tooth.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nRed Tooth.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nCut the chatter, Red Tooth.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nCut the chatter of Blue Tooth.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:23.000\nAm I Blue Tooth or the red one?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nWait, what the hell?\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nWhat did we say before?\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:30.000\nI had to be like one of those weird pirates from the show that yells at the people for being bad pirates.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nLittle Mermaid.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nLittle Mermaid.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nWhoopi Goldberg.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nSo, Benicio del Toro.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nBenicio del Toro.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nDid you see the bear bit and the thing?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:52.000\nAnd then for like a solid eight seconds, we all got to see what Benicio del Toro looks like when he's amused.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nKind of stepped on the...\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:59.000\nNot a real sneeze, just sabotage.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nKnock, knock.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nWho's there?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nDwayne.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nDwayne.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nThat's great.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nKeep going.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nDwayne who?\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nAnyways, Benicio del Toro.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nBenicio del Toro.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:23.000\nWas it Dwayne the chap I'm drowning?\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nYeah.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nAlright, moving on.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nIt's not like I have jokes on here.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nThat was the Oscars. You get any Oscar opinions? You don't care.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nOh, no. I don't really watch the Oscars. It's all...\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nIt's all white people, it's Pixar, racist.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:43.000\nThey're just awards. It's like, what does that mean? You like what you like.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nIsn't that the thing that matters? Who cares what other people like?\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nThat's not...

You have to.\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nAm I the only guy in Hollywood\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nthat doesn't have a beard?\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nIt's the reason why I don't want to get up in the morning\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nto write is because I can't grow a good beard.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nI grow a very patchy Johnny Depp.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nWho is that Asian guy\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nin the red carpet who had the worst patchiest\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nbeard of all time?

Yes.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nSays Dave Plein who has a giant beard.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nAlright, so like what was it\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\na year and a half ago?\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nYou guys had this thing on the internet.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nAnimals, dry comedy\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nlike eight frames per hour\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nin terms of like\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nglacial. Because it's just like\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\ndrawing of animal doing setup\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nlike doing kind of like\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nvery organic and kind of improv style.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nI'm going to get a soda.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nHe's so jealous because there's people that draw\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nup here.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nI mean I'm just sitting here and it's hot.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nI'm going to get a soda.

He was\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nlike fuck, what am I doing with my wife?\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nI'm going to go to...\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nTwo baby, that's good.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nBut you guys are self starters.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nYou're like the weekend, the guy.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nNot the two day.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nThe one guy.\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nThis is post internet\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nlike these guys on the internet\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\ndo the thing. Now it's really is the way\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nit works. Like you guys are self starting\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\ninternet dudes. Like you started\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\ndoing this thing as it is on the internet\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nfollowing your passion. Making yourself laugh.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nChannel 101. Then went to\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nChannel 101.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nNew York baby. Then went to\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nNew York take. What was it\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nthe New York TV Festival? Yeah.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nWhere Mitch Hurwitz was like you guys are\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nawesome. Duplass brothers were like\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nyou guys are awesome.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nWhat is Mitch's steak now?\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nHe did a voice\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nin two episodes. He's\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nmy dad in an episode. But he...\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nDoes he like... Do you guys have to send\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nmoney from the budget to the show?\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nTo him? No. He's got nothing\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nto do with it anymore. We partnered with the Duplass\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nbros. So those guys are\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nexecutive producers and how we were able\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nto make a bunch of episodes independently\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nfor like a year\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nbefore we partnered with Starbucks to finish it\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nout and sell it to HBO.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nAnd we just gave you a little home to keep you off the street.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nYou did. And I think it's nice that I\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\ndon't do anything on your show. I think it's\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nkind of cool because we just kind of passed in the halls\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nand especially when Rick and Morty was there too it's\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\njust like... I don't know it's a little gang.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nYeah. It was lovely. And you see me and you go\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nboy there's Dan\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nlike he doesn't... He's not going to come\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nin here and tell us how to draw an animal. Yeah.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nWell that wouldn't be any of my business.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nYeah. I'm not lazy.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nNo you're not. You're there late\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nand I've seen you there very early\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nfrom like the night before. It seems\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nlike Dan you're a little hands-off on the show.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nI mean you don't know.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nThat's a good thing. It's a good thing.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nHe came up to us. I thought\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nyou were a workaholic. I thought that was your gimmick.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nYou care too much.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nYou work too hard. Well the first\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\ntime he came up to us he rolled up his sleeves and\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nhe was like what can I do that? I did.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nI did. I did. A sandwich.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nAnd then you know... I did have that meeting with\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nyou guys. He doesn't...\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nI don't know. He's cool. He's nice.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nBut then I didn't see him for a long time.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nIs Dan a permanent PA here? Dan doesn't\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nhave sleeves. Dan's never had sleeves.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nYeah. But did you\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nremember that conversation? Because we talked\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nfor a half hour and I was like these guys seem like cool guys.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nYou already had it. They're already\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nguys in the building. It's like a different relationship.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nIt's like you guys said like the Duplass brothers\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nwere like you guys should do your thing. They were\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nyour benefactors and you guys tried as hard\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nas you could to do it literally by yourselves.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nAnd then it was like holy shit we're going to go insane.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nSo it's just really\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nthey're more tenets. It's not like\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nthey're not a brain child\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nof Starbucks. A building\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nwhere they get to work. But\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nnevertheless\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nbecause I love creativity\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nand because I'm sort of a...\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nI'm just a wonderful person.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nSo good. And because you never know\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nyou guys could give me a job one day.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nI don't have no idea. That's what Hollywood's\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nabout. You don't\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nsay no to anything like bringing in my office.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nI said if there's ever anything\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nI can do and you guys are really great\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nbut you've never needed anything.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nNo not really.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nI mean part of why are we with you guys.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nIt's a building.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nWhen we went around\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nto try to like find the animation\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nstudio that was going to help us because initially\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nwe made the first two episodes of our show\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nthat just aired on TV\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\ntwo weeks ago.

otter\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nThey float on their back\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nAnd they eat food on their stomach\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nAnd they're just like\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nShilling\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nBut they don't build dams\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nThey're almost beavers, but they don't work that hard\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nAnd they're just like\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nWhen they have sex, they grab on to the female's

day before Fridays\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nSo every Thursday\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nIf you're at work or whatever\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nThere's a new episode out\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nAnd I think our show's gonna have to be\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nA word of mouth sort of thing\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nSo the more\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nWe just need cool people\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nTo tell other cool people about it\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nBut we're not getting enough\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nStop, it's not for old people\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nIt's for young people\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nThey get two seasons if they get three\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nThat's helpful for everybody\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nIt is a really funny show\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nAnd it's like everybody having fun\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nAnd it's awesome\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nAnd we get to hire all these awesome\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nCool people who all have their

01:04:15.000\nSapprocky\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nSo it's a fun eclectic mix\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nWhat style of animation is it?\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nHow are you doing it?\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nWe're doing it in harmony\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nPeople call it like lo-fi\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nBecause the mouths don't move or anything\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nAnd it's kind of stop-motion-y\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nIn a way, but it's a really weird\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nEclectic mix\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nSome of our backgrounds are photo-realistic\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nLooking, it's a mixture of\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nHigh art and low art\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nHi\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nLittle on the nose\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nLittle on the nose\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nIt was a little on the nose\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nIt was a little on the nose\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nThank you\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nThanks so much guys\n\n01:04:53.000 -->

01:05:05.000\nAnd then that drives traffic\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nTo the HBO Go Plus\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nTurn style\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nWhich makes a wheel spin\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nWhich I think Universal then makes a chicken\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nYou get a free dope\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nPop quiz\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nWho was the one sitting closer to you?\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nOkay, I got to flip it\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nOkay\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nIt was\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nThis was Phil\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nYou did it\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nBut I had to flip it three times to remember it\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nIt's not about me being a bad person\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nI just\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nMy therapist had stopped\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nMy therapist told me\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nYou back yourself into a corner\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nBecause that's where you have won\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nYour greatest victories\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nBecause you were\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nIn your youth were in an environment\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nWhere you were back into a corner\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nFor real\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nAnd nobody else around you understands\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nBecause they look at you and they go\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nThat's a six foot tall fucking bear guy\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nLike that has no that no one wants\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nTo do anything bad to\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nAnd from their perception\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nYou're just a dick\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nBecause when I\n\n01:06:09.000 -->

that\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nOur uh\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nWhat's what\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nIs Abed here Abed are you here\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nAbed Gheith\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nOkay\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nOh Abed\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nAbed I haven't seen you in a while\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nYou're looking\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nBecause I don't have a job and I'm broke\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nWell okay well\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nIt's not above everyone else\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nI have some of your delicious vodka\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nYes of course\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nYou and I are always like\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nWell I don't want to insult you by saying this\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nI think me slightly more\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nBut you and I are always fluctuating\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nLike I never know when I see you\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nYou said last time that I lost weight\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nWhich was very flattering\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nMaybe every time I see you I just think you look good\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nOh thank you well you look good too\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nActually you're looking great\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nThis is real Abed\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nBut don't let the name fool you\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nI feel like the character I made\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nFor a community is more dimensional\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nThat's my new laugh\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nWhen's the last time we hung out\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nIt was a while ago\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nI just needed to siphon off some character points\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nAnd I went off to NBC\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nShould I sit next to Rob\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nOr is that we need a buffer zone\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nI think this is fine\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nHow are you doing\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nAfter not being the dictator\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nOf Cuba\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nNo I mean\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nHey\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nHey what\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nWhat\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nIt's like a siphon reaction\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nI was going to say\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nI lost weight\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nAnd then I was like\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nI need a cool look that makes me attractive\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nAnd I was like\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nI don't like my head\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nAnd I was like\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nI was like I need something\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nSo I decided\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nI decided\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nI did something\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nI have this hat from this thing I made\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nCalled the Pop\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nShot Spider Gluto\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nWell you take off your hat\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nI want to see your\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nYou got me\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nYou got me\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nSo you're saying\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nYou do look good with the hat\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nBut how do you\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nWhat are your feelings about\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nBecause I've been friends with Schrab for 30 million years\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\n30 million\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nReally long time\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nSchrab started\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nWhen I met him\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nSchrab was\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nHe was a bald guy\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nBut he was young\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nAnd through my friendship with him\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nI actually became\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nI didn't even realize\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nThe attention\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nWe're paying and how it feels\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nAnd all the different perspectives\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nAnd so I'm curious\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nLike you're wearing a hat\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nBecause you're saying like\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nI look better with the hat on\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nAnd it's because the fact that you're bald\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nIs covered or because the hat is\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nA better looking thing than hair\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nIn the 40's everyone wore hats\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nAnd so bald people kind of\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nLook like everyone else\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nAnd I want to look like everyone else\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nLike I want to be attractive and cool\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nPeople with hair\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nWhat the fuck is happening\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nThis is like\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nI feel like we're in therapy right now\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nBut I mean like it's a crazy reunion\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nI'm gonna pay for this for you to go to therapy\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nThis is not fair, this is like the therapy hour\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nI want to look like everybody else\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nI want to be attractive\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nSometimes you meet somebody\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nAnd they go oh you're bald\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nYou're inadequate\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nIf I have the hat\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nAnd I just go\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nThis is everything\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nYou've ever wanted\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nLook man\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nKarma fucking happens\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nAnd like\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nYou got 10 minutes before I have to go to Kate's show\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nSo make it good\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nLet's wrap this up\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nMake it fun for somebody\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nLet's put a pin in the hat conversation\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nBecause it's like\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nObviously when we watched\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nWhat was that guy in the bus of love\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nThe fucking like heavy metal guy\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nYes\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nThere's like certain personalities\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nThat we see where they have like a scarf\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nAnd it's like Jesus Christ\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nThis guy wants to make us\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nThink he's not bald\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nBut that's different from wearing like a Clark Kent\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nLike fucking like from an era\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nWhen everyone I tried doing that\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nI tried doing that and then I think\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nJustin said dude you look like a douchebag\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nHe's like don't be that guy\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nThat comes with that hat\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nI was like oh shit he's right\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nI want to try as hard as I can to not care about physical things\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nBut I guess I mean\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nYou look great\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nShit\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nI'm super psyched\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nMaybe it is the Castro thing\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nYou look like a\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nLike a young Middle Eastern Hemingway\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nLike I\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nI'll take it\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nI would read a novel that you wrote\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nAlright so Abid you're on a high\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nSo I brought you here\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nAnd you texted me\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nYou had a birthday recently\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nThat was Justin's idea by the way\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nDid you have a birthday party?\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nI told him the story\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nAnd then he goes text Dan\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nTell him about it\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nTell Justin\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nI promised him that I would give him credit\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nI just want credit for\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nInspiring you\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nYou texted me and said\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nWhat's Jeff doing over there?\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nI'm ordering a beer\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nSo I didn't go to your birthday party\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nApologies you had a karaoke place\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nIt was interesting\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nYou're down the street\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nBecause Ridley came\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nYeah but it's like there's a lot of\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nThere's construction\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nOn that street\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nI've never seen you sing a karaoke\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nBut it's a new environment\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nThere's a lot of weirdos there\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nYou would probably be uncomfortable\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nI'm sure\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nPeople will be judging you\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nOn your song choice\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nWell\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nDan is pretty\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nYou do well in karaoke\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nYou have some wheelhouse songs\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nHe does a great George Michael\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nHis faith is fucking unbelievable\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nI'm a big fan of that version\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nYou texted me\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nAnd you said\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nIs Jeff going to be on the show\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nOn Sunday\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nAnd you said\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nHe was at my birthday party\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nAnd I think it would make a good story\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nAnd I said\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nWhy don't you come down to the show and talk about it\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nI didn't want to hear anything about it\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nI texted Jeff and said\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nAbed's coming to the show\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nHe said some shit went down\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nAnd Jeff was like that's going to take a minute to talk about\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nBut Abed trying to explain something\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nIs Abed at his most\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nSocietally\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nEspecially if Rob Schrab is on stage\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nWhat has happened\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nI totally forgot\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nHe's going to be here\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nI've drawn a frame\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nHere's Abed explaining\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nI know nothing about this\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nSome shit went down\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nIt was crazy\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nI was super drunk first of all\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nThe first moment when we started\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nThat party at the Holiday Inn\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nShout out\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nAnd Jeff comes in\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nShout out to Burbank\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nThis show is about Burbank\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nSo Jeff comes in\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nAnd I'm excited that he came\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nI've been trying to get Jeff to come to the show\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nFor a while\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nThere's some insane characters there\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nThere's a guy\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nHe dresses like Bono\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nAnd he only does Bono songs\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nAnd then there's a guy that's got a giant beard\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nLike a white beard\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nAnd he's a coal miner guy\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nAnd he sings cowboy songs\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nAnd it's like waiting for Guffman\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nYou just got to see these people\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nOr true stories\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nOr people who just dress\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nLike people that sing like those people\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nIt's fun\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nIt's a fun time\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nI've been to so many videos of these people\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nAnd these people exist\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nI've seen the videos of these people\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nWhich karaoke place is this?\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nIt's Holiday Inn in Burbank\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nIt's Friday nights at 9\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nIs it hardcore or is it just weird?\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nThere's all these regulars and they all go\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nAre they hardcore about it?\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nAre they good singers?\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nAnd they're all dressing up like the characters\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nSo it's like one of those places\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nWhere you're like this is hardcore karaoke\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nThese are regulars\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nI go because I never know what I'm going to see\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nAnd I jump into the midst\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nYou set the scene\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nThis is the Nazi Germany of Schindler's List\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nHere comes the story now\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nTake us further in\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nYou're setting it up so big\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nSo anyway\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nWe started off at the top\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nWhich is a cool bar\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nAnd then we went down the cool glass elevator\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nAnd we go, it's like a Willy Wonka situation\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nAnd then we go into the actual\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nWhere they're doing the karaoke\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nThis is just a yelp review\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nThis is what happens to you when you\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nAny consumer that goes to these places\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nYou have to go through the motions\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nSo then we're there and it's like\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nThere's nobody there, I'm all excited\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nAll my friends are going to sing\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nWe're going to have a blast\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nThe night's starting off good\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nAnd people are buying me drinks because it's my birthday\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nCan you tell us how old you are?\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nOh man, alright, I'm 37\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nI'm old\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nIt's the new 27\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nYou thought I was 27, thank you\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nNo, I said it's the new 27\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nBut if you told me you were 27\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nLook at your thick black fucking marker beard\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nA girl at that karaoke said I was 26\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nSo that's pretty\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nShe probably didn't see that you were bald\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nShe would have thought you were 900,000 years old\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nI was wearing the hat\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nShucks, you got me\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nWell, so then\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nNo, I got Schrab, I'm not trying to hurt you\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nI'm trying to hurt Schrab\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nI feel like you should be cutting in more\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nHe's like, is he alright?\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nHe'll find, you're doing...\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nSo anyway, the night is going great\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nI can't remember what song I put in\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nI always have three songs in my pocket\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nOne of these I'm going to do\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nLike literally?\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nI think about what I'm going to sing\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nBut you're patting your pocket\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nI'm showing you that\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nBut you mean in your head\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nYeah, there's nothing in your pocket\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nHow did your pocket...\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nI write down the song\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nHe means he writes down three that he has ready to go\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nYou actually write them down on a slip of paper\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nWeird, weird\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nThat's how it works\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nAlready weird\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nAre you being sarcastic? Because I do think that's weird\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nIt is weird\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nYou have to write them down on a slip of paper\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nBefore you get there\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nI'm asking him\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nI had one from last time\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nI didn't do\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nProve to me right now that you don't have a song in your pocket\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nI wrote the same pants\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nGot me, I didn't wash them\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nIs there a chance of the song\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nIs there a chance of the song at large\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nIn your pocket right now?\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nNo, there's not\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nThere might be one in my wallet, but I don't want to look\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nI just wanted a record that was important for me to focus in on\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nThat thing, because it's an important detail\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nCallie, you're saying, oh yeah, you have to write\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nThat was the chair\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nIt's all karaoke\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nYou have to write it on a slip of paper\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nYou're saying you literally\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nYou had unsung songs\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nWritten on slip of karaoke\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nIn case I get stumped\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nAnd I need something like a reserve\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nI got it there\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nLike the teletype in tonight's Askers\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nCould be the best thing, could be the worst\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nI can't even tell\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nAt least you're innovating\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nI've been doing that karaoke place for five weeks\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nAnd everyone's good\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nI'm trying to like\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nI'm trying to compete with these people\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nSo I'm really trying to like bring my A game\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nAnd so I have reserves, because I'm like\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nOh, maybe I'll do better on Happy Together\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nMaybe Super Call of Fragileistic XBI\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nDocious will be better\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nAlways, always a fucking doozy\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nYeah, that's always a doozy\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nThat one's hard, dude\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nYou squeeze off a little Mary Poppins\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nIn a fucking hardcore karaoke place\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nSo you practice these songs at home?\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nNo, I mean, I love Mary Poppins\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nSo you memorize this song?\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nYeah, I mean, that song will never leave me right now\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nNo, fuck that, never, never\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nNo, come on\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nCall of Fragileistic XBI will be better\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nIs this really writing a trocious?\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nI'm not gonna do it\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nPlease stop doing it\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nPlease stop, don't ever do that again\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nSo anyway, I keep getting distracted here\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nSo I'm\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nI'm excited\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nI think I put in Nina Cherry's Buffalo Stance\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nOh nice\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nThis is one of my favorite\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nBecause rap is easy, you can just rap\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nYou don't have to sing good\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nIt's not always easy\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nBut you can just be like\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nI mean\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nYou're\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nNice try\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nI mean, rap is like\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nI'm this guy, I'm doing this\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nHere I go, bubba blue\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nWe were at karaoke in New York\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nAnd we rented one of those rooms\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nAnd New York karaoke gets more\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nLost in translation\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nIt's New York and it's compressed\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nYou go to places and it's more\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nOr OG Asian style\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nOr a little, you're in a tiny room\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nAnd there was a\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nThere was a young lady that came\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nIt was a friend of a friend\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nAnd she had clearly\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nThis is the first time I ever saw somebody\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nIt was like, oh well you've prepped this\n\n01:21:19.000 -->

work for my interest.\n\n01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.140\nYeah.\n\n01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.600\nNo, I mean, I was, it's good that I was cut out because it'd be another thing to explain\n\n01:24:50.600

01:24:55.600\nBecause I was dressed like a woman.\n\n01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600\nAll right.\n\n01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600\nEnough.\n\n01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.600\nIt's been plugged.\n\n01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600\nEnough.\n\n01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.600\nIt's been plugged.\n\n01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600\nYeah.\n\n01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600\nSo, first thing we do, there's only a few people in this room.\n\n01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.360\nYou do live karaoke, not, you know, it's similar to this.\n\n01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.640\nYou're on the stage and whatever.\n\n01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.640\nJeff walked in.\n\n01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.640\nIt's not like a private room.\n\n01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640\nOkay.\n\n01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.640\nYeah.\n\n01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.640\nI just wanted to clarify that.\n\n01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640\nIt's a big, big room, you know.\n\n01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640\nYeah.\n\n01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.200\nA bar room in a hotel.\n\n01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.700\nFirst thing Jeff does is he goes and he puts money in the tip jar.\n\n01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.700\nHe puts $5.\n\n01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.100\nWell, there's, there's a stipulation.\n\n01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.640\nSome people said he put more than $5.\n\n01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640\nWhat?\n\n01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.640\nThat I've talked to people about the story.\n\n01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640\nOkay, can I just say?\n\n01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.640\nWho said he put more than $5?\n\n01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640\nUh, Weissel.\n\n01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.640\nWeissel said he put more.\n\n01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:33.140\nI can, I can settle that part of it right off the bat.\n\n01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:37.140\nWhen we got there, there was only about maybe 10, 15 people there total.\n\n01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.140\nRight.\n\n01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.640\nThen a little later, there was maybe 30 people.\n\n01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.640\nIt started to fill up.\n\n01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.640\nI signed up fairly early on and when I signed up, I wrote down a song, gave it to, there's\n\n01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.140\na guy in a gala there.\n\n01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.640\nI gave them a $5 bill.\n\n01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.640\nI put a $5 bill in their little jug and that was the only money in that, in that jug.\n\n01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640\nHe was the first tipper.\n\n01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640\nIt was early in the night.\n\n01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.640\nSo then I sat down and then time passes.\n\n01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.140\nAnd then all bed goes on and I go on and we put in our slips of paper at the same time\n\n01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.140\nas Jeff.\n\n01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.140\nAnd then like tons of people were going on and Jeff's like, well, what's going on?\n\n01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.640\nHow come I'm not getting caught?\n\n01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.640\nSo he walks over and he has a little discussion.\n\n01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.140\nMe and Avid don't understand what's going on.\n\n01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.640\nHe goes onto the stage and says, worst karaoke place ever.\n\n01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.140\nWe're like, oh, you're making a joke?\n\n01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.140\nThere was a conversation that happened in between.\n\n01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.140\nSo that's what, we didn't find that out until he came over to us.\n\n01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.140\nI was like, is he joking?\n\n01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:27.140\nAnd then we realized as he walked over, I was like, oh, just mad.\n\n01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.640\nI walked over and it's a place where there's regulars there.\n\n01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.140\nThey're going to get preferential treatment.\n\n01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.140\nI understand that.\n\n01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:37.140\nI'm all for that because I go to other karaoke places where I am the beneficiary.\n\n01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.140\nI'm the beneficiary of that preferential treatment.\n\n01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.140\nRight, right.\n\n01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.140\nSo I dig that.\n\n01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:44.140\nSo somebody comes in after I signed up and they got up first, hooray.\n\n01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.140\nBut now I think some people sing twice in front of me.\n\n01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:49.140\nAnd also there's people that came in way after me.\n\n01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.140\nI think you're paying too much attention to who's singing when.\n\n01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.140\nWell, I was like, I'm really drunk and I'm just calling my name.\n\n01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:54.140\nNo, thank you.\n\n01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:55.140\nIt was.\n\n01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:56.140\nSo I walked over.\n\n01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:02.140\nI walked over and I have to say, I was in all good faith and all good, good climate,\n\n01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:05.140\nwalked over there and said, I was excited to see you go up.\n\n01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.140\nI said, I just want to check how far away am I?\n\n01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.140\nAnd she showed me the list and I was nowhere fucking anywhere on it.\n\n01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.140\nI go, what?\n\n01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:14.140\nShe goes, did you sign up?\n\n01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.140\nI'm like, yeah, I signed up like a while back.\n\n01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.140\nAnd the guy's like, yeah, I don't think you did.\n\n01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.140\nAnd so they showed me.\n\n01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.140\nThen he put my name down at the bottom list.\n\n01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:26.140\nI'm like, no, like I was here like when there was nobody here.\n\n01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:29.140\nAnd they're like, yeah, you're on the list now.\n\n01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.140\nI said, do you see the $5?\n\n01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.140\nDo you remember that conversation that happened where I walked up when there was nobody?\n\n01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.140\nAnd I signed up and handed you.\n\n01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:42.140\nWe all spoke to each other and I gave you a $5 bill and it went into this tip jar.\n\n01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.140\nAnd they're like, well, yeah, but yeah, I don't remember.\n\n01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.140\nYou're on it now.\n\n01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:49.140\nAnd so I was like, yeah, but now you're just lying to me.\n\n01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:52.140\nAnd the woman takes the $5 bill and hands it back here.\n\n01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:58.140\nI took it and I went, I took it and went rip, rip, rip and threw it in her face.\n\n01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.140\nOh my God, here's your $5 bill.\n\n01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:04.140\nAnd she took the shreds and she snorted them and then she like, shit them out.\n\n01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.140\nJust being fucking shit.\n\n01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.140\nI didn't see that.\n\n01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.140\nFucking wait.\n\n01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.140\nThis is what she told me about it.\n\n01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:11.140\nI was just being lied to.\n\n01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.140\nThey go, well, you're up next.\n\n01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:16.140\nThey said, you're not going on.\n\n01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.140\nI took the mic.\n\n01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:20.140\nEverybody, shittiest karaoke place in the universe.\n\n01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.140\nAnd walked up there.\n\n01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.140\nWe thought it was a joke.\n\n01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:23.140\nWe're like, what's happening?\n\n01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.140\nNo.\n\n01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.140\nI thought you said you thought he was making fun of the guy before him.\n\n01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.140\nNo, I was making fun of the two assholes running karaoke.\n\n01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.140\nThere was like a fake ass who rose up before him.\n\n01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.140\nSo poor guy just finished doing Elvis.\n\n01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:43.140\nHis therapist convinced him to go out and risk judgment in a safe way.\n\n01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:46.140\nWise men say.\n\n01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.140\nIt's like the stand up guy falling in love with you and then Jeff comes up.\n\n01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:53.140\nWorst karaoke place ever.\n\n01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:59.140\nHe just crushes a bag of potatoes and pours them all over his face.\n\n01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.140\nIt was to an empty stage.\n\n01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:05.140\nThen I got my shit together, told a couple of people that were there.\n\n01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.140\nSo I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to be here anymore.\n\n01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:13.140\nWhat I didn't find out is that you were in the hallway with like a security guard and\n\n01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.140\nthe lady for a long time.\n\n01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.140\nIt's scary.\n\n01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:20.140\nI went right out and called the lift to bone the fuck out.\n\n01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:26.140\nAnd I got out in the hallway, leaving the bar, leaving the hotel and a guy with the\n\n01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.140\near monitor and the suit.\n\n01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.140\nBurbank, California.\n\n01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:34.140\nComes up to me and he goes, with a woman, I think it was also probably like some sort\n\n01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.140\nof manager at the hotel.\n\n01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:38.140\nAnd I'm like, sir, you have to go.\n\n01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.140\nI'm leaving.\n\n01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.140\nI'm calling my car right now.\n\n01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:45.140\nI saw a long conversation and then I asked Cali, should I go over there?\n\n01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:47.140\nYou have to go.\n\n01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.140\nI wouldn't stay here on a bet.\n\n01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:54.140\nI said, and believe me, I'm sorry if this ever involves you.\n\n01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.140\nI'm not going to cause any trouble.\n\n01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:59.140\nI'm simply leaving.\n\n01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.140\nI'm just calling a car.\n\n01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:03.140\nWe can walk outside to where the car is coming.\n\n01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.140\nAnd that was the end of the story.\n\n01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:09.140\nHowever, I've never ripped up currency and thrown it in somebody's face.\n\n01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.140\nThat was shocking.\n\n01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.140\nThat is amazing.\n\n01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:12.140\nThat shocked me.\n\n01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.140\nI've never seen Jeff so angry.\n\n01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.140\nThey lied to me.\n\n01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:18.140\nThey lied back to me and you were just like, fuck this place.\n\n01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:21.140\nThere was five fucking dollars in that fucking jar.\n\n01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.140\nI've never seen you mean.\n\n01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.140\nAnd they pretended like we had never met.\n\n01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.140\nI've never seen Jeff angry.\n\n01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:27.140\nOn stage telling everyone to fuck off.\n\n01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:34.140\nI don't presume that five dollars in the plastic Costco pretzel jar that you took the\n\n01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:38.140\nlabel off and scrubbed it down so it didn't look like there was a pretzel label on there.\n\n01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:40.140\nThat is your shitty tip jar.\n\n01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:45.140\nI don't presume that five dollars in that jar entitles me to shit.\n\n01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:51.140\nBut just don't fucking pretend that we never spoke because it was within the hour.\n\n01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.140\nAnd we were fucking there.\n\n01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:57.140\nYou know, what's funny is every time I read it, I'm like, here's your money.\n\n01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.140\nI'm like, here's your fucking money, lady.\n\n01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:02.140\nAlso, Jeff is the only six-foot guy in a suit.\n\n01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.140\nRight, right, right.\n\n01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:06.140\nEveryone else was just like Bono.\n\n01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.140\nI'm not saying I'm here.\n\n01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:11.140\nI was ashamed of myself.\n\n01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:13.140\nI still did not feel good about that.\n\n01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.140\nI'm not saying I'm a good guy.\n\n01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:20.140\nWhat I did do is fuck off into Koreatown, went to a karaoke place where it was fucking\n\n01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:22.140\na groovy Tuesday, man.\n\n01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:23.140\nOh, sure.\n\n01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.140\nI'm sure.\n\n01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.140\nSee what's a better one.\n\n01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.140\nWe should have all gone there.\n\n01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.140\nFive fucking minutes after you left.\n\n01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.140\nJeff D is Jeff D there.\n\n01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.140\nWell, yeah, they're Jeff D.\n\n01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:34.140\nThey didn't even know.\n\n01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.140\nI wasn't on that list.\n\n01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:36.140\nI saw the list.\n\n01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:39.140\nThey showed it to me and they gave me the fucking short shrift.\n\n01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.140\nIt was an accident is what I'm thinking.\n\n01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.140\nThere's no accident in karaoke.\n\n01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.140\nI want to point out that if...\n\n01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:45.140\nNo, they called him twice.\n\n01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:48.140\nIf Jeff had done that on Twitter, it would be called a meltdown.\n\n01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.140\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.140\nThat's called a meltdown.\n\n01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:52.140\nI honestly...\n\n01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.140\nHe melted down.\n\n01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:56.140\nI never tipped until that night.\n\n01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:58.140\nNo, Dan, you would have always got up.\n\n01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.140\nDan, you would have taken $1,000, $5 bills and torn it up.\n\n01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.140\nNo, I would have fucking...\n\n01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:05.140\nI mean, believe me, I'm not.\n\n01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.140\nThere's a couple...\n\n01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:09.140\nThere's a lot of fascinating things are happening.\n\n01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.140\nI brought Abbot up here to exploit him.\n\n01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.140\nI thought he was going to be the guy in the jar.\n\n01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:15.140\nYou are definitely the...\n\n01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.140\nYou are...\n\n01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.140\nI'm not saying I'm not on your side.\n\n01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:19.140\nNo, I'm fucking Batman.\n\n01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:20.140\nBut you were wrong.\n\n01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.140\nThis is worth talking about.\n\n01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.140\nThis was worth talking about.\n\n01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.140\nThat's what I texted you.\n\n01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:28.140\nI feel like you should know this.\n\n01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.140\nGwen, baby.\n\n01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.140\nGwen, get up here.\n\n01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.140\nGwen, baby.\n\n01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.140\nGwen, where are you from?\n\n01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:34.140\nDelaware?\n\n01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.140\nIowa.\n\n01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:39.140\nI have an interesting story about that.\n\n01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:40.140\nGwen, get up here.\n\n01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.140\nI got an interesting story.\n\n01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.140\nThis is Gwen, baby, everybody.\n\n01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140\nAbout you guys.\n\n01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140\nI...\n\n01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140\nHey, Jeff, real quick.\n\n01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.140\nThat applause is very apprehensive.\n\n01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.140\nEveryone's like, what the fuck is happening?\n\n01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.140\nI was buying a drink.\n\n01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:56.140\nI was at the bar buying a drink and you were there with your two friends.\n\n01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:59.140\nI didn't know them, but they were talking about you.\n\n01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.140\nRight.\n\n01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:02.140\nAnd I was eavesdropping because they didn't know that I knew you.\n\n01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:03.140\nOkay.\n\n01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:07.140\nAnd they were saying, like, who wears a suit to a bar like this?\n\n01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.140\nRight.\n\n01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.140\nAnd I thought that was funny.\n\n01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:14.140\nBut people want to know if Gwen's the bouncer at the karaoke party they need to know.\n\n01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:15.140\nGwen is from Iowa.\n\n01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.140\nI met her.\n\n01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.140\nYou're traveling.\n\n01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:22.140\nI met her at the drawing room and that day I said, my friend, Abed, real Abed from community.\n\n01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:24.140\nHe said, oh, I know community.\n\n01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.140\nReal Abed from community.\n\n01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.140\nWell, Jeff was building me up, yeah.\n\n01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.140\nI was saying, we're talking about karaoke.\n\n01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:35.140\nI said, I'm going to do karaoke with my friend Abed, who is famously the inspiration for Abed\n\n01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.140\nfrom community.\n\n01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:40.140\nWe went, but Gwen, you texted me today and said you have been kicked out of three places\n\n01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.140\nin two nights?\n\n01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.140\nYeah.\n\n01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:47.140\nI've never been kicked out of a place and I came to LA for one day and I've been kicked\n\n01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.140\nout of three.\n\n01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.140\nIncluding a Holiday Inn in Burbank, California.\n\n01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:53.140\nYeah, but yours was my favorite for sure.\n\n01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:54.140\nYeah.\n\n01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:57.140\nBecause I destroyed, I destroyed Lincoln's effigy.\n\n01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.140\nWhat a birthday.\n\n01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.140\nWhat a birthday.\n\n01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.140\nGood job.\n\n01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.140\nI'm sad though because it is a cool karaoke place.\n\n01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.140\nThere's some weirdos there and you got like the worst end of it.\n\n01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:07.140\nI didn't like the sound set up.\n\n01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:12.140\nYou should say, before all the Jeff crazy shit happened.\n\n01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:13.140\nBad speakers.\n\n01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.140\nMy friend Ben Page, you know Ben Page.\n\n01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.140\nI know Ben Page.\n\n01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:21.140\nYeah, he's a karaoke genius and he went up and he did like Pink Floyd the wall, like\n\n01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.140\none of the songs and then like they had some sort of like the version of it was shitty\n\n01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.140\nand in the middle of the song, he just walked off the stage.\n\n01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.140\nShit.\n\n01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:32.140\nYeah, and he's like, that version sucks.\n\n01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:33.140\nIt was an off night.\n\n01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:37.140\nYeah, and I'm like, you can't just walk off the stage in the middle of the song, dude.\n\n01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:38.140\nLike I felt bad.\n\n01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:41.140\nI was like, sounds like I'm kind of a hero for not going to your birthday.\n\n01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.140\nIt's quite a secret.\n\n01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:45.140\nYeah, Dan, you're off the hook, man.\n\n01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.140\nYou're off the hook.\n\n01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.140\nTry staying there and doing karaoke after that happens.\n\n01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.140\nIt's impossible.\n\n01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.140\nIt's like nobody's having fun.\n\n01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:58.140\nAll right, but what other ideas do you have that you could try to explain?\n\n01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.140\nWhat ideas?\n\n01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:02.140\nI didn't know I didn't have ideas coming on here.\n\n01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:06.140\nDo you have any, you know, you're famous for having pitched a restaurant idea.\n\n01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:07.140\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.140\nYeah.\n\n01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:09.140\nOh, he wants more ideas.\n\n01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:11.140\nDo you have any inventions or a shit you want to lay on this?\n\n01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.140\nIt's just a hope.\n\n01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.140\nIt's just a hope.\n\n01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.140\nHe's hoping for something.\n\n01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.140\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.140\nDon't make up on the things you don't have.\n\n01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.140\nI talk about my spec I'm writing.\n\n01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.140\nNo.\n\n01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.140\nBecause that's kind of an idea.\n\n01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:23.140\nWill you talk about the cop that hit on you?\n\n01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.140\nOh, the cop.\n\n01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.140\nBut that's, I'm saving that for GVP though.\n\n01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:28.140\nShould I?\n\n01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:31.140\nFirst of all, they're GVP now.\n\n01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:35.140\nI was saving that for their episode.\n\n01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.140\nBut all right, I'll do it.\n\n01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.140\nI'll talk about it.\n\n01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:41.140\nWhen grandma's virginity starts churning out once a week, they can have exclusives.\n\n01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.140\nJustin and Ryan really.\n\n01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.140\nCan I get a hit of that?\n\n01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.140\nWhat is that?\n\n01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.140\nThat's medication.\n\n01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:49.140\nI have a prescription in that.\n\n01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:55.140\nI pulled it out and it was, I don't want to cause chaos.\n\n01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.140\nLet's all ground ourselves.\n\n01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.140\nWell, you want the cop story, the lady cop story?\n\n01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.140\nI'd like it.\n\n01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:04.140\nAnd also, I want to place a super fight like you guys played in Chicago too.\n\n01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:05.140\nCan we do that tonight or now?\n\n01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.140\nI want to hear about getting kicked out of three places in one.\n\n01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.140\nOkay.\n\n01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.140\nWhat were the other two joints that you got bounced out of?\n\n01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:15.140\nHow did you get kicked out of the karaoke place?\n\n01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:19.140\nI kicked myself out of a holiday in Burbank.\n\n01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.140\nHe left.\n\n01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:22.140\nHe was like, he was done.\n\n01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:23.140\nAll right.\n\n01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:27.140\nWell, let's pick, just so everybody understands, let's create like a Starship Troopers graphic\n\n01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.140\npackage where would you like to know more?\n\n01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.140\nOkay.\n\n01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.140\nWe're going with Gwen getting kicked out of three places.\n\n01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.140\nOkay.\n\n01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.140\nLet's go there.\n\n01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.140\nSo let's all go there together.\n\n01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.140\nEyes wide open.\n\n01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.140\nGwen.\n\n01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:38.140\nStarship troopers?\n\n01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140\nStarship troopers.\n\n01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.140\nI don't remember that part.\n\n01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.140\nAll right.\n\n01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:42.140\nPut a pin in it.\n\n01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:44.140\nI'm going to have to look that up later.\n\n01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:45.140\nOkay.\n\n01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.140\nBecause Gwen, three places in how many days?\n\n01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:50.140\nIt was like two.\n\n01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:51.140\nOkay.\n\n01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.140\nAnd I don't know.\n\n01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:57.140\nBottomless mimosas aren't bottomless, first of all.\n\n01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.140\nShots fired.\n\n01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.140\nThat's true.\n\n01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:02.140\nShe's saying what we're all thinking.\n\n01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:06.140\nAnd the other place that we got kicked out of was because of the bottomless mimosas.\n\n01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:11.140\nYou found out that you drink too many mimosas and like, okay, bottomless is a subjective\n\n01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.140\nterm.\n\n01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.140\nThey came out and said, this has to eventually end.\n\n01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.900\nThey said, wow.\n\n01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:17.900\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:23.020\nThat's like, you're in World War II and Nazis come out and they go like, look, we get it.\n\n01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.020\nYou love freedom.\n\n01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.300\nThat was a terrible example.\n\n01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.300\nYou couldn't find the bottom.\n\n01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:31.020\nI feel like the glass was really low.\n\n01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:32.020\nGwen, okay.\n\n01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.020\nLet's just take us through.\n\n01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:36.500\nSo as a person who got kicked out of three places in two days, take us first one, second\n\n01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.500\none, third one.\n\n01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.500\nNumber one.\n\n01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:39.500\nRight.\n\n01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.500\nOkay.\n\n01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:41.500\nHow did that kick you out?\n\n01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:42.500\nNumber one, me tearing up money at the Halloween.\n\n01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.500\nI ended up going to that place three times.\n\n01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500\nBut I understand.\n\n01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:45.500\nHow did you get kicked out?\n\n01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.500\nYeah.\n\n01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.500\nExactly.\n\n01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.500\nWhen I did that, I knew.\n\n01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.500\nNo, we know you.\n\n01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.500\nWhy her?\n\n01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.500\nBecause she was with me.\n\n01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.500\nShe was his boss.\n\n01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.500\nWe don't know that.\n\n01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.500\nWe don't know that.\n\n01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.500\nJeff had a date.\n\n01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.500\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.500\nWe don't know that.\n\n01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.500\nThere was her and her two friends.\n\n01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.500\nIt was like a whole group.\n\n01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:00.500\nYeah.\n\n01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.500\nJeff had a platonic date.\n\n01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.500\nWait.\n\n01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.500\nSo you guys.\n\n01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500\nI brought a woman from Iowa with her friends up to the bar.\n\n01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500\nThey already knew that you were going to be there.\n\n01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.980\nThey talked to the bar like they didn't know you.\n\n01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:11.500\nI met Gwen that day at the drawing.\n\n01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500\nI bet you didn't know this was going to happen.\n\n01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500\nYou're going to be talking about it in front of all these people.\n\n01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:16.500\nI eavesdropped.\n\n01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.500\nIt sounded like they didn't know who you were.\n\n01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:18.500\nAnd they were making fun of you.\n\n01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.500\nI bet does anybody truly know who I am?\n\n01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.500\nYeah.\n\n01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.500\nI'd like to know you.\n\n01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.500\nSo you think if they knew who he was, he'd get better treatment?\n\n01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.500\nIs that what you're saying?\n\n01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.500\nNo, I don't know.\n\n01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.500\nI don't think they cares it.\n\n01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.500\nAll right, all right, all right.\n\n01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.500\nSo that's the price is right.\n\n01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.500\nGwen's second place you got kicked out of.\n\n01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.500\nThe place with the mimosas.\n\n01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.500\nI don't know what the fuck that was.\n\n01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:39.500\nYou drank them out of champagne and orange juice.\n\n01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.500\nAll right.\n\n01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.500\nOkay.\n\n01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.500\nAnd then the other place, we walked down the street like two bars down.\n\n01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:50.500\nAnd then Logan fell asleep on the bar and we had to go.\n\n01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.500\nFall asleep on the bar.\n\n01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.500\nYeah.\n\n01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:54.500\nLogan, you son of a bitch.\n\n01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.500\nFor like 45 minutes.\n\n01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.500\nWhat bar?\n\n01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500\nWas that the guy?\n\n01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:58.500\nWas that the guy that was with you guys?\n\n01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:59.500\nNot a very good bar.\n\n01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.500\nThat was the guy that was with you guys, right?\n\n01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.500\nNo.\n\n01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.500\nLogan's the girl.\n\n01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.500\nOh, Logan's the girl.\n\n01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.500\nYou?\n\n01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.500\nOkay.\n\n01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.500\nLogan.\n\n01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:07.500\nI thought that was a man's name.\n\n01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.500\nWell, it's Wolverine.\n\n01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.500\nI mean, I'm sorry.\n\n01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.500\nNo.\n\n01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.500\nI mean, my Wolverine brain went to like that.\n\n01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.500\nI pictured a dude at first too.\n\n01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.500\nYeah.\n\n01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:16.500\nWe're on the same page.\n\n01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:20.340\nSo you were asked to leave or gently left places that you probably shouldn't have stayed\n\n01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.340\nin.\n\n01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:22.340\nIt was go both times.\n\n01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:26.660\nAnd it was someone who really didn't, both times it was someone I felt bad for them having\n\n01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.660\nto do it.\n\n01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:28.660\nGlenn, okay.\n\n01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.660\nNow I'm remembering.\n\n01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.660\nGlenn has an awesome story.\n\n01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:34.260\nCan we talk about your origin story of you, you and Iowa?\n\n01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:41.980\nShe's famous in this very small part of Iowa for being like, just in the movie Footloose.\n\n01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:44.140\nShe's like all the Kevin Bacon's in the world.\n\n01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.700\nWait, the remake or the old classic?\n\n01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.860\nCan we talk about this or is this bad?\n\n01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:49.860\nAre we adding flame?\n\n01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.860\nYeah.\n\n01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.860\nIt's fine.\n\n01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860\nNo, it's totally okay.\n\n01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.860\nThe classic.\n\n01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:54.860\nI don't think anyone in Iowa knows that this exists.\n\n01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:55.860\nIt's okay.\n\n01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.180\nDo you want to tell it?\n\n01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.180\nYou can start.\n\n01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.180\nI don't know where to start.\n\n01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:00.180\nWell, I met her.\n\n01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:02.260\nShe grew up, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:07.460\nYou grew up in a very, not evangelical, but fundamentalist Christian time where you had\n\n01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.540\nto wear a head covering.\n\n01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.020\nDancing was prescribed like illegal, right?\n\n01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.020\nYeah.\n\n01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.020\nAnd you had to wear a head covering.\n\n01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.820\nYou can still do square dancing.\n\n01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820\nThat's fine.\n\n01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.180\nBecause you're not touching.\n\n01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:24.740\nBut at her school, her mother was the vice president or principal of the college.\n\n01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:28.860\nAnd of a very fundamentalist Christian school, where there's lots of rules, you're not allowed\n\n01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.780\nto be in a car alone with a boy.\n\n01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.780\nThat's grounds for expulsion.\n\n01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:33.900\nYeah, that's like my dad always said that.\n\n01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:34.900\nAll right.\n\n01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:40.660\nSo he was like, no girl, you and just a girl, you know, like none of that.\n\n01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:41.660\nAll right.\n\n01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:44.660\nWell, your dad was just protecting the community.\n\n01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:45.660\nOuch.\n\n01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:46.660\nOuch.\n\n01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:52.180\nI'm not a, you win, you win, you win this round.\n\n01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.180\nHow old were you?\n\n01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:58.100\nWhat was the first, uh, transgression?\n\n01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.660\nThe first time you got rumbled at school.\n\n01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.980\nOh, I blew a dude and he told on me.\n\n01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:03.980\nOh, I hate when that happens.\n\n01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:04.980\nI wouldn't tell.\n\n01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.980\nHe falsely had sinned.\n\n01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:09.620\nI'm like, what the heck is this?\n\n01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:14.620\nIn his defense at that age, if you get blown, I mean, and you don't tell anybody, did it\n\n01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620\neven happen?\n\n01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:20.100\nHe probably didn't even mean to get you in trouble.\n\n01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:22.700\nHe was just like, oh my God, that felt so good.\n\n01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:24.220\nNow, God damn it.\n\n01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.420\nI'm sure they've ever met it.\n\n01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:27.420\nYeah.\n\n01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:32.820\nBut he told to like expiate his own sins, but also that sent you up the river.\n\n01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.820\nYes.\n\n01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.820\nOh God.\n\n01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:35.820\nThat's awful.\n\n01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:36.820\nAnd then your, and then the second one was what?\n\n01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:43.420\nI drove some kids to a party and I like had a hit from a joint and then I got told on.\n\n01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.420\nAll right.\n\n01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:45.420\nSo you got told on twice, kicked out of the school.\n\n01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:49.380\nShe was like Bill Clinton, you know, took a hit, got in trouble.\n\n01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.660\nShe was also hit her own Monica Lewinsky.\n\n01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:52.660\nYeah.\n\n01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660\nOh yeah.\n\n01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.260\nShe had both, she's liked Bill Clinton.\n\n01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:57.260\nYeah.\n\n01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.260\nFemale Bill Clinton.\n\n01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.260\nWow.\n\n01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:03.620\nSo you, so both times you got told on by male students, right?\n\n01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620\nYeah.\n\n01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.420\nAnd they probably didn't suffer any consequences because that's.\n\n01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.420\nProbably less.\n\n01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:09.420\nMale privilege, right?\n\n01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:11.060\nI remember the word harlot being thrown around.\n\n01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:12.060\nOh.\n\n01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.660\nSo you're the Hester Prynne of this town.\n\n01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.260\nWait, wait, was it for the blowjob or the weed?\n\n01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:17.260\nBoth.\n\n01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.260\nOkay.\n\n01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:19.260\nThat, that makes you a harlot.\n\n01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.260\nYou can't just do one.\n\n01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.260\nBecause she's a female.\n\n01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.260\nI'll bet.\n\n01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:25.820\nNo, I mean, I didn't even think of in that zone.\n\n01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.820\nAll right.\n\n01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:27.820\nYou're right.\n\n01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.820\nYou're right.\n\n01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:29.820\nFair enough.\n\n01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:30.820\nFair enough.\n\n01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.820\nI'm going to step aside here.\n\n01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:37.140\nSo before I get, you take it down 20%, she goes up 20%.\n\n01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.620\nThat's like, we're doing a symphony.\n\n01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:39.620\nIt's all math.\n\n01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.620\nYeah.\n\n01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:41.620\nYou're right.\n\n01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.620\nYou're right.\n\n01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:43.620\nAll right.\n\n01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.460\nSo you're the top brass at the.\n\n01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.100\nNo, not really.\n\n01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:48.100\nJust me.\n\n01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:49.100\nIt just, yeah.\n\n01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.700\nBut it didn't, it didn't affect her like standing in the community or?\n\n01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.700\nNo.\n\n01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:54.700\nNo.\n\n01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.700\nNo.\n\n01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.700\nBut you still live in the community.\n\n01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.700\nYeah.\n\n01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.700\nAnd now when people find you, if people run into you, they either think, oh, I didn't\n\n01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.740\nknow that you actually, you're like Paul Bunyan.\n\n01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:02.740\nLike you're an actual folk more.\n\n01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:03.740\nThere's two.\n\n01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:04.740\nThere's, I think there's rules.\n\n01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:05.740\nPaul Bunyan.\n\n01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:09.980\nThere's rules at the school now because of me, but there's also, there's also, I work\n\n01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:14.740\nat a bar and people will come in and it will be one of two, not to drink because it's coffee\n\n01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:15.740\nafter any day.\n\n01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:16.740\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:22.540\nBut they go to the school and they'll come in and I either get, oh, I, there's another\n\n01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.820\none and they think I'm my sister or.\n\n01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:25.820\nAre you twins?\n\n01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:33.860\nNo, she's three years older than me, but, or it's, oh, oh, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't\n\n01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:35.100\nknow that was real.\n\n01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.220\nLike that's, yeah.\n\n01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:38.220\nSo it's kind of, yeah.\n\n01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:39.220\nI'm folklore.\n\n01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:40.220\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:43.740\nBut you mean, well, meaning that they didn't know it was real, that you got punished, that\n\n01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:44.740\nyou were just kind of.\n\n01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:45.740\nThat existed.\n\n01:43:45.740 -->

I\n\n01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:09.560\nmean I was excommunicated from testing for eating too much pussy that see that doesn't happen it's\n\n01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:17.720\nlike I ate a girl's pussy and she told me first of all she never tells fucking betrayed me it's\n\n01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:23.160\nkind of like sucking a dick is like a power trip right it's kind of like it's like a domination\n\n01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:29.400\nthing I think you're no yeah I think it's called a blowjob because it's a job you have to like\n\n01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:35.000\nreally try to suck that dick make it feel good a lot of girls don't like that dick I think you're\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.640\ncoming you're you're swirling around my point but I am but also surrounding my point is like\n\n01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:46.440\nwhy it's called a blowjob let me talk like a six-year-old for a second and just bound through\n\n01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:50.840\nthis minefield I'm not gonna try to be politically correct or win any points my when I hear that\n\n01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:56.840\nstuff I just go but a woman sucking your dick is the biggest favor she could ever do you\n\n01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:03.000\nin your life and the the idea that that also makes you a slut instead of a saint is insane\n\n01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:09.800\nlike I just that a young that a young guy like she's it's not like it's not like she's indulging\n\n01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:16.520\nher impulses it's like she's indulging a natural like like oh that's such a highly evolved person\n\n01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:22.920\nthat at that age she wanted to give something to someone but in a community that repressed\n\n01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.920\nthat the guy can go oh I feel really guilty about this I'm gonna turn us both in and she's the one\n\n01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.360\nthat gets in trouble not me I think that's fucked honestly as a dude and having been that age like\n\n01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:40.680\nI said as a joke but it's like still it's like I think the the the original the foundation of it is\n\n01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:47.800\nif you're a dude and you find out that it's possible for a girl to like you enough to give of herself\n\n01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.640\nto you you can't you start to get obsessed and you go like but what if no one ever knows this\n\n01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:59.320\nhappened and I got hit by a bus and when that thought hits you unfortunately you're in a locker\n\n01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.000\nroom in the middle of pickpickipsy or whatever Gwen Gwen do you think there was any braggadocio\n\n01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.320\nor do you think it was just guilt in him trying to because you're religious right he was religious\n\n01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.080\nthere's no difference between guilt and braggadocio by the way let's just like so that's the same\n\n01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:18.520\nthing bless me father for I've sinned I fucking like a chick fucking thought I was hot like oh I'm\n\n01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:24.440\njust dying about it because like she she said like she had fundamentalist like it's pretty hardcore\n\n01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:29.800\nreligious it's like you know he actually felt bad yeah growing up Muslim we never got but I mean\n\n01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:33.240\nwhen you're bragging about someone blowing you don't usually tell like the president of your\n\n01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:40.440\ncollege so you said he was also kind of like a huckster car salesman he kind of yeah yeah\n\n01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.520\nso he was full of shit that's kind of like level two and it's like it's like the joke that\n\n01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.120\nwhere an old guy goes in a confessional and the priest opens the door and it's a very old man\n\n01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:52.120\nand the priest says how can I help you and he says I've been happily married for 50
