00:00.300 --> 00:03.100
Zero audio

00:23.500 --> 00:24.500
Hey

00:25.000 --> 00:25.500
World

00:25.700 --> 00:26.200
Hey World

00:26.200 --> 00:33.480
Welcome once again to Hollywood, California, down down,

00:33.480 --> 00:35.080
Conviction, the Nerdin' of Theater.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.640
Harmontown is now in second.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.140
Woo!

00:37.140 --> 00:43.200
I am so happy that you, son of my Jesus, fill us in the

00:43.200 --> 00:44.200
in not you.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.840
Don't bring around the flowers.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.240
Will you please welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown,

00:48.240 --> 00:49.120
Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:49.120 --> 00:49.620
Woo!

00:49.620 --> 00:58.620
Hello, thank you.

00:58.620 --> 01:04.620
Thank you very much.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.180
Another record-setting crowd.

01:07.180 --> 01:10.620
It was really hard to not tell you guys about the

01:10.620 --> 01:13.540
community thing last week.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.620
If you were here, I was sitting on that.

01:16.620 --> 01:19.620
That was a sharp secret to sit on.

01:19.620 --> 01:24.620
I'm not known for my secretiveness, secrecy.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.620
Do you think if you had secretions?

01:26.620 --> 01:27.620
Secretions.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.620
I am known for various secretions.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.620
You're primarily known for your secretions.

01:32.620 --> 01:33.620
Yes.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.620
Do you think that you said something last week that you

01:35.620 --> 01:37.620
could have queered the deal in some way?

01:37.620 --> 01:40.620
Raisist.

01:40.620 --> 01:44.620
No, I just would have gotten yelled at by people whose job

01:44.620 --> 01:47.620
is to do an unqueered deal.

01:47.620 --> 01:51.620
My agent, publicist, you know, people, I would have made

01:51.620 --> 01:54.620
their job harder by announcing, you know, there's

01:54.620 --> 01:57.620
actors' deals closing, writers' deals closing, my deal

01:57.620 --> 01:59.620
closing, blah, blah, blah.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.620
I don't really know how the stuff works.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.620
I just know that I get yelled at when I say too much,

02:04.620 --> 02:05.620
too soon.

02:05.620 --> 02:06.620
So what is the deal now?

02:06.620 --> 02:08.620
What do we now have to say?

02:08.620 --> 02:13.620
13 episodes on the inimitable Yahoo Network.

02:13.620 --> 02:23.620
The home of great television.

02:23.620 --> 02:24.620
Wait, wait, wait.

02:24.620 --> 02:29.620
Not, Jeff, not since the Lycos, I Love Lucy merger,

02:29.620 --> 02:34.620
has a search engine and a television show,

02:34.620 --> 02:38.620
but so aptly paired.

02:38.620 --> 02:42.620
What's your favorite Yahoo TV show?

02:42.620 --> 02:48.620
I talked to the chief marketing officer, the CMO,

02:48.620 --> 02:52.620
I didn't even know that was a thing, on the phone.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.620
Is he Native American?

02:54.620 --> 02:59.620
She is a very powerful woman, Jeff, who can crush us

02:59.620 --> 03:03.620
with a phone call or a text message.

03:03.620 --> 03:07.620
But why would they be Native American?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.620
Your question just started.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.620
Her name is chief marketing officer.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.620
Oh, Jesus Christ.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.620
Oh, boy.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.620
Oh, boy.

03:17.620 --> 03:21.620
Dan, there was much power in your TV show.

03:21.620 --> 03:27.620
There was great magic in the op-ed character.

03:27.620 --> 03:32.620
My viewership soars like a, like the spirit,

03:32.620 --> 03:35.620
like the baby eagle leaving its nest.

03:35.620 --> 03:36.620
Why is this okay?

03:36.620 --> 03:40.620
Is it just because they're vanishing?

03:40.620 --> 03:45.620
They're just, they have no chance of mounting a...

03:45.620 --> 03:48.620
I think I'm empowering Native Americans by exalting them

03:48.620 --> 03:50.620
to chief marketing executive.

03:50.620 --> 03:54.620
No, I think it's fine, but I also, I mean,

03:54.620 --> 03:56.620
compared to other things that aren't fine,

03:56.620 --> 03:58.620
I'm just wondering, like, these poor...

03:58.620 --> 04:01.620
I miss you old Dan who didn't care about any of that shit, man.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.620
Oh, God, are you kidding me?

04:03.620 --> 04:05.620
But I wouldn't survive this world.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.620
The world has changed under our feet, bro.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.620
The world has changed you, man.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.620
You know, I mean, I've become super hyper-conscious of,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.620
you know, I look back, like eight years ago,

04:14.620 --> 04:16.620
I would just liberally, like, I don't know,

04:16.620 --> 04:18.620
I would just, I was just, oh, man, I would,

04:18.620 --> 04:21.620
I called my brother a fag on Twitter

04:21.620 --> 04:26.620
because he said he loved his daughter.

04:26.620 --> 04:30.620
That was, that was the beginning of my realization

04:30.620 --> 04:33.620
that the world had changed because my brother tweeted,

04:33.620 --> 04:35.620
I love my daughter so much, I was like,

04:35.620 --> 04:37.620
I just replied fag.

04:37.620 --> 04:41.620
And then, like, real responses from people going,

04:41.620 --> 04:45.620
like, that's incredibly rude and tacky and hurtful

04:45.620 --> 04:48.620
and a word that's been used to hurt people on playgrounds.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.620
You, of all people, should know about bullying

04:50.620 --> 04:54.620
and I was, I was catastrophed.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.620
Well, we're gonna bring somebody up in a minute

04:56.620 --> 04:59.620
that knows bigger words and how to use them.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.620
So I'm not gonna enter his territory.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.620
But I was...

05:02.620 --> 05:04.620
Are you saying catastrophed is not an actual word?

05:04.620 --> 05:05.620
I don't know, is it?

05:05.620 --> 05:06.620
We'll find out when he comes up.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.620
I was mortified, let's say that.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.620
I was, I was, I didn't really,

05:09.620 --> 05:11.620
I wasn't really looking at myself through that camera

05:11.620 --> 05:14.620
so I do think I got healthier by some of this.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.620
I also think that, you know,

05:16.620 --> 05:20.620
the millennial outrage movement is, you know,

05:20.620 --> 05:24.620
a neo-fascist one and that it's incredibly dangerous

05:24.620 --> 05:26.620
to put so much value on words

05:26.620 --> 05:28.620
because some of the worst people in the world

05:28.620 --> 05:29.620
put value on language.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.620
Some of the worst people in the world

05:31.620 --> 05:33.620
are, pride themselves in their diplomacy

05:33.620 --> 05:36.620
and use language to get away with horrible behavior.

05:36.620 --> 05:41.620
So it's dangerous to focus so much energy

05:41.620 --> 05:44.620
on cleansing the world of bad words

05:44.620 --> 05:46.620
because you're gonna be in the same camp

05:46.620 --> 05:48.620
as Snickers and the Pentagon.

05:50.620 --> 05:51.620
What did you just say?

05:54.620 --> 05:55.620
Catastrophied?

05:55.620 --> 05:56.620
No.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.620
Oh, Snickers and the Pentagon.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.620
Yeah.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.620
Oh, Jesus.

06:06.620 --> 06:10.620
Jeff's racism unfurls like a mighty teepee flag.

06:14.620 --> 06:17.620
Much hatred expressed in your language.

06:20.620 --> 06:21.620
Keep going, baby.

06:21.620 --> 06:24.620
I just, I love doing that accent, that voice is like,

06:24.620 --> 06:26.620
I think it's like the same actor,

06:26.620 --> 06:28.620
like that we're all doing when we do a Native American guy.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.620
It's like, isn't it like a specific actor

06:31.620 --> 06:33.620
that talks like this?

06:33.620 --> 06:34.620
No?

06:34.620 --> 06:36.620
We got our guest out, he might know.

06:36.620 --> 06:37.620
Yeah.

06:37.620 --> 06:38.620
It's Bert Lancaster.

06:38.620 --> 06:39.620
Okay.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.620
Shit, shit, one more thing before we start

06:43.620 --> 06:45.620
the celebrity train rolling.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.620
Fuck, fuck, god damn it.

06:48.620 --> 06:51.620
It was right on the tip of my dumb 41-year-old

06:51.620 --> 06:52.620
Swiss cheese brain.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.620
No, no, I'm not.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.620
Oh, yeah, I have some drunk voicemails

06:55.620 --> 06:58.620
from the head of Yahoo.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.620
It seems like a good idea.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.620
Just to seal the deal.

07:05.620 --> 07:06.620
God damn it.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.620
Shit, shit, I totally forgot.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.620
Oh, oh, I was on the plane.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.620
Dino pointed this out.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.620
He was quoting someone.

07:15.620 --> 07:17.620
I feel like it was Louis C.K.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.620
or somebody was talking about this.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.620
All of the pilots, when they talk,

07:23.620 --> 07:27.620
they're all doing like an impression of Chuck Yeager.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.620
They don't even realize they're doing it.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.620
They're talking the way they think airplane people

07:32.620 --> 07:34.620
should talk right about now.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.620
Look out your window, there's Topeka.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.620
Who gives a fuck?

07:38.620 --> 07:41.620
Those people need to shut the fuck up, man.

07:41.620 --> 07:43.620
That's not new comedic territory.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.620
The food's bad too and the peanuts are too small.

07:45.620 --> 07:48.620
But I'm saying, it seems like every passing year

07:48.620 --> 07:50.620
the pilots got more shit to say.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.620
I'm telling you, I mean, I know you had to go

07:52.620 --> 07:54.620
to school to do what you do, but you're pressing

07:54.620 --> 07:56.620
three buttons and it's a flying tube.

07:56.620 --> 08:00.620
And you just got to shut up.

08:00.620 --> 08:03.620
You didn't go into broadcasting.

08:03.620 --> 08:06.620
If that's your passion, if you want to talk to people,

08:06.620 --> 08:10.620
I'm trying to play like Pokemons or something.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.620
I refreshingly had a pilot who, to give you

08:14.620 --> 08:17.620
a vocal approximation, Yosemite Sam.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.620
He sounded like Yosemite Sam.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.620
All right, everybody, just buckle on in.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.620
We're going to go over to Rocky Mountains now.

08:24.620 --> 08:28.620
He sounded like the instructions on Big Thunder Mountain

08:28.620 --> 08:30.620
at Disneyland.

08:30.620 --> 08:34.620
Keep your hands and arms inside the plane at all times.

08:34.620 --> 08:37.620
Here's who wildest ride or no weirdness.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.620
But he said, I saw him coming up.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.620
We were in the jetway, the airway, the walkway

08:43.620 --> 08:45.620
when you get on the fucker.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.620
And he kept coming through, make a hole,

08:48.620 --> 08:50.620
make a hole, I'm coming through.

08:50.620 --> 08:52.620
And he's like, man, I got to get this paperwork right.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.620
And he got on the plane, then came back out

08:54.620 --> 08:55.620
and came back up the aisle.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.620
We're all waiting to get on the plane.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.620
He's like, we're not leaving until this paperwork is right.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.620
We're not leaving.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.620
Paperwork is wrong.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.620
And he came back and he got on the plane and said,

09:04.620 --> 09:05.620
we're like, this is our pilot.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.620
He seems all right.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.620
Then we get on and he goes, ladies and gentlemen,

09:09.620 --> 09:11.620
we're going to go over to Rocky Mountains right now.

09:11.620 --> 09:14.620
And I got some telemetry information.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.620
The worst turbulence you've probably ever been through

09:17.620 --> 09:18.620
in your life.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.620
So I'm telling you all right now,

09:19.620 --> 09:23.620
and I'm not trying to alarm anybody,

09:23.620 --> 09:26.620
put your seatbelts on as tight as you can put them on

09:26.620 --> 09:29.620
and keep them on until I tell you to not keep them on

09:29.620 --> 09:32.620
because we're going to go through some bad turbulence.

09:32.620 --> 09:36.620
And then he keeps saying, I'm not trying to alarm you.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.620
I'm just saying this is no joke.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.620
Then we went over to the Rockies and it was like,

09:41.620 --> 09:42.620
if you didn't have your seatbelt on,

09:42.620 --> 09:44.620
you would have had a broken neck.

09:44.620 --> 09:47.620
And then he kind of smug and he's like,

09:47.620 --> 09:49.620
well, I guess I wasn't fucking with you people.

09:49.620 --> 09:52.620
What's that?

09:52.620 --> 09:56.620
Looks like someone knows their air travel.

09:56.620 --> 10:00.620
I'm the rootin' of students.

10:00.620 --> 10:03.620
The pilot on my flight from Miami to Dallas,

10:03.620 --> 10:04.620
I caught a glimpse of him.

10:04.620 --> 10:05.620
You know how they do this thing?

10:05.620 --> 10:08.620
They put the lunch wagon in front of the thing

10:08.620 --> 10:12.620
to block the 9-11ers.

10:12.620 --> 10:16.620
Because everything changed after 9-11.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.620
Everything for us changed.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.620
We have to take off our shoes.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.620
We have to get naked.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.620
We have to have rectal exams.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.620
But when the pilot has to take a shit,

10:24.620 --> 10:27.620
they put the fucking lunch wagon in front of the door.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.620
Is it a literal lunch wagon?

10:29.620 --> 10:30.620
What's that?

10:30.620 --> 10:31.620
What are the cart?

10:31.620 --> 10:32.620
The dessert cart.

10:32.620 --> 10:38.620
Is the fine line between us and another national tragedy.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.620
And so you always get to see the pilot

10:40.620 --> 10:42.620
take those little drops of deuce or whatever.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.620
And that guy came out.

10:44.620 --> 10:47.620
I didn't even realize I had standards for pilot's wardrobe.

10:47.620 --> 10:48.620
I really do like them.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.620
I want them to look like military,

10:50.620 --> 10:53.620
kind of really put together, tucked in and stuff.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.620
This guy came out.

10:54.620 --> 10:58.620
He had fucking, like, Oakley sunglasses balanced up

10:58.620 --> 11:02.620
on top of his head, like a Jason Biggs character.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.620
He had his shirt all unbuttoned.

11:05.620 --> 11:09.620
He looked like Gary Bucey in a Bachelor movie from the 80s.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.620
Like, it was just, like, the wingman,

11:11.620 --> 11:13.620
like, kind of, no pun intended.

11:13.620 --> 11:15.620
Like, the fratty, like, it was just like,

11:15.620 --> 11:18.620
Jesus Christ, man, put out a fucking outfit

11:18.620 --> 11:20.620
that looks like you can fly a plane.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.620
I'm scared shitless over here.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.620
Or that those safety videos, when they're on VHS

11:24.620 --> 11:27.620
and the shit's all wobbly.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.620
There's exits over there.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.620
And it's like, you can't get your TV to work.

11:33.620 --> 11:37.620
And you're in charge of my body being 30,000 feet above.

11:37.620 --> 11:41.620
I know they're not connected, but there's, I'm alarmed.

11:41.620 --> 11:44.620
And I said under my breath, because they were the flight attendants,

11:44.620 --> 11:47.620
it took two of them to push the CRT TV

11:47.620 --> 11:49.620
back into the ceiling of the thing

11:49.620 --> 11:53.620
after a ridiculous, like, Gremlins era tape played,

11:53.620 --> 11:55.620
that I think there were flashes,

11:55.620 --> 11:58.620
like, there was shit that had been recorded over it at one point.

11:58.620 --> 12:00.620
And then they accidentally taped over the hole.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.620
And I was like, you'd get that reference if you were my age.

12:03.620 --> 12:08.620
But they fucking shoved the TV back in

12:08.620 --> 12:09.620
and it took two of them, they couldn't get it.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.620
And I unconsciously said,

12:11.620 --> 12:14.620
this is not something you should say in an airplane.

12:14.620 --> 12:17.620
I'm a bad person for saying this,

12:17.620 --> 12:20.620
but I just blurted out, we're all gonna die.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.620
And God bless his heart, the flight attendant,

12:24.620 --> 12:26.620
he said, don't say that.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.620
And I was like, oh fuck.

12:28.620 --> 12:35.620
But then it's like, it's true eventually, but not today.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.620
He was a delight.

12:37.620 --> 12:40.620
I mean, if I was a flight attendant and somebody in first class

12:40.620 --> 12:42.620
was like, we're all gonna die, you know,

12:42.620 --> 12:44.620
and looking like me and sitting next to Dino,

12:44.620 --> 12:46.620
like a couple of drunk Sasquatches,

12:46.620 --> 12:49.620
like, I'm surprised I kicked off the plane,

12:49.620 --> 12:51.620
but he made me happy.

12:51.620 --> 12:53.620
I felt like, okay, so the TV's shitty,

12:53.620 --> 12:59.620
but this guy, maybe he can save us if shit goes bad.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.620
You said only that you don't want to fly anymore?

13:01.620 --> 13:02.620
You're through flying?

13:02.620 --> 13:04.620
Well, I just get fucking scared.

13:04.620 --> 13:07.620
I feel like I'm playing with statistics.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.620
I know it doesn't make any sense.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.620
You're safer than if you go in a car or whatever.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.620
But when you're in a car,

13:14.620 --> 13:17.620
your life isn't being controlled by people that feel like

13:17.620 --> 13:20.620
they might as well be working at a phone store.

13:20.620 --> 13:23.620
They're strangers, and they have their rules,

13:23.620 --> 13:25.620
and it's just like, these are the last people,

13:25.620 --> 13:27.620
these are the people you're gonna die with,

13:27.620 --> 13:29.620
and it just really freaks me out.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.620
I'm a control freak.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.620
I don't like doctors, I don't like airplanes.

13:32.620 --> 13:35.620
And I'm not backing down on this position.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.620
I think they should be outlawed.

13:37.620 --> 13:44.620
Doctors and airplanes, these people die.

13:44.620 --> 13:48.620
The last person you see is a doctor before you die, usually.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.620
How come if doctors are so smart, how come they don't live longer?

13:52.620 --> 13:56.620
Why is there no study that says doctors live longer on average?

13:56.620 --> 13:58.620
I'll tell you why, because it's all fucking guesswork.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.620
It's all bullshit.

13:59.620 --> 14:00.620
Listen to this.

14:00.620 --> 14:05.620
How come they can't take care of that?

14:05.620 --> 14:07.620
What's going on down here?

14:07.620 --> 14:09.620
Fix it.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.620
Harry Potter, Dumbledore,

14:12.620 --> 14:15.620
get out your fucking broomstick and get in there and fix it.

14:15.620 --> 14:18.620
Oh, we can't, yeah, you can't, I can't either.

14:18.620 --> 14:23.620
Except your dad was rich, it's the only difference.

14:23.620 --> 14:26.620
Come on, we gotta get it, let's get out our friends.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.620
You wanna pick first?

14:27.620 --> 14:31.620
Yeah, well I think we should bring Mr. Greg Poops out first.

14:31.620 --> 14:50.620
Hello, Gregory.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.620
Hi, hello everybody.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.620
Sorry, I didn't take too long, I didn't keep you waiting, did I?

14:56.620 --> 14:59.620
No, no, we were having a lovely discussion backstage

14:59.620 --> 15:03.620
about how airline travel is the safest way to travel.

15:03.620 --> 15:07.620
A stagecoach is more vulnerable to turbulence.

15:07.620 --> 15:10.620
Greg, tell Dan about our flight on Air Macedonia.

15:10.620 --> 15:18.620
Okay, so we were playing in Kosovo because our career is on fucking fire.

15:18.620 --> 15:27.620
I think when you play a place known for genocide and mass graves, fucking comedy.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.620
They say you play Kosovo on the way up and on the way down.

15:30.620 --> 15:37.620
It was great to be back.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.620
What's the origin of that bit?

15:39.620 --> 15:42.620
Oh, golly, I don't know, I've used it for a thousand years.

15:42.620 --> 15:48.620
So we get up at pre-dawn and we leave from Skopje and Macedonia where we're staying at the Holiday Inn.

15:48.620 --> 15:53.620
I had my laundry done there and I can still smell the detergent 11 years later.

15:53.620 --> 15:58.620
I don't know if pink has a scent, but it did in Macedonia.

15:58.620 --> 16:07.620
And so we pitch this up to the airport and it's bright black out and we have coffee and whatnot.

16:07.620 --> 16:08.620
Pre-dawn.

16:08.620 --> 16:09.620
Pre-dawn.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.620
And like the Radon and Tebi, thank you.

16:11.620 --> 16:17.620
By the way, the drives, I don't know if any of you have just taken a ride through Kosovo recently or ever.

16:17.620 --> 16:19.620
Do you like filth?

16:19.620 --> 16:22.620
Do I just?

16:22.620 --> 16:28.620
We were going through it and we were like, it's bleak and it's sad and it's poverty and it's not Calcutta,

16:28.620 --> 16:31.620
but it's very bleak and sad.

16:31.620 --> 16:35.620
And we couldn't quite put a finger on it and someone pointed out, there's a thing that you don't notice yet.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.620
There are no birds.

16:37.620 --> 16:41.620
There's no wildlife there because there's that many unexploded landmines.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.620
And no dogs at all.

16:43.620 --> 16:46.620
You once in a while you'll see a dog, but occasionally in the middle of the night you're, boom,

16:46.620 --> 16:48.620
and a dog like fly over your head.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.620
Oh, come on.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.620
That's not real.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.620
Oh, yeah, now there's so much unexploded ordinance there.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.620
But you guys never saw a dog fly over your head.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.620
That's all I'm saying.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.620
Every morning, right before sausages.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.620
Boom.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.620
Boom, and you'd be like, oh, fuck.

17:04.620 --> 17:08.620
You know what, would you give me some more banana milk?

17:08.620 --> 17:14.620
So we go on to the tarmac and there's no security as such, right?

17:14.620 --> 17:16.620
Your bags are on the tarmac.

17:16.620 --> 17:20.620
We're there doing a USO tour show, so this is well after 9-11.

17:20.620 --> 17:23.620
We're performing for the troops in and around Afghanistan and stuff.

17:23.620 --> 17:27.620
And so you're required to point at your bag to identify that that's your bag.

17:27.620 --> 17:29.620
And that's some total of the fucking right.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.620
Like you point and they go, okay, get on.

17:31.620 --> 17:36.620
So the plane is battered, dented, has graffiti on it, misspelled.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.620
It says air Macedonian in Macedonian letters, right?

17:39.620 --> 17:41.620
In Greek letters, complete.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.620
There was peeling duct tape on a part of it.

17:43.620 --> 17:47.620
And Sean Masterson is with us because like, I don't know about this aircraft.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.620
I'm like, don't worry, it'll be fine.

17:49.620 --> 17:52.620
We get in first class and we take stuff.

17:52.620 --> 17:56.620
And there's no, you know how you were saying the lunch wagon, which I love,

17:56.620 --> 17:58.620
because I love the 50s.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.620
I couldn't think of the word cart.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.620
My brain is dying.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.620
If it's a lunch wagon, I'm ordering a tuna salad and macaroni and cheese.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.620
I lost the word cart.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.620
It's a senior moment.

18:09.620 --> 18:14.620
There's no door on the cockpit. You know how that on like a U.S. air or whatever,

18:14.620 --> 18:18.620
they'll have like a sealed door with a bar across it, like, you know,

18:18.620 --> 18:20.620
Frankenstein's lair or whatever.

18:20.620 --> 18:23.620
This was Macedonia, no door at all.

18:23.620 --> 18:27.620
As soon as we take off the pilots turn to each other and light up smokes and start talking.

18:27.620 --> 18:31.620
And they never look at the road the whole fucking time, right?

18:31.620 --> 18:34.620
Smoking, fucking smoking cigarettes.

18:34.620 --> 18:37.620
Facing 90 degree angles, like not looking out the window.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.620
Oh, no, like this. This is the view you're seeing.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.620
You're looking in the cockpit.

18:42.620 --> 18:45.620
And they're talking. Then we get over fucking Amsterdam and you hear beep, beep, beep.

18:45.620 --> 18:51.620
The autopilot goes off and they go, fuck, and put out their smokes.

18:51.620 --> 18:53.620
Sean Massison in our group.

18:53.620 --> 18:56.620
He's a nervous Nellie friend of ours who's lovely.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.620
And he calls the flight attendant over.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.620
Oh, by the way, the best food in the world.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.620
What was it for breakfast?

19:02.620 --> 19:06.620
Stale bread, Turkish coffee, olives, yogurt, feta cheese and honey.

19:06.620 --> 19:08.620
Yeah, it was awesome. It was really good.

19:08.620 --> 19:09.620
It was really awesome.

19:09.620 --> 19:10.620
And the flight attendant comes over.

19:10.620 --> 19:11.620
We were starving.

19:11.620 --> 19:16.620
The flight attendant comes over and Sean's like, are they supposed to be smoke talking?

19:16.620 --> 19:18.620
Shouldn't they be looking at the road?

19:18.620 --> 19:20.620
The road.

19:20.620 --> 19:24.620
And she goes, they like to watch.

19:24.620 --> 19:28.620
They like to look at the party happening back in the face of us.

19:28.620 --> 19:31.620
What are you going to see with a plane?

19:31.620 --> 19:33.620
What are you going to steer around a mountain?

19:33.620 --> 19:38.620
Yes. Precisely.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.620
I mean, I think they know the routes by now.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.620
There's no mountains on that route.

19:43.620 --> 19:46.620
Close the door and put the cigarette out.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.620
I loved it, man.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.620
I really wanted to go up there and have a drink with them.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.620
What do you guys drink?

19:52.620 --> 19:54.620
Uso and shit? Let's do the song.

19:54.620 --> 19:58.620
When I was a kid, like late 70s, we've fled to Hawaii as little kids.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.620
Every man on the plane wore a suit.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.620
Every woman wore a dress and everybody smoked.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.620
Everybody smoked.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.620
As soon as you were up in the air, everybody lit up.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.620
And every armrest had an ashtray in it.

20:10.620 --> 20:14.620
I remember smoking. You could still smoke at international flights when I was still a smoker.

20:14.620 --> 20:15.620
That would become the rule.

20:15.620 --> 20:17.620
I remember smoking on a plane going to Mexico.

20:17.620 --> 20:20.620
Such a weird memory to have.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.620
And there was a smoking section.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.620
You could smoke at the back.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.620
You're on a tube.

20:26.620 --> 20:30.620
Our whole attitude about smoking, I remember it changing around me.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.620
And I remember being pissed at my friends.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.620
They were asking me to not smoke in their apartments.

20:34.620 --> 20:37.620
I was entitled to fucking smoke in their apartment.

20:37.620 --> 20:40.620
My brain had to shift.

20:40.620 --> 20:43.620
Again, the world's changing, man.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.620
This cigarette stuff.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.620
And not for the better.

20:47.620 --> 20:52.620
If this was the old days, we'd all be doing blow and smoking right here in this room, man.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.620
If this was a 70s podcast, and those would have been awesome.

20:55.620 --> 21:01.620
Because we'd have had lots of pubic hair, and Elliot Gould would have been the special guest.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.620
That was all that, like Dick Cavett and stuff.

21:04.620 --> 21:07.620
Before talk shows became profitable.

21:07.620 --> 21:09.620
Before they became a way to plug things and stuff.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.620
It was just like, okay, the national anthem is going to start in a little bit.

21:12.620 --> 21:17.620
But while you fall asleep, here's John Lennon drinking with Truman Capote.

21:17.620 --> 21:19.620
Talking about how high he is.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.620
And it's just quiet.

21:21.620 --> 21:25.620
Long pauses and just one shot, one camera.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.620
That's what podcasting is now.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.620
Listen to us.

21:29.620 --> 21:33.620
That's what I love about podcasting.

21:33.620 --> 21:40.620
Who could have predicted in this world of increasing bandwidth and shrinking attention spans

21:40.620 --> 21:43.620
that there would be an art form where people listen to people babble for two hours.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.620
I love that you think it's an art form.

21:45.620 --> 21:47.620
I think that's fantastic.

21:47.620 --> 21:50.620
I feel elevated.

21:50.620 --> 21:57.620
I thought I was just a hacky road comic running out the last stretch of my fucking golden years.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.620
What we used to call radio.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.620
I think a glass of milk is a hard form.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.620
No, I think it is an art form.

22:05.620 --> 22:07.620
And I think you're right, because we don't have parameters.

22:07.620 --> 22:10.620
Until all the shit hits the fan, but we won't get into that.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.620
He went through a phase because you didn't have commercials.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.620
Then you did. Now you don't again, right?

22:14.620 --> 22:17.620
I don't know if I do or not. I don't listen to all of my show.

22:17.620 --> 22:21.620
Because I find myself repetitive.

22:21.620 --> 22:25.620
I feel like the drunk that's been cornered at the party,

22:25.620 --> 22:27.620
the guy's telling you the same story for the 50th time.

22:27.620 --> 22:29.620
That's what I feel like my podcast is.

22:29.620 --> 22:33.620
I'm really weirdly selective about which ones episodes of this show I listen to.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.620
There's ones that I just wanted.

22:35.620 --> 22:39.620
I was drunk and sloppy and hate myself.

22:39.620 --> 22:43.620
I don't want to hear about the World Cup anymore.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.620
I love the World Cup.

22:45.620 --> 22:47.620
We have a lot to talk about.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.620
Well, let's not do it.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.620
The Costa Rica game.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.620
Did anyone see the football-loving chicken?

22:54.620 --> 22:57.620
That's Costa Rica's mascot, Doc and San Jose.

22:57.620 --> 23:00.620
That was the best part of the entire World Cup.

23:00.620 --> 23:03.620
Big, I'll warn you, last time a fancy guy in a suit

23:03.620 --> 23:06.620
shouted us down about talking about sports at the podcast.

23:06.620 --> 23:09.620
Oh, I forgot. We're talking about sports at a comic book store.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.620
That's like talking about pussy at a comic book store.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.620
It's something that's only been discussed.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.620
Oh, I see. You're sensitive.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.620
That's fantastic.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.620
I want to know when you develop taste.

23:20.620 --> 23:22.620
When did that weird moment occur?

23:22.620 --> 23:24.620
I was here at the beginning and I watched you,

23:24.620 --> 23:26.620
and now all of a sudden, wow.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.620
Yeah, okay.

23:28.620 --> 23:33.620
The two guys who are the British guys who do the horrible ESPN,

23:33.620 --> 23:36.620
because before I thought Alexi Lawless was just kind of inane,

23:36.620 --> 23:38.620
but now I openly hate Alexi Lawless.

23:38.620 --> 23:40.620
I like Alexi Lawless.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.620
Do you really? I find him...

23:42.620 --> 23:44.620
I'm smug, but I don't think I'm smug.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.620
I think I'm contentious.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.620
No, you're imperious.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.620
I am imperious, but I admit it.

23:50.620 --> 23:52.620
But Alexi Lawless gets like,

23:52.620 --> 23:54.620
the American team didn't...

23:54.620 --> 23:56.620
You're like, fuck you.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.620
You were a midfielder and you sucked balls, okay?

23:58.620 --> 24:01.620
I saw you in the 90, 94.

24:01.620 --> 24:04.620
I saw all the fucking World Cups you were in, bro-hom.

24:04.620 --> 24:07.620
And this team's better than any American team you were on.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.620
I will always find it fascinating that you,

24:09.620 --> 24:12.620
like an erudite, kind of pedagogue...

24:12.620 --> 24:14.620
Sissy.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.620
That you are a huge sports fan.

24:16.620 --> 24:19.620
This guy loves baseball more than anybody you've ever met.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.620
Well, again, baseball...

24:21.620 --> 24:24.620
Did you guys ever see the movie like Bull Durham or whatnot?

24:24.620 --> 24:26.620
That's what baseball is.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.620
Or Major League 3, Back to the Miners,

24:28.620 --> 24:32.620
which is the best title for a movie in the history of mankind.

24:32.620 --> 24:35.620
Because if it's Major League 3, how can it be Back to the Miners?

24:35.620 --> 24:38.620
You fucked yourself with the title.

24:38.620 --> 24:41.620
That meeting was the worst meeting that ever happened in Hollywood?

24:41.620 --> 24:43.620
I actually never even thought about that.

24:43.620 --> 24:47.620
You can't be an alien for no alien this time.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.620
What do you mean Back to the Miners?

24:52.620 --> 24:54.620
It's Major League. The movie's called Major...

24:54.620 --> 24:56.620
There's other movies that do that.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.620
What are other titles that did that?

24:58.620 --> 25:01.620
Bad News Bears. It's all good news.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.620
This isn't an example of that,

25:05.620 --> 25:08.620
but there was the sequel to that Open Water.

25:08.620 --> 25:10.620
Remember Open Water 2?

25:10.620 --> 25:13.620
The unspoken subject. I don't know sharks this time.

25:13.620 --> 25:17.620
We got rid of the sharks because water's scary enough.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.620
You can drown in it.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.620
And it's wet.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.620
You're so uncomfortable.

25:23.620 --> 25:26.620
If you tread it for an hour, you'll get tired and then you can die.

25:26.620 --> 25:30.620
I have a cramp. I ate a tuna sandwich too soon before this happened.

25:30.620 --> 25:33.620
It was like watching one of those hands-on-a-heart-body competitions.

25:33.620 --> 25:36.620
You're just watching people slowly drown.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.620
Anyways, why don't we keep the guests free?

25:38.620 --> 25:42.620
Let's bring out soccer expert Kumeil Nagyari!

25:57.620 --> 26:01.620
We got a lot of heat for the soccer talk last week.

26:01.620 --> 26:04.620
Well, it was pretty, I mean, it was...

26:04.620 --> 26:07.620
After a point, we had covered it.

26:07.620 --> 26:09.620
It was just you asking over and over again,

26:09.620 --> 26:11.620
why can't there be a countdown, like a clock?

26:11.620 --> 26:13.620
Why can't they pause the clock?

26:13.620 --> 26:16.620
And I actually got it after listening to it.

26:16.620 --> 26:19.620
Well, we got to do it again because now we're talking about the thing

26:19.620 --> 26:21.620
that we talked about for way too long.

26:21.620 --> 26:23.620
But I just want to say I do get it now.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.620
I get it because it's like the people fall down.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.620
I think it's a sport that has...

26:27.620 --> 26:30.620
its league has more integrity than American sports.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.620
Because they're like all...

26:32.620 --> 26:34.620
They're all amazing actors.

26:34.620 --> 26:37.620
If you do this, they're like, oh, my face fell off!

26:37.620 --> 26:40.620
Porche! Porche! Mama!

26:40.620 --> 26:42.620
Foulton Himmel!

26:42.620 --> 26:46.620
I literally saw one where two guys' calves gently grazed each other

26:46.620 --> 26:50.620
and they laid on the ground clutching their faces for two minutes.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.620
What they don't know is that...

26:52.620 --> 26:55.620
I don't think that these guys have figured out the fact

26:55.620 --> 26:58.620
that there are nine million cameras in my definition on them.

26:58.620 --> 27:02.620
Also, there are 20 cameras at least that have that perfect slow-mo.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.620
So when you get hit, there's a guy that kind of...

27:05.620 --> 27:07.620
A foot came up and grazed the back of a guy's head

27:07.620 --> 27:10.620
and he crushed his nose, which is clearly bullshit.

27:10.620 --> 27:13.620
But when you bite him slow-mo, it's hilarious.

27:13.620 --> 27:16.620
Well, maybe his brain came and hit the nose.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.620
I hope.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.620
I think that that guy who bit...

27:20.620 --> 27:22.620
My favorite was the guy who bit the other guy

27:22.620 --> 27:24.620
and then got kicked out of the World Cup.

27:24.620 --> 27:25.620
Suarez.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.620
Yeah, Suarez, who's one of the best players in the world, apparently.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.620
I like bit... I like...

27:30.620 --> 27:32.620
Chewy Lewis.

27:32.620 --> 27:34.620
Oh, Huffington Post, because they played the Italians

27:34.620 --> 27:37.620
who are called the Azuri, the blues in Italian.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.620
They're called the blues because they always wear blue.

27:39.620 --> 27:42.620
The Huffington Post article was Chewy Lewis and the Blues.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.620
Wait.

27:44.620 --> 27:45.620
Lewis Suarez.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.620
Oh, his name is Lewis.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.620
You know what? I thought that was dumb.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.620
And now that I know it's for instance Lewis...

27:51.620 --> 27:53.620
No, it's a home run. It's a home run.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.620
It's a home run.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.620
The best newspaper published in the world.

27:58.620 --> 28:00.620
But he, when he...

28:00.620 --> 28:02.620
I thought it was so ballsy when he bit the guy.

28:02.620 --> 28:05.620
He laid down being like, I hurt my teeth, too.

28:05.620 --> 28:07.620
Like, he was like...

28:07.620 --> 28:09.620
What he did, he went in and fucking...

28:09.620 --> 28:12.620
Well, I have one less bullet in my gun, so...

28:12.620 --> 28:14.620
I got robbed, in a sense.

28:14.620 --> 28:17.620
He jumped in and nose for a rot to Kealini for me at the time.

28:17.620 --> 28:20.620
And he probably did almost hurt his teeth

28:20.620 --> 28:22.620
on an athlete's shoulder.

28:22.620 --> 28:25.620
Like, you can't just go higher.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.620
Did you notice that he bit the Italian team?

28:27.620 --> 28:29.620
No one bit the Russians.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.620
You know what I mean?

28:30.620 --> 28:32.620
You bite the Russians, you're like, this is a cabbage.

28:32.620 --> 28:34.620
You bite the Italian team, you're like...

28:34.620 --> 28:35.620
Mascarpone.

28:35.620 --> 28:36.620
Oh, my God.

28:36.620 --> 28:38.620
This is delicioso.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.620
It's filled with butter and...

28:40.620 --> 28:41.620
Mocopane.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.620
In Russia, soccer bite you.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.620
Is this true, Anatoly?

28:46.620 --> 28:48.620
Grinito with fucking Mascarpone on top.

28:48.620 --> 28:50.620
Soccer recognized soccer.

28:50.620 --> 28:52.620
Oh, my God.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.620
God damn it, we talked about sports again.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.620
We're talking about how delicious Italian people taste.

28:56.620 --> 28:57.620
Okay.

28:57.620 --> 28:58.620
I will say...

28:58.620 --> 29:01.620
Italian taste like spirit of eagle.

29:01.620 --> 29:03.620
It's Jay Silverheels.

29:03.620 --> 29:04.620
That's the actor.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.620
Is that the actor?

29:05.620 --> 29:06.620
Jay Silverheels.

29:06.620 --> 29:07.620
Hey, that's what I meant.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.620
Who's the actor?

29:08.620 --> 29:09.620
Jay Silverheels.

29:09.620 --> 29:10.620
Can you play Tonto?

29:10.620 --> 29:11.620
Here you go.

29:11.620 --> 29:12.620
Mm, Kimosabe.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.620
Many miles to next stop.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.620
Gee, Tonto, I wonder...

29:17.620 --> 29:20.620
Might we run into some hostiles along the way?

29:20.620 --> 29:22.620
Many hostiles, Kimosabe.

29:22.620 --> 29:26.620
Was he trying to fuck the Lone Ranger?

29:26.620 --> 29:27.620
Yes.

29:27.620 --> 29:30.620
Like Batman and Robin, there was an alter universe

29:30.620 --> 29:34.620
where the Lone Ranger and Tonto, I think, were a deep couple.

29:34.620 --> 29:36.620
Are you saying this character is sort of like

29:36.620 --> 29:37.620
up who is for my people?

29:37.620 --> 29:39.620
Except for my people, the guy is...

29:39.620 --> 29:41.620
It's a white guy.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.620
We couldn't even get one of our own to sell out our whole race.

29:44.620 --> 29:46.620
Let me explain something to you.

29:46.620 --> 29:49.620
White people can do a lot of voices.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.620
It's what we really excel at, genetically, is racism.

29:52.620 --> 29:57.620
Do you remember Peter Lawrence as Mr. Motto?

29:57.620 --> 29:58.620
We loved him.

29:58.620 --> 29:59.620
Non-whites.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.620
Warner Oland as Charlie Chan.

30:02.620 --> 30:04.620
Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's.

30:04.620 --> 30:08.620
Oh man, such a beautiful Asian accent.

30:08.620 --> 30:10.620
He's like a ballerina.

30:10.620 --> 30:15.620
It's just a shame that there were no Asian actors in Hollywood at that time.

30:15.620 --> 30:17.620
Yeah, that's true.

30:17.620 --> 30:20.620
Yeah, that is amazing to watch.

30:20.620 --> 30:23.620
How far we've come in a little...

30:23.620 --> 30:26.620
Okay, we won't talk about soccer, but I won't talk about soccer.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.620
I'll say about planes and smoking.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.620
One of my weirdest memories.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.620
This is kind of a weird story, so you have to sort of be okay with that.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.620
I forget where I was flying, but I was flying somewhere with my family.

30:36.620 --> 30:38.620
And there was a smoking section in the back of the plane.

30:38.620 --> 30:41.620
And while I was on the way to the bathroom, this guy sort of...

30:41.620 --> 30:43.620
And I was like eight, started talking to me.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.620
It's just a weird story.

30:45.620 --> 30:47.620
Is this a flight around Pakistan?

30:47.620 --> 30:49.620
No, it's second in the national flight, but I don't remember how long.

30:49.620 --> 30:51.620
Probably just Singapore, so it's probably about three hours.

30:51.620 --> 30:53.620
So this guy befriends me, and he's like,

30:53.620 --> 30:55.620
here, come sit next to me.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.620
This is already a weird story.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.620
That's already the weirdest thing that's ever happened on a plane.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.620
No, it's no good.

31:01.620 --> 31:04.620
Have you been to the launch wagon yet?

31:04.620 --> 31:07.620
The launch wagon is blocking the captain's...

31:07.620 --> 31:10.620
Hankas area?

31:10.620 --> 31:14.620
So I actually have lunch, or maybe some chapattis.

31:14.620 --> 31:18.620
The plural of chapatti is chapatti,

31:18.620 --> 31:21.620
but it's impressive that you knew the word.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.620
Pack-a-snap.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.620
Pack-a-snap.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.620
Pack-a-snap.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.620
You did not just pack-a-snap me.

31:30.620 --> 31:33.620
I'm going to bang your fucking deshi back.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.620
That just derailed the whole episode.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.620
Pack-a-snap.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.620
Pack-a-snap.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.620
I feel I'm on soon.

31:41.620 --> 31:43.620
Coming on, I feel I'm on soon.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.620
Coming on.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.620
So this guy, I sit next to him, and he's drinking,

31:47.620 --> 31:49.620
and I didn't know anybody who drank then.

31:49.620 --> 31:51.620
Wait, you were eight?

31:51.620 --> 31:53.620
Yeah, and also nobody drank in Pakistan,

31:53.620 --> 31:55.620
but this guy was Pakistani way older than me,

31:55.620 --> 31:57.620
and he was like, here, try this whiskey.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.620
Oh, no.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.620
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's a weird story.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.620
Holy shit.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.620
So my mom came and was like, what the fuck?

32:05.620 --> 32:07.620
And she grabbed me and went up,

32:07.620 --> 32:09.620
and then the next time I was going to the bathroom,

32:09.620 --> 32:11.620
she's like, hey, just, he was like, hey, sit with me again.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.620
Sit with me.

32:13.620 --> 32:15.620
I don't know, and I was like, I didn't know how to say no.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.620
Wait, is he crossed the aisle for me?

32:17.620 --> 32:19.620
No, he's like in a different section.

32:19.620 --> 32:23.620
So I'm like probably like 40 rows in front of him,

32:23.620 --> 32:25.620
and then there's like curtains,

32:25.620 --> 32:27.620
and then the smoking section, he's in the smoking section.

32:27.620 --> 32:29.620
So I'm going to the bathroom again,

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
and he's like, all right, sit with me.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.620
So I sat with him again, my mom came and got me,

32:33.620 --> 32:35.620
and I run very clearly, my mom took me up

32:35.620 --> 32:37.620
with me where she was like, hey,

32:37.620 --> 32:40.620
sometimes people want to do bad things to children,

32:40.620 --> 32:42.620
and I remember being like, me?

32:42.620 --> 32:46.620
Like I was like, this predator wanted to prey on me?

32:46.620 --> 32:48.620
Wait, oh, you were flattered?

32:48.620 --> 32:50.620
I was flattered.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.620
I was like, little old me?

32:53.620 --> 32:56.620
I was going to get preyed on?

32:56.620 --> 32:58.620
I wasn't sure about the shirts.

32:58.620 --> 33:00.620
I didn't know.

33:00.620 --> 33:04.620
You're wrong, mom, I am beautiful.

33:04.620 --> 33:10.620
I said, you tweeted a picture of yourself

33:10.620 --> 33:12.620
around that age,

33:12.620 --> 33:15.620
and you looked so much like Milhouse from The Simpsons.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.620
It was adorable.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.620
That was when I was like four.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.620
That was great.

33:21.620 --> 33:26.620
From like seven to like 18 was a real bag of trash.

33:26.620 --> 33:29.620
So this guy, so you needed this validation?

33:29.620 --> 33:32.620
No, no, I came at the perfect time.

33:32.620 --> 33:36.620
I was all confident for a little while after that.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.620
You were walking with a swagger through a baggage plane?

33:39.620 --> 33:41.620
A truck to demand with whiskey?

33:41.620 --> 33:44.620
Yeah, I don't need you little girls like me.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.620
I have grown men who are into me.

33:47.620 --> 33:53.620
Aaron and I were just watching the Roger Ebert documentary.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.620
Is it tough to watch?

33:55.620 --> 33:57.620
Because I think that guy is amazing.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.620
It's really hard to watch because he's a great guy,

33:59.620 --> 34:01.620
and therefore you should watch it.

34:01.620 --> 34:03.620
No, it's not hard.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.620
It's inspiring because something terrible is happening

34:06.620 --> 34:08.620
to a person that doesn't deserve it

34:08.620 --> 34:11.620
and coping with that and watching him

34:11.620 --> 34:15.620
just fucking charge headlong into oblivion

34:15.620 --> 34:17.620
with a, you know,

34:17.620 --> 34:19.620
I was going to say with a smile on his face

34:19.620 --> 34:21.620
and then I ran through all these fucking...

34:21.620 --> 34:23.620
Yeah, I'm sorry.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.620
That's how my brain works and what happened.

34:25.620 --> 34:28.620
Thank you for proving that I was right

34:28.620 --> 34:31.620
to have vapor lock for a second.

34:31.620 --> 34:36.620
But it's a good documentary that will...

34:36.620 --> 34:38.620
Yeah, it's a nice...

34:38.620 --> 34:40.620
Watch it.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.620
The relationship between Siskel and Ebert,

34:44.620 --> 34:48.620
there's a story that Siskel's wife tells.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.620
I think those kids really...

34:50.620 --> 34:52.620
I thought when I was a kid growing up watching these guys,

34:52.620 --> 34:54.620
I was like, well, they hate each other.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.620
That's what's for sale, but it's kind of an act.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.620
It's like Ernie and Bert, which is true,

34:58.620 --> 35:00.620
but they also really did hate each other.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.620
They really did?

35:01.620 --> 35:02.620
They really hated each other,

35:02.620 --> 35:04.620
but they also loved each other.

35:04.620 --> 35:07.620
That part of the documentary is also very touching,

35:07.620 --> 35:09.620
but it's way more so,

35:09.620 --> 35:11.620
like the more important part of the documentary

35:11.620 --> 35:13.620
is Ebert's relationship with his wife

35:13.620 --> 35:18.620
and it's a tear bringer.

35:18.620 --> 35:19.620
I think it might be...

35:19.620 --> 35:20.620
Not a joker?

35:20.620 --> 35:22.620
Much tears run.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.620
Right, there's a tear bringer.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.620
There's a story in it. Siskel's wife tells.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.620
How many tears have you brought?

35:28.620 --> 35:30.620
Even the airplane theme of the story.

35:30.620 --> 35:34.620
Siskel and Ebert are on an airplane flying somewhere

35:34.620 --> 35:36.620
and Siskel is tired of listening to Ebert.

35:36.620 --> 35:38.620
This sounds like a good joke.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.620
Talk of Siskel's life.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.620
So he's going to fuck it up.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.620
Ebert's telling the same story.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.620
Siskel doesn't want to hear it anywhere,

35:48.620 --> 35:52.620
so Siskel gets a napkin and writes a note on it that says,

35:52.620 --> 35:56.620
Mr. Ebert, we're here in the cockpit.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.620
We found out you're on the plane.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.620
We admire you much more than that other guy.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.620
We really agree with your movie reviews more than his

36:05.620 --> 36:10.620
and it would be an honor if you would join us in the cockpit.

36:10.620 --> 36:13.620
We'll just talk about movies with us for a while.

36:13.620 --> 36:17.620
So I gave the note, had the flight attendant hand Ebert the note.

36:17.620 --> 36:20.620
Ebert goes bounding down the aisle.

36:20.620 --> 36:23.620
He starts pounding on the cockpit door.

36:23.620 --> 36:25.620
It's so funny.

36:25.620 --> 36:29.620
And then everyone's like, what the fuck is this fat guy doing?

36:29.620 --> 36:35.620
He's trying to destroy the plane and Siskel calls out from his seat.

36:35.620 --> 36:39.620
He just yells out, Mr. Ebert, we're in the cockpit.

36:39.620 --> 36:41.620
He yells out the first line of the letter.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.620
That's how the story ends.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.620
This is an airplane theme.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.620
There's a great article that Ebert wrote

36:47.620 --> 36:50.620
because he lost his lower jaw to...

36:50.620 --> 36:52.620
So he couldn't eat, so he was on tubes and stuff.

36:52.620 --> 36:56.620
He wrote this wonderful article about how he experiences food now,

36:56.620 --> 37:00.620
how he looks at pictures of food and recalls wonderful meals he's had

37:00.620 --> 37:02.620
and he's like, don't feel sorry for me.

37:02.620 --> 37:05.620
I'm still having that experience and he talks about his best meals

37:05.620 --> 37:07.620
as a guy who will never taste again.

37:07.620 --> 37:10.620
It's really, really fantastic.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.620
It's a real tear-breaker. It's really great.

37:13.620 --> 37:17.620
The end of his life is one of the most inspiring chapters of it

37:17.620 --> 37:24.620
because he very quickly adopted the blogging lifestyle

37:24.620 --> 37:29.620
because he became like right up to the finish line.

37:29.620 --> 37:32.620
He was like one of the coolest bloggers and tweeters

37:32.620 --> 37:34.620
and kind of amazing.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.620
Not only can you not fear death,

37:36.620 --> 37:40.620
but you can actually get some of your better shit done right before it,

37:40.620 --> 37:43.620
when you're staring at the face, kind of cool,

37:43.620 --> 37:45.620
but also really fucked up because why, Harold Ramos,

37:45.620 --> 37:49.620
why Roger Ebert, why do bad things happen to people that we admire?

37:49.620 --> 37:53.620
So many thoroughbreds when there's so many we could spare down here.

37:53.620 --> 38:02.620
Let's bring out a couple's therapy veteran and love of my life, Erin McGathy.

38:02.620 --> 38:10.620
I've got to try once, I've got to try once, only if I want to, right, son.

38:10.620 --> 38:18.620
Like it's juicy, juicy, and you'll see I'm gonna have my pride, son.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.620
The gang's all back.

38:20.620 --> 38:23.620
I don't even have to say anything.

38:23.620 --> 38:26.620
We've got so many bright, shining superstars up here,

38:26.620 --> 38:35.620
all of you bringing your own brand of rye stuff to the thing.

38:35.620 --> 38:39.620
And then it should just be silence for two minutes.

38:39.620 --> 38:43.620
Camille's story about the alcohol reminded me...

38:43.620 --> 38:47.620
I didn't try alcohol, by the way, so bomb, if you're listening.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.620
I also did not fuck that man.

38:50.620 --> 38:54.620
Although he did go to the bathroom two times at least on a three-hour flight,

38:54.620 --> 38:58.620
so whatever.

38:58.620 --> 39:02.620
Yeah, I was hydrating a lot.

39:02.620 --> 39:06.620
We would be flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet.

39:06.620 --> 39:10.620
Isn't it weird that we can poop on planes?

39:10.620 --> 39:15.620
You would think that they would throw that out there.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.620
I've never pooped on a plane.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.620
You've never pooped on a plane?

39:19.620 --> 39:21.620
It's like the first thing I do.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.620
For real?

39:22.620 --> 39:24.620
Yeah, as soon as the...

39:24.620 --> 39:27.620
I know, I don't...

39:27.620 --> 39:33.620
I'm literally shitting where you were.

39:33.620 --> 39:35.620
I don't know what it is.

39:35.620 --> 39:38.620
Wait, for real, you really get on a plane and immediately have to take a shit?

39:38.620 --> 39:39.620
Yeah.

39:39.620 --> 39:42.620
You have that weird thing where you eat and food pushes poop out of your body.

39:42.620 --> 39:44.620
I'm like a play-doh fun factory.

39:44.620 --> 39:47.620
Yours is just a straight line?

39:47.620 --> 39:51.620
Yeah, if I eat a salty cracker, I will poop a salty cracker's worth of poop.

39:51.620 --> 39:54.620
I know it's not the cracker, but that's the illusion that's created.

39:54.620 --> 40:02.620
It feels like I eat and then it turns into poop and like a Polaroid camera comes out.

40:02.620 --> 40:04.620
It really...

40:04.620 --> 40:06.620
It's as if I'm really proud of it.

40:06.620 --> 40:08.620
I think it's something that I might...

40:08.620 --> 40:10.620
Like you're an earthworm?

40:10.620 --> 40:13.620
Yeah, my regularity is like actually...

40:13.620 --> 40:15.620
Startling.

40:15.620 --> 40:19.620
It's in a world where there's lots of things that could go wrong with you.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.620
You're comfortable getting...

40:21.620 --> 40:28.620
At 6 foot 4, going into a lavatory on a plane is a terrible experience because to get...

40:28.620 --> 40:30.620
If I want to go pee on a plane...

40:30.620 --> 40:31.620
What do you guys want to do later?

40:31.620 --> 40:32.620
Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.620
I was telling a story, Greg.

40:35.620 --> 40:37.620
Scoops, do you want a drink?

40:37.620 --> 40:38.620
Sure.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.620
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt the podcast.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.620
Can we talk about...

40:41.620 --> 40:42.620
Her name is Scoops?

40:42.620 --> 40:43.620
Yeah.

40:43.620 --> 40:46.620
I have an issue with us because you hear us call each other.

40:46.620 --> 40:47.620
Scoops?

40:47.620 --> 40:49.620
I mean, I guess I don't have an issue.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.620
I guess I like it.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.620
Every time we call each other a pet name.

40:52.620 --> 40:53.620
Dan, you've noticed this.

40:53.620 --> 40:54.620
Scoops, Scoops.

40:54.620 --> 40:55.620
Jeff goes,

40:55.620 --> 40:56.620
Scoops?

40:56.620 --> 40:57.620
Scoops?

40:57.620 --> 40:58.620
Every time you want to have...

40:58.620 --> 40:59.620
It's Scoops though, right?

40:59.620 --> 41:04.620
It's Scoops or Scoops or Shoeb or Shuber or Tony Shaluber.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.620
Or Kubrama.

41:05.620 --> 41:07.620
Yeah, that's my thing.

41:07.620 --> 41:08.620
It's a moving term.

41:08.620 --> 41:09.620
So I always feel like...

41:09.620 --> 41:11.620
I thought it was Scoops but now it's Scoops.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.620
Dan, which did our pet name be in front of Jeff?

41:13.620 --> 41:15.620
Barack Kubrama.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.620
All right.

41:17.620 --> 41:18.620
That's awesome.

41:18.620 --> 41:19.620
I've always...

41:19.620 --> 41:22.620
It always seems to be slightly moving so I can't...

41:22.620 --> 41:24.620
It's not just Scoops or Scoops.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.620
Yeah, it's always a long line of...

41:26.620 --> 41:29.620
Why don't we all call each other Coops and Pooms?

41:29.620 --> 41:30.620
Really?

41:30.620 --> 41:31.620
Call each other Coops?

41:31.620 --> 41:33.620
No, he calls me Coops and I call him...

41:33.620 --> 41:34.620
Oh, Coops.

41:34.620 --> 41:35.620
Oh, I see how.

41:35.620 --> 41:36.620
Yeah.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.620
So you get derailed.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.620
Yeah, you were telling me that.

41:38.620 --> 41:39.620
Yeah, you always think something about...

41:39.620 --> 41:40.620
I was actually...

41:40.620 --> 41:42.620
I felt blessed that I was derailed.

41:42.620 --> 41:46.620
Because it's just a story about you taking a shit on a plane.

41:46.620 --> 41:48.620
No, I thought...

41:48.620 --> 41:53.620
When Camille was talking about that man offering you whiskey or whatever...

41:53.620 --> 41:54.620
Yeah, thank you.

41:54.620 --> 41:55.620
It was...

41:55.620 --> 41:56.620
Jesus juice.

41:56.620 --> 41:57.620
Jesus juice.

41:57.620 --> 41:58.620
I had a...

41:58.620 --> 42:00.620
I was thinking about...

42:00.620 --> 42:01.620
My mind was...

42:01.620 --> 42:04.620
I was thinking about plane rides and I grew up in a Navy family.

42:04.620 --> 42:07.620
So we lived in Italy for a while and when we lived in Italy,

42:07.620 --> 42:11.620
the adults of my life were other chaplains that my dad knew

42:11.620 --> 42:14.620
because my dad was a chaplain, which is like a preacher in the military.

42:14.620 --> 42:15.620
I didn't know that.

42:15.620 --> 42:16.620
Oh, really?

42:16.620 --> 42:17.620
Wow.

42:17.620 --> 42:18.620
Yeah.

42:18.620 --> 42:21.620
And on any base, there's only one chaplain per faith.

42:21.620 --> 42:25.620
So my dad was friends with a rabbi and the others.

42:25.620 --> 42:26.620
Oh, so...

42:26.620 --> 42:28.620
What a coward.

42:28.620 --> 42:29.620
Oh, yeah.

42:29.620 --> 42:35.620
A rabbi, a priest and the right one walking through...

42:35.620 --> 42:37.620
And I had a...

42:37.620 --> 42:41.620
So were all your dad's stories, did this sound like jokes?

42:41.620 --> 42:43.620
Yeah, they're always...

42:43.620 --> 42:48.620
Two Jews walk into a temple.

42:48.620 --> 42:55.620
So I had a baby sitter who came over twice and would play old maid with me

42:55.620 --> 42:56.620
and he was another chaplain.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.620
But then we were telling the story and I remember...

42:59.620 --> 43:00.620
And I don't...

43:00.620 --> 43:02.620
I've never thought of this before and never talked about it

43:02.620 --> 43:04.620
and this does not end in weird touching.

43:04.620 --> 43:07.620
But I had a converse... I was like nine years old

43:07.620 --> 43:10.620
and I was talking to him about my parents' instant coffee

43:10.620 --> 43:11.620
and I was saying, it's so strange.

43:11.620 --> 43:15.620
My parents drink this drink that doesn't taste like other drinks

43:15.620 --> 43:17.620
and it smells strange and it's really weird.

43:17.620 --> 43:20.620
And he gave me brandy.

43:20.620 --> 43:22.620
He was like, do you know what this is?

43:22.620 --> 43:23.620
What this thing is?

43:23.620 --> 43:24.620
Is this a rabbi?

43:24.620 --> 43:26.620
This was actually a priest.

43:26.620 --> 43:28.620
But like...

43:28.620 --> 43:32.620
Oh, Erin, I wonder if you'll be looking over here at the joystick.

43:32.620 --> 43:35.620
But he...

43:35.620 --> 43:37.620
This is called cough syrup.

43:37.620 --> 43:40.620
It'll make the journey so gentle.

43:40.620 --> 43:43.620
My father and I have never talked about this.

43:43.620 --> 43:45.620
This is called a man candy.

43:45.620 --> 43:47.620
He was chaplain Nate.

43:47.620 --> 43:49.620
And I knew that like we stopped...

43:49.620 --> 43:51.620
Chaplain Nate was the one who tried to give you brandy.

43:51.620 --> 43:52.620
...tried to give me brandy.

43:52.620 --> 43:55.620
He stopped babysitting for me because I told my dad that chaplain...

43:55.620 --> 43:57.620
that I was going to marry chaplain Nate.

43:57.620 --> 44:01.620
And you ended up kind of doing just that.

44:01.620 --> 44:03.620
Are you a chaplain, Nate?

44:03.620 --> 44:05.620
Yeah, because I'm an alcoholic. It was a joke.

44:05.620 --> 44:07.620
Yeah, I got it.

44:07.620 --> 44:08.620
Sorry.

44:08.620 --> 44:10.620
This story is not funny. We're good.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.620
No, it's troubling.

44:12.620 --> 44:14.620
Yeah, yeah.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.620
I tell you, it's funny.

44:16.620 --> 44:18.620
When he came over, we played Old Maid.

44:18.620 --> 44:20.620
I sat on his...

44:20.620 --> 44:21.620
Cough.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.620
Wow. Hollywood Squares.

44:25.620 --> 44:27.620
I like to think that you thought...

44:27.620 --> 44:29.620
If you're going to...

44:29.620 --> 44:31.620
If you're going to pause...

44:31.620 --> 44:33.620
How's that Jeff Davis to block?

44:33.620 --> 44:35.620
If you're going to say...

44:35.620 --> 44:37.620
I sat on his and then paused.

44:37.620 --> 44:39.620
Someone's going to say something.

44:39.620 --> 44:40.620
I think it's so funny.

44:40.620 --> 44:42.620
No answer is good. Except for shoes.

44:42.620 --> 44:44.620
You thought that's what Old Maid was.

44:44.620 --> 44:46.620
And then ten years later, you're like,

44:46.620 --> 44:47.620
Let's play Old Maid.

44:47.620 --> 44:48.620
And people are like,

44:48.620 --> 44:50.620
Oh, this is not what Old Maid is.

44:50.620 --> 44:52.620
And I'm like, Cough.

44:52.620 --> 44:55.620
These are the synoptic gospels.

44:55.620 --> 44:57.620
Okay, so you were sitting on his...

44:57.620 --> 44:59.620
We would sit on his lap and we would play Old Maid together.

44:59.620 --> 45:00.620
And then we would have...

45:00.620 --> 45:02.620
How old are you at this point?

45:02.620 --> 45:03.620
Nine.

45:03.620 --> 45:04.620
Nine.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.620
Pretty old Maid.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.620
What is Old Maid?

45:08.620 --> 45:10.620
It's a really old Maid.

45:10.620 --> 45:11.620
Old Maid is like, yeah.

45:11.620 --> 45:12.620
Yeah.

45:12.620 --> 45:13.620
It had pictures instead of suits.

45:13.620 --> 45:14.620
Yes.

45:14.620 --> 45:18.620
And the point of the game is to not end up with the old woman who's alone.

45:20.620 --> 45:21.620
It's a positive message.

45:21.620 --> 45:24.620
Is that the theme of Western society or what?

45:24.620 --> 45:26.620
There are all these space cards.

45:26.620 --> 45:28.620
The barber and the veterinarian.

45:28.620 --> 45:30.620
And then there's the Old Maid who no one loves

45:30.620 --> 45:32.620
and you don't want to end up with her.

45:32.620 --> 45:39.620
Woman's only value is to give her body for reproductive purposes.

45:39.620 --> 45:40.620
But one day...

45:40.620 --> 45:43.620
I am the sexist Indian.

45:43.620 --> 45:45.620
I can get away with it.

45:45.620 --> 45:47.620
I'm vanishing.

45:47.620 --> 45:48.620
And I know...

45:48.620 --> 45:50.620
I hate women.

45:50.620 --> 45:52.620
I know nothing happened and that doesn't make it okay.

45:52.620 --> 45:54.620
But there's a reason why I never saw him again.

45:54.620 --> 45:57.620
Did you tell your dad that you sat on his lap and played Old Maid?

45:57.620 --> 45:58.620
Yeah.

45:58.620 --> 46:00.620
And that he was going to be my husband someday.

46:00.620 --> 46:01.620
I don't know.

46:01.620 --> 46:02.620
I can't remember.

46:02.620 --> 46:04.620
The brandy thing is a memory that has...

46:04.620 --> 46:06.620
You're not sure if that's real.

46:06.620 --> 46:07.620
No, I know that's real.

46:07.620 --> 46:08.620
I know that's real.

46:08.620 --> 46:12.620
When I was 11, I was headlining at the fountain blue in Miami Beach.

46:12.620 --> 46:14.620
An older man came up to me.

46:14.620 --> 46:18.620
He was Jewish and he gave me a bottle of Mogan David.

46:18.620 --> 46:21.620
We played Kabbalah all night long.

46:21.620 --> 46:23.620
You can play Kabbalah?

46:23.620 --> 46:25.620
Who in my day?

46:25.620 --> 46:27.620
Is it Kabbalah that religion?

46:27.620 --> 46:30.620
I guess it's a game to Greg.

46:30.620 --> 46:33.620
There was a game called Kabbalah in the old days.

46:33.620 --> 46:36.620
I'm just being a wieness now.

46:36.620 --> 46:38.620
I don't actually have a story.

46:38.620 --> 46:41.620
I think that was a good call on Aaron's dad's part.

46:41.620 --> 46:43.620
Hell yeah.

46:43.620 --> 46:46.620
But it also seems kind of tragic because I'm also projecting on to this guy.

46:46.620 --> 46:49.620
Like, I don't think he met you any harm.

46:49.620 --> 46:51.620
I will say I'm not...

46:51.620 --> 46:53.620
It's not a dangerous situation.

46:53.620 --> 46:56.620
The facts sound dangerous and weird.

46:56.620 --> 46:58.620
They're good at making it not seem dangerous.

46:58.620 --> 47:00.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:00.620 --> 47:02.620
Why did you want to marry him?

47:02.620 --> 47:03.620
Sorry?

47:03.620 --> 47:05.620
Why did you want to marry him?

47:05.620 --> 47:07.620
Do we allow talking for this?

47:07.620 --> 47:09.620
It's jarring for the...

47:09.620 --> 47:12.620
One of the audience asked why a nine-year-old me wanted to marry him.

47:12.620 --> 47:13.620
Audience?

47:13.620 --> 47:15.620
Because he gave you attention.

47:15.620 --> 47:17.620
Greg, easy. Easy, Greg.

47:17.620 --> 47:19.620
He was a man.

47:19.620 --> 47:23.620
When you're a child, you don't really understand what marriage is.

47:23.620 --> 47:25.620
I wasn't really turned on by anything.

47:25.620 --> 47:27.620
I also wanted to, quote-unquote, marry my dentist.

47:27.620 --> 47:29.620
I wanted to marry the mailman.

47:29.620 --> 47:31.620
There's a man who collected stray dogs outside of our house

47:31.620 --> 47:33.620
and I was going to marry him.

47:33.620 --> 47:35.620
Why would you marry my mom?

47:35.620 --> 47:37.620
I told my mom I wanted to marry her.

47:37.620 --> 47:41.620
Was this before or after you asked if she thought you were handsome?

47:41.620 --> 47:45.620
I did that when I was like 20.

47:45.620 --> 47:47.620
Mom, am I good looking?

47:47.620 --> 47:49.620
I'm afraid to ask other people...

47:49.620 --> 47:51.620
You were 20 when the...

47:51.620 --> 47:53.620
No, I was like probably 17.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.620
34.

47:55.620 --> 47:59.620
Is there a good age to ask your mom if you're hot?

48:01.620 --> 48:03.620
But I think there's a healthy...

48:03.620 --> 48:09.620
Kids want to marry their opposite sex parent if they're straight.

48:09.620 --> 48:11.620
They have a right to be gay as well.

48:11.620 --> 48:13.620
God damn it.

48:13.620 --> 48:15.620
The kids go through this...

48:15.620 --> 48:17.620
By the way, congratulations, Indiana.

48:17.620 --> 48:21.620
And fuck gay rights.

48:21.620 --> 48:23.620
Where was it? Indiana and Utah?

48:23.620 --> 48:25.620
And they just overturned the thing as unconstitutional.

48:25.620 --> 48:27.620
Good job. Gay points for me.

48:29.620 --> 48:31.620
You just negated everything you said.

48:33.620 --> 48:35.620
How many gay points do you currently have right now?

48:37.620 --> 48:39.620
Someone's chair broke on the audience.

48:39.620 --> 48:41.620
Oh, shit.

48:41.620 --> 48:43.620
They're weak chairs.

48:43.620 --> 48:45.620
You probably didn't want me to call attention to that.

48:45.620 --> 48:47.620
Godzilla?

48:47.620 --> 48:49.620
Those chairs are alone.

48:49.620 --> 48:51.620
It happens all the time.

48:51.620 --> 48:55.620
There's some old ones in there still and they break all the time.

48:55.620 --> 48:59.620
When my family moved from Italy to the United States, I had chicken pox.

48:59.620 --> 49:03.620
And you're not allowed to travel with chicken pox, but my parents are so sick of Italy.

49:03.620 --> 49:05.620
I have this memory of my mom.

49:05.620 --> 49:07.620
In my memory, she's beating me.

49:07.620 --> 49:09.620
But...

49:09.620 --> 49:11.620
It probably wasn't her beating me, but she put makeup all over my face.

49:11.620 --> 49:13.620
Didn't tell me what was going on, but...

49:13.620 --> 49:17.620
Were you guys doing the bus and truck company of Godspell on the way home?

49:19.620 --> 49:23.620
Thank you. That was for me and for the Illuminati.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.620
Pedestrians, take a seat.

49:27.620 --> 49:29.620
Thank you. I know you did. You have Asperger's.

49:29.620 --> 49:31.620
My parents...

49:31.620 --> 49:33.620
You're not allowed to take a child with chicken pox onto an international flight.

49:33.620 --> 49:35.620
Of course you're not.

49:35.620 --> 49:39.620
My parents put makeup all over my 10-year-old face.

49:39.620 --> 49:41.620
She doesn't have chicken pox. She's a mime.

49:41.620 --> 49:43.620
She's Elizabeth Taylor.

49:43.620 --> 49:45.620
She's in a Kabuki theater company.

49:45.620 --> 49:47.620
She's Joan Crawford.

49:47.620 --> 49:49.620
Yeah.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.620
The Mikado opens in two nights.

49:51.620 --> 49:53.620
She's just sexy.

49:53.620 --> 49:57.620
I wore my mother's scarves so I could wrap them around my face.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.620
I had no idea what was going on.

49:59.620 --> 50:01.620
I had no idea what was going on.

50:01.620 --> 50:05.620
I see a little baby with a lot of makeup and scarves around their face.

50:05.620 --> 50:07.620
All right!

50:07.620 --> 50:09.620
I'd rather have a baby with chicken pox on the plane.

50:09.620 --> 50:11.620
Okay.

50:11.620 --> 50:13.620
So hopefully no one got sick on that flight.

50:13.620 --> 50:15.620
That's the end of the story.

50:15.620 --> 50:17.620
So why did you guys go from Italy?

50:17.620 --> 50:19.620
Texas.

50:19.620 --> 50:21.620
Your parents were so bored that they went from Italy to Texas?

50:21.620 --> 50:23.620
No.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.620
My dad was getting his master's.

50:25.620 --> 50:27.620
My dad was getting his master's.

50:27.620 --> 50:29.620
My dad was getting his master's.

50:29.620 --> 50:31.620
My dad was getting his master's

50:31.620 --> 50:33.620
degree at a seminary in Texas for nine months.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.620
Boring answer.

50:35.620 --> 50:37.620
Don't you guys think that we should get some feedback about all of this?

50:37.620 --> 50:39.620
From Dungeon Master, Spencer Crinton.

50:39.620 --> 50:41.620
Yes!

50:55.620 --> 50:57.620
It's exciting.

50:57.620 --> 50:59.620
Welcome, Spencer. How are you doing, my brother?

50:59.620 --> 51:01.620
I'm doing pretty good.

51:01.620 --> 51:03.620
I mean, I'm good.

51:03.620 --> 51:05.620
Who babies at you?

51:05.620 --> 51:07.620
I don't know.

51:07.620 --> 51:09.620
I think there's this one girl.

51:09.620 --> 51:11.620
A calculator.

51:11.620 --> 51:13.620
I babysat mostly.

51:13.620 --> 51:15.620
I'm sorry.

51:15.620 --> 51:17.620
I want to hear about how much you loved your baby center.

51:17.620 --> 51:19.620
Did you notice, is this tablecloth a little fancier?

51:19.620 --> 51:21.620
They've been really fancying up the room here.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.620
Yeah.

51:23.620 --> 51:25.620
Other than the chairs that explode when people sit on it.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.620
Yeah.

51:27.620 --> 51:29.620
The audience doesn't get to anything fancy.

51:29.620 --> 51:31.620
But Jeff's podium is...

51:31.620 --> 51:33.620
We're still calling in the audience, huh?

51:33.620 --> 51:35.620
Love and proletarian, I'd say.

51:35.620 --> 51:37.620
The Hoi Ploi.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.620
Yeah.

51:39.620 --> 51:41.620
Anyways, so did you ever ask your mom to marry you?

51:41.620 --> 51:43.620
No.

51:43.620 --> 51:45.620
I was wondering about that.

51:45.620 --> 51:47.620
I don't think so, but you know,

51:47.620 --> 51:49.620
I did get inappropriate situations

51:49.620 --> 51:51.620
with adults.

51:51.620 --> 51:53.620
All right.

51:53.620 --> 51:55.620
Let's hear about one.

51:55.620 --> 51:57.620
Top 10.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.620
Number 10.

51:59.620 --> 52:01.620
Vaughn's parking lot.

52:03.620 --> 52:05.620
I went to...

52:05.620 --> 52:07.620
My grandparents live up north in Northern California,

52:07.620 --> 52:09.620
and we went to visit them.

52:09.620 --> 52:11.620
Ferndale?

52:11.620 --> 52:13.620
Loyalty was where it was.

52:13.620 --> 52:15.620
And there was just some random

52:15.620 --> 52:17.620
kind of state fair.

52:17.620 --> 52:19.620
What do you call them? A fair, a carnival.

52:19.620 --> 52:21.620
Yeah.

52:21.620 --> 52:23.620
There were surprises and rides and attractions,

52:23.620 --> 52:25.620
and everyone was like having a good time.

52:25.620 --> 52:27.620
And I went to try and win one of those,

52:27.620 --> 52:29.620
you know, monkeys, and I won it

52:29.620 --> 52:31.620
because I could knock off a ball,

52:31.620 --> 52:33.620
or I could knock a bottle

52:33.620 --> 52:35.620
with a ball

52:35.620 --> 52:37.620
off of a platform, I guess.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.620
Tell us more about this game.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.620
So you have a bottle...

52:43.620 --> 52:45.620
I'm unclear on the rules.

52:45.620 --> 52:47.620
Is there a timer? Do you press pause?

52:47.620 --> 52:49.620
I'm unclear on the physics.

52:49.620 --> 52:51.620
I like it. Can you use your hands?

52:51.620 --> 52:53.620
I think there's sand.

52:53.620 --> 52:55.620
It makes it harder.

52:55.620 --> 52:57.620
Anyway, I got a monkey,

52:57.620 --> 52:59.620
and the lady who's the carny,

52:59.620 --> 53:01.620
and, you know, don't trust ladies

53:01.620 --> 53:03.620
when you're a kid.

53:03.620 --> 53:05.620
Don't trust carneys either.

53:05.620 --> 53:07.620
But I got this monkey,

53:07.620 --> 53:09.620
and she's like, you know,

53:09.620 --> 53:11.620
you can bring your monkey into my jungle anytime.

53:11.620 --> 53:13.620
And I was like...

53:13.620 --> 53:15.620
How are you? I'm nine.

53:15.620 --> 53:17.620
Well, did you?

53:17.620 --> 53:19.620
Did you bring your monkey into her jungle?

53:19.620 --> 53:21.620
No.

53:21.620 --> 53:23.620
Did you celebrate her papaya with your mango?

53:23.620 --> 53:25.620
No, but I did peel her banana.

53:27.620 --> 53:29.620
She had a banana? That was no lady.

53:29.620 --> 53:31.620
That's no lady, my friend.

53:31.620 --> 53:33.620
You're telling me.

53:33.620 --> 53:35.620
How old was this lady?

53:35.620 --> 53:37.620
You know, old. Old enough

53:37.620 --> 53:39.620
to set off a long-held prejudice

53:39.620 --> 53:41.620
against old people.

53:41.620 --> 53:43.620
Too old for a nine-year-old boy.

53:43.620 --> 53:45.620
Yeah, definitely.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.620
All right, what's the next one?

53:47.620 --> 53:49.620
Do you have a beard? I know.

53:49.620 --> 53:51.620
You're trying to picture a nine-year-old Spencer,

53:51.620 --> 53:53.620
and you can't picture him without a beard.

53:53.620 --> 53:55.620
I picture Spencer just shorter

53:55.620 --> 53:57.620
holding a matchbox car.

53:57.620 --> 53:59.620
I picture him wearing a little rascal's beard,

53:59.620 --> 54:01.620
like a fake beard

54:01.620 --> 54:03.620
that hooks over the ears.

54:03.620 --> 54:05.620
Blah, blah, blah, blah,

54:05.620 --> 54:07.620
blah, blah, blah,

54:07.620 --> 54:09.620
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

54:09.620 --> 54:11.620
He didn't need glasses yet,

54:11.620 --> 54:13.620
but he made them out of cardboard.

54:13.620 --> 54:15.620
Give me more stories.

54:15.620 --> 54:17.620
This is not even an appropriate question,

54:17.620 --> 54:19.620
but did she

54:19.620 --> 54:21.620
think she was attractive?

54:21.620 --> 54:23.620
No, I don't think attractive people

54:23.620 --> 54:25.620
do stuff like that, right?

54:25.620 --> 54:27.620
I don't know.

54:27.620 --> 54:29.620
I think that's bigotry.

54:29.620 --> 54:31.620
That's probably very attractive

54:31.620 --> 54:33.620
pedophiles out there.

54:33.620 --> 54:35.620
You'd make a great cop, Spencer.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.620
Pull over all the ugly people.

54:39.620 --> 54:43.620
They've been diddling someone.

54:43.620 --> 54:45.620
He's too hot

54:45.620 --> 54:47.620
to molest.

54:47.620 --> 54:49.620
I think you'll find people with money

54:49.620 --> 54:51.620
don't commit crimes.

54:51.620 --> 54:53.620
Move along, nothing to see here.

54:53.620 --> 54:55.620
All right, next story, Spencer.

54:55.620 --> 54:57.620
We're going down your

54:57.620 --> 54:59.620
10 molestation brushes

54:59.620 --> 55:01.620
of the 20th century.

55:01.620 --> 55:03.620
I don't think I have

55:03.620 --> 55:05.620
any more molestation stories.

55:05.620 --> 55:07.620
Oh, that's the only one?

55:07.620 --> 55:09.620
Yeah.

55:09.620 --> 55:11.620
We shouldn't be disappointed.

55:13.620 --> 55:15.620
I'm just rooting for the underdog.

55:15.620 --> 55:17.620
Do you want to go faster?

55:17.620 --> 55:19.620
They always

55:19.620 --> 55:21.620
want to be just kept going to carnivals

55:21.620 --> 55:23.620
and having weird interactions with people.

55:23.620 --> 55:25.620
I worked at a carnival for a weekend.

55:25.620 --> 55:27.620
It's terrible.

55:27.620 --> 55:29.620
What did you do?

55:29.620 --> 55:31.620
Three balls for a dollar.

55:31.620 --> 55:33.620
Yeah, that's the game that I won.

55:33.620 --> 55:35.620
It was so confusing in my explanation.

55:35.620 --> 55:37.620
You said you were knocking milk

55:37.620 --> 55:39.620
cans off of a platform.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.620
Oh, you do it.

55:41.620 --> 55:43.620
And the trick is that the hole

55:43.620 --> 55:45.620
in the top is exactly

55:45.620 --> 55:47.620
the size of the ball.

55:47.620 --> 55:49.620
It's possible to...

55:49.620 --> 55:51.620
If people say, I think this is rigged,

55:51.620 --> 55:53.620
you can demonstrate that it's not

55:53.620 --> 55:55.620
with a very careful orchestrated

55:55.620 --> 55:57.620
motion that I had to be taught to me

55:57.620 --> 55:59.620
by a carny,

55:59.620 --> 56:01.620
where you shove the ball straight down

56:01.620 --> 56:03.620
and it'll go right into the thing.

56:03.620 --> 56:05.620
You are me and not good at being a carny.

56:05.620 --> 56:07.620
And so it says,

56:07.620 --> 56:09.620
I think that's rigged and you go to do that.

56:09.620 --> 56:11.620
It bounces off of it

56:11.620 --> 56:13.620
and through the top of the tense

56:13.620 --> 56:15.620
and everyone rolls into the hole.

56:15.620 --> 56:17.620
I want to talk to you about the...

56:17.620 --> 56:19.620
Yeah, I mean, no, it's a...

56:19.620 --> 56:21.620
I don't know, it's not technical.

56:21.620 --> 56:23.620
Because if you...

56:23.620 --> 56:25.620
If you hit it here by like...

56:27.620 --> 56:29.620
Go again, go again.

56:29.620 --> 56:34.620
Go again.

56:34.620 --> 56:36.620
That impression makes me so hot.

56:38.620 --> 56:40.620
It's like you're...

56:40.620 --> 56:42.620
It's horrible.

56:42.620 --> 56:44.620
There's more stutter when you play it.

56:44.620 --> 56:46.620
You finally get to have sex with yourself, Dan.

56:46.620 --> 56:48.620
We finally found a role-play game.

56:50.620 --> 56:52.620
You be me and I'll be me.

56:55.620 --> 56:57.620
Knock my milk bottle off this platform

56:57.620 --> 56:59.620
with your balls.

56:59.620 --> 57:01.620
Get your monkey in my jungle.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.620
Hey, Greg Pips, do you have any advice

57:04.620 --> 57:07.620
for young, very young couples

57:07.620 --> 57:09.620
like myself and Erin?

57:09.620 --> 57:10.620
I do.

57:10.620 --> 57:12.620
Then they're about to get hitched.

57:12.620 --> 57:14.620
Well, I've been married a long time now

57:14.620 --> 57:16.620
and I think you'll find, Dan,

57:16.620 --> 57:18.620
that you need to understand two things

57:18.620 --> 57:20.620
about being a man and a marriage.

57:20.620 --> 57:22.620
One, it's almost inevitable that whatever you've done

57:22.620 --> 57:24.620
is unbelievably erroneous.

57:24.620 --> 57:26.620
And then you have to understand

57:26.620 --> 57:29.620
that your deficiencies are legion.

57:29.620 --> 57:31.620
There is no point in time

57:31.620 --> 57:33.620
where you're going to go,

57:33.620 --> 57:35.620
I fucking win.

57:35.620 --> 57:37.620
Nor is it advisable for you

57:37.620 --> 57:39.620
at any point to decide to win

57:39.620 --> 57:41.620
an argument and or a scrimmage

57:41.620 --> 57:43.620
and or a skirmish and or a battle

57:43.620 --> 57:45.620
and or a war.

57:45.620 --> 57:47.620
It's a very long road

57:47.620 --> 57:49.620
and it's best you'll find,

57:49.620 --> 57:51.620
I believe, for young couples

57:51.620 --> 57:53.620
starting out on this,

57:53.620 --> 57:55.620
this giant golden journey

57:55.620 --> 57:57.620
to the Emerald City.

57:57.620 --> 57:59.620
Mutual respect

57:59.620 --> 58:01.620
for everything the other one does.

58:01.620 --> 58:03.620
In other words, when they come home and go,

58:03.620 --> 58:05.620
I had the hardest day today and you go,

58:05.620 --> 58:07.620
really, I fucking did this.

58:07.620 --> 58:09.620
That's not a big win.

58:09.620 --> 58:11.620
That is

58:11.620 --> 58:13.620
a truck that rolls into the

58:13.620 --> 58:15.620
you know, the lay by

58:15.620 --> 58:17.620
and bursts into flames.

58:17.620 --> 58:19.620
So I would defer is what I'm saying.

58:19.620 --> 58:21.620
Greg, do you do this all the time?

58:21.620 --> 58:23.620
Is that the secret to your happy marriage?

58:23.620 --> 58:25.620
No, I haven't learned it after 30 years.

58:25.620 --> 58:27.620
But I'm just giving you this tip.

58:27.620 --> 58:29.620
How long have you been married?

58:29.620 --> 58:31.620
A while now.

58:31.620 --> 58:33.620
1990.

58:33.620 --> 58:35.620
But your relationship is an inspiration

58:35.620 --> 58:37.620
to listeners of your podcast

58:37.620 --> 58:39.620
because you have so much respect for you.

58:39.620 --> 58:41.620
You refer to your wife as formidable.

58:41.620 --> 58:43.620
Well, and she is.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.620
She's smarter than me. She's better looking than me.

58:45.620 --> 58:47.620
And she's funnier than me.

58:47.620 --> 58:49.620
So I have to keep her

58:49.620 --> 58:51.620
locked up in a closet

58:51.620 --> 58:53.620
almost all the time.

58:53.620 --> 58:55.620
Have you guys ever done any counseling or anything?

58:55.620 --> 58:57.620
Oh, fuck no.

58:57.620 --> 58:59.620
Aaron and I are going to marriage camp.

58:59.620 --> 59:01.620
Have you guys done marriage camp?

59:01.620 --> 59:03.620
Marriage camp, really?

59:03.620 --> 59:05.620
I don't know, but I've been told

59:05.620 --> 59:07.620
your sister's pussy is mighty cold.

59:09.620 --> 59:11.620
Marriage camp.

59:11.620 --> 59:13.620
Wow, what's that like?

59:13.620 --> 59:15.620
Well, it's not an actual camp.

59:15.620 --> 59:17.620
Harmon, get over the goddamn obstacle.

59:17.620 --> 59:19.620
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

59:19.620 --> 59:21.620
Pile!

59:21.620 --> 59:23.620
Greg, will you...

59:23.620 --> 59:25.620
I might make you a rifleman in my beloved corps.

59:25.620 --> 59:27.620
Greg, will you be...

59:27.620 --> 59:29.620
Jeff, look what time it is!

59:29.620 --> 59:31.620
That was never done.

59:33.620 --> 59:35.620
Put the lunch wagon

59:35.620 --> 59:37.620
in front of the cockpit.

59:37.620 --> 59:39.620
Put the lunch wagon

59:39.620 --> 59:41.620
in front of the cockpit.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.620
Lunch wagon.

59:43.620 --> 59:45.620
Greg, we were talking about

59:45.620 --> 59:47.620
the major league earlier.

59:47.620 --> 59:49.620
Dana, I want to hear what you're saying about marriage counseling,

59:49.620 --> 59:51.620
but I don't know what you're saying.

59:51.620 --> 59:53.620
Well, here we go.

59:53.620 --> 59:55.620
Damn it, damn it!

59:55.620 --> 59:57.620
These grotesque fucking cartoon shows

59:57.620 --> 59:59.620
for the goddamn cartoon network.

59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.620
You pay attention to your wife more

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.620
and have more fucking harmony at home.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.620
And goddamn it, stop it.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.620
I'm about as proud of you

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.620
as I've ever been in a couple of her talk to me.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.620
The manager of the major league, everybody.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.620
Well, here it is.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.620
Stop peep-hessing around,

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.620
telling stories about how you fucked your priest

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.620
when you were five years old and shit.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.620
It's not the kind of thing a marriage is built on.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.620
I thought the third season of community

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.620
was a little trite.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.620
That's fighting word.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.620
Season four, it's open season on.

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.620
Because my dad is a minister

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.620
and performs a lot of marriages.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.620
He requires...

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.620
And he's not Catholic, but he requires couples

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.620
to go through a camp, a quote-unquote camp.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.620
How long has this been true of him?

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.620
Since the beginning.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.620
And it's like five sessions.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.620
Have you guys done more than one?

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.620
We...

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.620
Well, this isn't at the behest of her dad.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.620
You're making it sound like we're doing this...

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.620
No, I mean, I always grew up thinking

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.620
that that was...

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.620
Standard.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.620
You talked to my dad.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.620
We had a couple of breakout sessions.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.620
That was all.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.620
Thank you.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.620
One person in the whole fucking crowd.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.620
Then we had a small meeting and then a confab.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.620
And then a breakfast, then we blue-skied for a while.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.620
That was all.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.620
Thank you.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.620
Two people in the fucking room, really?

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.620
Fuck you.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.620
Easy action.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.620
Sorry.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.620
Easy action.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.620
I'm having a mediator.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.620
I know Dan talked about it at length in the last episode.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.620
But it's been awesome.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.620
How many sessions have you guys been to?

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.620
Only technically one. We did a consultation.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.620
No more sessions since the last...

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.620
Is there an obstacle course or what?

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.620
Yeah, there's a...

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.620
There's this hall of mirrors.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.620
And Dan has to tell me whether or not I look good.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.620
And...

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.620
There's just a series of genes that you

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.620
repeatedly ask me if you look fatted.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.620
And then there are all these...

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.620
No, yes, yes, no, no.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.620
There are these Chris Evans cutouts.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.620
And I have to just look at Dan.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.620
In the hall of mirrors,

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.620
you have to be like, which mirror do I look best in?

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.620
And he has to point to you.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.620
That's not any of the mirrors.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.620
This one.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.620
There's a bed where there's just a mannequin

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.620
that comes to the door with pizza

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.620
and we have to argue

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.620
about who's going to go down

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.620
and get it.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.620
That's the big...

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.620
That's what we fight about.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.620
Yeah.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.620
It's like soon as there's a doorbell,

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.620
I take my pants off.

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.620
Because I'm like, oh, you have to go down.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.620
That's our test too.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.620
We do that too.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.620
I take my pants off before the...

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.620
Do you really?

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.620
I do.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.620
I do that too, but I live alone.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.620
And you just like

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.620
answering the door in your pants.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.620
Ding dong, zip.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.620
Jeff does it when our pizza guy comes over

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.620
inside the window.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.620
He's just in the garden taking his pants off.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.620
He just watches us eat.

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.620
He loves it.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.620
Yeah, it's amazing.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.620
It's...

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.620
All the fights that we have

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.620
where we get drunk

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.620
and we say mean things to each other

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.620
and we're bad people

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.620
and we have to apologize in the morning,

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.620
but I think the ugliest...

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.620
The ugliest part

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.620
of us is when the fucking guy comes

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.620
out of the food.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.620
We just lay there

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.620
and try to out baby each other.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.620
I put my pajamas on.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.620
The person who goes down to the door

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.620
may as well be Joan of Arc.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.620
They're a fucking murder.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.620
Once you're like, oh, oh, go.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.620
Yeah, oh yeah.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.620
How's the Pad Thai tasting? Is it good?

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.620
It was salted with my sweat.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.620
Yeah, I think I just sort of decided

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.620
I'll just get the door.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.620
I've made that decision and now it's way easier.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.620
I'll be the one who always goes

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.620
and it's just...

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:07.620
Let me ask you something, Kamal.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.620
Do you take the garbage out as well?

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.620
Yeah.

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.620
I think you'll find that you do.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.620
There's a certain tasks that are assigned...

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.620
Wait, what's going on? What do you know?

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.620
I'm just giving her an inch.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.620
I don't think this is going to go wrong, right?

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.620
No, I'm saying this is the natural state of things.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.620
I'm not being sexist

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.620
or horrible in any way.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.620
I'm saying that you'll find

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.620
you'll take the garbage out

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.620
unless you're not there.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:37.620
She actually does...

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.620
I mean, she does way more around the house.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.620
We're children.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.620
We've been infantilized.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.620
Oh, our job is to be funny

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.620
on occasion, not with this crowd,

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.620
but in front of other folks

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.620
every 15 to 30 seconds.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.620
We laugh, turn, whatnot.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.620
Yeah, well, it's...

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.620
Okay, for us, she's...

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.620
Just edit

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.620
any response I've had.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.620
No, for us,

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.620
the one thing we fight about is

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.620
other than who's going to the door

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.620
is the balance of work and family.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.620
That's the fight we have all the time.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.620
What does that mean? Family meaning the two of you?

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.620
Yeah, the two of us and the house.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.620
No, not... We don't give a shit.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.620
Fuck your families.

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.620
That's people.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.620
No, I've been screening

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.620
their calls for a while.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.620
Balance with them?

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.620
Yeah, no, yeah, balance of...

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.620
Because she's sort of...

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.620
She's in the same line of work

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.620
like she's a writer and producer.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.620
So we both sort of work from home

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.620
and it can happen that you could just...

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:41.620
Because we work together too, so it's hard sometimes

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.620
your relationship...

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.620
You don't want it to become just a work relationship.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.620
So we really have rules like

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.620
you can't talk about work unless you say

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.620
because we do a bunch of stuff together

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.620
and that has really, really helped

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.620
us sort of negotiate that a lot.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.620
Because sometimes...

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.620
If you're talking about work, sometimes

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.620
you can get into a fight

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.620
because you're in the middle of being married

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.620
and also being a co-worker with someone.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.620
You can get into fights that you wouldn't get into

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.620
if you were in either of those camps.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.620
So that was

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.620
one thing that we had to sort of figure out

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.620
and I think that's been good.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.620
You mean like, did you call so and so?

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.620
Oh, that's my

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.620
fucking job now!

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.620
I'm trying to eat a hard boiled egg!

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.620
I'm allergic to eggs

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.620
but the rest of it's pretty accurate.

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.620
Oh, you're allergic to eggs!

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.620
Then why didn't you tell me that before I made two?

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.620
Honey, if you were paying attention for the last

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.620
seven years...

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.620
Why don't you eat your fucking yogurt

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.620
and just sit in the fucking corner, alright?

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:47.620
You shouldn't have to try to eat a hard boiled egg.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.620
Yeah, you should have that down by now.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.620
So are we going to open this fifth bottle of wine

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.620
or what?

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.620
Right?

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.620
I thought you were...

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.620
I was immediately like, oh yeah, we are out of vodka.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.620
Are we really?

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:07.620
Yeah, I know, it's a record we sent you.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.620
We've never run out of vodka.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.620
Yeah, we're out of vodka really.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.620
Camille, your wife is a family,

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.620
not practicing right now,

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.620
but is a licensed family therapist.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.620
I've thought about...

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.620
I think about you guys a lot.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.620
Right.

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:25.620
No, she is.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.620
How does that affect your relationship

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.620
in that way?

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.620
Because she can say, well...

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.620
Jacoby...

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.620
Nickelmide.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.620
Is that a real person?

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.620
Yes.

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.620
No, no, no.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.620
Well, here's what...

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.620
My dad's a psychiatrist too,

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.620
so we sort of both know...

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.620
What she'll do is she'll call me

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.620
on my little bullshit tricks,

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.620
and being with her, I've understood myself

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.620
way more than I ever did.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.620
So she'll be like, alright, you're angry,

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.620
but you're not angry at this,

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.620
what are you really angry at?

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.620
And I'm like, that's true, because for me,

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.620
it's like something is going on,

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.620
and then I just do a magic eight ball

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.620
wheel, like alright,

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.620
I'm angry at the cat now.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.620
There will be times

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.620
where I was like one time,

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.620
she came home and I was just in my underwear

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.620
looking for this, I was like,

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:21.620
I can't find my Bruce Springsteen t-shirt.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.620
And she was like, okay,

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.620
I have a seat, turn on the air conditioner,

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.620
you're sweating, this isn't

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.620
about Bruce Springsteen, is it?

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.620
And it wasn't,

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.620
I was anxious about

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.620
a job I was starting,

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.620
so that's what...

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.620
She's helped me

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.620
realize, like, focus

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.620
on the thing that

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.620
I'm actually feeling,

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.620
you have a Bruce Springsteen t-shirt?

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.620
I'm a massive Bruce Springsteen fan.

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.620
Are you really?

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.620
Oh, now they're here.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.620
Hurray for you,

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.620
I didn't know the whole crowd was for

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.620
fucking T-neck tonight.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:05.620
Nice, T-neck.

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.620
I got married right by T-neck.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.620
Which exit? Good night, everybody.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.620
Oh, to go back to what you were saying, Spencer.

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.620
Oh!

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.620
That was a Mike Slam.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.620
But like a very gentle one.

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:25.620
This is a little tied to what you were saying.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.620
By the way, I did a Chris Rock mic drop

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.620
at this convention in Florida,

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.620
where I did a big mic broke.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.620
But it was broken already.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.620
That complicates the story, I was holding it,

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.620
it was in two pieces already,

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.620
and then I did a bit where I was like,

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.620
and then it fell apart, and then the engineers were like,

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.620
and I was like, I'll buy you a mic.

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.620
And that made them love me.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.620
I've never been famous enough

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.620
to wear a mic drop, but I do do this

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.620
all the time.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.620
Soft.

01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.620
That's like a catch and release of mic drops.

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.620
When I was getting married,

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.620
there was a big story in T-neck.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.620
There was a guy who worked

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.620
at a funeral home, guess what he was doing?

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.620
I'll tell you, fucking dead old ladies.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.620
Like women in their 80s.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.620
And I saw a picture, he was 28

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.620
and very handsome.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.620
You're just into what you're into, man.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.620
I like to think that maybe he was so good at sex

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.620
that it was like going to the hardest difficulty setting

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.620
in a video game.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.620
It's like playing basketball

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.620
with weights on your ankles.

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.620
What if it was a corpse?

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.620
Fuck, I can come in any situation.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.620
I can make her come.

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.620
That is marriage counseling.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.620
You know what I'm saying?

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.620
Not only is she old, she's dead.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.620
She died of being old.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.620
And I fucked her.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.620
I fucked her back to life.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:01.620
We've all been there.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.620
What do you think, Spencer?

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.620
Flies in the face of your profiling?

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:07.620
Yeah, I'm really turning a new page in my book.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.620
About fucking old ladies.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.620
There was a guy digging up old ladies

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.620
and fucking the...

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.620
He didn't have to dig them up.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.620
He got the right job further.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.620
He was like, you know, going right to the fucking...

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.620
Was it only old ladies

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.620
or was it the fact that there were only old ladies

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.620
currently in the funeral home?

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.620
I just know that the three...

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.620
If a young lady died, he'd be like,

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.620
Fucking it!

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.620
It's Christmas!

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.620
If you're that curvy, I think anything at that point.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.620
I think...

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.620
That's so awful.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.620
They were both in their 80s, the women that they...

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.620
And they obviously didn't say the names of the ladies,

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.620
but the family probably read it like,

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.620
Wait, that's how old Nana was.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.620
That's the funeral home we used.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.620
Survived by two cousins in Saacakis.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.620
How did he get...

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.620
Did someone walk in on him?

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.620
Yeah, that's my question.

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.620
I think...

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.620
How do you get caught when you work

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.620
in a funeral parlor and you just

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.620
like to fuck dead people?

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.620
That seems like the perfect little biosphere.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.620
Yeah, then you just embalm them

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.620
and that's like all the evidence is sealed up in there.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.620
Yeah, uh-oh.

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.620
I don't...

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.620
Wait, in your head...

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.620
In my head, he was pulling out for some reason.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.620
Just like, we can't picture

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.620
Spencer without a beard.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.620
You're just like, well, that's how sex acts.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.620
Oh, my God.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.620
I feel so bad about Ruma Klanahan now.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.620
She's so cute.

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.620
Oh, God, I was going to say something horrible.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.620
You've already said a bunch of horrible shit.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.620
I mean, how do you quantify that crime?

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.620
Like, Dan, if I died

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.620
and you found out, because obviously

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.620
the embalmers would rape me.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.620
She's so proud of herself.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.620
No, I'm not. No, I am not.

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.620
But like, because like,

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.620
you know, my body is dead,

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.620
what do you...

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.620
Like, what do you want to do to that?

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.620
Like, what do you do?

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.620
What do you mean?

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.620
Are you asking him to fuck you when you're dead?

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.620
It really felt like that's where this was going.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.620
I'm imagining finding out

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.620
that like, my aunt was

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.620
raped after she was

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.620
dead.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.620
I don't...

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.620
I don't know how to place those feelings

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.620
because she's not there.

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.620
And he is disrespectful.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.620
Like, what is the punishment for that crime?

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.620
He dies and then he's raped,

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.620
but he never feels it. I mean, like, what is the...

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.620
Wait, are you on the side of the guy who's doing that?

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.620
No, no!

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.620
No, she's just asking, how do you...

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.620
No, I'm like, how do you... what is the...

01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.620
Are you saying it's just like at that point,

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:01.620
are you asking if Dan would become Batman

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.620
and avenge you somewhere?

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:05.620
No, I think she's asking, is there really a crime?

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:07.620
Because it's just like a piece of furniture now, so...

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.620
No, I'm not saying is there really...

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.620
I mean, I'm asking an inappropriate show.

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.620
If you can fuck a cow, it's a show.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.620
What I'm saying is like, I don't even know...

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.620
I mean, what do you even...

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.620
You're saying it's a victimless crime?

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.620
No!

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.620
Well, it kind of is. I mean, it technically is.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.620
It depends on your religion, if it's a victim...

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.620
How victimless it is.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.620
I wonder if there's another topic besides

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.620
necrophilia.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.620
I can't believe we got to 105 episodes

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.620
without talking about necrophilia.

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.620
What's funny is I was going to say

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.620
qualified, non-consensual necrophilia,

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.620
but I guess all of it is.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.620
Well, then you might have

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.620
like a special clause in your will.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:47.620
Yeah.

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.620
I think the victims of the...

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.620
the families when they read in the paper

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.620
that a guy got caught fucking old ladies...

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.620
Well, you know...

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.620
There should be a punishment, but I mean,

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.620
what is the punishment?

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.620
I think he's in jail.

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.620
What category do you put it in though?

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.620
Because...

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.620
I think what you do is if a guy gets caught,

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.620
let's say, fucking women

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.620
in the funeral home.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.620
What you do is you kill his grandma

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.620
and you fuck her right in front of him.

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:17.620
That's it.

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:19.620
I mean, that's the answer I was looking for.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.620
I mean, that's the search

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.620
for brainstorming sessions.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.620
I'm just spitballing her, you guys.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.620
No wrong answers. Let the punishment

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.620
be the crime, is what I'm saying.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.620
Well, this is funny, oh God. This is not funny.

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.620
What I'm going to say is not funny,

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.620
but there was

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.620
a serial killer in Pakistan

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.620
who...

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.620
who's going around

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.620
killing, like, this is a bummer of a story.

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.620
He was

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.620
killing little, like, poor kids

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.620
and dissolving them in acid. This is what he was doing.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.620
I'm definitely going to listen to this podcast.

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.620
This is one of the ones that makes the cut.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.620
I was going to say, finally we make the cut.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.620
I'm going to listen to this one.

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.620
And he was like, listen, I've killed, like, 60 some kids.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.620
I want to get to 100. Stop me.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.620
And the cops literally, like, laughed and kicked him out.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.620
Then he finally got to 100.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.620
He was like, ah, I actually did do it.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.620
I did it. I killed 100.

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.620
I told you I was going to, and then I did.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.620
And the official punishment,

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.620
because he dissolved 100 kids in acid,

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.620
was this was what

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.620
the court said, kill him,

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.620
cut his body into 100 pieces,

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.620
and then dissolve him in acid.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:27.620
A slam jump. Yeah, that's a pack of slam.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.620
Pack of slam.

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.620
Pack of slam.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.620
You've been pack of slammed.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.620
Pack of snaps. Pack of snap.

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.620
This week on Pack of Slammed,

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.620
this guy thought he could get away with killing 100 children.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.620
What he doesn't know is that

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.620
after he's dead, his body

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.620
will be 100 tiny pieces

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.620
of him.

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.620
Penny White experiences some new sensations

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.620
on a new hot in Cleveland.

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:53.620
I'm going to go home

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.620
and Google how we treat

01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.620
our dad and somebody

01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.620
in different weird ways.

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.620
It's a huge thing.

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.620
It's like, yeah, what is our relationship

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.620
with?

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.620
They say that

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.620
Cro-Magnon,

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.620
which is what we are. We're Cro-Magnon, right?

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:13.620
As opposed to Neanderthals,

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.620
who we kind of out-hunted

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.620
to extinction, although some people believe

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:19.620
that we interbred with them.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.620
Neanderthals, in spite of being

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.620
a little dumber in different ways,

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.620
they couldn't

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.620
invent ranged weapons

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.620
which we used to just hunt them to extinction,

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:31.620
but that they

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:33.620
buried their dead

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.620
and they buried them with

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:37.620
trinkets and stuff, which Cro-Magnons

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.620
didn't do. We are descended

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.620
from more atheistic animals

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.620
than the brutes

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.620
that we hunted,

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.620
we elbowed out of

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.620
existence

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.620
by being smart.

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.620
I don't know how to process that.

01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:55.620
I just want to fuck a dead old lady.

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:57.620
Well, I think,

01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.620
you know how I feel about religion and all,

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.620
but I think the ritual

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.620
of someone dying in the way you treat them

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.620
is, you know, that's how you sort of

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.620
say goodbye to them and that's how you process

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.620
your feelings of, you know, that this person is dead.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.620
I feel like, I don't know, in our culture

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.620
especially, we don't really know how to

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.620
do that. When my mom

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.620
died in our house,

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.620
she was dying and she died in our house

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.620
in, like, the den

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.620
and we just turned the lights off

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.620
and waited for the

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:27.620
for the

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.620
the

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.620
corner?

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.620
We waited for the corner and just went in the other room

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.620
and watched Muppet Treasure Island.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.620
That's one way to

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.620
do it.

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.620
No wrong answers.

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:45.620
That's actually what the Quran says.

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.620
No, that's the Muppets Take Man Head.

01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.620
No, you have to watch a Tim Curry

01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.620
movie according to the Quran.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.620
It has to be the worst

01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.620
witch or it has to be the Muppet Treasure Island.

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.620
We stood around her

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.620
for a while and then we're like, oh,

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.620
I

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.620
don't know what else to do

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.620
and we just turned off. She died in the den.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.620
She died in the den.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.620
It's like,

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.620
how long has it been since you guys seen Muppet Treasure Island?

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.620
And so there's

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.620
a corpse in the other room?

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:21.620
It's a mom.

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.620
Not a corpse.

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.620
That's another thing.

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.620
Our relationship with death has changed.

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.620
It changed in modern society.

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.620
I mean, it wasn't a cool night.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:33.620
It wasn't like, listen,

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.620
tonight, bit of A, bit of B.

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.620
You're the reason they call them.

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:39.620
She died.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:41.620
We were all like, and now,

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.620
and we all kind of like spread.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.620
How old were you? 17.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.620
And you sort of knew that she was

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.620
Yeah, she was dying.

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:51.620
It wasn't a sudden thing.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.620
She was in the hospital.

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.620
She had a bed set up in the den.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:57.620
It wasn't upstairs because she couldn't go

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.620
up and down the stairs. She was dying of ovarian cancer.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.620
She died in the den.

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.620
We all kind of knew the day it was happening.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.620
It happened.

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.620
And then we were all like, and

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.620
like we had this grieving period

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.620
that was very intense

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.620
and then we were all like, and now

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:15.620
you have homework

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.620
and I have, I mean, it was

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:19.620
it was a casual

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.620
like I watched Muppet Treasure Island

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.620
for a reason.

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:25.620
I loved it. It was very comforting.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.620
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I guess

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.620
when that happens, like how do you

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:31.620
process it and when you go back to like

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.620
normal life and there is something to be said

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.620
or I think part of the reason that there is so much

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.620
ritual to it is that it gives you stuff to do

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.620
after this horrible

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.620
thing has happened. Now you have like

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.620
preparations to make and you have to set up

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:45.620
a funeral home and all that stuff.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.620
It felt very inappropriate when the doorbell rang

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.620
and Tim Curry

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.620
is singing

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.620
Cabin Fever and I'm

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.620
fuck, I have to pause it.

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.620
She's here.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.620
She's right there.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.620
Oh my god, that's, I mean, that's

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.620
the amazing thing about

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.620
death is that it's, it

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.620
intermingles with life and like we don't, we

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.620
do everything we can to not make it feel like that

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.620
but when you talk to people who have had

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.620
real experiences with

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:15.620
real encounters with death,

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.620
of course part of the story is going to be

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.620
the seemingly profane

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.620
absurdly

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.620
braided experience of

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.620
then I ordered a pizza

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.620
and then a friend came over and we played

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:29.620
Yahtzee or whatever.

01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.620
I saw that, remember

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.620
that Penn Gillette had that show

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.620
on Showtime and I don't know.

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.620
They were, they were, they were in a funeral

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.620
industry in one episode

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.620
and I was interested to learn

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.620
from that show if that show is credible

01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.620
that we,

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.620
the reason they're called funeral parlors

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.620
is because what we now call

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.620
living rooms, we specifically

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.620
made a decision, Good Housekeeping

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:55.620
Magazine they cite as the,

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.620
they made a sort of

01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.620
deliberate decision the way

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.620
Hearst Newspapers decided

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.620
to go after hemp, like

01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.620
we made a decision to go after

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.620
death and that Good

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.620
Housekeeping Magazine suddenly announced

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.620
at a certain point during a certain year

01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.620
this is now called the living room because

01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.620
your house isn't for dead people, you don't

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.620
want dead people in your house because before

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.620
that you had a parlor and part of the parlor's

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:21.620
function was that your relatives

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.620
died and you, that's where they

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:25.620
stayed and everyone came over

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.620
and paid their respects and took photos

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:29.620
and hung out and took photographs with them

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.620
and what not and played parlor games

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.620
like charades. What about ice cream parlors?

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.620
Uh, that

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.620
great question

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.620
Are you Rain Man?

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.620
Yeah, Kmart sucks.

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.620
It's like a child walking to the room

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.620
What about

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.620
ice cream parlors?

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.620
We had, we had funeral,

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.620
we had funeral parlors, we had ice cream parlors

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.620
He's mad, he's mad! They took the ice cream

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.620
out of our living room

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.620
Yeah, when you got ice cream you would

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:05.620
you would sit in a room for two days

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.620
I gotta go to somewhere else

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.620
to eat my ice cream

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.620
bullshit

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.620
But yeah, I want to eat my ice cream

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.620
in my living room with my dead nanny

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.620
nanna and watch fucking

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.620
Muppet Treasure, I look like a fucking human being

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.620
It's strange that we do such

01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:25.620
unnatural things too

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.620
America

01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:29.620
has spearheaded these strange relationships

01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.620
with titties and dead people

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.620
like like like

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.620
you go to Italy, you turn on a TV

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.620
and there would be one tittie

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.620
in a fucking commercial for

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.620
yogurt

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.620
They have like a one tittie rule

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.620
in Europe

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.620
I'm turning to Greg because he's

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.620
cosmopolitan

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.620
I

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:53.620
breast don't kill people in Europe

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.620
America's relationship with boobs

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.620
with nudity and death

01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.620
When I was

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.620
in Paris, I went underground and they had those catacombs

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.620
I was like, I was amazed

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.620
I was walking for what seemed like miles

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.620
of fucking ice cream

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.620
They had dug the material

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.620
to build the city out of these tunnels

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.620
and then put their dead down there

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.620
and it was like, oh shit

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.620
there's nothing like this under New York

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.620
there's nothing

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.620
We don't like death

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.620
We don't like boobs

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.620
There's one like order

01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.620
like a monk or they're called the cappuccino

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.620
I think, have you been there?

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.620
You go into the basement and all their dead

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.620
priests they use to decorate

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:35.620
their place so they've made like these wonderful

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:37.620
like amazing

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.620
like you know so it would be just like a bunch of skulls

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:41.620
there but like these awesome designs

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:43.620
that looks like wings and stuff

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.620
and it feels like to me

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:47.620
it's a lot healthier way of dealing with death

01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.620
but if I like looking at it

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:51.620
Of course, dealing with it

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.620
When they go to those places and you're up there

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.620
called an ossuary, I remember going to one with my wife

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.620
That's right, an ossuary

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.620
And in skulls they had written

01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:01.620
etche mort which means look at death

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.620
and it's just a wall of fucking skulls

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.620
It's wildly morbid

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:07.620
It could have just said

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.620
Snickers is packed with peanuts

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.620
because you would be looking at death

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.620
while they could have worked some

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:15.620
fine fucks this in the ice cream parlour

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:19.620
Now we're real uncomfortable

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.620
I'm mad about ice cream parlours, I don't know why

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.620
America is a very young country

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.620
it doesn't want to believe

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.620
in death, it doesn't want to believe

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:29.620
in sex either, it doesn't want to believe

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.620
it wants to believe in violence

01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.620
we love violence

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.620
but we don't understand

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.620
fucking and dying yet

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.620
You know, I'm just fine

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.620
I'm not a

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.620
happy 4th of July

01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.620
Happy birthday, Murph

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.620
I don't know if we all believe in death

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.620
but I do believe in dungeons and dragons

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.620
Let's get it on

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.620
That was so

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.620
God, give me a better cue

01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.620
than

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:01.620
when we last time on Harmontown

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.620
Our heroes had barely

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.620
escaped from paradise with their lives

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.620
and after robbing a gnomish bar

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.620
and fighting off the local gang

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:11.620
the cactus bunch

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.620
the party set fire to the bar and exited

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.620
Quark, noticing the fire

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.620
spreading, went to warn the locals

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.620
and alerted a gnomed barber

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.620
who got in an argument with the barbarian

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:23.620
before scuttling off

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:25.620
Afraid of legal backlash, our heroes

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:27.620
tried to escape the city

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.620
but found woven barriers blocking any egress

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:31.620
Sharpie burnt a hole in the woven wall

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.620
and with some of Christopher's acid

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.620
they tore their way through

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.620
and into the cold tundra

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.620
outside

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.620
there they found themselves completely lost

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:43.620
with only a burning sack laying in the ice

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.620
that is until a Yeti

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.620
came upon the gang

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.620
ignoring Quark's friendliness

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.620
he threw a net on the gang

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:53.620
but would they appreciate being in a net?

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.620
was the Yeti gonna eat them?

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:57.620
would Bill Mardigan simply burn

01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:59.620
to death and everyone in it

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:08.620
find out on an all-new Harmontown

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.620
yeah we escaped the city

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:12.620
by burning our way through the wall

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:14.620
after burning everything

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.620
then we're in a tundra

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.620
a Yeti came up through a net over us

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:19.620
I don't know why I'm repeating that

01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:21.620
well, for Greg, right?

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.620
we were at a wonderful place

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.620
everyone was nice to us, we burned everything

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:27.620
and now we're...

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.620
we've become just sociopaths

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.620
that's the game now

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.620
in the last two episodes, I wasn't really myself

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.620
and I really wanted that baby

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.620
do we have the robot golem baby?

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.620
oh, you guys got it

01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:44.620
but it doesn't have the life thing in it, right?

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:48.620
Greg, we're in possession of a small robotic golem baby

01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.620
that needs a certain disc to make it operable

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.620
absolutely enchanting

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:54.620
enchanting

01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.620
so you guys, you're in the middle of this cold

01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.620
you know, frozen wasteland

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.620
sort of situation

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.620
you're underneath a big Yeti net

01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.620
and there's a big Yeti, he's looking at you guys

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.620
he takes a few steps back

01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:09.620
after seeing you guys in the net

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:10.620
and he grunts

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.620
and he raises the hands like this

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.620
raise the roof

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.620
he's raising the roof?

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:16.620
he's doing that

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.620
but that doesn't exist in Dean

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:20.620
I admit it, I emulate it

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.620
you're into it, you guys are just doing that

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:23.620
I do it too

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.620
I go, we're your friends

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.620
we're your friends

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:28.620
I go, whoop whoop

01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.620
those things all happen

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.620
just kind of like a weird miming thing going on

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:37.620
no communication is really happening

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.620
can I make eye contact with him?

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:42.620
Yeti

01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:43.620
yeah, go ahead

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.620
Yeti

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:47.620
what's happening?

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:48.620
ah

01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.620
it's

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.620
who do

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.620
move

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:54.620
do I speak this language?

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.620
is he stuttering?

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.620
is he having a stroke?

01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:57.620
or is this a language?

01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:58.620
it's a language you don't understand

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:00.620
he's speaking backwards, I think

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:01.620
say it again

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.620
it's

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:03.620
stuff

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:05.620
he's saying

01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:06.620
futzty

01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:11.620
but the blinding snow and driving wind

01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.620
give way to the sound of hoof prints

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:14.620
I mean, hoof sounds

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.620
what's the

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:16.620
whoo

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:18.620
oh my gosh

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.620
yee

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.620
oh my god

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:22.620
is that

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.620
I think it's

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.620
it's Tylenol with coating

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.620
once again

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.620
by the infinitesimal genitalia of Justin Bieber

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:36.620
I have arrived at

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.620
at a moment most propitious

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:41.620
oh fell Yeti

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.620
taste my vengeance upon thee

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:45.620
as I allow

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:46.620
as I

01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.620
one, I detect evil

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:49.620
and two

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:55.620
I do something else that's poorly spelled

01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:58.620
is it Tylenol with coating?

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:00.620
yeah

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:01.620
his eye

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:04.620
he who is both female and male

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:05.620
immortal and mortal

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:07.620
horse and man

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:11.620
part you and part human

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.620
Richard Simmons?

01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:15.620
like Suarez

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.620
I will bite you if you're Italian

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:23.620
what is this Yeti I see before me?

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.620
is this a Bigfoot in white garb?

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.620
it definitely is

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.620
you use your magical

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.620
evil sensing horn

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:32.620
to see if it's evil

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:35.620
and you detect no evil in its heart

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.620
oh

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.620
oh

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.620
indeed

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.620
my horn is fallible

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.620
sometimes my horn misdiagnoses

01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.620
like Dick Van Dyke on the show

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:51.620
wow

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:53.620
you gotta update your references Tylenol with coating

01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:58.620
a pile of shit thou Edith

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.620
my references will remain eternal

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:05.620
you speak them with such confidence

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:06.620
there's no need to update

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:08.620
ta ever so

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:11.620
that has always been my favorite in secret

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:15.620
there is no evil in this Yeti

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.620
and let me whisk you away

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:18.620
all upon you

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.620
jump upon my back and we shall fly

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:23.620
like a duck's ass sliding down an icy hill backwards

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620
we're in a net

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.620
we're in a net

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.620
but before we go

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:31.620
the Yeti has hidden treasure

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.620
that has not been spoken of

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:36.620
for Yetis are known to keep up on their person

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.620
and in a case about them

01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:40.620
much much much riches

01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:43.620
I brandish my cutlass

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:45.620
and I slice through the net

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:48.620
you slice into the net

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:50.620
but it's made out of steel

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.620
the net bounces off

01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:56.620
Tylenol with coating do you know this Yeti

01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.620
or is this a new Yeti to you

01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:00.620
indeed

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.620
all Yetis are but one and the same

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:03.620
if thou hast met one

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.620
thou hast met them all

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.620
racist

01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:08.620
that sounds very racist

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:10.620
I am eternal

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:12.620
these are truths that I speak

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:15.620
not bromides and platitudes, saws

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:18.620
and well-worn tropes

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.620
these are but things from experience

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.620
plucket I have from my passage

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.620
to past

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:29.620
I don't know if that answered my question

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.620
indeed

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:34.620
thou hast much treasure dost thou not Yeti

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.620
keeping in thy case that thou keeps behind thee

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:39.620
it grunts at you

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.620
and you can understand what it's saying

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:43.620
of course I can my father thought

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.620
says it on page two

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.620
it says my chest is back at my house

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.620
fuck all day and fuck my luck

01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.620
many riches were I to grab this day

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.620
but it seems that the Yeti has none upon him

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.620
how so any credit cards

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.620
what's a credit card

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.620
Jesus ain't you fucking hillbilly

01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.620
can you get the Yeti to remove the net

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.620
let us out of the net

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:12.620
and ask him what's happening

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.620
indeed

01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:15.620
Yeti free my friends would sell

01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.620
for thou's is listening to thine equine master

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.620
he says oh these guys are your friends

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.620
I thought they were just animals

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.620
so let me let me get that for you

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.620
racist racist

01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:31.620
they are but comedians who live in Los Angeles

01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.620

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.620
Yeti

01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:58.620
he does so

01:33:58.620 --> 01:33:59.620
he removes the net

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:00.620
a solid thou's would do me

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:01.620
he puts it away

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:04.620
sorry about that

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:05.620

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.620
do we understand him

01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:07.620
we don't understand him

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:08.620
no

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:09.620
I understand him

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.620
he has wished us most apologies

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.620

01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:13.620

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:15.620
cocoa I have made

01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:16.620
in a cavern nearby

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.620
oh

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:24.620
I've taken me before the Yeti

01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.620
and

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:28.620
like kind of

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:30.620

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.620
subservience

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:37.620
yeah

01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:38.620
he removed the net right

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.620
so I'm like

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.620
I kneel before him

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.620
yeah

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:43.620
like a strong

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:45.620
but servile

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.620
man

okay

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.620
and I go

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.620
and I just gesture to him

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.620
because I know he can't speak

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.620
English

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.620
and I go

01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:58.620
I give him a thumbs up

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.620
because we watch that Roger Ebert

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:02.620
yeah

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:04.620
so sad he keeps giving

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:05.620
everything a thumbs up

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:09.620
well he does

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:11.620
he really did at the end

01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:12.620
he was very forgiving

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:14.620
to a lot of terrible movies

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.620
yeah

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.620
right at the end

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.620
right at the end he's like

01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:19.620
monster house is great

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:24.620
Tylenol with coding

01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:25.620

01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:26.620

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:28.620
I haven't seen her in a while

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:30.620
she is most delicious

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.620
and chocolatey most

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:34.620
let us away

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:35.620
and let our feet break wind

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.620
as we travel across this

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.620
Pampas

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:41.620
I ask

01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.620
Tylenol with coding

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.620
Tylenol with coding

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.620
oh Genome to see

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:46.620
to whose face I have sat upon

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:47.620
in the past

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.620
he remembers

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.620
oh most tranquil Genome

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.620
my thighs have sought

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.620
analgesia on my nose

01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.620
he never forgets a face

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.620

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:03.620

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.620
a place

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:11.620

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:13.620

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.620
to the honeycomb hideout

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:42.620
the honeycomb kids are there

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:44.620
I get a

01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:46.620
so together you

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.620
ride off and you

01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.620
ride towards

01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:49.620
what you couldn't

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.620
even see before

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:51.620
but once you get

01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.620
upon it it's like

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:53.620
a little white smear

01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:54.620
on a bare white smear

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:55.620
and it's a

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.620
ice cavern

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.620
it just goes

01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.620
in just a ways

01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.620
to get out

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:00.620
of the

01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:01.620
the wind and the snow

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.620
sounds like a biopsy

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:03.620
it's kind of like

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.620
a biopsy

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.620
but in the snow

01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.620
it's just

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:09.620
some sort of

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:10.620
ice cavern

01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:11.620
and you guys

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.620
get there

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:15.620
sink of the shelter

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:16.620
from the

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.620
the sleet and hail

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.620
in this cavern

01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:21.620
most warm

01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:22.620
albeit shallow

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:26.620
I spur

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:27.620
Tylenol on

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:28.620
into the

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:29.620
the cavern

01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:30.620
the interior

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:31.620
of this cavern

01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.620
is not

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.620
commodious

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.620
thus will find

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.620
that my four haunches

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620
are most

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.620
snow

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.620
piferous

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:40.620
and other

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:41.620
shit I made up

01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:44.620
would sound like some

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:45.620
cocoa

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.620
it has the marshmallows

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.620
in it the kind that

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.620
float upon the top

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.620
most pleasingly

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:50.620
yeah I'll love some

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.620
thank you

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:52.620
would sound like

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:53.620
toast with cinnamon on it

01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:54.620
yeah

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:55.620
for magic powers

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.620
have I

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:57.620
an amulet

01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:58.620
of shadow

01:38:58.620 --> 01:38:59.620
whirling

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:00.620
I'll just take

01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:01.620
the cinnamon toast

01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:02.620
okay

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.620
who would like

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:05.620
a strawberry

01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:06.620
pop tart

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:07.620
ooh

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.620
can I

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:09.620
can I trade my

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.620
cinnamon toast

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:11.620
for the strawberry pop

01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.620
toast

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:13.620
I'm so fucking

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:14.620
literally bro

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.620

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620
I don't want the

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:17.620
crust though

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:18.620
because that shit

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:19.620
nasty

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.620
I put butter

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.620
upon the

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.620
cinnamon pop

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:23.620
tart to make it

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:24.620
extra good

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.620
do you have

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.620
pickles

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:27.620
dude

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:28.620

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:29.620
pregnant

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:30.620
I have

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.620
to see if it does

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:32.620
not crunch as most

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:33.620
I try the pickle

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:34.620
game master

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.620
I check in

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.620
emotionally with cocoa

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:39.620
she's kind of distant

01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.620
who wouldn't be

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:43.620
in a shallow ice cave

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:44.620
who's

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:45.620
who's cocoa

01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:46.620
that's a

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.620
Mulraine's horse

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.620
of course yes

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.620
should there be a

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:50.620
voice to cocoa

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.620
I mean there doesn't

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:52.620
need to be

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:53.620
I mean

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.620
she's not there

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:55.620
she doesn't speak right

01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.620
I mean

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:57.620
I've heard

01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.620
I've heard her speak

01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.620
you know

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620
you know

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620
is this cocoa with us

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.620
or no

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:03.620
yeah she's here

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:04.620
she usually is

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:05.620
cocoa

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:06.620
I present a carrot

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:08.620
cocoa baby

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:15.620
much vitamin A

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:16.620
has transferred this

01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:17.620
evening

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:19.620
I feel like

01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.620
I kind of

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:21.620
abandoned you

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:23.620
a while ago

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:24.620
I mean you're a horse

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.620
you're hard to take with

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:26.620
and I know a lot of

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:27.620
stuff has happened to you

01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:28.620
uh-huh

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:33.620
cocoa does seem

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:34.620
emotionally distant

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:37.620
by the blister genitalia

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.620
of Miley Cyrus

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:39.620
this dog bogged down

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.620
speaketh not to

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.620
thine horse

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.620
for I am a unicorn

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:47.620
and more than horse

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:48.620
am I

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.620
for horn do I have

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:50.620
in my head

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:51.620
oh don't be jealous

01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:52.620
that's not a competition

01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:53.620
just because

01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.620
you're kind of horsey

01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:56.620
settle thine shit down

01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:57.620
oh sprog

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.620
I examine the cavern

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.620
it's very shallow

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.620
it's pretty nondescript

01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:04.620
other than like

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:05.620
what looks like a small

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.620
burnt out

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:07.620
a throw rug have I bought

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.620
from bed, bathroom

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.620
and beyond

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.620
so Tylenol

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:13.620
you just

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.620
you live here

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:16.620
I don't live

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:17.620
I crib

01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.620
and then other times

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.620
I you know

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:22.620
I crib with other people

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:24.620
I get around town

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:25.620
do you know

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.620
the neighborhood well

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:27.620
like where are we

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:28.620
do I fuck

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.620
Jesus

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:32.620
home style is this to me

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:33.620
although the winner

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.620
is most foul and pestilent

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.620
much snow

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:38.620
and abrasive

01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:40.620
ice crystals

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:41.620
formeth about us

01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:42.620
I make a terrible pun

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.620
and I go

01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:44.620
I mean I've heard the phrase

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:45.620
man cave but

01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:46.620
and everyone looks at me

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:47.620
horribly and then

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:48.620
I retreat back into

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:49.620
my cup of cocoa

01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:52.620
now has nothing

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:53.620
to be ashamed of

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.620
lead us out of here

01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:56.620
I will

01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:57.620
onto the furtive plain

01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:58.620
and then onto the fruitful area

01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:59.620
where the purple caverns

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:00.620
do beckon us

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:02.620
full of riches

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.620
and stew

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620
made of rabbits

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.620
and other things

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.620
that thou likeest

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:08.620
Tylenol or coding

01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:09.620
what have you been up to

01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:10.620
I'm high

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.620
a good deal of the time

01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:14.620
we haven't seen you

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:15.620
in a long time

01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:16.620
and now you're very

01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:17.620
set on this goal

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.620
just tell us

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:20.620
about your travels

01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:21.620
oh many travels have I

01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:22.620
Omaha

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:23.620
Omaha of Nebraska

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:24.620
have I been to

01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:25.620
and found that the white people

01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:26.620
were fat most

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:29.620
fanny packs and crocs

01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:30.620
did they wear

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:31.620
in public

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.620
and no sport coat upon thee

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:34.620
and then other times

01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:35.620
have I gone to Missouri

01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:36.620
and found that the people

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:37.620
ate pork rinds

01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:38.620
unashamedly

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:39.620
and listened to country music

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.620
as if it was for everyone

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.620

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:14.620

with video rolling

01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:32.620
so you depart

01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:33.620
you head towards

01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.620

01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:38.620
tundra wasteland

01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:39.620
so the journey

01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.620
takes several weeks

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.620
the range

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.620
where the purple caverns

01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:48.620
are said to be found

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.620
weeks have gone by

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:50.620

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:54.620
peanuts

01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:55.620
and other games

01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:56.620
like cribbage

01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:58.620
an old maid

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:02.620
a priest has asked me

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:04.620
to sit upon his lap

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:05.620

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.620

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620
refused him twice

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.620
upon trips to the toilet

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:13.620
Tylenol

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.620
we're here at the purple canyons

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:18.620
and the purple canyons

01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.620
doth yawn before they

01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:24.620
that doth beam above thee

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:25.620
do the treasures

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:26.620
just lay there for us

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.620
to pick them

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:28.620
like fruit hanging from a tree

01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:29.620

01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:29.620
with thine

01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:30.620
jaundiced eye

01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.620
Jesus Christ

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.620
stare forward into the

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:34.620
abyss

01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:38.620
I'm looking at

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:39.620
a canyon

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:40.620
does no one have

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:41.620

I let a torch

01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.620
you light a torch

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:47.620
and you can see

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:48.620
inside the opening

01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.620
of this purple cavern

01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:50.620
there's

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:51.620
three or four

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:52.620
I'd say

01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.620
four gemstones

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:54.620
of various colors

01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:55.620
just kind of

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.620
seated upon the floor

01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:58.620
I ride towards

01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:59.620
the biggest one

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:01.620

01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:08.620
for these gemstones

01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:09.620
are valuable most

01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:10.620
in a way

01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:11.620
thou canst understand

01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:12.620
well then

01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:13.620
why would you

01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:14.620
want us to have them

01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:15.620
if we can't

01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:16.620

01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:18.620
thine man

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.620

at this moment

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:21.620

01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:23.620

of understanding

01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:26.620
crew

01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:27.620

01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:30.620
or whatever

01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:31.620
this is like taking

01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:32.620
a van

01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:33.620

01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:37.620
gentlemen

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:38.620
no patience

01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:39.620
nobody knows

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:40.620
what you're talking about man

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:42.620
what the fuck

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:43.620
what is knots very far

01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.620
but what is

01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.620
the R word

01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:46.620
you said

01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:48.620
is that a new

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:49.620
form of orc

01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:51.620
yeah

01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:53.620
wait, how is that

01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:58.620
I'm high-roading

01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:01.620
yeah, we're high-roading

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:03.620
I appraise the gems

01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.620
as you guys

01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:06.620
approach the gems

01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:07.620
they seem to shift

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.620
before your eyes

01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:09.620
and mutate

01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:10.620
and they

01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:11.620
get bigger and grow

01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.620
into strange

01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:13.620
grotesque

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:14.620
insectoid forms

01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:15.620
fuck, great

01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:16.620
tylenall you son of a bitch

01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:18.620
hey

01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:19.620
this is a treasure

01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.620
fuck is doused

01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:21.620
does that make sense to you

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:24.620
for a moment

01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:25.620
I lend

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.620
Chris de Burgh's ear

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:27.620
what is

01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:28.620
what is going on

01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:30.620
what are we

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:31.620
or what are we

01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:32.620
I'm over here

01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:33.620
I'm over here

01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:34.620
I don't know

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:35.620
I feel like it's our fault

01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:36.620
for following this guy

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.620
by the way

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:40.620
that cocoa was just

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:41.620
a bunch of mud and water

01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:43.620
that's what Swiss missed

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:45.620
I was being polite

01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:46.620
cocoa

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:47.620
this guy got us out of

01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:48.620
a yeti net

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:49.620
alright

01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:50.620
he got us out of a yeti net

01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:51.620
hooray

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.620
we didn't try other means

01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:54.620
we couldn't get out of it

01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:55.620
hey, I have a great plan

01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:57.620
we burned down the purple cavern

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.620
jack and apes

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.620
I go to our coco

01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:05.620
I say cocoa

01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.620
I don't know if you've noticed

01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:07.620
but these treasures you're talking about

01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:08.620
these gems

01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:09.620
that you were so smug

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:10.620
about a moment ago

01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:11.620
not cocoa

01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.620
I'm sorry

01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:13.620
you're allowed to talk to her

01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:14.620
I'm sorry

01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:15.620
I meant tylenall

01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:16.620
tylenall's coding

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:17.620
tylenall's coding

01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:18.620
jack

01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:20.620
these gems turned into

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.620
giant insectoid creatures

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:23.620
this is the treasure

01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:24.620
you told us about

01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:25.620
thou hast not seen

01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:26.620
the intrinsic value

01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:28.620
hair in

01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:30.620
show me the value

01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:31.620
of this

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:32.620
I have

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.620
of

01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:35.620
hair

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:36.620
so high

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:37.620
what are the bugs doing

01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:38.620
yeah

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:39.620
what do they do spend

01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:40.620
they're slowly menacing

01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:41.620
towards you

01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:43.620
clacking their dangerous limbs

01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:45.620
menacing is a verb

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:46.620
it is now

01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:47.620
well, yeah

01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:48.620
yeah, menacing's a verb

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:49.620
what happened to my magic powers

01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:50.620
they're

01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:51.620
they're eviling towards us

01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:56.620
menacing actually is a verb

01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:57.620
well, it's a gerund

01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:58.620
they're a menacing base

01:49:58.620 --> 01:49:59.620
you can menace someone

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:00.620
I mean, I'm not saying I did it right

01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:01.620
but it's definitely

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:02.620
what happened to my magical powers

01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:03.620
I brought them for jewels

01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:04.620
and all of a sudden

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:05.620
there's menacing

01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:06.620
yeah, yeah

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:07.620
tylenall's

01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:08.620
they're not evil

01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:09.620
they're not

01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:10.620
alright, everybody

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:11.620
chill-a-fed takers

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.620
why don't you do an evil

01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:15.620
the way you read their heart

01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:16.620
and see if there's any good

01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:17.620
or evil in their heart

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:18.620
detect evil on them

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:19.620
excellent idea

01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:22.620
I shall take the under advisement

01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:24.620
try to thwart what you like

01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:25.620
click click click

01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:26.620
clock clock clock clock

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:27.620
they don't seem evil

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:28.620
they just seem kind of like empty

01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:30.620
like robots or dolls

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:31.620
or something

01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:32.620
hmm, disappointing this

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.620
like a 70s TV show

01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:37.620
what are you talking about?

01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:38.620
much value

01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:39.620
thought I had these insect droids

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:42.620
let's talk more rock, motherfucker

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:45.620
I use my amulet of spring

01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:46.620
arnulet?

01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:47.620
can't

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:48.620
yeah, it's an amulet

01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:50.620
he really got him

01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:52.620
can shoot thorny vines

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:55.620
20 feet to protect or ensnare enemies

01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:57.620
I choose not to protect them

01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:58.620
I would like to ensnare them

01:50:58.620 --> 01:50:59.620
ensnare them

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:01.620
they're not evil

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.620
they're not evil

01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:05.620
you found that out?

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:06.620
yeah, he said they're not evil

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:08.620
sorry, I'm drunk

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.620
they don't have evil hearts

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:11.620
like, you know, ovens aren't evil

01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:12.620
but if you stick your head in it

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:13.620
it'll tell you

01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:14.620
a bobcat isn't evil

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.620
but it'll eat your children

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:17.620
on a camping trip

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.620
the dingos that took that lady's baby

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.620
he's like

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:21.620
they weren't snagly whiplash

01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:23.620
they were like, I want to eat a baby

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:24.620
I'm a dingo

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:25.620
you're right

01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:26.620
let's set them on fire

01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:27.620
ruined your life

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.620
many mundane points do you mortals make

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:32.620
I sense motive on these

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.620
insect-wise gen-

01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:35.620
it has no motive

01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:36.620
they're just evil

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.620
I'm about to fucking take a sword to these fuckers

01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:40.620
and see if there's any gold inside them

01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:42.620
you can't, you can't detect any motives

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:43.620
I take my sword and I cut you

01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:45.620
fucking just smash one in the face

01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.620
oh, Jesus

01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:49.620
you smash one in the face

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:51.620
it's

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:53.620
dealing

01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:54.620
19 damage, it shatters

01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.620
it shatters into crystals

01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:03.620
can I just keep smashing or am I gonna roll over here

01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:05.620
alright

01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.620
you have a boner, don't you?

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:08.620
nope

01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:09.620
keep talking, I'm gonna

01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:12.620
you slash into the rest of these guys

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.620
but they're not having it

01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.620
no, it's bouncing off

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:18.620
what do these crystals look like?

01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:19.620
they look like crabs

01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.620
one of them looks like a red crab made of ruby

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:24.620
ah, much crab meat, have we discovered most expensive is

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:26.620
Tylenol, take five, mother fucker

01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.620
the disappointment anticipated I did not

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.620
I wanna do my armulate ensnared move

01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:36.620
now that the fighting has started

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.620
well, I already rolled that

01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:39.620
so the other two are ensnared

01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:40.620
oh, nice

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:41.620
their legs are all

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:43.620
I look back for my ensnaring and I'm like

01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:45.620
I look over at Mulraine and I'm like

01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.620
eh?

01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.620
and I'm like

01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:49.620
eh

01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:50.620
eh

01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.620
I have a magic circle that I can do against evil

01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:56.620
not evil

01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:00.620
who was that?

01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:05.620
much Asperger since I

01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:08.620
there's a lot of it here

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.620
alright, then I have some rope

01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:12.620
yeah

01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:14.620
I'd like to do some tricks now to distract everyone

01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:16.620
from how shit the plot has become

01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.620
hahahaha

01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:21.620
this one's called the triple helix

01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:23.620
it's really impressive

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.620
you don't even have thumbs or anything

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:26.620
nope

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:28.620
perf sin yet not I do when

01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:35.620
is there any value in these ruby crystals

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:36.620
are these worth anything?

01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:38.620
yeah, because I won't say if you had said

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:39.620
let's go six weeks

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.620
I'll show you some rope tricks

01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:43.620
none of us would have come

01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:46.620
imagine my disappointment

01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:48.620
we were in a Yeti net

01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:49.620
alright

01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:51.620
this guy's Giuliani

01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:53.620
take what you get

01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.620
we don't give him six weeks of our lives

01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:57.620
for getting us out of a fucking

01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:59.620
it wasn't six weeks, it was several weeks

01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:02.620
I lie on the ground and I open my clothes

01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:04.620
so the jewels will crawl in

01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:06.620
wait, what?

01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.620
it was not the first time

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:11.620
they're all entangled

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:13.620
so they can't move good

01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:15.620
or well

01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:17.620
I safely button up my dress and I stand up

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:19.620
and I just back up

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.620
so what about the one that I shattered?

01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:24.620
it's all shattered, I mean

01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:26.620
can I get the red one?

01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.620
can I go with the red ruby?

01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:30.620
I'm trying to find out what's happening

01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.620
yeah, okay so you pick up a lot of

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:35.620
sapphire shards

01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:37.620
I get a bunch, I get the red one

01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:38.620
that's really cool

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:40.620
that one's not dead yet, I mean that's still

01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:41.620
in a thing

01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.620
are there any red shattered ones?

01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.620
no, there's a red intact crab

01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:47.620
hmm

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:49.620
red's my favorite color

01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:51.620
so I think we

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:53.620
I think we killed that

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:56.620
we need a cliffhanger, someone to make something happen

01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.620
I take a shit

01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:03.620
quark

01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:05.620
I mean, Sharpie

01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.620
Sharpie, this is neither the time nor the place

01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:10.620
did you, it's sandwich sized

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:12.620
where did you get a sandwich?

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.620
I just ate one

01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:18.620
we did it

01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:20.620
