guys about the\n\n01:10.620 --> 01:13.540\ncommunity thing last week.\n\n01:13.540 --> 01:16.620\nIf you were here, I was sitting on that.\n\n01:16.620 --> 01:19.620\nThat was a sharp secret to sit on.\n\n01:19.620 --> 01:24.620\nI'm not known for my secretiveness, secrecy.\n\n01:24.620 --> 01:26.620\nDo you think if you had secretions?\n\n01:26.620 --> 01:27.620\nSecretions.\n\n01:27.620 --> 01:30.620\nI am known for various secretions.\n\n01:30.620 --> 01:32.620\nYou're primarily known for your secretions.\n\n01:32.620 --> 01:33.620\nYes.\n\n01:33.620 --> 01:35.620\nDo you think that you said something last week that you\n\n01:35.620 --> 01:37.620\ncould have queered the deal in some way?\n\n01:37.620 --> 01:40.620\nRaisist.\n\n01:40.620 --> 01:44.620\nNo, I just would have gotten yelled at by people whose job\n\n01:44.620 --> 01:47.620\nis to do an unqueered deal.\n\n01:47.620 --> 01:51.620\nMy agent, publicist, you know, people, I would have made\n\n01:51.620 --> 01:54.620\ntheir job harder by announcing, you know, there's\n\n01:54.620 --> 01:57.620\nactors' deals closing, writers' deals closing, my deal\n\n01:57.620 --> 01:59.620\nclosing, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:59.620 --> 02:01.620\nI don't really know how the stuff works.\n\n02:01.620 --> 02:04.620\nI just know that I get yelled at when I say too much,\n\n02:04.620 --> 02:05.620\ntoo soon.\n\n02:05.620 --> 02:06.620\nSo what is the deal now?\n\n02:06.620 --> 02:08.620\nWhat do we now have to say?\n\n02:08.620 --> 02:13.620\n13 episodes on the inimitable Yahoo Network.\n\n02:13.620 --> 02:23.620\nThe home of great television.\n\n02:23.620 --> 02:24.620\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n02:24.620 --> 02:29.620\nNot, Jeff, not since the Lycos, I Love Lucy merger,\n\n02:29.620 --> 02:34.620\nhas a search engine and a television show,\n\n02:34.620 --> 02:38.620\nbut so aptly paired.\n\n02:38.620 --> 02:42.620\nWhat's your favorite Yahoo TV show?\n\n02:42.620 --> 02:48.620\nI talked to the chief marketing officer, the CMO,\n\n02:48.620 --> 02:52.620\nI didn't even know that was a thing, on the phone.\n\n02:52.620 --> 02:54.620\nIs he Native American?\n\n02:54.620 --> 02:59.620\nShe is a very powerful woman, Jeff, who can crush us\n\n02:59.620 --> 03:03.620\nwith a phone call or a text message.\n\n03:03.620 --> 03:07.620\nBut why would they be Native American?\n\n03:07.620 --> 03:09.620\nYour question just started.\n\n03:09.620 --> 03:11.620\nHer name is chief marketing officer.\n\n03:11.620 --> 03:13.620\nOh, Jesus Christ.\n\n03:13.620 --> 03:15.620\nOh, boy.\n\n03:15.620 --> 03:17.620\nOh, boy.\n\n03:17.620 --> 03:21.620\nDan, there was much power in your TV show.\n\n03:21.620 --> 03:27.620\nThere was great magic in the op-ed character.\n\n03:27.620 --> 03:32.620\nMy viewership soars like a, like the spirit,\n\n03:32.620 --> 03:35.620\nlike the baby eagle leaving its nest.\n\n03:35.620 --> 03:36.620\nWhy is this okay?\n\n03:36.620 --> 03:40.620\nIs it just because they're vanishing?\n\n03:40.620 --> 03:45.620\nThey're just, they have no chance of mounting a...\n\n03:45.620 --> 03:48.620\nI think I'm empowering Native Americans by exalting them\n\n03:48.620 --> 03:50.620\nto chief marketing executive.\n\n03:50.620 --> 03:54.620\nNo, I think it's fine, but I also, I mean,\n\n03:54.620 --> 03:56.620\ncompared to other things that aren't fine,\n\n03:56.620 --> 03:58.620\nI'm just wondering, like, these poor...\n\n03:58.620 --> 04:01.620\nI miss you old Dan who didn't care about any of that shit, man.\n\n04:01.620 --> 04:03.620\nOh, God, are you kidding me?\n\n04:03.620 --> 04:05.620\nBut I wouldn't survive this world.\n\n04:05.620 --> 04:07.620\nThe world has changed under our feet, bro.\n\n04:07.620 --> 04:09.620\nThe world has changed you, man.\n\n04:09.620 --> 04:12.620\nYou know, I mean, I've become super hyper-conscious of,\n\n04:12.620 --> 04:14.620\nyou know, I look back, like eight years ago,\n\n04:14.620 --> 04:16.620\nI would just liberally, like, I don't know,\n\n04:16.620 --> 04:18.620\nI would just, I was just, oh, man, I would,\n\n04:18.620 --> 04:21.620\nI called my brother a fag on Twitter\n\n04:21.620 --> 04:26.620\nbecause he said he loved his daughter.\n\n04:26.620 --> 04:30.620\nThat was, that was the beginning of my realization\n\n04:30.620 --> 04:33.620\nthat the world had changed because my brother tweeted,\n\n04:33.620 --> 04:35.620\nI love my daughter so much, I was like,\n\n04:35.620 --> 04:37.620\nI just replied fag.\n\n04:37.620 --> 04:41.620\nAnd then, like, real responses from people going,\n\n04:41.620 --> 04:45.620\nlike, that's incredibly rude and tacky and hurtful\n\n04:45.620 --> 04:48.620\nand a word that's been used to hurt people on playgrounds.\n\n04:48.620 --> 04:50.620\nYou, of all people, should know about bullying\n\n04:50.620 --> 04:54.620\nand I was, I was catastrophed.\n\n04:54.620 --> 04:56.620\nWell, we're gonna bring somebody up in a minute\n\n04:56.620 --> 04:59.620\nthat knows bigger words and how to use them.\n\n04:59.620 --> 05:01.620\nSo I'm not gonna enter his territory.\n\n05:01.620 --> 05:02.620\nBut I was...\n\n05:02.620 --> 05:04.620\nAre you saying catastrophed is not an actual word?\n\n05:04.620 --> 05:05.620\nI don't know, is it?\n\n05:05.620 --> 05:06.620\nWe'll find out when he comes up.\n\n05:06.620 --> 05:08.620\nI was mortified, let's say that.\n\n05:08.620 --> 05:09.620\nI was, I was, I didn't really,\n\n05:09.620 --> 05:11.620\nI wasn't really looking at myself through that camera\n\n05:11.620 --> 05:14.620\nso I do think I got healthier by some of this.\n\n05:14.620 --> 05:16.620\nI also think that, you know,\n\n05:16.620 --> 05:20.620\nthe millennial outrage movement is, you know,\n\n05:20.620 --> 05:24.620\na neo-fascist one and that it's incredibly dangerous\n\n05:24.620 --> 05:26.620\nto put so much value on words\n\n05:26.620 --> 05:28.620\nbecause some of the worst people in the world\n\n05:28.620 --> 05:29.620\nput value on language.\n\n05:29.620 --> 05:31.620\nSome of the worst people in the world\n\n05:31.620 --> 05:33.620\nare, pride themselves in their diplomacy\n\n05:33.620 --> 05:36.620\nand use language to get away with horrible behavior.\n\n05:36.620 --> 05:41.620\nSo it's dangerous to focus so much energy\n\n05:41.620 --> 05:44.620\non cleansing the world of bad words\n\n05:44.620 --> 05:46.620\nbecause you're gonna be in the same camp\n\n05:46.620 --> 05:48.620\nas Snickers and the Pentagon.\n\n05:50.620 --> 05:51.620\nWhat did you just say?\n\n05:54.620 --> 05:55.620\nCatastrophied?\n\n05:55.620 --> 05:56.620\nNo.\n\n05:57.620 --> 05:59.620\nOh, Snickers and the Pentagon.\n\n05:59.620 --> 06:00.620\nYeah.\n\n06:02.620 --> 06:04.620\nOh, Jesus.\n\n06:06.620 --> 06:10.620\nJeff's racism unfurls like a mighty teepee flag.\n\n06:14.620 --> 06:17.620\nMuch hatred expressed in your language.\n\n06:20.620 --> 06:21.620\nKeep going, baby.\n\n06:21.620 --> 06:24.620\nI just, I love doing that accent, that voice is like,\n\n06:24.620 --> 06:26.620\nI think it's like the same actor,\n\n06:26.620 --> 06:28.620\nlike that we're all doing when we do a Native American guy.\n\n06:28.620 --> 06:31.620\nIt's like, isn't it like a specific actor\n\n06:31.620 --> 06:33.620\nthat talks like this?\n\n06:33.620 --> 06:34.620\nNo?\n\n06:34.620 --> 06:36.620\nWe got our guest out, he might know.\n\n06:36.620 --> 06:37.620\nYeah.\n\n06:37.620 --> 06:38.620\nIt's Bert Lancaster.\n\n06:38.620 --> 06:39.620\nOkay.\n\n06:41.620 --> 06:43.620\nShit, shit, one more thing before we start\n\n06:43.620 --> 06:45.620\nthe celebrity train rolling.\n\n06:46.620 --> 06:48.620\nFuck, fuck, god damn it.\n\n06:48.620 --> 06:51.620\nIt was right on the tip of my dumb 41-year-old\n\n06:51.620 --> 06:52.620\nSwiss cheese brain.\n\n06:52.620 --> 06:53.620\nNo, no, I'm not.\n\n06:53.620 --> 06:55.620\nOh, yeah, I have some drunk voicemails\n\n06:55.620 --> 06:58.620\nfrom the head of Yahoo.\n\n06:58.620 --> 07:00.620\nIt seems like a good idea.\n\n07:01.620 --> 07:03.620\nJust to seal the deal.\n\n07:05.620 --> 07:06.620\nGod damn it.\n\n07:06.620 --> 07:07.620\nShit, shit, I totally forgot.\n\n07:07.620 --> 07:09.620\nOh, oh, I was on the plane.\n\n07:10.620 --> 07:12.620\nDino pointed this out.\n\n07:13.620 --> 07:15.620\nHe was quoting someone.\n\n07:15.620 --> 07:17.620\nI feel like it was Louis C.K.\n\n07:17.620 --> 07:19.620\nor somebody was talking about this.\n\n07:19.620 --> 07:23.620\nAll of the pilots, when they talk,\n\n07:23.620 --> 07:27.620\nthey're all doing like an impression of Chuck Yeager.\n\n07:27.620 --> 07:29.620\nThey don't even realize they're doing it.\n\n07:29.620 --> 07:32.620\nThey're talking the way they think airplane people\n\n07:32.620 --> 07:34.620\nshould talk right about now.\n\n07:34.620 --> 07:36.620\nLook out your window, there's Topeka.\n\n07:36.620 --> 07:38.620\nWho gives a fuck?\n\n07:38.620 --> 07:41.620\nThose people need to shut the fuck up, man.\n\n07:41.620 --> 07:43.620\nThat's not new comedic territory.\n\n07:43.620 --> 07:45.620\nThe food's bad too and the peanuts are too small.\n\n07:45.620 --> 07:48.620\nBut I'm saying, it seems like every passing year\n\n07:48.620 --> 07:50.620\nthe pilots got more shit to say.\n\n07:50.620 --> 07:52.620\nI'm telling you, I mean, I know you had to go\n\n07:52.620 --> 07:54.620\nto school to do what you do, but you're pressing\n\n07:54.620 --> 07:56.620\nthree buttons and it's a flying tube.\n\n07:56.620 --> 08:00.620\nAnd you just got to shut up.\n\n08:00.620 --> 08:03.620\nYou didn't go into broadcasting.\n\n08:03.620 --> 08:06.620\nIf that's your passion, if you want to talk to people,\n\n08:06.620 --> 08:10.620\nI'm trying to play like Pokemons or something.\n\n08:10.620 --> 08:14.620\nI refreshingly had a pilot who, to give you\n\n08:14.620 --> 08:17.620\na vocal approximation, Yosemite Sam.\n\n08:17.620 --> 08:19.620\nHe sounded like Yosemite Sam.\n\n08:19.620 --> 08:22.620\nAll right, everybody, just buckle on in.\n\n08:22.620 --> 08:24.620\nWe're going to go over to Rocky Mountains now.\n\n08:24.620 --> 08:28.620\nHe sounded like the instructions on Big Thunder Mountain\n\n08:28.620 --> 08:30.620\nat Disneyland.\n\n08:30.620 --> 08:34.620\nKeep your hands and arms inside the plane at all times.\n\n08:34.620 --> 08:37.620\nHere's who wildest ride or no weirdness.\n\n08:37.620 --> 08:40.620\nBut he said, I saw him coming up.\n\n08:40.620 --> 08:43.620\nWe were in the jetway, the airway, the walkway\n\n08:43.620 --> 08:45.620\nwhen you get on the fucker.\n\n08:45.620 --> 08:48.620\nAnd he kept coming through, make a hole,\n\n08:48.620 --> 08:50.620\nmake a hole, I'm coming through.\n\n08:50.620 --> 08:52.620\nAnd he's like, man, I got to get this paperwork right.\n\n08:52.620 --> 08:54.620\nAnd he got on the plane, then came back out\n\n08:54.620 --> 08:55.620\nand came back up the aisle.\n\n08:55.620 --> 08:57.620\nWe're all waiting to get on the plane.\n\n08:57.620 --> 08:59.620\nHe's like, we're not leaving until this paperwork is right.\n\n08:59.620 --> 09:00.620\nWe're not leaving.\n\n09:00.620 --> 09:02.620\nPaperwork is wrong.\n\n09:02.620 --> 09:04.620\nAnd he came back and he got on the plane and said,\n\n09:04.620 --> 09:05.620\nwe're like, this is our pilot.\n\n09:05.620 --> 09:07.620\nHe seems all right.\n\n09:07.620 --> 09:09.620\nThen we get on and he goes, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n09:09.620 --> 09:11.620\nwe're going to go over to Rocky Mountains right now.\n\n09:11.620 --> 09:14.620\nAnd I got some telemetry information.\n\n09:14.620 --> 09:17.620\nThe worst turbulence you've probably ever been through\n\n09:17.620 --> 09:18.620\nin your life.\n\n09:18.620 --> 09:19.620\nSo I'm telling you all right now,\n\n09:19.620 --> 09:23.620\nand I'm not trying to alarm anybody,\n\n09:23.620 --> 09:26.620\nput your seatbelts on as tight as you can put them on\n\n09:26.620 --> 09:29.620\nand keep them on until I tell you to not keep them on\n\n09:29.620 --> 09:32.620\nbecause we're going to go through some bad turbulence.\n\n09:32.620 --> 09:36.620\nAnd then he keeps saying, I'm not trying to alarm you.\n\n09:36.620 --> 09:38.620\nI'm just saying this is no joke.\n\n09:38.620 --> 09:41.620\nThen we went over to the Rockies and it was like,\n\n09:41.620 --> 09:42.620\nif you didn't have your seatbelt on,\n\n09:42.620 --> 09:44.620\nyou would have had a broken neck.\n\n09:44.620 --> 09:47.620\nAnd then he kind of smug and he's like,\n\n09:47.620 --> 09:49.620\nwell, I guess I wasn't fucking with you people.\n\n09:49.620 --> 09:52.620\nWhat's that?\n\n09:52.620 --> 09:56.620\nLooks like someone knows their air travel.\n\n09:56.620 --> 10:00.620\nI'm the rootin' of students.\n\n10:00.620 --> 10:03.620\nThe pilot on my flight from Miami to Dallas,\n\n10:03.620 --> 10:04.620\nI caught a glimpse of him.\n\n10:04.620 --> 10:05.620\nYou know how they do this thing?\n\n10:05.620 --> 10:08.620\nThey put the lunch wagon in front of the thing\n\n10:08.620 --> 10:12.620\nto block the 9-11ers.\n\n10:12.620 --> 10:16.620\nBecause everything changed after 9-11.\n\n10:16.620 --> 10:18.620\nEverything for us changed.\n\n10:18.620 --> 10:19.620\nWe have to take off our shoes.\n\n10:19.620 --> 10:20.620\nWe have to get naked.\n\n10:20.620 --> 10:22.620\nWe have to have rectal exams.\n\n10:22.620 --> 10:24.620\nBut when the pilot has to take a shit,\n\n10:24.620 --> 10:27.620\nthey put the fucking lunch wagon in front of the door.\n\n10:27.620 --> 10:29.620\nIs it a literal lunch wagon?\n\n10:29.620 --> 10:30.620\nWhat's that?\n\n10:30.620 --> 10:31.620\nWhat are the cart?\n\n10:31.620 --> 10:32.620\nThe dessert cart.\n\n10:32.620 --> 10:38.620\nIs the fine line between us and another national tragedy.\n\n10:38.620 --> 10:40.620\nAnd so you always get to see the pilot\n\n10:40.620 --> 10:42.620\ntake those little drops of deuce or whatever.\n\n10:42.620 --> 10:44.620\nAnd that guy came out.\n\n10:44.620 --> 10:47.620\nI didn't even realize I had standards for pilot's wardrobe.\n\n10:47.620 --> 10:48.620\nI really do like them.\n\n10:48.620 --> 10:50.620\nI want them to look like military,\n\n10:50.620 --> 10:53.620\nkind of really put together, tucked in and stuff.\n\n10:53.620 --> 10:54.620\nThis guy came out.\n\n10:54.620 --> 10:58.620\nHe had fucking, like, Oakley sunglasses balanced up\n\n10:58.620 --> 11:02.620\non top of his head, like a Jason Biggs character.\n\n11:02.620 --> 11:05.620\nHe had his shirt all unbuttoned.\n\n11:05.620 --> 11:09.620\nHe looked like Gary Bucey in a Bachelor movie from the 80s.\n\n11:09.620 --> 11:11.620\nLike, it was just, like, the wingman,\n\n11:11.620 --> 11:13.620\nlike, kind of, no pun intended.\n\n11:13.620 --> 11:15.620\nLike, the fratty, like, it was just like,\n\n11:15.620 --> 11:18.620\nJesus Christ, man, put out a fucking outfit\n\n11:18.620 --> 11:20.620\nthat looks like you can fly a plane.\n\n11:20.620 --> 11:22.620\nI'm scared shitless over here.\n\n11:22.620 --> 11:24.620\nOr that those safety videos, when they're on VHS\n\n11:24.620 --> 11:27.620\nand the shit's all wobbly.\n\n11:27.620 --> 11:30.620\nThere's exits over there.\n\n11:30.620 --> 11:33.620\nAnd it's like, you can't get your TV to work.\n\n11:33.620 --> 11:37.620\nAnd you're in charge of my body being 30,000 feet above.\n\n11:37.620 --> 11:41.620\nI know they're not connected, but there's, I'm alarmed.\n\n11:41.620 --> 11:44.620\nAnd I said under my breath, because they were the flight attendants,\n\n11:44.620 --> 11:47.620\nit took two of them to push the CRT TV\n\n11:47.620 --> 11:49.620\nback into the ceiling of the thing\n\n11:49.620 --> 11:53.620\nafter a ridiculous, like, Gremlins era tape played,\n\n11:53.620 --> 11:55.620\nthat I think there were flashes,\n\n11:55.620 --> 11:58.620\nlike, there was shit that had been recorded over it at one point.\n\n11:58.620 --> 12:00.620\nAnd then they accidentally taped over the hole.\n\n12:00.620 --> 12:03.620\nAnd I was like, you'd get that reference if you were my age.\n\n12:03.620 --> 12:08.620\nBut they fucking shoved the TV back in\n\n12:08.620 --> 12:09.620\nand it took two of them, they couldn't get it.\n\n12:09.620 --> 12:11.620\nAnd I unconsciously said,\n\n12:11.620 --> 12:14.620\nthis is not something you should say in an airplane.\n\n12:14.620 --> 12:17.620\nI'm a bad person for saying this,\n\n12:17.620 --> 12:20.620\nbut I just blurted out, we're all gonna die.\n\n12:22.620 --> 12:24.620\nAnd God bless his heart, the flight attendant,\n\n12:24.620 --> 12:26.620\nhe said, don't say that.\n\n12:26.620 --> 12:28.620\nAnd I was like, oh fuck.\n\n12:28.620 --> 12:35.620\nBut then it's like, it's true eventually, but not today.\n\n12:35.620 --> 12:37.620\nHe was a delight.\n\n12:37.620 --> 12:40.620\nI mean, if I was a flight attendant and somebody in first class\n\n12:40.620 --> 12:42.620\nwas like, we're all gonna die, you know,\n\n12:42.620 --> 12:44.620\nand looking like me and sitting next to Dino,\n\n12:44.620 --> 12:46.620\nlike a couple of drunk Sasquatches,\n\n12:46.620 --> 12:49.620\nlike, I'm surprised I kicked off the plane,\n\n12:49.620 --> 12:51.620\nbut he made me happy.\n\n12:51.620 --> 12:53.620\nI felt like, okay, so the TV's shitty,\n\n12:53.620 --> 12:59.620\nbut this guy, maybe he can save us if shit goes bad.\n\n12:59.620 --> 13:01.620\nYou said only that you don't want to fly anymore?\n\n13:01.620 --> 13:02.620\nYou're through flying?\n\n13:02.620 --> 13:04.620\nWell, I just get fucking scared.\n\n13:04.620 --> 13:07.620\nI feel like I'm playing with statistics.\n\n13:07.620 --> 13:09.620\nI know it doesn't make any sense.\n\n13:09.620 --> 13:12.620\nYou're safer than if you go in a car or whatever.\n\n13:12.620 --> 13:14.620\nBut when you're in a car,\n\n13:14.620 --> 13:17.620\nyour life isn't being controlled by people that feel like\n\n13:17.620 --> 13:20.620\nthey might as well be working at a phone store.\n\n13:20.620 --> 13:23.620\nThey're strangers, and they have their rules,\n\n13:23.620 --> 13:25.620\nand it's just like, these are the last people,\n\n13:25.620 --> 13:27.620\nthese are the people you're gonna die with,\n\n13:27.620 --> 13:29.620\nand it just really freaks me out.\n\n13:29.620 --> 13:30.620\nI'm a control freak.\n\n13:30.620 --> 13:32.620\nI don't like doctors, I don't like airplanes.\n\n13:32.620 --> 13:35.620\nAnd I'm not backing down on this position.\n\n13:35.620 --> 13:37.620\nI think they should be outlawed.\n\n13:37.620 --> 13:44.620\nDoctors and airplanes, these people die.\n\n13:44.620 --> 13:48.620\nThe last person you see is a doctor before you die, usually.\n\n13:48.620 --> 13:52.620\nHow come if doctors are so smart, how come they don't live longer?\n\n13:52.620 --> 13:56.620\nWhy is there no study that says doctors live longer on average?\n\n13:56.620 --> 13:58.620\nI'll tell you why, because it's all fucking guesswork.\n\n13:58.620 --> 13:59.620\nIt's all bullshit.\n\n13:59.620 --> 14:00.620\nListen to this.\n\n14:00.620 --> 14:05.620\nHow come they can't take care of that?\n\n14:05.620 --> 14:07.620\nWhat's going on down here?\n\n14:07.620 --> 14:09.620\nFix it.\n\n14:09.620 --> 14:12.620\nHarry Potter, Dumbledore,\n\n14:12.620 --> 14:15.620\nget out your fucking broomstick and get in there and fix it.\n\n14:15.620 --> 14:18.620\nOh, we can't, yeah, you can't, I can't either.\n\n14:18.620 --> 14:23.620\nExcept your dad was rich, it's the only difference.\n\n14:23.620 --> 14:26.620\nCome on, we gotta get it, let's get out our friends.\n\n14:26.620 --> 14:27.620\nYou wanna pick first?\n\n14:27.620 --> 14:31.620\nYeah, well I think we should bring Mr. Greg Poops out first.\n\n14:31.620 --> 14:50.620\nHello, Gregory.\n\n14:50.620 --> 14:53.620\nHi, hello everybody.\n\n14:53.620 --> 14:56.620\nSorry, I didn't take too long, I didn't keep you waiting, did I?\n\n14:56.620 --> 14:59.620\nNo, no, we were having a lovely discussion backstage\n\n14:59.620 --> 15:03.620\nabout how airline travel is the safest way to travel.\n\n15:03.620 --> 15:07.620\nA stagecoach is more vulnerable to turbulence.\n\n15:07.620 --> 15:10.620\nGreg, tell Dan about our flight on Air Macedonia.\n\n15:10.620 --> 15:18.620\nOkay, so we were playing in Kosovo because our career is on fucking fire.\n\n15:18.620 --> 15:27.620\nI think when you play a place known for genocide and mass graves, fucking comedy.\n\n15:27.620 --> 15:30.620\nThey say you play Kosovo on the way up and on the way down.\n\n15:30.620 --> 15:37.620\nIt was great to be back.\n\n15:37.620 --> 15:39.620\nWhat's the origin of that bit?\n\n15:39.620 --> 15:42.620\nOh, golly, I don't know, I've used it for a thousand years.\n\n15:42.620 --> 15:48.620\nSo we get up at pre-dawn and we leave from Skopje and Macedonia where we're staying at the Holiday Inn.\n\n15:48.620 --> 15:53.620\nI had my laundry done there and I can still smell the detergent 11 years later.\n\n15:53.620 --> 15:58.620\nI don't know if pink has a scent, but it did in Macedonia.\n\n15:58.620 --> 16:07.620\nAnd so we pitch this up to the airport and it's bright black out and we have coffee and whatnot.\n\n16:07.620 --> 16:08.620\nPre-dawn.\n\n16:08.620 --> 16:09.620\nPre-dawn.\n\n16:09.620 --> 16:11.620\nAnd like the Radon and Tebi, thank you.\n\n16:11.620 --> 16:17.620\nBy the way, the drives, I don't know if any of you have just taken a ride through Kosovo recently or ever.\n\n16:17.620 --> 16:19.620\nDo you like filth?\n\n16:19.620 --> 16:22.620\nDo I just?\n\n16:22.620 --> 16:28.620\nWe were going through it and we were like, it's bleak and it's sad and it's poverty and it's not Calcutta,\n\n16:28.620 --> 16:31.620\nbut it's very bleak and sad.\n\n16:31.620 --> 16:35.620\nAnd we couldn't quite put a finger on it and someone pointed out, there's a thing that you don't notice yet.\n\n16:35.620 --> 16:37.620\nThere are no birds.\n\n16:37.620 --> 16:41.620\nThere's no wildlife there because there's that many unexploded landmines.\n\n16:41.620 --> 16:43.620\nAnd no dogs at all.\n\n16:43.620 --> 16:46.620\nYou once in a while you'll see a dog, but occasionally in the middle of the night you're, boom,\n\n16:46.620 --> 16:48.620\nand a dog like fly over your head.\n\n16:48.620 --> 16:50.620\nOh, come on.\n\n16:50.620 --> 16:52.620\nThat's not real.\n\n16:52.620 --> 16:54.620\nOh, yeah, now there's so much unexploded ordinance there.\n\n16:54.620 --> 16:56.620\nBut you guys never saw a dog fly over your head.\n\n16:56.620 --> 16:58.620\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\n16:58.620 --> 17:00.620\nEvery morning, right before sausages.\n\n17:00.620 --> 17:02.620\nBoom.\n\n17:02.620 --> 17:04.620\nBoom, and you'd be like, oh, fuck.\n\n17:04.620 --> 17:08.620\nYou know what, would you give me some more banana milk?\n\n17:08.620 --> 17:14.620\nSo we go on to the tarmac and there's no security as such, right?\n\n17:14.620 --> 17:16.620\nYour bags are on the tarmac.\n\n17:16.620 --> 17:20.620\nWe're there doing a USO tour show, so this is well after 9-11.\n\n17:20.620 --> 17:23.620\nWe're performing for the troops in and around Afghanistan and stuff.\n\n17:23.620 --> 17:27.620\nAnd so you're required to point at your bag to identify that that's your bag.\n\n17:27.620 --> 17:29.620\nAnd that's some total of the fucking right.\n\n17:29.620 --> 17:31.620\nLike you point and they go, okay, get on.\n\n17:31.620 --> 17:36.620\nSo the plane is battered, dented, has graffiti on it, misspelled.\n\n17:36.620 --> 17:39.620\nIt says air Macedonian in Macedonian letters, right?\n\n17:39.620 --> 17:41.620\nIn Greek letters, complete.\n\n17:41.620 --> 17:43.620\nThere was peeling duct tape on a part of it.\n\n17:43.620 --> 17:47.620\nAnd Sean Masterson is with us because like, I don't know about this aircraft.\n\n17:47.620 --> 17:49.620\nI'm like, don't worry, it'll be fine.\n\n17:49.620 --> 17:52.620\nWe get in first class and we take stuff.\n\n17:52.620 --> 17:56.620\nAnd there's no, you know how you were saying the lunch wagon, which I love,\n\n17:56.620 --> 17:58.620\nbecause I love the 50s.\n\n17:58.620 --> 18:00.620\nI couldn't think of the word cart.\n\n18:00.620 --> 18:02.620\nMy brain is dying.\n\n18:02.620 --> 18:05.620\nIf it's a lunch wagon, I'm ordering a tuna salad and macaroni and cheese.\n\n18:05.620 --> 18:07.620\nI lost the word cart.\n\n18:07.620 --> 18:09.620\nIt's a senior moment.\n\n18:09.620 --> 18:14.620\nThere's no door on the cockpit. You know how that on like a U.S. air or whatever,\n\n18:14.620 --> 18:18.620\nthey'll have like a sealed door with a bar across it, like, you know,\n\n18:18.620 --> 18:20.620\nFrankenstein's lair or whatever.\n\n18:20.620 --> 18:23.620\nThis was Macedonia, no door at all.\n\n18:23.620 --> 18:27.620\nAs soon as we take off the pilots turn to each other and light up smokes and start talking.\n\n18:27.620 --> 18:31.620\nAnd they never look at the road the whole fucking time, right?\n\n18:31.620 --> 18:34.620\nSmoking, fucking smoking cigarettes.\n\n18:34.620 --> 18:37.620\nFacing 90 degree angles, like not looking out the window.\n\n18:37.620 --> 18:40.620\nOh, no, like this. This is the view you're seeing.\n\n18:40.620 --> 18:42.620\nYou're looking in the cockpit.\n\n18:42.620 --> 18:45.620\nAnd they're talking. Then we get over fucking Amsterdam and you hear beep, beep, beep.\n\n18:45.620 --> 18:51.620\nThe autopilot goes off and they go, fuck, and put out their smokes.\n\n18:51.620 --> 18:53.620\nSean Massison in our group.\n\n18:53.620 --> 18:56.620\nHe's a nervous Nellie friend of ours who's lovely.\n\n18:56.620 --> 18:58.620\nAnd he calls the flight attendant over.\n\n18:58.620 --> 19:00.620\nOh, by the way, the best food in the world.\n\n19:00.620 --> 19:02.620\nWhat was it for breakfast?\n\n19:02.620 --> 19:06.620\nStale bread, Turkish coffee, olives, yogurt, feta cheese and honey.\n\n19:06.620 --> 19:08.620\nYeah, it was awesome. It was really good.\n\n19:08.620 --> 19:09.620\nIt was really awesome.\n\n19:09.620 --> 19:10.620\nAnd the flight attendant comes over.\n\n19:10.620 --> 19:11.620\nWe were starving.\n\n19:11.620 --> 19:16.620\nThe flight attendant comes over and Sean's like, are they supposed to be smoke talking?\n\n19:16.620 --> 19:18.620\nShouldn't they be looking at the road?\n\n19:18.620 --> 19:20.620\nThe road.\n\n19:20.620 --> 19:24.620\nAnd she goes, they like to watch.\n\n19:24.620 --> 19:28.620\nThey like to look at the party happening back in the face of us.\n\n19:28.620 --> 19:31.620\nWhat are you going to see with a plane?\n\n19:31.620 --> 19:33.620\nWhat are you going to steer around a mountain?\n\n19:33.620 --> 19:38.620\nYes. Precisely.\n\n19:38.620 --> 19:41.620\nI mean, I think they know the routes by now.\n\n19:41.620 --> 19:43.620\nThere's no mountains on that route.\n\n19:43.620 --> 19:46.620\nClose the door and put the cigarette out.\n\n19:46.620 --> 19:48.620\nI loved it, man.\n\n19:48.620 --> 19:50.620\nI really wanted to go up there and have a drink with them.\n\n19:50.620 --> 19:52.620\nWhat do you guys drink?\n\n19:52.620 --> 19:54.620\nUso and shit? Let's do the song.\n\n19:54.620 --> 19:58.620\nWhen I was a kid, like late 70s, we've fled to Hawaii as little kids.\n\n19:58.620 --> 20:00.620\nEvery man on the plane wore a suit.\n\n20:00.620 --> 20:02.620\nEvery woman wore a dress and everybody smoked.\n\n20:02.620 --> 20:04.620\nEverybody smoked.\n\n20:04.620 --> 20:07.620\nAs soon as you were up in the air, everybody lit up.\n\n20:07.620 --> 20:10.620\nAnd every armrest had an ashtray in it.\n\n20:10.620 --> 20:14.620\nI remember smoking. You could still smoke at international flights when I was still a smoker.\n\n20:14.620 --> 20:15.620\nThat would become the rule.\n\n20:15.620 --> 20:17.620\nI remember smoking on a plane going to Mexico.\n\n20:17.620 --> 20:20.620\nSuch a weird memory to have.\n\n20:20.620 --> 20:22.620\nAnd there was a smoking section.\n\n20:22.620 --> 20:24.620\nYou could smoke at the back.\n\n20:24.620 --> 20:26.620\nYou're on a tube.\n\n20:26.620 --> 20:30.620\nOur whole attitude about smoking, I remember it changing around me.\n\n20:30.620 --> 20:32.620\nAnd I remember being pissed at my friends.\n\n20:32.620 --> 20:34.620\nThey were asking me to not smoke in their apartments.\n\n20:34.620 --> 20:37.620\nI was entitled to fucking smoke in their apartment.\n\n20:37.620 --> 20:40.620\nMy brain had to shift.\n\n20:40.620 --> 20:43.620\nAgain, the world's changing, man.\n\n20:43.620 --> 20:45.620\nThis cigarette stuff.\n\n20:45.620 --> 20:47.620\nAnd not for the better.\n\n20:47.620 --> 20:52.620\nIf this was the old days, we'd all be doing blow and smoking right here in this room, man.\n\n20:52.620 --> 20:55.620\nIf this was a 70s podcast, and those would have been awesome.\n\n20:55.620 --> 21:01.620\nBecause we'd have had lots of pubic hair, and Elliot Gould would have been the special guest.\n\n21:01.620 --> 21:04.620\nThat was all that, like Dick Cavett and stuff.\n\n21:04.620 --> 21:07.620\nBefore talk shows became profitable.\n\n21:07.620 --> 21:09.620\nBefore they became a way to plug things and stuff.\n\n21:09.620 --> 21:12.620\nIt was just like, okay, the national anthem is going to start in a little bit.\n\n21:12.620 --> 21:17.620\nBut while you fall asleep, here's John Lennon drinking with Truman Capote.\n\n21:17.620 --> 21:19.620\nTalking about how high he is.\n\n21:19.620 --> 21:21.620\nAnd it's just quiet.\n\n21:21.620 --> 21:25.620\nLong pauses and just one shot, one camera.\n\n21:25.620 --> 21:27.620\nThat's what podcasting is now.\n\n21:27.620 --> 21:29.620\nListen to us.\n\n21:29.620 --> 21:33.620\nThat's what I love about podcasting.\n\n21:33.620 --> 21:40.620\nWho could have predicted in this world of increasing bandwidth and shrinking attention spans\n\n21:40.620 --> 21:43.620\nthat there would be an art form where people listen to people babble for two hours.\n\n21:43.620 --> 21:45.620\nI love that you think it's an art form.\n\n21:45.620 --> 21:47.620\nI think that's fantastic.\n\n21:47.620 --> 21:50.620\nI feel elevated.\n\n21:50.620 --> 21:57.620\nI thought I was just a hacky road comic running out the last stretch of my fucking golden years.\n\n21:57.620 --> 22:00.620\nWhat we used to call radio.\n\n22:00.620 --> 22:03.620\nI think a glass of milk is a hard form.\n\n22:03.620 --> 22:05.620\nNo, I think it is an art form.\n\n22:05.620 --> 22:07.620\nAnd I think you're right, because we don't have parameters.\n\n22:07.620 --> 22:10.620\nUntil all the shit hits the fan, but we won't get into that.\n\n22:10.620 --> 22:12.620\nHe went through a phase because you didn't have commercials.\n\n22:12.620 --> 22:14.620\nThen you did. Now you don't again, right?\n\n22:14.620 --> 22:17.620\nI don't know if I do or not. I don't listen to all of my show.\n\n22:17.620 --> 22:21.620\nBecause I find myself repetitive.\n\n22:21.620 --> 22:25.620\nI feel like the drunk that's been cornered at the party,\n\n22:25.620 --> 22:27.620\nthe guy's telling you the same story for the 50th time.\n\n22:27.620 --> 22:29.620\nThat's what I feel like my podcast is.\n\n22:29.620 --> 22:33.620\nI'm really weirdly selective about which ones episodes of this show I listen to.\n\n22:33.620 --> 22:35.620\nThere's ones that I just wanted.\n\n22:35.620 --> 22:39.620\nI was drunk and sloppy and hate myself.\n\n22:39.620 --> 22:43.620\nI don't want to hear about the World Cup anymore.\n\n22:43.620 --> 22:45.620\nI love the World Cup.\n\n22:45.620 --> 22:47.620\nWe have a lot to talk about.\n\n22:47.620 --> 22:49.620\nWell, let's not do it.\n\n22:49.620 --> 22:52.620\nThe Costa Rica game.\n\n22:52.620 --> 22:54.620\nDid anyone see the football-loving chicken?\n\n22:54.620 --> 22:57.620\nThat's Costa Rica's mascot, Doc and San Jose.\n\n22:57.620 --> 23:00.620\nThat was the best part of the entire World Cup.\n\n23:00.620 --> 23:03.620\nBig, I'll warn you, last time a fancy guy in a suit\n\n23:03.620 --> 23:06.620\nshouted us down about talking about sports at the podcast.\n\n23:06.620 --> 23:09.620\nOh, I forgot. We're talking about sports at a comic book store.\n\n23:09.620 --> 23:12.620\nThat's like talking about pussy at a comic book store.\n\n23:12.620 --> 23:14.620\nIt's something that's only been discussed.\n\n23:14.620 --> 23:16.620\nOh, I see. You're sensitive.\n\n23:16.620 --> 23:18.620\nThat's fantastic.\n\n23:18.620 --> 23:20.620\nI want to know when you develop taste.\n\n23:20.620 --> 23:22.620\nWhen did that weird moment occur?\n\n23:22.620 --> 23:24.620\nI was here at the beginning and I watched you,\n\n23:24.620 --> 23:26.620\nand now all of a sudden, wow.\n\n23:26.620 --> 23:28.620\nYeah, okay.\n\n23:28.620 --> 23:33.620\nThe two guys who are the British guys who do the horrible ESPN,\n\n23:33.620 --> 23:36.620\nbecause before I thought Alexi Lawless was just kind of inane,\n\n23:36.620 --> 23:38.620\nbut now I openly hate Alexi Lawless.\n\n23:38.620 --> 23:40.620\nI like Alexi Lawless.\n\n23:40.620 --> 23:42.620\nDo you really? I find him...\n\n23:42.620 --> 23:44.620\nI'm smug, but I don't think I'm smug.\n\n23:44.620 --> 23:46.620\nI think I'm contentious.\n\n23:46.620 --> 23:48.620\nNo, you're imperious.\n\n23:48.620 --> 23:50.620\nI am imperious, but I admit it.\n\n23:50.620 --> 23:52.620\nBut Alexi Lawless gets like,\n\n23:52.620 --> 23:54.620\nthe American team didn't...\n\n23:54.620 --> 23:56.620\nYou're like, fuck you.\n\n23:56.620 --> 23:58.620\nYou were a midfielder and you sucked balls, okay?\n\n23:58.620 --> 24:01.620\nI saw you in the 90, 94.\n\n24:01.620 --> 24:04.620\nI saw all the fucking World Cups you were in, bro-hom.\n\n24:04.620 --> 24:07.620\nAnd this team's better than any American team you were on.\n\n24:07.620 --> 24:09.620\nI will always find it fascinating that you,\n\n24:09.620 --> 24:12.620\nlike an erudite, kind of pedagogue...\n\n24:12.620 --> 24:14.620\nSissy.\n\n24:14.620 --> 24:16.620\nThat you are a huge sports fan.\n\n24:16.620 --> 24:19.620\nThis guy loves baseball more than anybody you've ever met.\n\n24:19.620 --> 24:21.620\nWell, again, baseball...\n\n24:21.620 --> 24:24.620\nDid you guys ever see the movie like Bull Durham or whatnot?\n\n24:24.620 --> 24:26.620\nThat's what baseball is.\n\n24:26.620 --> 24:28.620\nOr Major League 3, Back to the Miners,\n\n24:28.620 --> 24:32.620\nwhich is the best title for a movie in the history of mankind.\n\n24:32.620 --> 24:35.620\nBecause if it's Major League 3, how can it be Back to the Miners?\n\n24:35.620 --> 24:38.620\nYou fucked yourself with the title.\n\n24:38.620 --> 24:41.620\nThat meeting was the worst meeting that ever happened in Hollywood?\n\n24:41.620 --> 24:43.620\nI actually never even thought about that.\n\n24:43.620 --> 24:47.620\nYou can't be an alien for no alien this time.\n\n24:50.620 --> 24:52.620\nWhat do you mean Back to the Miners?\n\n24:52.620 --> 24:54.620\nIt's Major League. The movie's called Major...\n\n24:54.620 --> 24:56.620\nThere's other movies that do that.\n\n24:56.620 --> 24:58.620\nWhat are other titles that did that?\n\n24:58.620 --> 25:01.620\nBad News Bears. It's all good news.\n\n25:03.620 --> 25:05.620\nThis isn't an example of that,\n\n25:05.620 --> 25:08.620\nbut there was the sequel to that Open Water.\n\n25:08.620 --> 25:10.620\nRemember Open Water 2?\n\n25:10.620 --> 25:13.620\nThe unspoken subject. I don't know sharks this time.\n\n25:13.620 --> 25:17.620\nWe got rid of the sharks because water's scary enough.\n\n25:17.620 --> 25:19.620\nYou can drown in it.\n\n25:19.620 --> 25:21.620\nAnd it's wet.\n\n25:21.620 --> 25:23.620\nYou're so uncomfortable.\n\n25:23.620 --> 25:26.620\nIf you tread it for an hour, you'll get tired and then you can die.\n\n25:26.620 --> 25:30.620\nI have a cramp. I ate a tuna sandwich too soon before this happened.\n\n25:30.620 --> 25:33.620\nIt was like watching one of those hands-on-a-heart-body competitions.\n\n25:33.620 --> 25:36.620\nYou're just watching people slowly drown.\n\n25:36.620 --> 25:38.620\nAnyways, why don't we keep the guests free?\n\n25:38.620 --> 25:42.620\nLet's bring out soccer expert Kumeil Nagyari!\n\n25:57.620 --> 26:01.620\nWe got a lot of heat for the soccer talk last week.\n\n26:01.620 --> 26:04.620\nWell, it was pretty, I mean, it was...\n\n26:04.620 --> 26:07.620\nAfter a point, we had covered it.\n\n26:07.620 --> 26:09.620\nIt was just you asking over and over again,\n\n26:09.620 --> 26:11.620\nwhy can't there be a countdown, like a clock?\n\n26:11.620 --> 26:13.620\nWhy can't they pause the clock?\n\n26:13.620 --> 26:16.620\nAnd I actually got it after listening to it.\n\n26:16.620 --> 26:19.620\nWell, we got to do it again because now we're talking about the thing\n\n26:19.620 --> 26:21.620\nthat we talked about for way too long.\n\n26:21.620 --> 26:23.620\nBut I just want to say I do get it now.\n\n26:23.620 --> 26:25.620\nI get it because it's like the people fall down.\n\n26:25.620 --> 26:27.620\nI think it's a sport that has...\n\n26:27.620 --> 26:30.620\nits league has more integrity than American sports.\n\n26:30.620 --> 26:32.620\nBecause they're like all...\n\n26:32.620 --> 26:34.620\nThey're all amazing actors.\n\n26:34.620 --> 26:37.620\nIf you do this, they're like, oh, my face fell off!\n\n26:37.620 --> 26:40.620\nPorche! Porche! Mama!\n\n26:40.620 --> 26:42.620\nFoulton Himmel!\n\n26:42.620 --> 26:46.620\nI literally saw one where two guys' calves gently grazed each other\n\n26:46.620 --> 26:50.620\nand they laid on the ground clutching their faces for two minutes.\n\n26:50.620 --> 26:52.620\nWhat they don't know is that...\n\n26:52.620 --> 26:55.620\nI don't think that these guys have figured out the fact\n\n26:55.620 --> 26:58.620\nthat there are nine million cameras in my definition on them.\n\n26:58.620 --> 27:02.620\nAlso, there are 20 cameras at least that have that perfect slow-mo.\n\n27:02.620 --> 27:05.620\nSo when you get hit, there's a guy that kind of...\n\n27:05.620 --> 27:07.620\nA foot came up and grazed the back of a guy's head\n\n27:07.620 --> 27:10.620\nand he crushed his nose, which is clearly bullshit.\n\n27:10.620 --> 27:13.620\nBut when you bite him slow-mo, it's hilarious.\n\n27:13.620 --> 27:16.620\nWell, maybe his brain came and hit the nose.\n\n27:16.620 --> 27:18.620\nI hope.\n\n27:18.620 --> 27:20.620\nI think that that guy who bit...\n\n27:20.620 --> 27:22.620\nMy favorite was the guy who bit the other guy\n\n27:22.620 --> 27:24.620\nand then got kicked out of the World Cup.\n\n27:24.620 --> 27:25.620\nSuarez.\n\n27:25.620 --> 27:27.620\nYeah, Suarez, who's one of the best players in the world, apparently.\n\n27:27.620 --> 27:29.620\nI like bit... I like...\n\n27:30.620 --> 27:32.620\nChewy Lewis.\n\n27:32.620 --> 27:34.620\nOh, Huffington Post, because they played the Italians\n\n27:34.620 --> 27:37.620\nwho are called the Azuri, the blues in Italian.\n\n27:37.620 --> 27:39.620\nThey're called the blues because they always wear blue.\n\n27:39.620 --> 27:42.620\nThe Huffington Post article was Chewy Lewis and the Blues.\n\n27:42.620 --> 27:44.620\nWait.\n\n27:44.620 --> 27:45.620\nLewis Suarez.\n\n27:45.620 --> 27:47.620\nOh, his name is Lewis.\n\n27:47.620 --> 27:49.620\nYou know what? I thought that was dumb.\n\n27:49.620 --> 27:51.620\nAnd now that I know it's for instance Lewis...\n\n27:51.620 --> 27:53.620\nNo, it's a home run. It's a home run.\n\n27:53.620 --> 27:55.620\nIt's a home run.\n\n27:55.620 --> 27:58.620\nThe best newspaper published in the world.\n\n27:58.620 --> 28:00.620\nBut he, when he...\n\n28:00.620 --> 28:02.620\nI thought it was so ballsy when he bit the guy.\n\n28:02.620 --> 28:05.620\nHe laid down being like, I hurt my teeth, too.\n\n28:05.620 --> 28:07.620\nLike, he was like...\n\n28:07.620 --> 28:09.620\nWhat he did, he went in and fucking...\n\n28:09.620 --> 28:12.620\nWell, I have one less bullet in my gun, so...\n\n28:12.620 --> 28:14.620\nI got robbed, in a sense.\n\n28:14.620 --> 28:17.620\nHe jumped in and nose for a rot to Kealini for me at the time.\n\n28:17.620 --> 28:20.620\nAnd he probably did almost hurt his teeth\n\n28:20.620 --> 28:22.620\non an athlete's shoulder.\n\n28:22.620 --> 28:25.620\nLike, you can't just go higher.\n\n28:25.620 --> 28:27.620\nDid you notice that he bit the Italian team?\n\n28:27.620 --> 28:29.620\nNo one bit the Russians.\n\n28:29.620 --> 28:30.620\nYou know what I mean?\n\n28:30.620 --> 28:32.620\nYou bite the Russians, you're like, this is a cabbage.\n\n28:32.620 --> 28:34.620\nYou bite the Italian team, you're like...\n\n28:34.620 --> 28:35.620\nMascarpone.\n\n28:35.620 --> 28:36.620\nOh, my God.\n\n28:36.620 --> 28:38.620\nThis is delicioso.\n\n28:38.620 --> 28:40.620\nIt's filled with butter and...\n\n28:40.620 --> 28:41.620\nMocopane.\n\n28:41.620 --> 28:44.620\nIn Russia, soccer bite you.\n\n28:44.620 --> 28:46.620\nIs this true, Anatoly?\n\n28:46.620 --> 28:48.620\nGrinito with fucking Mascarpone on top.\n\n28:48.620 --> 28:50.620\nSoccer recognized soccer.\n\n28:50.620 --> 28:52.620\nOh, my God.\n\n28:52.620 --> 28:54.620\nGod damn it, we talked about sports again.\n\n28:54.620 --> 28:56.620\nWe're talking about how delicious Italian people taste.\n\n28:56.620 --> 28:57.620\nOkay.\n\n28:57.620 --> 28:58.620\nI will say...\n\n28:58.620 --> 29:01.620\nItalian taste like spirit of eagle.\n\n29:01.620 --> 29:03.620\nIt's Jay Silverheels.\n\n29:03.620 --> 29:04.620\nThat's the actor.\n\n29:04.620 --> 29:05.620\nIs that the actor?\n\n29:05.620 --> 29:06.620\nJay Silverheels.\n\n29:06.620 --> 29:07.620\nHey, that's what I meant.\n\n29:07.620 --> 29:08.620\nWho's the actor?\n\n29:08.620 --> 29:09.620\nJay Silverheels.\n\n29:09.620 --> 29:10.620\nCan you play Tonto?\n\n29:10.620 --> 29:11.620\nHere you go.\n\n29:11.620 --> 29:12.620\nMm, Kimosabe.\n\n29:12.620 --> 29:14.620\nMany miles to next stop.\n\n29:14.620 --> 29:17.620\nGee, Tonto, I wonder...\n\n29:17.620 --> 29:20.620\nMight we run into some hostiles along the way?\n\n29:20.620 --> 29:22.620\nMany hostiles, Kimosabe.\n\n29:22.620 --> 29:26.620\nWas he trying to fuck the Lone Ranger?\n\n29:26.620 --> 29:27.620\nYes.\n\n29:27.620 --> 29:30.620\nLike Batman and Robin, there was an alter universe\n\n29:30.620 --> 29:34.620\nwhere the Lone Ranger and Tonto, I think, were a deep couple.\n\n29:34.620 --> 29:36.620\nAre you saying this character is sort of like\n\n29:36.620 --> 29:37.620\nup who is for my people?\n\n29:37.620 --> 29:39.620\nExcept for my people, the guy is...\n\n29:39.620 --> 29:41.620\nIt's a white guy.\n\n29:41.620 --> 29:44.620\nWe couldn't even get one of our own to sell out our whole race.\n\n29:44.620 --> 29:46.620\nLet me explain something to you.\n\n29:46.620 --> 29:49.620\nWhite people can do a lot of voices.\n\n29:49.620 --> 29:52.620\nIt's what we really excel at, genetically, is racism.\n\n29:52.620 --> 29:57.620\nDo you remember Peter Lawrence as Mr. Motto?\n\n29:57.620 --> 29:58.620\nWe loved him.\n\n29:58.620 --> 29:59.620\nNon-whites.\n\n29:59.620 --> 30:02.620\nWarner Oland as Charlie Chan.\n\n30:02.620 --> 30:04.620\nMickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's.\n\n30:04.620 --> 30:08.620\nOh man, such a beautiful Asian accent.\n\n30:08.620 --> 30:10.620\nHe's like a ballerina.\n\n30:10.620 --> 30:15.620\nIt's just a shame that there were no Asian actors in Hollywood at that time.\n\n30:15.620 --> 30:17.620\nYeah, that's true.\n\n30:17.620 --> 30:20.620\nYeah, that is amazing to watch.\n\n30:20.620 --> 30:23.620\nHow far we've come in a little...\n\n30:23.620 --> 30:26.620\nOkay, we won't talk about soccer, but I won't talk about soccer.\n\n30:26.620 --> 30:28.620\nI'll say about planes and smoking.\n\n30:28.620 --> 30:30.620\nOne of my weirdest memories.\n\n30:30.620 --> 30:33.620\nThis is kind of a weird story, so you have to sort of be okay with that.\n\n30:33.620 --> 30:36.620\nI forget where I was flying, but I was flying somewhere with my family.\n\n30:36.620 --> 30:38.620\nAnd there was a smoking section in the back of the plane.\n\n30:38.620 --> 30:41.620\nAnd while I was on the way to the bathroom, this guy sort of...\n\n30:41.620 --> 30:43.620\nAnd I was like eight, started talking to me.\n\n30:43.620 --> 30:45.620\nIt's just a weird story.\n\n30:45.620 --> 30:47.620\nIs this a flight around Pakistan?\n\n30:47.620 --> 30:49.620\nNo, it's second in the national flight, but I don't remember how long.\n\n30:49.620 --> 30:51.620\nProbably just Singapore, so it's probably about three hours.\n\n30:51.620 --> 30:53.620\nSo this guy befriends me, and he's like,\n\n30:53.620 --> 30:55.620\nhere, come sit next to me.\n\n30:55.620 --> 30:57.620\nThis is already a weird story.\n\n30:57.620 --> 30:59.620\nThat's already the weirdest thing that's ever happened on a plane.\n\n30:59.620 --> 31:01.620\nNo, it's no good.\n\n31:01.620 --> 31:04.620\nHave you been to the launch wagon yet?\n\n31:04.620 --> 31:07.620\nThe launch wagon is blocking the captain's...\n\n31:07.620 --> 31:10.620\nHankas area?\n\n31:10.620 --> 31:14.620\nSo I actually have lunch, or maybe some chapattis.\n\n31:14.620 --> 31:18.620\nThe plural of chapatti is chapatti,\n\n31:18.620 --> 31:21.620\nbut it's impressive that you knew the word.\n\n31:21.620 --> 31:23.620\nPack-a-snap.\n\n31:23.620 --> 31:25.620\nPack-a-snap.\n\n31:25.620 --> 31:27.620\nPack-a-snap.\n\n31:27.620 --> 31:30.620\nYou did not just pack-a-snap me.\n\n31:30.620 --> 31:33.620\nI'm going to bang your fucking deshi back.\n\n31:33.620 --> 31:35.620\nThat just derailed the whole episode.\n\n31:35.620 --> 31:37.620\nPack-a-snap.\n\n31:37.620 --> 31:39.620\nPack-a-snap.\n\n31:39.620 --> 31:41.620\nI feel I'm on soon.\n\n31:41.620 --> 31:43.620\nComing on, I feel I'm on soon.\n\n31:43.620 --> 31:45.620\nComing on.\n\n31:45.620 --> 31:47.620\nSo this guy, I sit next to him, and he's drinking,\n\n31:47.620 --> 31:49.620\nand I didn't know anybody who drank then.\n\n31:49.620 --> 31:51.620\nWait, you were eight?\n\n31:51.620 --> 31:53.620\nYeah, and also nobody drank in Pakistan,\n\n31:53.620 --> 31:55.620\nbut this guy was Pakistani way older than me,\n\n31:55.620 --> 31:57.620\nand he was like, here, try this whiskey.\n\n31:57.620 --> 31:59.620\nOh, no.\n\n31:59.620 --> 32:01.620\nYeah, I'm telling you, it's a weird story.\n\n32:01.620 --> 32:03.620\nHoly shit.\n\n32:03.620 --> 32:05.620\nSo my mom came and was like, what the fuck?\n\n32:05.620 --> 32:07.620\nAnd she grabbed me and went up,\n\n32:07.620 --> 32:09.620\nand then the next time I was going to the bathroom,\n\n32:09.620 --> 32:11.620\nshe's like, hey, just, he was like, hey, sit with me again.\n\n32:11.620 --> 32:13.620\nSit with me.\n\n32:13.620 --> 32:15.620\nI don't know, and I was like, I didn't know how to say no.\n\n32:15.620 --> 32:17.620\nWait, is he crossed the aisle for me?\n\n32:17.620 --> 32:19.620\nNo, he's like in a different section.\n\n32:19.620 --> 32:23.620\nSo I'm like probably like 40 rows in front of him,\n\n32:23.620 --> 32:25.620\nand then there's like curtains,\n\n32:25.620 --> 32:27.620\nand then the smoking section, he's in the smoking section.\n\n32:27.620 --> 32:29.620\nSo I'm going to the bathroom again,\n\n32:29.620 --> 32:31.620\nand he's like, all right, sit with me.\n\n32:31.620 --> 32:33.620\nSo I sat with him again, my mom came and got me,\n\n32:33.620 --> 32:35.620\nand I run very clearly, my mom took me up\n\n32:35.620 --> 32:37.620\nwith me where she was like, hey,\n\n32:37.620 --> 32:40.620\nsometimes people want to do bad things to children,\n\n32:40.620 --> 32:42.620\nand I remember being like, me?\n\n32:42.620 --> 32:46.620\nLike I was like, this predator wanted to prey on me?\n\n32:46.620 --> 32:48.620\nWait, oh, you were flattered?\n\n32:48.620 --> 32:50.620\nI was flattered.\n\n32:50.620 --> 32:53.620\nI was like, little old me?\n\n32:53.620 --> 32:56.620\nI was going to get preyed on?\n\n32:56.620 --> 32:58.620\nI wasn't sure about the shirts.\n\n32:58.620 --> 33:00.620\nI didn't know.\n\n33:00.620 --> 33:04.620\nYou're wrong, mom, I am beautiful.\n\n33:04.620 --> 33:10.620\nI said, you tweeted a picture of yourself\n\n33:10.620 --> 33:12.620\naround that age,\n\n33:12.620 --> 33:15.620\nand you looked so much like Milhouse from The Simpsons.\n\n33:15.620 --> 33:17.620\nIt was adorable.\n\n33:17.620 --> 33:19.620\nThat was when I was like four.\n\n33:19.620 --> 33:21.620\nThat was great.\n\n33:21.620 --> 33:26.620\nFrom like seven to like 18 was a real bag of trash.\n\n33:26.620 --> 33:29.620\nSo this guy, so you needed this validation?\n\n33:29.620 --> 33:32.620\nNo, no, I came at the perfect time.\n\n33:32.620 --> 33:36.620\nI was all confident for a little while after that.\n\n33:36.620 --> 33:39.620\nYou were walking with a swagger through a baggage plane?\n\n33:39.620 --> 33:41.620\nA truck to demand with whiskey?\n\n33:41.620 --> 33:44.620\nYeah, I don't need you little girls like me.\n\n33:44.620 --> 33:47.620\nI have grown men who are into me.\n\n33:47.620 --> 33:53.620\nAaron and I were just watching the Roger Ebert documentary.\n\n33:53.620 --> 33:55.620\nIs it tough to watch?\n\n33:55.620 --> 33:57.620\nBecause I think that guy is amazing.\n\n33:57.620 --> 33:59.620\nIt's really hard to watch because he's a great guy,\n\n33:59.620 --> 34:01.620\nand therefore you should watch it.\n\n34:01.620 --> 34:03.620\nNo, it's not hard.\n\n34:03.620 --> 34:06.620\nIt's inspiring because something terrible is happening\n\n34:06.620 --> 34:08.620\nto a person that doesn't deserve it\n\n34:08.620 --> 34:11.620\nand coping with that and watching him\n\n34:11.620 --> 34:15.620\njust fucking charge headlong into oblivion\n\n34:15.620 --> 34:17.620\nwith a, you know,\n\n34:17.620 --> 34:19.620\nI was going to say with a smile on his face\n\n34:19.620 --> 34:21.620\nand then I ran through all these fucking...\n\n34:21.620 --> 34:23.620\nYeah, I'm sorry.\n\n34:23.620 --> 34:25.620\nThat's how my brain works and what happened.\n\n34:25.620 --> 34:28.620\nThank you for proving that I was right\n\n34:28.620 --> 34:31.620\nto have vapor lock for a second.\n\n34:31.620 --> 34:36.620\nBut it's a good documentary that will...\n\n34:36.620 --> 34:38.620\nYeah, it's a nice...\n\n34:38.620 --> 34:40.620\nWatch it.\n\n34:40.620 --> 34:44.620\nThe relationship between Siskel and Ebert,\n\n34:44.620 --> 34:48.620\nthere's a story that Siskel's wife tells.\n\n34:48.620 --> 34:50.620\nI think those kids really...\n\n34:50.620 --> 34:52.620\nI thought when I was a kid growing up watching these guys,\n\n34:52.620 --> 34:54.620\nI was like, well, they hate each other.\n\n34:54.620 --> 34:56.620\nThat's what's for sale, but it's kind of an act.\n\n34:56.620 --> 34:58.620\nIt's like Ernie and Bert, which is true,\n\n34:58.620 --> 35:00.620\nbut they also really did hate each other.\n\n35:00.620 --> 35:01.620\nThey really did?\n\n35:01.620 --> 35:02.620\nThey really hated each other,\n\n35:02.620 --> 35:04.620\nbut they also loved each other.\n\n35:04.620 --> 35:07.620\nThat part of the documentary is also very touching,\n\n35:07.620 --> 35:09.620\nbut it's way more so,\n\n35:09.620 --> 35:11.620\nlike the more important part of the documentary\n\n35:11.620 --> 35:13.620\nis Ebert's relationship with his wife\n\n35:13.620 --> 35:18.620\nand it's a tear bringer.\n\n35:18.620 --> 35:19.620\nI think it might be...\n\n35:19.620 --> 35:20.620\nNot a joker?\n\n35:20.620 --> 35:22.620\nMuch tears run.\n\n35:22.620 --> 35:24.620\nRight, there's a tear bringer.\n\n35:24.620 --> 35:26.620\nThere's a story in it. Siskel's wife tells.\n\n35:26.620 --> 35:28.620\nHow many tears have you brought?\n\n35:28.620 --> 35:30.620\nEven the airplane theme of the story.\n\n35:30.620 --> 35:34.620\nSiskel and Ebert are on an airplane flying somewhere\n\n35:34.620 --> 35:36.620\nand Siskel is tired of listening to Ebert.\n\n35:36.620 --> 35:38.620\nThis sounds like a good joke.\n\n35:38.620 --> 35:40.620\nTalk of Siskel's life.\n\n35:40.620 --> 35:42.620\nSo he's going to fuck it up.\n\n35:44.620 --> 35:46.620\nEbert's telling the same story.\n\n35:46.620 --> 35:48.620\nSiskel doesn't want to hear it anywhere,\n\n35:48.620 --> 35:52.620\nso Siskel gets a napkin and writes a note on it that says,\n\n35:52.620 --> 35:56.620\nMr. Ebert, we're here in the cockpit.\n\n35:56.620 --> 35:59.620\nWe found out you're on the plane.\n\n35:59.620 --> 36:02.620\nWe admire you much more than that other guy.\n\n36:02.620 --> 36:05.620\nWe really agree with your movie reviews more than his\n\n36:05.620 --> 36:10.620\nand it would be an honor if you would join us in the cockpit.\n\n36:10.620 --> 36:13.620\nWe'll just talk about movies with us for a while.\n\n36:13.620 --> 36:17.620\nSo I gave the note, had the flight attendant hand Ebert the note.\n\n36:17.620 --> 36:20.620\nEbert goes bounding down the aisle.\n\n36:20.620 --> 36:23.620\nHe starts pounding on the cockpit door.\n\n36:23.620 --> 36:25.620\nIt's so funny.\n\n36:25.620 --> 36:29.620\nAnd then everyone's like, what the fuck is this fat guy doing?\n\n36:29.620 --> 36:35.620\nHe's trying to destroy the plane and Siskel calls out from his seat.\n\n36:35.620 --> 36:39.620\nHe just yells out, Mr. Ebert, we're in the cockpit.\n\n36:39.620 --> 36:41.620\nHe yells out the first line of the letter.\n\n36:41.620 --> 36:43.620\nThat's how the story ends.\n\n36:43.620 --> 36:45.620\nThis is an airplane theme.\n\n36:45.620 --> 36:47.620\nThere's a great article that Ebert wrote\n\n36:47.620 --> 36:50.620\nbecause he lost his lower jaw to...\n\n36:50.620 --> 36:52.620\nSo he couldn't eat, so he was on tubes and stuff.\n\n36:52.620 --> 36:56.620\nHe wrote this wonderful article about how he experiences food now,\n\n36:56.620 --> 37:00.620\nhow he looks at pictures of food and recalls wonderful meals he's had\n\n37:00.620 --> 37:02.620\nand he's like, don't feel sorry for me.\n\n37:02.620 --> 37:05.620\nI'm still having that experience and he talks about his best meals\n\n37:05.620 --> 37:07.620\nas a guy who will never taste again.\n\n37:07.620 --> 37:10.620\nIt's really, really fantastic.\n\n37:10.620 --> 37:13.620\nIt's a real tear-breaker. It's really great.\n\n37:13.620 --> 37:17.620\nThe end of his life is one of the most inspiring chapters of it\n\n37:17.620 --> 37:24.620\nbecause he very quickly adopted the blogging lifestyle\n\n37:24.620 --> 37:29.620\nbecause he became like right up to the finish line.\n\n37:29.620 --> 37:32.620\nHe was like one of the coolest bloggers and tweeters\n\n37:32.620 --> 37:34.620\nand kind of amazing.\n\n37:34.620 --> 37:36.620\nNot only can you not fear death,\n\n37:36.620 --> 37:40.620\nbut you can actually get some of your better shit done right before it,\n\n37:40.620 --> 37:43.620\nwhen you're staring at the face, kind of cool,\n\n37:43.620 --> 37:45.620\nbut also really fucked up because why, Harold Ramos,\n\n37:45.620 --> 37:49.620\nwhy Roger Ebert, why do bad things happen to people that we admire?\n\n37:49.620 --> 37:53.620\nSo many thoroughbreds when there's so many we could spare down here.\n\n37:53.620 --> 38:02.620\nLet's bring out a couple's therapy veteran and love of my life, Erin McGathy.\n\n38:02.620 --> 38:10.620\nI've got to try once, I've got to try once, only if I want to, right, son.\n\n38:10.620 --> 38:18.620\nLike it's juicy, juicy, and you'll see I'm gonna have my pride, son.\n\n38:18.620 --> 38:20.620\nThe gang's all back.\n\n38:20.620 --> 38:23.620\nI don't even have to say anything.\n\n38:23.620 --> 38:26.620\nWe've got so many bright, shining superstars up here,\n\n38:26.620 --> 38:35.620\nall of you bringing your own brand of rye stuff to the thing.\n\n38:35.620 --> 38:39.620\nAnd then it should just be silence for two minutes.\n\n38:39.620 --> 38:43.620\nCamille's story about the alcohol reminded me...\n\n38:43.620 --> 38:47.620\nI didn't try alcohol, by the way, so bomb, if you're listening.\n\n38:47.620 --> 38:50.620\nI also did not fuck that man.\n\n38:50.620 --> 38:54.620\nAlthough he did go to the bathroom two times at least on a three-hour flight,\n\n38:54.620 --> 38:58.620\nso whatever.\n\n38:58.620 --> 39:02.620\nYeah, I was hydrating a lot.\n\n39:02.620 --> 39:06.620\nWe would be flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet.\n\n39:06.620 --> 39:10.620\nIsn't it weird that we can poop on planes?\n\n39:10.620 --> 39:15.620\nYou would think that they would throw that out there.\n\n39:15.620 --> 39:17.620\nI've never pooped on a plane.\n\n39:17.620 --> 39:19.620\nYou've never pooped on a plane?\n\n39:19.620 --> 39:21.620\nIt's like the first thing I do.\n\n39:21.620 --> 39:22.620\nFor real?\n\n39:22.620 --> 39:24.620\nYeah, as soon as the...\n\n39:24.620 --> 39:27.620\nI know, I don't...\n\n39:27.620 --> 39:33.620\nI'm literally shitting where you were.\n\n39:33.620 --> 39:35.620\nI don't know what it is.\n\n39:35.620 --> 39:38.620\nWait, for real, you really get on a plane and immediately have to take a shit?\n\n39:38.620 --> 39:39.620\nYeah.\n\n39:39.620 --> 39:42.620\nYou have that weird thing where you eat and food pushes poop out of your body.\n\n39:42.620 --> 39:44.620\nI'm like a play-doh fun factory.\n\n39:44.620 --> 39:47.620\nYours is just a straight line?\n\n39:47.620 --> 39:51.620\nYeah, if I eat a salty cracker, I will poop a salty cracker's worth of poop.\n\n39:51.620 --> 39:54.620\nI know it's not the cracker, but that's the illusion that's created.\n\n39:54.620 --> 40:02.620\nIt feels like I eat and then it turns into poop and like a Polaroid camera comes out.\n\n40:02.620 --> 40:04.620\nIt really...\n\n40:04.620 --> 40:06.620\nIt's as if I'm really proud of it.\n\n40:06.620 --> 40:08.620\nI think it's something that I might...\n\n40:08.620 --> 40:10.620\nLike you're an earthworm?\n\n40:10.620 --> 40:13.620\nYeah, my regularity is like actually...\n\n40:13.620 --> 40:15.620\nStartling.\n\n40:15.620 --> 40:19.620\nIt's in a world where there's lots of things that could go wrong with you.\n\n40:19.620 --> 40:21.620\nYou're comfortable getting...\n\n40:21.620 --> 40:28.620\nAt 6 foot 4, going into a lavatory on a plane is a terrible experience because to get...\n\n40:28.620 --> 40:30.620\nIf I want to go pee on a plane...\n\n40:30.620 --> 40:31.620\nWhat do you guys want to do later?\n\n40:31.620 --> 40:32.620\nOh, I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n40:32.620 --> 40:35.620\nI was telling a story, Greg.\n\n40:35.620 --> 40:37.620\nScoops, do you want a drink?\n\n40:37.620 --> 40:38.620\nSure.\n\n40:38.620 --> 40:40.620\nSorry, I didn't mean to interrupt the podcast.\n\n40:40.620 --> 40:41.620\nCan we talk about...\n\n40:41.620 --> 40:42.620\nHer name is Scoops?\n\n40:42.620 --> 40:43.620\nYeah.\n\n40:43.620 --> 40:46.620\nI have an issue with us because you hear us call each other.\n\n40:46.620 --> 40:47.620\nScoops?\n\n40:47.620 --> 40:49.620\nI mean, I guess I don't have an issue.\n\n40:49.620 --> 40:50.620\nI guess I like it.\n\n40:50.620 --> 40:52.620\nEvery time we call each other a pet name.\n\n40:52.620 --> 40:53.620\nDan, you've noticed this.\n\n40:53.620 --> 40:54.620\nScoops, Scoops.\n\n40:54.620 --> 40:55.620\nJeff goes,\n\n40:55.620 --> 40:56.620\nScoops?\n\n40:56.620 --> 40:57.620\nScoops?\n\n40:57.620 --> 40:58.620\nEvery time you want to have...\n\n40:58.620 --> 40:59.620\nIt's Scoops though, right?\n\n40:59.620 --> 41:04.620\nIt's Scoops or Scoops or Shoeb or Shuber or Tony Shaluber.\n\n41:04.620 --> 41:05.620\nOr Kubrama.\n\n41:05.620 --> 41:07.620\nYeah, that's my thing.\n\n41:07.620 --> 41:08.620\nIt's a moving term.\n\n41:08.620 --> 41:09.620\nSo I always feel like...\n\n41:09.620 --> 41:11.620\nI thought it was Scoops but now it's Scoops.\n\n41:11.620 --> 41:13.620\nDan, which did our pet name be in front of Jeff?\n\n41:13.620 --> 41:15.620\nBarack Kubrama.\n\n41:15.620 --> 41:17.620\nAll right.\n\n41:17.620 --> 41:18.620\nThat's awesome.\n\n41:18.620 --> 41:19.620\nI've always...\n\n41:19.620 --> 41:22.620\nIt always seems to be slightly moving so I can't...\n\n41:22.620 --> 41:24.620\nIt's not just Scoops or Scoops.\n\n41:24.620 --> 41:26.620\nYeah, it's always a long line of...\n\n41:26.620 --> 41:29.620\nWhy don't we all call each other Coops and Pooms?\n\n41:29.620 --> 41:30.620\nReally?\n\n41:30.620 --> 41:31.620\nCall each other Coops?\n\n41:31.620 --> 41:33.620\nNo, he calls me Coops and I call him...\n\n41:33.620 --> 41:34.620\nOh, Coops.\n\n41:34.620 --> 41:35.620\nOh, I see how.\n\n41:35.620 --> 41:36.620\nYeah.\n\n41:36.620 --> 41:37.620\nSo you get derailed.\n\n41:37.620 --> 41:38.620\nYeah, you were telling me that.\n\n41:38.620 --> 41:39.620\nYeah, you always think something about...\n\n41:39.620 --> 41:40.620\nI was actually...\n\n41:40.620 --> 41:42.620\nI felt blessed that I was derailed.\n\n41:42.620 --> 41:46.620\nBecause it's just a story about you taking a shit on a plane.\n\n41:46.620 --> 41:48.620\nNo, I thought...\n\n41:48.620 --> 41:53.620\nWhen Camille was talking about that man offering you whiskey or whatever...\n\n41:53.620 --> 41:54.620\nYeah, thank you.\n\n41:54.620 --> 41:55.620\nIt was...\n\n41:55.620 --> 41:56.620\nJesus juice.\n\n41:56.620 --> 41:57.620\nJesus juice.\n\n41:57.620 --> 41:58.620\nI had a...\n\n41:58.620 --> 42:00.620\nI was thinking about...\n\n42:00.620 --> 42:01.620\nMy mind was...\n\n42:01.620 --> 42:04.620\nI was thinking about plane rides and I grew up in a Navy family.\n\n42:04.620 --> 42:07.620\nSo we lived in Italy for a while and when we lived in Italy,\n\n42:07.620 --> 42:11.620\nthe adults of my life were other chaplains that my dad knew\n\n42:11.620 --> 42:14.620\nbecause my dad was a chaplain, which is like a preacher in the military.\n\n42:14.620 --> 42:15.620\nI didn't know that.\n\n42:15.620 --> 42:16.620\nOh, really?\n\n42:16.620 --> 42:17.620\nWow.\n\n42:17.620 --> 42:18.620\nYeah.\n\n42:18.620 --> 42:21.620\nAnd on any base, there's only one chaplain per faith.\n\n42:21.620 --> 42:25.620\nSo my dad was friends with a rabbi and the others.\n\n42:25.620 --> 42:26.620\nOh, so...\n\n42:26.620 --> 42:28.620\nWhat a coward.\n\n42:28.620 --> 42:29.620\nOh, yeah.\n\n42:29.620 --> 42:35.620\nA rabbi, a priest and the right one walking through...\n\n42:35.620 --> 42:37.620\nAnd I had a...\n\n42:37.620 --> 42:41.620\nSo were all your dad's stories, did this sound like jokes?\n\n42:41.620 --> 42:43.620\nYeah, they're always...\n\n42:43.620 --> 42:48.620\nTwo Jews walk into a temple.\n\n42:48.620 --> 42:55.620\nSo I had a baby sitter who came over twice and would play old maid with me\n\n42:55.620 --> 42:56.620\nand he was another chaplain.\n\n42:56.620 --> 42:59.620\nBut then we were telling the story and I remember...\n\n42:59.620 --> 43:00.620\nAnd I don't...\n\n43:00.620 --> 43:02.620\nI've never thought of this before and never talked about it\n\n43:02.620 --> 43:04.620\nand this does not end in weird touching.\n\n43:04.620 --> 43:07.620\nBut I had a converse... I was like nine years old\n\n43:07.620 --> 43:10.620\nand I was talking to him about my parents' instant coffee\n\n43:10.620 --> 43:11.620\nand I was saying, it's so strange.\n\n43:11.620 --> 43:15.620\nMy parents drink this drink that doesn't taste like other drinks\n\n43:15.620 --> 43:17.620\nand it smells strange and it's really weird.\n\n43:17.620 --> 43:20.620\nAnd he gave me brandy.\n\n43:20.620 --> 43:22.620\nHe was like, do you know what this is?\n\n43:22.620 --> 43:23.620\nWhat this thing is?\n\n43:23.620 --> 43:24.620\nIs this a rabbi?\n\n43:24.620 --> 43:26.620\nThis was actually a priest.\n\n43:26.620 --> 43:28.620\nBut like...\n\n43:28.620 --> 43:32.620\nOh, Erin, I wonder if you'll be looking over here at the joystick.\n\n43:32.620 --> 43:35.620\nBut he...\n\n43:35.620 --> 43:37.620\nThis is called cough syrup.\n\n43:37.620 --> 43:40.620\nIt'll make the journey so gentle.\n\n43:40.620 --> 43:43.620\nMy father and I have never talked about this.\n\n43:43.620 --> 43:45.620\nThis is called a man candy.\n\n43:45.620 --> 43:47.620\nHe was chaplain Nate.\n\n43:47.620 --> 43:49.620\nAnd I knew that like we stopped...\n\n43:49.620 --> 43:51.620\nChaplain Nate was the one who tried to give you brandy.\n\n43:51.620 --> 43:52.620\n...tried to give me brandy.\n\n43:52.620 --> 43:55.620\nHe stopped babysitting for me because I told my dad that chaplain...\n\n43:55.620 --> 43:57.620\nthat I was going to marry chaplain Nate.\n\n43:57.620 --> 44:01.620\nAnd you ended up kind of doing just that.\n\n44:01.620 --> 44:03.620\nAre you a chaplain, Nate?\n\n44:03.620 --> 44:05.620\nYeah, because I'm an alcoholic. It was a joke.\n\n44:05.620 --> 44:07.620\nYeah, I got it.\n\n44:07.620 --> 44:08.620\nSorry.\n\n44:08.620 --> 44:10.620\nThis story is not funny. We're good.\n\n44:10.620 --> 44:12.620\nNo, it's troubling.\n\n44:12.620 --> 44:14.620\nYeah, yeah.\n\n44:14.620 --> 44:16.620\nI tell you, it's funny.\n\n44:16.620 --> 44:18.620\nWhen he came over, we played Old Maid.\n\n44:18.620 --> 44:20.620\nI sat on his...\n\n44:20.620 --> 44:21.620\nCough.\n\n44:23.620 --> 44:25.620\nWow.

Old enough\n\n53:37.620 --> 53:39.620\nto set off a long-held prejudice\n\n53:39.620 --> 53:41.620\nagainst old people.\n\n53:41.620 --> 53:43.620\nToo old for a nine-year-old boy.\n\n53:43.620 --> 53:45.620\nYeah, definitely.\n\n53:45.620 --> 53:47.620\nAll right, what's the next one?\n\n53:47.620 --> 53:49.620\nDo you have a beard? I know.\n\n53:49.620 --> 53:51.620\nYou're trying to picture a nine-year-old Spencer,\n\n53:51.620 --> 53:53.620\nand you can't picture him without a beard.\n\n53:53.620 --> 53:55.620\nI picture Spencer just shorter\n\n53:55.620 --> 53:57.620\nholding a matchbox car.\n\n53:57.620 --> 53:59.620\nI picture him wearing a little rascal's beard,\n\n53:59.620 --> 54:01.620\nlike a fake beard\n\n54:01.620 --> 54:03.620\nthat hooks over the ears.\n\n54:03.620 --> 54:05.620\nBlah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n54:05.620 --> 54:07.620\nblah, blah, blah,\n\n54:07.620 --> 54:09.620\nBlah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n54:09.620 --> 54:11.620\nHe didn't need glasses yet,\n\n54:11.620 --> 54:13.620\nbut he made them out of cardboard.\n\n54:13.620 --> 54:15.620\nGive me more stories.\n\n54:15.620 --> 54:17.620\nThis is not even an appropriate question,\n\n54:17.620 --> 54:19.620\nbut did she\n\n54:19.620 --> 54:21.620\nthink she was attractive?\n\n54:21.620 --> 54:23.620\nNo, I don't think attractive people\n\n54:23.620 --> 54:25.620\ndo stuff like that, right?\n\n54:25.620 --> 54:27.620\nI don't know.\n\n54:27.620 --> 54:29.620\nI think that's bigotry.\n\n54:29.620 --> 54:31.620\nThat's probably very attractive\n\n54:31.620 --> 54:33.620\npedophiles out there.\n\n54:33.620 --> 54:35.620\nYou'd make a great cop, Spencer.\n\n54:37.620 --> 54:39.620\nPull over all the ugly people.\n\n54:39.620 --> 54:43.620\nThey've been diddling someone.\n\n54:43.620 --> 54:45.620\nHe's too hot\n\n54:45.620 --> 54:47.620\nto molest.\n\n54:47.620 --> 54:49.620\nI think you'll find people with money\n\n54:49.620 --> 54:51.620\ndon't commit crimes.\n\n54:51.620 --> 54:53.620\nMove along, nothing to see here.\n\n54:53.620 --> 54:55.620\nAll right, next story, Spencer.\n\n54:55.620 --> 54:57.620\nWe're going down your\n\n54:57.620 --> 54:59.620\n10 molestation brushes\n\n54:59.620 --> 55:01.620\nof the 20th century.\n\n55:01.620 --> 55:03.620\nI don't think I have\n\n55:03.620 --> 55:05.620\nany more molestation stories.\n\n55:05.620 --> 55:07.620\nOh, that's the only one?\n\n55:07.620 --> 55:09.620\nYeah.\n\n55:09.620 --> 55:11.620\nWe shouldn't be disappointed.\n\n55:13.620 --> 55:15.620\nI'm just rooting for the underdog.\n\n55:15.620 --> 55:17.620\nDo you want to go faster?\n\n55:17.620 --> 55:19.620\nThey always\n\n55:19.620 --> 55:21.620\nwant to be just kept going to carnivals\n\n55:21.620 --> 55:23.620\nand having weird interactions with people.\n\n55:23.620 --> 55:25.620\nI worked at a carnival for a weekend.\n\n55:25.620 --> 55:27.620\nIt's terrible.\n\n55:27.620 --> 55:29.620\nWhat did you do?\n\n55:29.620 --> 55:31.620\nThree balls for a dollar.\n\n55:31.620 --> 55:33.620\nYeah, that's the game that I won.\n\n55:33.620 --> 55:35.620\nIt was so confusing in my explanation.\n\n55:35.620 --> 55:37.620\nYou said you were knocking milk\n\n55:37.620 --> 55:39.620\ncans off of a platform.\n\n55:39.620 --> 55:41.620\nOh, you do it.\n\n55:41.620 --> 55:43.620\nAnd the trick is that the hole\n\n55:43.620 --> 55:45.620\nin the top is exactly\n\n55:45.620 --> 55:47.620\nthe size of the ball.\n\n55:47.620 --> 55:49.620\nIt's possible to...\n\n55:49.620 --> 55:51.620\nIf people say, I think this is rigged,\n\n55:51.620 --> 55:53.620\nyou can demonstrate that it's not\n\n55:53.620 --> 55:55.620\nwith a very careful orchestrated\n\n55:55.620 --> 55:57.620\nmotion that I had to be taught to me\n\n55:57.620 --> 55:59.620\nby a carny,\n\n55:59.620 --> 56:01.620\nwhere you shove the ball straight down\n\n56:01.620 --> 56:03.620\nand it'll go right into the thing.\n\n56:03.620 --> 56:05.620\nYou are me and not good at being a carny.\n\n56:05.620 --> 56:07.620\nAnd so it says,\n\n56:07.620 --> 56:09.620\nI think that's rigged and you go to do that.\n\n56:09.620 --> 56:11.620\nIt bounces off of it\n\n56:11.620 --> 56:13.620\nand through the top of the tense\n\n56:13.620 --> 56:15.620\nand everyone rolls into the hole.\n\n56:15.620 --> 56:17.620\nI want to talk to you about the...\n\n56:17.620 --> 56:19.620\nYeah, I mean, no, it's a...\n\n56:19.620 --> 56:21.620\nI don't know, it's not technical.\n\n56:21.620 --> 56:23.620\nBecause if you...\n\n56:23.620 --> 56:25.620\nIf you hit it here by like...\n\n56:27.620 --> 56:29.620\nGo again, go again.\n\n56:29.620 --> 56:34.620\nGo again.\n\n56:34.620 --> 56:36.620\nThat impression makes me so hot.\n\n56:38.620 --> 56:40.620\nIt's like you're...\n\n56:40.620 --> 56:42.620\nIt's horrible.\n\n56:42.620 --> 56:44.620\nThere's more stutter when you play it.\n\n56:44.620 --> 56:46.620\nYou finally get to have sex with yourself, Dan.\n\n56:46.620 --> 56:48.620\nWe finally found a role-play game.\n\n56:50.620 --> 56:52.620\nYou be me and I'll be me.\n\n56:55.620 --> 56:57.620\nKnock my milk bottle off this platform\n\n56:57.620 --> 56:59.620\nwith your balls.\n\n56:59.620 --> 57:01.620\nGet your monkey in my jungle.\n\n57:02.620 --> 57:04.620\nHey, Greg Pips, do you have any advice\n\n57:04.620 --> 57:07.620\nfor young, very young couples\n\n57:07.620 --> 57:09.620\nlike myself and Erin?\n\n57:09.620 --> 57:10.620\nI do.\n\n57:10.620 --> 57:12.620\nThen they're about to get hitched.\n\n57:12.620 --> 57:14.620\nWell, I've been married a long time now\n\n57:14.620 --> 57:16.620\nand I think you'll find, Dan,\n\n57:16.620 --> 57:18.620\nthat you need to understand two things\n\n57:18.620 --> 57:20.620\nabout being a man and a marriage.\n\n57:20.620 --> 57:22.620\nOne, it's almost inevitable that whatever you've done\n\n57:22.620 --> 57:24.620\nis unbelievably erroneous.\n\n57:24.620 --> 57:26.620\nAnd then you have to understand\n\n57:26.620 --> 57:29.620\nthat your deficiencies are legion.\n\n57:29.620 --> 57:31.620\nThere is no point in time\n\n57:31.620 --> 57:33.620\nwhere you're going to go,\n\n57:33.620 --> 57:35.620\nI fucking win.\n\n57:35.620 --> 57:37.620\nNor is it advisable for you\n\n57:37.620 --> 57:39.620\nat any point to decide to win\n\n57:39.620 --> 57:41.620\nan argument and or a scrimmage\n\n57:41.620 --> 57:43.620\nand or a skirmish and or a battle\n\n57:43.620 --> 57:45.620\nand or a war.\n\n57:45.620 --> 57:47.620\nIt's a very long road\n\n57:47.620 --> 57:49.620\nand it's best you'll find,\n\n57:49.620 --> 57:51.620\nI believe, for young couples\n\n57:51.620 --> 57:53.620\nstarting out on this,\n\n57:53.620 --> 57:55.620\nthis giant golden journey\n\n57:55.620 --> 57:57.620\nto the Emerald City.\n\n57:57.620 --> 57:59.620\nMutual respect\n\n57:59.620 --> 58:01.620\nfor everything the other one does.\n\n58:01.620 --> 58:03.620\nIn other words, when they come home and go,\n\n58:03.620 --> 58:05.620\nI had the hardest day today and you go,\n\n58:05.620 --> 58:07.620\nreally, I fucking did this.\n\n58:07.620 --> 58:09.620\nThat's not a big win.\n\n58:09.620 --> 58:11.620\nThat is\n\n58:11.620 --> 58:13.620\na truck that rolls into the\n\n58:13.620 --> 58:15.620\nyou know, the lay by\n\n58:15.620 --> 58:17.620\nand bursts into flames.\n\n58:17.620 --> 58:19.620\nSo I would defer is what I'm saying.\n\n58:19.620 --> 58:21.620\nGreg, do you do this all the time?\n\n58:21.620 --> 58:23.620\nIs that the secret to your happy marriage?\n\n58:23.620 --> 58:25.620\nNo, I haven't learned it after 30 years.\n\n58:25.620 --> 58:27.620\nBut I'm just giving you this tip.\n\n58:27.620 --> 58:29.620\nHow long have you been married?\n\n58:29.620 --> 58:31.620\nA while now.\n\n58:31.620 --> 58:33.620\n1990.\n\n58:33.620 --> 58:35.620\nBut your relationship is an inspiration\n\n58:35.620 --> 58:37.620\nto listeners of your podcast\n\n58:37.620 --> 58:39.620\nbecause you have so much respect for you.\n\n58:39.620 --> 58:41.620\nYou refer to your wife as formidable.\n\n58:41.620 --> 58:43.620\nWell, and she is.\n\n58:43.620 --> 58:45.620\nShe's smarter than me. She's better looking than me.\n\n58:45.620 --> 58:47.620\nAnd she's funnier than me.\n\n58:47.620 --> 58:49.620\nSo I have to keep her\n\n58:49.620 --> 58:51.620\nlocked up in a closet\n\n58:51.620 --> 58:53.620\nalmost all the time.\n\n58:53.620 --> 58:55.620\nHave you guys ever done any counseling or anything?\n\n58:55.620 --> 58:57.620\nOh, fuck no.\n\n58:57.620 --> 58:59.620\nAaron and I are going to marriage camp.\n\n58:59.620 --> 59:01.620\nHave you guys done marriage camp?\n\n59:01.620 --> 59:03.620\nMarriage camp, really?\n\n59:03.620 --> 59:05.620\nI don't know, but I've been told\n\n59:05.620 --> 59:07.620\nyour sister's pussy is mighty cold.\n\n59:09.620 --> 59:11.620\nMarriage camp.\n\n59:11.620 --> 59:13.620\nWow, what's that like?\n\n59:13.620 --> 59:15.620\nWell, it's not an actual camp.\n\n59:15.620 --> 59:17.620\nHarmon, get over the goddamn obstacle.\n\n59:17.620 --> 59:19.620\nGo, go, go, go, go, go!\n\n59:19.620 --> 59:21.620\nPile!\n\n59:21.620 --> 59:23.620\nGreg, will you...\n\n59:23.620 --> 59:25.620\nI might make you a rifleman in my beloved corps.\n\n59:25.620 --> 59:27.620\nGreg, will you be...\n\n59:27.620 --> 59:29.620\nJeff, look what time it is!\n\n59:29.620 --> 59:31.620\nThat was never done.\n\n59:33.620 --> 59:35.620\nPut the lunch wagon\n\n59:35.620 --> 59:37.620\nin front of the cockpit.\n\n59:37.620 --> 59:39.620\nPut the lunch wagon\n\n59:39.620 --> 59:41.620\nin front of the cockpit.\n\n59:41.620 --> 59:43.620\nLunch wagon.\n\n59:43.620 --> 59:45.620\nGreg, we were talking about\n\n59:45.620 --> 59:47.620\nthe major league earlier.\n\n59:47.620 --> 59:49.620\nDana, I want to hear what you're saying about marriage counseling,\n\n59:49.620 --> 59:51.620\nbut I don't know what you're saying.\n\n59:51.620 --> 59:53.620\nWell, here we go.\n\n59:53.620 --> 59:55.620\nDamn it, damn it!\n\n59:55.620 --> 59:57.620\nThese grotesque fucking cartoon shows\n\n59:57.620 --> 59:59.620\nfor the goddamn cartoon network.\n\n59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.620\nYou pay attention to your wife more\n\n01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.620\nand have more fucking harmony at home.\n\n01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.620\nAnd goddamn it, stop it.\n\n01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.620\nI'm about as proud of you\n\n01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.620\nas I've ever been in a couple of her talk to me.\n\n01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.620\nThe manager of the major league, everybody.\n\n01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.620\nWell, here it is.\n\n01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.620\nStop peep-hessing around,\n\n01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.620\ntelling stories about how you fucked your priest\n\n01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.620\nwhen you were five years old and shit.\n\n01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.620\nIt's not the kind of thing a marriage is built on.\n\n01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.620\nI thought the third season of community\n\n01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.620\nwas a little trite.\n\n01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.620\nThat's fighting word.\n\n01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.620\nSeason four, it's open season on.\n\n01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.620\nBecause my dad is a minister\n\n01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.620\nand performs a lot of marriages.\n\n01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.620\nHe requires...\n\n01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.620\nAnd he's not Catholic, but he requires couples\n\n01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.620\nto go through a camp, a quote-unquote camp.\n\n01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.620\nHow long has this been true of him?\n\n01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.620\nSince the beginning.\n\n01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.620\nAnd it's like five sessions.\n\n01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.620\nHave you guys done more than one?\n\n01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.620\nWe...\n\n01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.620\nWell, this isn't at the behest of her dad.\n\n01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.620\nYou're making it sound like we're doing this...\n\n01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.620\nNo, I mean, I always grew up thinking\n\n01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.620\nthat that was...\n\n01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.620\nStandard.\n\n01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.620\nYou talked to my dad.\n\n01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.620\nWe had a couple of breakout sessions.\n\n01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.620\nThat was all.\n\n01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.620\nThank you.\n\n01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.620\nOne person in the whole fucking crowd.\n\n01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.620\nThen we had a small meeting and then a confab.\n\n01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.620\nAnd then a breakfast, then we blue-skied for a while.\n\n01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.620\nThat was all.\n\n01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.620\nThank you.\n\n01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.620\nTwo people in the fucking room, really?\n\n01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.620\nFuck you.\n\n01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.620\nEasy action.\n\n01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.620\nSorry.\n\n01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.620\nEasy action.\n\n01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.620\nI'm having a mediator.\n\n01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.620\nI know Dan

a Chris Rock mic drop\n\n01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.620\nat this convention in Florida,\n\n01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.620\nwhere I did a big mic broke.\n\n01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.620\nBut it was

mic.\n\n01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.620\nAnd that made them love me.\n\n01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.620\nI've never been famous enough\n\n01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.620\nto wear a mic drop, but I do do

man.\n\n01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.620\nI like to think that maybe he was so good at sex\n\n01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.620\nthat it was like going to the hardest difficulty setting\n\n01:10:27.620 -->

01:11:03.620\nWhat do you think, Spencer?\n\n01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.620\nFlies in the face of your profiling?\n\n01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:07.620\nYeah, I'm really turning a new page in my book.\n\n01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.620\nAbout fucking old ladies.\n\n01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.620\nThere was a guy digging up old ladies\n\n01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.620\nand fucking

right to the fucking...\n\n01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.620\nWas it only old ladies\n\n01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.620\nor was it the fact that there were only old ladies\n\n01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.620\ncurrently in the funeral home?\n\n01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.620\nI just know that the three...\n\n01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.620\nIf a young lady died, he'd be like,\n\n01:11:31.620 -->

think...\n\n01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.620\nThat's so awful.\n\n01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.620\nThey were both in their 80s, the women that they...\n\n01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.620\nAnd they obviously didn't say the names of the ladies,\n\n01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.620\nbut the family probably read it like,\n\n01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.620\nWait, that's how old Nana was.\n\n01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.620\nThat's the funeral home we used.\n\n01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.620\nSurvived by two cousins in Saacakis.\n\n01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.620\nHow did he get...\n\n01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.620\nDid someone walk in on him?\n\n01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.620\nYeah, that's my question.\n\n01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.620\nI think...\n\n01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.620\nHow do you get caught when you work\n\n01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.620\nin a funeral parlor and you just\n\n01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.620\nlike to fuck dead people?\n\n01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.620\nThat seems like the perfect little biosphere.\n\n01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.620\nYeah, then you just embalm them\n\n01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.620\nand that's like all the evidence is sealed up in there.\n\n01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.620\nYeah, uh-oh.\n\n01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.620\nI don't...\n\n01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.620\nWait, in your head...\n\n01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.620\nIn my head,
