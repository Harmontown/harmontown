00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello, Gramercy Theater, the New York Comedy Festival!

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
I have a very good feeling about this.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Ladies and gentlemen, from New York City, in the great state of New York, Harmontown

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
is now in session.

00:32.000 --> 00:46.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
Jeff, you wanted a...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That makes it...

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Thank you, Arturo.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Do I owe you money, Arturo?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm being surfaced with gifts right now.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, Agent, this is a real pad, not your Nintendo bullshit.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
What the fuck is going on?

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Hello, New York, thank you so much for...

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
It couldn't be happier, you're wonderful people, I hope you're very...

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I hope you're comfortable, and I just...

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
We're so honored and flattered, particularly...

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
We're sold out tonight and we're sold out tomorrow night,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
and I hope that...

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
He's really, really, really...

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I mean, you know, it's crazy.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
This theater is cool, the Ramones play here?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
This place is sexy as hell.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, well, every time...

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, we've never had a bad experience in New York, so let's...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
It's time to break that pad.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
That shinks it.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
But it's obviously flattering, it's the capital of the world, you know?

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
So when they're excited that you're coming to visit them, it feels legitimizing.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
We're very happy that people like us in Los Angeles, but let's face it,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
those people are fucking nincompoops.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Like, they don't know what they're doing, they're crazy people.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
They are from the Midwest and they go out to a desert and they draw things

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
and they expect to get paid for it.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
You guys are like fucking dealing with reality.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Like, 9-Eleven's happening over your shoulder.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And you're like, yeah, but still, Dan Harmon showing up would be good.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
And that's a huge compliment.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Because like, getting to work without being stabbed is a big deal for you guys.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
And also, like, there's cats going on.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You have shows.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
You mean the play cats?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
In LA, you can't...

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Cats closing like 89, dude.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It doesn't matter.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
If they said they wanted it back, they'd make more cats.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm gonna guess, I swear to God, I bet I'm right.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I bet there's a night writer show on Broadway right now.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Because if they want it, so be it.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
There's a Spider-Man who's dangling all over the place.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
There's a Harry Potter show on Broadway.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
These guys, what I'm saying is, they can do whatever they want.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
And so a hug from you really is twice as valuable as everyone that we've ever said we liked.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I really, like, you guys are...

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
We've sucked Portland's dick.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
We've been to Austin and we've said, this is the best town in the world.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Honestly, I hope those people aren't listening right now, but it's all been a lie.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Even in our own home.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
We don't like those people as much as we like you.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
You guys are good, good, good, good people.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
So thank you.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Glad we got that out of the way.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Now onto the show, which we don't have.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
There's no show.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I don't know.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
We've never had a show.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
We tried to have a show for the first three Harmontowns before we recorded it.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
We tried to think about guests and what we're gonna do, and then we just said, fuck it, let's just get drunk.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I did scribble some notes.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I got some notes.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Oh, shit.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
All right, so I try to understand that...

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I...

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Okay, applause for the...

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
He has the speech impediment.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
No, it's true.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I thought you thought that was CG.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Now you're in there, you're singing.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Oh, he really...

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
He's like, it's the king speech.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
It's like, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh, it's really cool.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I can see his lips flapping.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
You all thought that Ferro Audio edited and then like remixed his...

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You're singing, it's a real thing.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Do you believe in life?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
No, it's real.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
And...

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
We also auto-tune.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I, I, I...

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I, I...

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Are you stuck?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
No, I'm...

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Now when I do it, I know I'm hearing it and it's...

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I know, you don't, don't apologize.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
That's beautiful.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
And that's another thing about New York.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
By the way, have we talked about this?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
New York is the nicest fucking town.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Everyone had...

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Here's what nice it is.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
I came out and plugged in my, my iPod or a phone, whatever you call it,

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
and a dude brought me drinks.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It's the best place in the world.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
It's, well, because it makes sense.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
If you told somebody from Mars you'd go,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
guess which is the most polite city?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Do you think it's the one where everyone's stacked on top of each other?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And, and, and that if the lights go out,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
they're five seconds from cannibalism?

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Like, do you think those people know their P's and Q's?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
The, the Martian would go,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
yeah, I would bet my money on that.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
I would think that the people in Nebraska would turn out to be racist.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
What was the year when the lights all went out

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
and everybody had a million babies?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay, it was the 70s though.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
77.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
77 this guy says.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
2003 too?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
No, that was...

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah, well...

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Why do the lights keep going out in this fucking city?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Because they need power to do what they do.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
They're, they're wonderful people.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The lights are controlled by big condom.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Well, there was that night that, yeah, it was like...

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But who is him for that matter?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Whatever.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
But, but, but, but honestly, like nicer people here, nicer encounters

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
because everyone has to be, well, more versed in politeness.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
It's a big...

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
A guy on the third row said, fuck you.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It's their first night here.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
She's fucked her.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
She's from Austin.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
She's from Austin, Texas.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
But you know what?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
We love her here and we accept her.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
And she could be the senator of New York tomorrow if we, if we so chose.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Senators.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Okay, so I'm just looking at my notes and I just, okay, I'm trying to...

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
So I, on the plane, I spilled some chili on my shirt.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
You had chili on the plane?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And I found out...

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
What plate serves chili?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Jet Blue, if you need to know.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Chili?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm just expressing incredulity.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, it's not like a big pot of it.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
It looks like a guy going...

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Woo-hoo!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Who, who watched Moon Kid?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Like, oh, crawdad coming out.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
It was, it still gets distracted by Jet Blue's menu.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
I spilled some shit on my shirt and, and I, and I was like, oh shit.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And I only brought one shirt for five days for...

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Because you're a professional.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
So it's like, once it, once there's chili on it, it's like there's chili on it the whole

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
time.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
And so I was like, oh man.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
And then, and then Dino said, put some salt on it.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
And then, and then, and I, and I, I took some salt and I put it on it and I started rubbing

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
and it, like, I guess you guys probably can see that it probably didn't all go away.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
But there was chili all over my shirt.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
And it worked.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
And, and I was like scrubbing.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm like, oh, is that the abrasion?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
And then I was talking to Jeff about it.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And he's like, oh, that's why soda water works.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
And I was like, soda, sodium?

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
I didn't know that for 42 years.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Sodium, soda water.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I didn't know that.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It's very exciting.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's super exciting.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
Like a little club soda will get that out because it has salt in it, because the ions, like

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
they want, they are hungry for chili.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
But didn't, didn't they?

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
It's just like, it's exciting to learn things.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Didn't you learn this in the same table at the same restaurant where you've had other

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
epiphanies about stuff that you didn't use to know?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, about the courtesy flesh.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, okay.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
All right.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
So thank you.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
So, so we could call this a segment.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Do you want to give it a theme song?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Just...

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
I didn't bring my iPad.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
We're limited tonight.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Well, this is stuff, this is stuff that I've learned at 42.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
I'm going to turn that down a bit.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Do you want to...

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Because it is kind of exciting.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And there's, and there's two more.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Oh yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
So do you want to give it a theme song for real?

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
Dan Harmon learning things that he should have learned when he was a little younger.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
See, the crowd has gone wild.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I don't know.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
They're being very nice.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I thought that was terrible.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
I think if we come to a different city, we should...

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Dan Harmon is the world's coolest guy.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
But what is it?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
What is that?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
That song is a wall of...

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I know.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Again, it's a real...

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I think it's our friend, Titanic's and Claire.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Well, no, I'm not questioning his talent.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm just like, that song is just a wall of sand.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
I know.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I try to turn it down.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
It's very loud.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, it's not about lowering the volume.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
It's about picking a song that has a...

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Hold your horses.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
A beginning.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I'm going to pick another...

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Okay.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Ready?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
What's the segment called?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
You pick a title.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Dan Harmon...

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
No, you know what?

10:01.000 --> 10:10.000
It's not about me.

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
Sometimes you learn things even though you've been alive for 40 years.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
It's not too late to learn.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Mammals' brains harden.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
That's why sometimes you have a kitten that fetches and then you tell your friends, my

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
cat plays fetch and then the cat doesn't fetch anymore because its brain gets hard.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
And that's most mammals, but Ben Franklin was 75 going out in the rain and like, what

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
will happen?

10:46.000 --> 10:56.000
Because we are eternally children and our brains are soft and that's also results in

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
racism and...

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
That's been our show.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Thanks for coming.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Rape and murder.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Drive safely.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
But we're eternally at play.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.600
We're like, well, what would happen if I hated that guy because he's black?

11:09.600 --> 11:12.600
But also what would happen if I flew a kite in the rain?

11:12.600 --> 11:20.000
Hey, if you like these lights, maybe you should hate black people.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Should that segment's theme song have its own segment theme song?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
No, that would be...

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
That went wrong.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.480
I'm going to assume Ben Franklin was racist because he didn't know any better.

11:32.480 --> 11:37.320
But that, you know, if you're black and you're listening and you like electricity, don't

11:37.320 --> 11:40.720
be conflicted.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.040
There's room in the world for all of us and there's not...

11:44.040 --> 11:45.600
I don't think we should accept...

11:45.600 --> 11:52.280
I think I implied that if you like electricity, you should hate black people and that's not

11:52.280 --> 11:54.840
the case at all.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.040
The opposite is the case.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.120
If you like electricity, you should love...

11:58.120 --> 12:01.200
Well, you shouldn't love anybody because of their color.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.640
That would be as racist as if you hated them.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.800
And you guys are from New York.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.160
You know this.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.560
Don't love people because of the color of their skin.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.720
That's fucked up.

12:13.720 --> 12:19.480
Like there are bad people who are different skin-wise.

12:19.480 --> 12:23.400
And if you just love them for their skin, you're a racist.

12:23.400 --> 12:27.840
And you will pay the price because they'll come to your house and go, hi, I'm purple

12:27.840 --> 12:29.920
and everyone hates me.

12:29.920 --> 12:34.440
And I come in your house and you'll be like, oh, no, I love purple people.

12:34.440 --> 12:41.800
And then he's like, stab, stab, like you deserved it.

12:41.800 --> 12:48.200
Are you running for the Republican nomination right now?

12:48.200 --> 12:52.600
Because you're making a hell of a lot of sense over there.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.600
All right.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.600
Well, you know what?

12:54.600 --> 12:57.440
I'm saying what they're thinking.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.440
Is that guy going to win?

12:58.440 --> 12:59.440
He's not going to win.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
Okay.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.440
All right.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.440
Let's talk about that later.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.440
Okay.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.600
Is that the salt and the sodium?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.680
So we're in the segment.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.680
He's on target.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.440
He'll never lose the target.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.240
I get a little drunk when I come to New York.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.160
Just two more things about me learning things when I'm 40.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.160
So 42.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.080
The soda is sodium.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.280
Here's the new one.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.120
You brought up courtesy flush.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.560
So I never knew what courtesy flush meant.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.440
I always thought it meant you poop and then you flush twice.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.440
I was like, how is that a courtesy to anyone?

13:35.440 --> 13:40.920
I never, I was like, do they mean like, because there's poop flakes in the water?

13:40.920 --> 13:42.800
That's a courtesy?

13:42.800 --> 13:46.640
If you poop and then what you see in the toilet.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.800
This one goes out to the ladies in the house.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.400
If what you see demands a second flush, that's not a courtesy.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.640
That's gross.

13:55.640 --> 14:00.760
And you should hate yourself and flush second time because there's extra poop because your

14:00.760 --> 14:03.800
butt has more poop than a toilet.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.800
That's what I thought courtesy flush meant.

14:05.800 --> 14:10.760
Courtesy flush, as you already know, and I just learned, it means halfway through your

14:10.760 --> 14:20.760
poop, you reach back and flush your poopus while you're still pooping.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.760
I didn't know that.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.760
I just learned that.

14:22.760 --> 14:27.560
And I had to come to New York to learn that because New York has no, like, space.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.280
You guys could have gone and seen Hamilton tonight.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.000
You could have gone and, we're learning shit here at the Gramercy.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.080
Because every place here, it's like, you know, it's a three foot bathroom.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.120
Matt Dan, have you put the courtesy flush into play?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
Have you used that now?

14:39.120 --> 14:40.120
No, I haven't done it yet.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.760
I'd safe to say at this age, I don't think I'll learn that habit.

14:44.760 --> 14:49.000
But I'm still, I'm very charmed by the concept.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.720
Okay, one more thing, and then we're done with this segment.

14:53.720 --> 14:58.200
So here's, okay, so this is going to blow your fucking mind.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.440
Buckle your holy shit belts, everybody.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.120
I just found this out in the Rick and Morty writer's room.

15:03.120 --> 15:06.600
So I'm not even sure how to, yeah, thank you, thank you, kids, thank you.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
Yeah.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Yeah.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
Oh, we're...

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
Yeah.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.600
These people love writer's rooms.

15:12.600 --> 15:17.520
Yeah, we're in that writer's room, we're working it up.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.400
You guys are mostly topless, you guys are shirts off most of the time on that writer's

15:20.400 --> 15:21.400
room.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.400
Sure, whatever.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.400
Yeah.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.200
Okay, so this is fucking insane to me.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.360
I don't, okay, so...

15:28.360 --> 15:30.840
I have no idea where this is going.

15:30.840 --> 15:39.800
Okay, so you guys know the catch phrase, nobody puts baby in the corner, in a corner, right?

15:39.800 --> 15:56.000
So for the last five, eight years, like, I thought that line was from the movie Million

15:56.000 --> 16:02.400
Dollar Baby.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.320
She was in the corner a lot of that movie.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.320
It makes sense.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.320
I've never seen the movie.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.320
Part of being a biker.

16:07.320 --> 16:13.760
I know that Clint Eastwood teaches a Million Dollar Baby to fight.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.560
And spoilers, I've never seen the movie.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.280
I know she gets put in a corner and dies.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.280
I know that.

16:22.280 --> 16:30.000
I also know how death of a salesman ends, but I, like, I, because I have two reasons.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.440
And when I walk you through this, you're going to go, Dan, I forgive you, and I'm actually

16:35.440 --> 16:38.920
kind of mad at a society that did this to you.

16:38.920 --> 16:45.120
The first thing is, I think this is just a distortion of my perception, because apparently

16:45.120 --> 16:51.160
that line is from Dirty Dancing, which I've seen the one and a half times that we've all

16:51.160 --> 16:52.160
seen it.

16:52.160 --> 16:56.360
The first time through when you're trying to impress someone, and the half time when

16:56.360 --> 17:00.560
you just fall asleep and you're hoping it holds up.

17:00.560 --> 17:06.800
Absolutely apropos of absolutely nothing, Patrick Swayze walks up to Jennifer Gray and

17:06.800 --> 17:09.840
says, nobody puts baby in the corner.

17:09.840 --> 17:11.440
Isn't her dad that says that?

17:11.440 --> 17:13.240
Her father says it about her.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
Oh, all right.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
The plot thickens.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.240
The plot thickens.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.240
Okay.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
You know what?

17:18.240 --> 17:20.240
Garbage movie, by the way.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.560
Her dad says it about her.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.880
Swayze says it about her, too, her dad.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.960
I'm so glad we got this fucking sorted.

17:28.960 --> 17:33.880
Drinks around the house, bar.

17:33.880 --> 17:41.120
I think her dad says in the movie, he says, I don't want you dancing with that dirty dancer.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.120
Go in the corner.

17:42.120 --> 17:46.760
And then he goes over to her and he goes, I'm sorry, nobody puts baby in the corner.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.560
By the way, your name's baby.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.560
Get out of the corner.

17:50.560 --> 17:55.440
So here's the thing, I saw that movie, I don't remember that line, I don't think it was a

17:55.440 --> 17:56.440
big deal.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.320
It was like Macaulay Culkin going like this, it's not like the point in the movie, this

18:00.320 --> 18:05.120
is great, it's a dumb movie and that's just another dumb part of it, right?

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
No, it was a great movie.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.320
Did anyone here write dirty dancing?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.320
You did?

18:10.320 --> 18:11.320
Okay.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.320
These guys wrote it.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.320
It's a dumb movie.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.520
These two 24-year-olds wrote dirty dancing.

18:16.520 --> 18:22.400
It's a dumb movie and honestly, anyone who wants to challenge me on that, I will ‑‑ like

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
I usually ‑‑

18:23.400 --> 18:28.080
Who here is strong enough to do the lift and have Dan go up like Jennifer Gray?

18:28.080 --> 18:30.160
Do we have somebody strong enough to do the lift?

18:30.160 --> 18:31.680
No, we're going to do that down this aisle.

18:31.680 --> 18:36.320
We're going to end the show with somebody doing the dirty dancing lift and going down

18:36.320 --> 18:38.520
the aisle.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.280
So here's the other thing that happened.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.080
Remember this is the end with Seth Rogen?

18:43.080 --> 18:48.600
So his buddy in the movie is in that million dollar baby movie, right?

18:48.600 --> 18:53.320
So in the movie, Seth Rogen says to his friend, he says, I don't know, I don't know, I don't

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
know.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.160
He says nobody puts baby in the corner and the guy kind of chuckles.

18:57.160 --> 19:01.200
Like it's his way of seducing his friend into going to the Hollywood party.

19:01.200 --> 19:06.120
And like so that guy was in million dollar baby and then Seth does that joke.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.960
And so I ‑‑ that's what ‑‑

19:09.960 --> 19:12.240
What was that guy in million dollar baby?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.240
Wasn't he in that movie?

19:13.240 --> 19:14.240
I don't ‑‑

19:14.240 --> 19:15.240
Okay.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.240
Well, I haven't seen it.

19:16.240 --> 19:22.600
I may have also made that up because I haven't seen the movie so ‑‑ so I picture Colleen

19:22.600 --> 19:27.800
Eastwood teaching Hillary Swank how to box and then that guy is like, hey, I love being

19:27.800 --> 19:29.920
in the corner.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.920
Let's move on.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.480
But it's just ‑‑ I thought you'd enjoy that.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.720
You can learn things after ‑‑

19:35.720 --> 19:38.280
You promised that Mayans would be blown and I think you proved it.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.280
I think ‑‑

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
Yeah, no, I think ‑‑

19:40.280 --> 19:45.040
Yeah, I thought ‑‑ every time someone said nobody puts baby in the corner, I've

19:45.040 --> 19:51.000
always pictured Colleen Eastwood talking to Hillary Swank on a hospital bed.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.440
I never pictured Patrick Swayze talking to him.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.520
What if he said that in that movie but he was referencing Dirty Dancing?

19:58.520 --> 19:59.520
Yeah.

19:59.520 --> 20:09.520
Oh, by the way, both movies, garbage.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.520
You know?

20:10.520 --> 20:11.520
Dirty Dancing is a game.

20:11.520 --> 20:15.840
Dirty Dancing tackles abortion and tackles ‑‑

20:15.840 --> 20:18.440
I wrote 28 percent of Monster House.

20:18.440 --> 20:24.920
So if I tell you a movie is bad, you fucking listen to me.

20:24.920 --> 20:25.920
Okay.

20:25.920 --> 20:30.480
So I was masturbating today in the hotel room.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
And I ‑‑

20:31.480 --> 20:32.960
This is how most of Dan's stories start, by the way.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.080
And I had a conference call.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.080
I was like ‑‑

20:37.080 --> 20:39.760
Is that why you started masturbating?

20:39.760 --> 20:48.320
I was in the bed and I was like ‑‑ I want to masturbate and I thought of the person

20:48.320 --> 20:56.640
that I wanted to masturbate to and Hillary Swank and I Googled around and I found the

20:56.640 --> 21:00.360
image and I was like, okay, I'm going to ‑‑ okay, I'm masturbating.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.640
And then there was a conference call and I was like, okay, but I'm going to masturbate

21:04.640 --> 21:09.240
for five minutes and then I'll get on the conference call.

21:09.240 --> 21:13.280
But then they changed the dial in number.

21:13.280 --> 21:20.080
So then I was masturbating and there was like an intern calling me and she was on the phone

21:20.080 --> 21:25.040
and she was going, hey, we changed the dial in number and I was like, I had literally

21:25.040 --> 21:34.000
my penis in my hand and I was like, okay, well, can you ‑‑ okay, what's the ‑‑ she's

21:34.000 --> 21:39.760
like, I'll e‑mail it to you, okay, but I don't really have a point in the story.

21:39.760 --> 21:47.480
What it made me think of was she didn't know I was ‑‑ she didn't know she was talking

21:47.480 --> 21:52.280
to a man that was like doing this ‑‑ I think if you're a woman and you call a man,

21:52.280 --> 21:55.200
you should just have that assumption already in your head.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.600
That's ‑‑ the guy is very likely the guy is jerking off on that call.

21:58.600 --> 22:05.280
But when Erin ‑‑ my former wife, she worked at 1‑800 Dentist, she would say

22:05.280 --> 22:11.280
she said a big part of her job was you would answer the phone and go 1‑800 Dentist and

22:11.280 --> 22:23.280
then the guy would go, yeah, I want to get a dentist and a ‑‑ a dentist real bad.

22:23.280 --> 22:28.400
Okay, sir, do you ‑‑ do you have an insurance provider?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
What?

22:29.400 --> 22:35.160
And it was like a big part of her job, it was like a prevalent thing.

22:35.160 --> 22:46.120
There were guys that were like clearly masturbating and the idea of talking to a person.

22:46.120 --> 22:51.040
But the thing that I don't ‑‑ they kind of ‑‑ because this happened to me and

22:51.040 --> 22:58.480
I was like, oh, this person doesn't know that I'm kneeling in a New York hotel bed looking

22:58.480 --> 23:04.400
at a photo of like a girl from a commercial.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
What was the commercial?

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
I'm not saying.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.400
I'm not saying.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
Don't say 1‑800 Dentist.

23:08.400 --> 23:15.840
I'm not saying because I have not verified her birth date and I ‑‑ those records

23:15.840 --> 23:25.640
are sealed until we officially verify that she was born after 1980, whatever the cigarette

23:25.640 --> 23:26.640
date is.

23:26.640 --> 23:31.400
But like, believe me, she's on the bubble.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
Jesus Christ.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
Hey.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
You know what?

23:35.400 --> 23:38.720
You shouldn't have said it was flow from the progressive progressive.

23:38.720 --> 23:43.400
I should have said lots of stuff, but I didn't.

23:43.400 --> 23:51.640
I should have done ‑‑ the Wright brothers should have taken a car.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.200
But they didn't.

23:54.200 --> 23:59.200
I'm equating my horrible ‑‑ your late perversion to ‑‑

23:59.200 --> 24:02.240
To the birth of the invention of flight.

24:02.240 --> 24:06.840
And how did they know when they were out there going like, what if a car could fly?

24:06.840 --> 24:13.120
How did they ‑‑ I bet people were driving by and going like, gross.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.240
Go home to your wife.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.240
Age inappropriate.

24:17.240 --> 24:22.680
And they would have called out, you know, Taco Bell put her in the commercial for a

24:22.680 --> 24:23.680
reason.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
Oh, so we got it.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.680
It was Taco Bell.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.680
No, it's not.

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
I made that up.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.680
I made it up.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
I made it up.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.680
No, I made it up.

24:30.680 --> 24:31.680
We don't know that.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.680
I made it up ourselves.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.680
You were driven off to a Tawawa.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.680
You were driven off to a Tawawa.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.680
You were a Taco Bell girl.

24:35.680 --> 24:36.680
You're not going to find her.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.680
I'll tell you.

24:37.680 --> 24:38.680
I'll tell you next week.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.680
Tell us the commercial.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.100
Your whole gimmick is full disclosure.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.000
Tell us what commercial you were driven off to.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.100
But my whole gimmick is not full disclosure if she's 17.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.440
I saw the commercial.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.480
I made a mental note of it.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.020
I called her image up.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.780
I'm a grown man, I'm in charge of my life.

25:03.780 --> 25:05.900
NBCUniversal called up, he said,

25:05.900 --> 25:08.140
I had my pants around my ankles,

25:08.140 --> 25:12.980
I had my wiener in my hand, it's tiny, I'm powerless,

25:12.980 --> 25:15.140
but I'm a bad person.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.940
It's funny to me that there was a person

25:16.940 --> 25:18.300
who was like an intern going like,

25:18.300 --> 25:20.460
okay, hold on for, I'm giving you the thing.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.140
And I'm like, okay.

25:22.140 --> 25:23.580
So I was just thinking like,

25:23.580 --> 25:25.420
so what happened, did you go and hold

25:25.420 --> 25:26.260
and stop drinking after?

25:26.260 --> 25:27.100
Did you continue?

25:27.100 --> 25:28.500
Of course I stopped, it like shriveled,

25:28.500 --> 25:31.260
but I, because I took,

25:31.260 --> 25:32.420
but only because I was like,

25:32.420 --> 25:33.940
I didn't go there in my head.

25:33.940 --> 25:36.100
Because the person on the phone was over 17 years old,

25:36.100 --> 25:36.940
is that why?

25:36.940 --> 25:40.100
Jeff, you know, Jeff, you're, Jeff.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.980
Am I connecting the wrong dots, damn.

25:41.980 --> 25:45.900
Jeff, you're the bad person here.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.220
Because what I was thinking was,

25:47.220 --> 25:48.140
oh, this is interesting,

25:48.140 --> 25:49.700
because I remember Erin's stories about

25:49.700 --> 25:51.020
when she worked for 1-800-Dentist,

25:51.020 --> 25:53.140
how there were the people who would call her,

25:53.140 --> 25:55.860
I was like, they were clearly getting off on,

25:55.860 --> 25:58.020
that the interesting thing to me is like the question of,

25:58.020 --> 26:00.220
like there's some people who are,

26:00.220 --> 26:02.220
they're getting off on the idea that you,

26:03.180 --> 26:05.820
it's an assault, that they,

26:05.820 --> 26:09.380
like, that they want you to know.

26:09.380 --> 26:10.820
And then I started, I was like, wait,

26:10.820 --> 26:12.940
but what if you, what if your thing was

26:12.940 --> 26:14.540
that they didn't know?

26:14.540 --> 26:16.620
What if you just called people and were like,

26:16.620 --> 26:20.900
hey, I was wondering, should I get a new swimming pool?

26:20.900 --> 26:23.500
Well, sir, I'm looking through my things

26:23.500 --> 26:25.220
and the whole time you're jerking off.

26:25.220 --> 26:28.220
Like, is that a fetish?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.620
And how would you ever know?

26:29.620 --> 26:31.180
You wouldn't, because that would be the whole point,

26:31.180 --> 26:32.820
because the guy would be like,

26:32.820 --> 26:34.300
and then you're like, hello?

26:34.300 --> 26:36.180
I was like, I just love swimming pools.

26:36.180 --> 26:39.340
It's not, I was just thinking, like, I didn't go there.

26:39.340 --> 26:41.420
Dan, how many listens do we get on Harmontown

26:41.420 --> 26:42.260
a month or a week?

26:42.260 --> 26:43.100
Do you know?

26:43.100 --> 26:45.740
What's the ballpark figures in there?

26:45.740 --> 26:46.940
That's 10 million.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.900
Okay, so we got to assume, there's at least-

26:49.900 --> 26:51.460
Five million women.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.340
And you're saying we just lost them.

26:53.340 --> 26:56.140
No, I'm saying, if the number is over a million

26:56.140 --> 26:57.940
and it's over a few million,

26:57.940 --> 27:01.300
certain people are jerking off right as we speak right now.

27:01.300 --> 27:04.260
How many people here at the Gramergy Theater

27:04.260 --> 27:06.620
are currently jerking off in the shadows?

27:06.620 --> 27:08.860
Well, that's nearly half of the crowd.

27:08.860 --> 27:09.700
I love that.

27:09.700 --> 27:10.540
Well, that's sort of the Pandora's Box,

27:10.540 --> 27:11.380
I was hoping it was like-

27:11.380 --> 27:12.220
How many people are jerking off?

27:12.220 --> 27:14.300
Somebody's sitting next to them is the more important.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.820
All right, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

27:15.820 --> 27:17.220
That matters more than anything.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.580
Okay.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.420
All right.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.260
Uh...

27:22.580 --> 27:23.540
If somebody brought me a drink over,

27:23.540 --> 27:25.020
they can certainly be jerking off.

27:25.020 --> 27:29.300
Salt stains, phone jerking, soda is sodium.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.140
Nobody puts me in the corner.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.140
Poop pants.

27:33.140 --> 27:35.860
It says, poop pants, let's dance, Bowie.

27:35.860 --> 27:36.700
Oh, because that was last night

27:36.700 --> 27:38.260
and you were in a blackout drunk

27:38.260 --> 27:41.340
and we were at a bar and let's dance was playing.

27:41.340 --> 27:44.380
Let's dance and so I started singing poop pants

27:44.380 --> 27:47.220
and then you were certain that tonight,

27:47.220 --> 27:49.060
if we sang the song, let's dance,

27:49.060 --> 27:51.020
but use the lyrics to poop pants,

27:51.020 --> 27:52.820
that it would be podcast dynamite.

27:52.820 --> 27:53.660
Yeah.

27:56.540 --> 27:57.860
Sounds like I was...

27:58.980 --> 28:01.180
Sounds like on paper I was right.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.020
I believe so.

28:02.020 --> 28:06.620
Poop pants, put on your brown shoes to match your pants.

28:06.620 --> 28:09.140
All right, so no one knows.

28:09.140 --> 28:13.580
Poop pants, let the poop go.

28:13.580 --> 28:16.620
When I say run, that means I have the runs.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.780
Yeah, that's my favorite part is that

28:18.780 --> 28:20.700
when it goes into the like cosmic prayers,

28:20.700 --> 28:24.900
it's like, when you poop, you poop your pants.

28:24.900 --> 28:28.420
My ass feels like a flame.

28:30.100 --> 28:35.100
Poop pants, put on your special brown shoes

28:35.100 --> 28:37.780
so no one sees.

28:37.780 --> 28:41.580
Poop pants, no one will notice

28:41.580 --> 28:43.460
if you wear enough brown things.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.900
I remember we were doing that drunkenly at a bar

28:46.900 --> 28:49.580
last night and you said, Jeff, stop, sorry,

28:49.580 --> 28:51.380
gotta write this down, gotta write it down.

28:51.380 --> 28:52.220
Poop pants.

28:52.220 --> 28:53.060
I did.

28:53.060 --> 28:54.940
And you said, I'll never know what that means tomorrow.

28:54.940 --> 28:55.780
I said, write down.

28:55.780 --> 28:56.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look what happened.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.660
Write down David Bowie's last dance.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.660
Okay, great, that worked really well.

29:00.660 --> 29:01.500
Yeah.

29:01.500 --> 29:05.780
Okay, so I don't suppose you have a 4-1-1 on this.

29:05.780 --> 29:07.500
I just have the word sandwich.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.660
The inventor of the sandwich.

29:10.660 --> 29:11.500
Wait, what?

29:11.500 --> 29:14.020
This is today, we were talking about the...

29:14.020 --> 29:15.660
Woody Allen.

29:15.660 --> 29:17.780
Woody Allen and either Side Effects are getting even

29:17.780 --> 29:18.620
or one of his books,

29:18.620 --> 29:20.380
not without feathers I don't think,

29:20.380 --> 29:22.420
it was a bit about the role of sandwich,

29:22.420 --> 29:23.260
you wouldn't think it was sandwich.

29:23.260 --> 29:24.260
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:24.260 --> 29:25.100
Yeah.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.740
And you wrote it down and you're like,

29:27.740 --> 29:28.740
oh no, I'm not gonna tell you,

29:28.740 --> 29:30.940
not gonna tell you, not gonna tell you what it is.

29:30.940 --> 29:34.180
You had something fucking good for the sandwich a bit.

29:34.180 --> 29:36.260
Yeah, but I feel like, okay, so I guess Woody Allen...

29:36.260 --> 29:38.540
Do we need our guest out here for this?

29:38.540 --> 29:40.740
Well, yeah, we'll bring him out in a second.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.580
Just let me get, okay, one more thing.

29:42.580 --> 29:46.300
A guy called me, a guy mistook me in a bar today.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.140
I was, I had my back to the guy

29:48.140 --> 29:51.340
and he came out of the bathroom in the spring lounge

29:51.340 --> 29:55.940
and he came out of the bathroom and he saw me from behind

29:55.940 --> 30:00.060
wearing this jacket and he went, Mr. Grossman?

30:00.060 --> 30:05.060
And I turned to him and he's like, oh, sorry.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.180
And I was like, this is a big step for me.

30:08.180 --> 30:12.460
Like, if you're 25, you're never mistaken for Mr. Grossman.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.100
That's like a big, that's a threshold.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.980
But whenever, even if your name's Shiv Grossman,

30:19.980 --> 30:22.020
yeah, someone's gonna go, Shiv,

30:22.020 --> 30:24.860
but like, I was mistaken today

30:24.860 --> 30:27.540
for a man called Mr. Grossman.

30:27.540 --> 30:29.020
And then I pressed the guy for details

30:29.020 --> 30:31.140
and it's a cartoonist from the New Yorker.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.620
So I was like, I'll take it, I'll take it.

30:35.620 --> 30:36.460
I like it.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.300
Now, do you Google his image?

30:37.300 --> 30:38.620
Look, do you resemble Mr. Grossman?

30:38.620 --> 30:39.460
No, I don't care.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.140
He was calling you a gross man.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.620
No, don't be silly.

30:42.620 --> 30:43.460
You know what?

30:43.460 --> 30:44.280
I don't know.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.120
You know what?

30:45.120 --> 30:45.940
You're a terrible person.

30:45.940 --> 30:46.980
Did you look at Mr. Grossman?

30:46.980 --> 30:49.380
No, I didn't, because I'm not narcissistic.

30:51.380 --> 30:52.220
I don't care.

30:52.220 --> 30:53.300
I don't care what I look like.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.020
I just thought it was fun, you know,

30:55.020 --> 31:00.020
and you're racist and everyone's made of light.

31:03.420 --> 31:04.260
Here we go.

31:04.260 --> 31:08.820
I love millennials now, and I'll tell you why.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.060
What do you love most about millennials?

31:11.060 --> 31:12.260
I love them because like,

31:12.260 --> 31:14.060
nothing's ever gonna go their way.

31:14.060 --> 31:17.740
And I truly, like, I've come around,

31:17.740 --> 31:19.460
I'm like, oh my God, these poor kids.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.820
Like, I fucking love you.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.900
Like, I'm so sorry.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.660
Like, I actually wanna help you,

31:24.660 --> 31:26.860
like, try to make the world right,

31:26.860 --> 31:28.980
because it took me a while.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.900
Please try to understand that I,

31:30.900 --> 31:32.940
for the first 10 years that we met,

31:32.940 --> 31:35.900
like, I thought you were just an asshole,

31:36.900 --> 31:38.820
because you wanted all this stuff,

31:38.820 --> 31:40.580
and it took me, and then I realized,

31:40.580 --> 31:42.380
oh, you're never gonna get it.

31:42.380 --> 31:44.340
And that makes me love you.

31:44.340 --> 31:46.460
Like, I'm so sorry.

31:46.460 --> 31:47.660
I love you.

31:47.660 --> 31:50.380
Like, you guys really have your head in the right spot.

31:50.380 --> 31:51.540
My generation was just like,

31:51.540 --> 31:53.100
oh, let's just look at the floor,

31:53.100 --> 31:54.780
and as long as we don't land on the moon

31:54.780 --> 31:56.980
or be the Beatles, we'll be cool.

31:56.980 --> 31:57.980
But you guys are like,

31:57.980 --> 32:01.020
you should do everything different.

32:01.020 --> 32:05.460
And I was like, yeah, you sound like Hitler to me.

32:05.460 --> 32:09.020
And then, but then after a while,

32:09.020 --> 32:11.380
they're like, you should do it all different.

32:11.380 --> 32:13.460
You should do it different.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.260
And I was like, but nothing different is happening.

32:16.260 --> 32:18.300
And then I was like, aw, aw.

32:18.300 --> 32:23.140
Aw, you little dickens.

32:23.140 --> 32:23.980
You want everything,

32:23.980 --> 32:25.500
nothing's ever gonna be different.

32:25.500 --> 32:28.100
You love everything, the earth is burning to a crisp,

32:28.100 --> 32:31.220
and you're just like, well, you should think me a brand.

32:31.220 --> 32:34.540
And it's sad and beautiful.

32:34.540 --> 32:35.900
Like, I'm on your side now

32:35.900 --> 32:37.540
that I know you'll never win.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.500
You're rude to me now.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.380
How old is the oldest millennial?

32:43.380 --> 32:44.900
Like, what's the current one in there?

32:44.900 --> 32:46.060
According to Pepsi.

32:46.060 --> 32:47.900
I swear, that's not a joke.

32:47.900 --> 32:51.740
Like, I met with like a guy from Pepsi,

32:51.740 --> 32:54.620
but you fucking like, shoot me.

32:54.620 --> 32:57.740
Oh yeah, like, this is the millennial.

32:57.740 --> 32:59.100
I hope you like Breaking Bad,

32:59.100 --> 33:03.620
but I feel like like TV is like,

33:03.620 --> 33:05.700
but if it's gonna be made good,

33:05.700 --> 33:08.060
it's gonna be like corporations are gonna be making it.

33:08.060 --> 33:09.620
Like Nike's gonna make TV.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.180
Colgate's gonna make TV.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.220
Pepsi's gonna make TV.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.820
Don't groan, you fucking little pieces of shit.

33:14.820 --> 33:18.140
You like it, you like your TV,

33:18.140 --> 33:20.380
you like your free TV.

33:20.380 --> 33:24.420
Ah, dear TV, I got offended today.

33:24.420 --> 33:29.100
Not that, not like Orange is the New Black,

33:29.100 --> 33:32.860
but I like the episode where there's too much orange in it.

33:35.420 --> 33:37.660
Cause I'm an orange person,

33:37.660 --> 33:41.340
and I don't like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:41.340 --> 33:43.100
Signed, no, no.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.100
And then in your letter goes,

33:47.780 --> 33:50.780
into a toilet called No One Gives a Fuck.

33:50.780 --> 33:55.780
Thanks for your money, but I got sidetracked.

33:58.820 --> 34:02.060
Truthfully, the truth is like Netflix is a corporation.

34:02.060 --> 34:03.820
They may as well be Nike or Pepsi,

34:03.820 --> 34:05.660
like they're just the first corporation

34:05.660 --> 34:07.100
that noticed what you guys like,

34:07.100 --> 34:09.900
and they're giving it to you, and that's a good thing.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.820
Like Pepsi is very, very capable

34:11.820 --> 34:14.380
of making great like fucking television.

34:14.380 --> 34:19.380
Don't you laugh, sir, at our comedy show.

34:19.380 --> 34:22.540
It will, don't you dare ever laugh.

34:22.540 --> 34:25.420
Do you guys remember when Seinfeld told everyone

34:25.420 --> 34:26.660
to stop laughing?

34:26.660 --> 34:30.820
Cramer was racist, and then he was on Glitterman.

34:30.820 --> 34:35.820
And then Cramer was like, I'm sorry,

34:35.820 --> 34:40.820
he's got the hair, it's like, I'm not racist,

34:40.820 --> 34:43.620
it's the thing, I love Afro-Americans.

34:43.620 --> 34:46.660
And everyone's like laughing, and Seinfeld goes,

34:46.660 --> 34:48.300
stop laughing.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.300
It's not funny.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.740
He's telling, oh, I'll take your word for it.

34:53.740 --> 34:58.740
Seinfeld, what the fuck, what the fucking fuck is happening?

35:01.100 --> 35:04.380
Cramer's apologizing for being racist on Glitterman.

35:04.380 --> 35:06.940
Seinfeld's out there curating the apology.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.820
When, let me know when I should laugh.

35:12.620 --> 35:14.860
I don't want to be a bad person or anything.

35:14.860 --> 35:20.140
Let me know when my involuntary reactions are appropriate.

35:20.140 --> 35:22.900
Because I got to tell you, watching all this makes me go.

35:22.900 --> 35:27.900
It's fucking funny if I laugh, period.

35:33.380 --> 35:35.580
Sorry, that sounded like I was mocking you.

35:35.580 --> 35:39.380
But I also, I don't trust you guys.

35:39.380 --> 35:42.620
As a generation, New York, I love New York.

35:42.620 --> 35:46.140
All right, everybody stop it, stop laughing.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.500
It's not funny.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.380
It's a bad show.

35:50.380 --> 35:51.900
I came to New York and did a bad show.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.540
Let's all go to Broadway, come on.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.740
Let's bring out Dino.

36:01.740 --> 36:06.740
Our next guest is a 10-year veteran of New York.

36:06.740 --> 36:08.740
He's my best friend, he's...

36:08.740 --> 36:10.740
Hi!

36:12.740 --> 36:14.740
I'm sorry, I'm not Spencer.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.740
Yeah, I mean, we're allowed to talk about Spencer, right?

36:18.740 --> 36:20.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.740
My voice is gone.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.740
Really?

36:24.740 --> 36:26.740
We did karaoke at one of those little, like,

36:26.740 --> 36:28.740
St. Mark's sing-sing kind of joints

36:28.740 --> 36:30.740
where you do karaoke.

36:30.740 --> 36:34.740
Dino, you only did songs that were shrieking was involved.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.740
Well, because I can't hit notes.

36:36.740 --> 36:38.740
So I gotta scream them.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.740
You do Pink by Aerosmith, better than Aerosmith,

36:40.740 --> 36:42.740
as far as I'm concerned.

36:42.740 --> 36:44.740
Because I sing it like this!

36:44.740 --> 36:46.740
Oh, by the way, absolutely...

36:46.740 --> 36:48.740
The worst lyric.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.740
Worst written song, lyrically.

36:50.740 --> 36:52.740
Pink.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.740
Pink.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.740
Pink is...

36:56.740 --> 36:58.740
Don't, don't, don't, don't...

36:58.740 --> 37:00.740
I won't.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.740
Like, I'm doing my impression of the song.

37:02.740 --> 37:04.740
Pink is

37:04.740 --> 37:06.740
in my

37:06.740 --> 37:08.740
head.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.740
Pink is a combination

37:10.740 --> 37:12.740
of yellow and red.

37:12.740 --> 37:14.740
Like, that's the lyrics.

37:14.740 --> 37:16.740
Yeah, but that's...

37:16.740 --> 37:18.740
Pink is kind of a flamingo.

37:18.740 --> 37:20.740
Pink is my kind of lingo?

37:20.740 --> 37:22.740
Very close.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.740
That's very close to it.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.740
Yeah, it's exactly right.

37:26.740 --> 37:28.740
Fucking dumb.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.740
If you wrote Pink for Aerosmith,

37:30.740 --> 37:32.740
you're rich,

37:32.740 --> 37:34.740
buy a gun and kill yourself.

37:34.740 --> 37:36.740
Like, I have no...

37:36.740 --> 37:38.740
I don't care.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.740
I don't care if you're William Goldman.

37:40.740 --> 37:42.740
In their defense, they weren't really trying.

37:42.740 --> 37:44.740
No, exactly.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.740
So kill yourself.

37:46.740 --> 37:48.740
Like, do you know...

37:48.740 --> 37:50.740
If you're 16 and you're thinking of suicide,

37:50.740 --> 37:52.740
talk to someone.

37:52.740 --> 37:54.740
If you wrote Pink, fucking pull the trigger.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.740
If you wrote Pink for Aerosmith, kill yourself.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.740
Because you're never going to.

38:00.740 --> 38:02.740
My challenge to you is blow my mind.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.740
Kill yourself.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.740
Do the right thing.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.740
And right in your suicide note,

38:08.740 --> 38:10.740
I wrote Pink

38:10.740 --> 38:12.740
for Aerosmith.

38:12.740 --> 38:14.740
And I heard Dan Hyman.

38:14.740 --> 38:16.740
I heard it, and you know what?

38:16.740 --> 38:18.740
Thank you.

38:18.740 --> 38:20.740
Because thank you, Dan Hyman,

38:20.740 --> 38:22.740
for saying what society wouldn't say.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.740
That I'm a dipshit.

38:24.740 --> 38:26.740
And that I fucked

38:26.740 --> 38:28.740
up.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.740
That I used my gift to hurt people.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.740
Because there's little kids listening.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.740
Pink is a kind of color.

38:34.740 --> 38:40.740
Pink is a kind of color.

38:40.740 --> 38:44.740
Pink is my kind of color.

38:44.740 --> 38:48.740
I like Pink because I like that color.

38:48.740 --> 38:50.740
When you're Pink,

38:50.740 --> 38:54.740
it's a new color.

38:54.740 --> 38:56.740
First of all, Pink is the color of

38:56.740 --> 38:58.740
vaginas and penises.

38:58.740 --> 39:00.740
Well, that's where Eric is in there.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.740
That's the point of the song.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.740
Pink cheered up to say all kinds of cool things.

39:04.740 --> 39:06.740
Well, he did.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.740
Pink is the color.

39:08.740 --> 39:10.740
It's the bing on your cherry.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.740
I don't like it.

39:12.740 --> 39:14.740
It's the bing on your cherry.

39:14.740 --> 39:16.740
That doesn't scan.

39:16.740 --> 39:18.740
It's dumb.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.740
You also sang Beast of Burden

39:20.740 --> 39:22.740
by Rolling Stones last night.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.740
Thank you.

39:24.740 --> 39:26.740
Was it you that missed,

39:26.740 --> 39:28.740
heard those lyrics a long time ago?

39:28.740 --> 39:30.740
You thought it was something else?

39:30.740 --> 39:32.740
I don't know.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.740
I definitely missed her lyrics.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.740
I'll never be your pizza burning.

39:36.740 --> 39:38.740
I'll never be your pizza burning.

39:38.740 --> 39:40.740
I'll never be your pizza burning.

39:44.740 --> 39:46.740
I think that was weird Al-Yankovic.

39:48.740 --> 39:50.740
No one knows

39:50.740 --> 39:52.740
weird Al-Yankovic is trying to sing the actual song.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.740
He's just an idiot.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.740
He can't remember.

39:56.740 --> 39:58.740
Carmen, today,

39:58.740 --> 40:00.740
if you know the

40:00.740 --> 40:02.740
backlog of Harmontown episodes,

40:02.740 --> 40:04.740
but Dan is notoriously bad at telling jokes.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.740
Take a bow.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.740
You may have heard him mistell the duck joke,

40:12.740 --> 40:14.740
the welder's mask joke, various jokes.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.740
Dan, I told you the joke

40:16.740 --> 40:18.740
about the guy that puked all over his shirt today.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.740
You promised you would try to tell this joke today.

40:20.740 --> 40:22.740
You laughed very hard at the bar.

40:22.740 --> 40:24.740
You promised that you would say,

40:24.740 --> 40:26.740
I'm gonna fucking do it.

40:26.740 --> 40:28.740
Now,

40:28.740 --> 40:30.740
while Dan conjures this up

40:30.740 --> 40:32.740
in his memory and tries to get it right.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.740
You want to tell the whole...

40:34.740 --> 40:36.740
We already did.

40:36.740 --> 40:38.740
I never listened to this show.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.740
Can you give me a little hint about the guy puking?

40:40.740 --> 40:42.740
The guy pukes in himself,

40:42.740 --> 40:44.740
and he goes, I can't go home looking like this.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.740
Oh, okay.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.740
I got it.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.740
It's a good joke.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.740
Okay, I just made me laugh at that.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.740
Grand Mz Theater, New York City,

40:54.740 --> 40:56.740
you have my absolute firm conviction

40:56.740 --> 40:58.740
without fear of contradiction.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.740
Dan Harmon is gonna tell you this joke.

41:00.740 --> 41:02.740
It's gonna be a goodie.

41:02.740 --> 41:04.740
It's a great joke.

41:04.740 --> 41:06.740
I would say this joke is nearly 180

41:06.740 --> 41:08.740
or more years old.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.740
It's a great old classic joke.

41:10.740 --> 41:12.740
Okay, all right.

41:12.740 --> 41:14.740
We take you to a bar

41:14.740 --> 41:16.740
where a joke starts.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.740
Don't tell them where they're going.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.740
Okay, all right, so a guy...

41:20.740 --> 41:22.740
I'm not gonna look at you.

41:22.740 --> 41:24.740
A guy goes into a bar

41:24.740 --> 41:26.740
and he goes,

41:26.740 --> 41:28.740
I...

41:28.740 --> 41:30.740
I...

41:30.740 --> 41:32.740
We'll be right back.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.740
He goes, give me a drink

41:34.740 --> 41:36.740
and the bartender goes, here's your drink

41:36.740 --> 41:38.740
and then the guy keeps drinking

41:38.740 --> 41:40.740
and then after a while he looks at his watch

41:40.740 --> 41:42.740
and he goes, I got him so late

41:42.740 --> 41:44.740
like I should have gone home

41:44.740 --> 41:46.740
like to my wife

41:46.740 --> 41:48.740
because I love her.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.740
And the bartender goes,

41:50.740 --> 41:52.740
are you gonna be in trouble

41:52.740 --> 41:54.740
for going home late?

41:54.740 --> 41:56.740
And the guy says, yeah.

41:56.740 --> 41:58.740
And he goes like, here's a trick I've learned.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.740
So take a...

42:00.740 --> 42:02.740
Take this $20 bill.

42:02.740 --> 42:04.740
That's weird

42:04.740 --> 42:06.740
that he would give it to him.

42:06.740 --> 42:08.740
Because

42:08.740 --> 42:10.740
it seems like the guy after all

42:10.740 --> 42:12.740
like he profited from the...

42:12.740 --> 42:14.740
Can we help him or no?

42:14.740 --> 42:16.740
No, no, no, no.

42:16.740 --> 42:18.740
You don't have to mime it.

42:18.740 --> 42:20.740
I'm on the retelling

42:20.740 --> 42:22.740
I'm saying, I think this guy that we think is so stupid

42:22.740 --> 42:24.740
in this story, I think he profited.

42:24.740 --> 42:26.740
I'm not even sure

42:26.740 --> 42:28.740
he's married, I think he made $20.

42:28.740 --> 42:30.740
No, not the way Jeff told it.

42:30.740 --> 42:32.740
So let me continue.

42:32.740 --> 42:34.740
Tell him the funny way.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.740
So the bartender says, take this $20 bill.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.740
That's the part I'm hung up on.

42:38.740 --> 42:40.740
That didn't happen.

42:40.740 --> 42:42.740
Take a $20 bill.

42:42.740 --> 42:44.740
Why does he give him a $20 bill?

42:44.740 --> 42:46.740
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

42:46.740 --> 42:48.740
Take your own $20 bill.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.740
Take your own $20 bill.

42:50.740 --> 42:52.740
Because why? Well, I'm getting to that.

42:52.740 --> 42:54.740
I just got hung up. I thought the bartender was giving the money.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.740
Take a $20 bill.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.740
Fold it up.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.740
I don't know why.

43:00.740 --> 43:02.740
That's not a...

43:02.740 --> 43:04.740
It is part of it.

43:04.740 --> 43:06.740
Let him tell the joke, Dino.

43:06.740 --> 43:08.740
It's part of it.

43:08.740 --> 43:10.740
Fold it neatly and put it in your pocket.

43:10.740 --> 43:12.740
Jeff likes talking.

43:12.740 --> 43:14.740
No, it's part of it.

43:14.740 --> 43:16.740
It is part of it?

43:16.740 --> 43:18.740
No, it is part of it.

43:18.740 --> 43:20.740
Fold it neatly?

43:20.740 --> 43:22.740
I can't wait to find out

43:22.740 --> 43:24.740
why it was part of it.

43:24.740 --> 43:26.740
We still haven't found out why he gave it.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.740
I'm enjoying drinking

43:28.740 --> 43:30.740
and I'm

43:30.740 --> 43:32.740
going home late to my wife

43:32.740 --> 43:34.740
and the bartender says, let me tell you

43:34.740 --> 43:36.740
what to do.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.740
Take a $20 bill of your own

43:38.740 --> 43:40.740
and fold it.

43:40.740 --> 43:42.740
Neatly.

43:42.740 --> 43:44.740
That part I don't get

43:44.740 --> 43:46.740
but I swear to God, that's what he said.

43:46.740 --> 43:48.740
Put it in your pocket.

43:48.740 --> 43:50.740
When you go home to your wife

43:50.740 --> 43:52.740
and she goes, why were you home

43:52.740 --> 43:54.740
so late?

43:54.740 --> 43:56.740
It's amazing.

43:56.740 --> 43:58.740
Leave it.

43:58.740 --> 44:00.740
I'm telling the exact joke.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.740
Say to her,

44:02.740 --> 44:04.740
say, I was at a bar

44:04.740 --> 44:06.740
and a guy puked on me.

44:06.740 --> 44:08.740
Oh!

44:08.740 --> 44:10.740
You never said that.

44:10.740 --> 44:12.740
It's

44:12.740 --> 44:14.740
the joke

44:14.740 --> 44:16.740
progresses linearly.

44:16.740 --> 44:18.740
I never said it.

44:18.740 --> 44:20.740
It's not like a crawl in the beginning.

44:20.740 --> 44:22.740
A guy will puke on someone.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.740
Everyone's like...

44:24.740 --> 44:26.740
You're doing great.

44:26.740 --> 44:28.740
Say to your wife,

44:28.740 --> 44:30.740
a guy puked on me

44:30.740 --> 44:32.740
and he felt so bad

44:32.740 --> 44:34.740
that he gave

44:34.740 --> 44:36.740
me this neatly folded $20 bill

44:36.740 --> 44:38.740
to

44:38.740 --> 44:40.740
go to a dry cleaner

44:40.740 --> 44:42.740
to get the puke wash out of my shirt

44:42.740 --> 44:44.740
and that's why I'm late

44:44.740 --> 44:46.740
is because of the amount of time it takes

44:46.740 --> 44:48.740
to get a shirt cleaned.

44:48.740 --> 44:50.740
But also, when I went to the dry cleaner

44:50.740 --> 44:52.740
for some reason I didn't use the $20.

44:52.740 --> 44:54.740
Yeah, yes.

44:54.740 --> 44:56.740
Which makes no sense

44:56.740 --> 44:58.740
but that's not my fault.

44:58.740 --> 45:00.740
Yes it is your fault.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.740
It's a flawed joke

45:02.740 --> 45:04.740
and my...

45:04.740 --> 45:06.740
It's a flawed version of this.

45:06.740 --> 45:08.740
And my passion for storytelling is revealing that.

45:08.740 --> 45:10.740
I'm bad at telling jokes.

45:10.740 --> 45:12.740
I didn't get to the punchline.

45:12.740 --> 45:14.740
And so

45:14.740 --> 45:16.740
the thing I found delightful

45:16.740 --> 45:18.740
the thing I really liked

45:18.740 --> 45:20.740
about the joke is what happens next.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.740
It's that the

45:24.740 --> 45:26.740
this fella goes home and here's the thing

45:26.740 --> 45:28.740
about the joke is that you're cutting around

45:28.740 --> 45:30.740
a thing that happens.

45:30.740 --> 45:32.740
That part was intentional.

45:32.740 --> 45:34.740
That part was intentional.

45:34.740 --> 45:36.740
I'm just sad.

45:36.740 --> 45:38.740
Because he goes home and he goes...

45:38.740 --> 45:40.740
So the bartender told him all that stuff.

45:40.740 --> 45:42.740
Said take the $20

45:42.740 --> 45:44.740
and fold it and say this story.

45:44.740 --> 45:46.740
A guy puked at me. How should he fold it?

45:46.740 --> 45:48.740
Neatly or not neatly?

45:48.740 --> 45:50.740
It's neatly?

45:50.740 --> 45:52.740
So then in the joke you have to cut from that

45:52.740 --> 45:54.740
to the guy going home.

45:54.740 --> 45:56.740
Because you're cutting around

45:56.740 --> 45:58.740
stuff that happens.

45:58.740 --> 46:00.740
This joke takes 18 seconds to tell.

46:00.740 --> 46:02.740
But the guy, you cut to the guy going home.

46:02.740 --> 46:04.740
Like a hard cut.

46:04.740 --> 46:06.740
But you're supposed to not know

46:06.740 --> 46:08.740
how much time is passed.

46:08.740 --> 46:10.740
That created community.

46:10.740 --> 46:12.740
So he goes...

46:12.740 --> 46:14.740
Because it takes a half hour to tell one joke.

46:14.740 --> 46:16.740
That's why that show was...

46:18.740 --> 46:20.740
That's what it was famous for.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.740
How come the Big Bang Theory just told me

46:26.740 --> 46:28.740
20 jokes in the same amount of time?

46:28.740 --> 46:30.740
Why are we exploring this guy's autism

46:30.740 --> 46:32.740
in a closet?

46:34.740 --> 46:36.740
So the guy goes home

46:36.740 --> 46:38.740
and he says to his...

46:38.740 --> 46:40.740
And his wife says...

46:40.740 --> 46:42.740
Okay, so I'm glad you're home.

46:42.740 --> 46:44.740
Day 3 of this joke.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.740
Very important. She's glad he's home.

46:46.740 --> 46:48.740
And she goes...

46:48.740 --> 46:50.740
Why are you so late?

46:50.740 --> 46:52.740
And he goes...

46:52.740 --> 46:54.740
Well, there was this thing that happened.

46:54.740 --> 46:56.740
And he goes...

46:56.740 --> 46:58.740
I had to take my shirt to the dry cleaner.

46:58.740 --> 47:00.740
And for some reason I still have the

47:00.740 --> 47:02.740
neatly folded money

47:02.740 --> 47:04.740
that represents what happened.

47:04.740 --> 47:06.740
And she goes...

47:06.740 --> 47:08.740
Why is there $40 here?

47:08.740 --> 47:10.740
And he says he also shit in my pants.

47:14.740 --> 47:16.740
Still a good joke.

47:16.740 --> 47:18.740
Still a good joke.

47:18.740 --> 47:20.740
I will now tell that joke correctly.

47:22.740 --> 47:24.740
Did they get the punchline wrong?

47:24.740 --> 47:26.740
They didn't laugh.

47:26.740 --> 47:28.740
Well, you didn't set it up right.

47:28.740 --> 47:30.740
You didn't set it up.

47:30.740 --> 47:32.740
The joke starts with the guy puking on himself drunk.

47:32.740 --> 47:34.740
What?

47:34.740 --> 47:36.740
The only way it makes sense.

47:36.740 --> 47:38.740
A guy has had a bar.

47:38.740 --> 47:40.740
He's been there all day, all night.

47:40.740 --> 47:42.740
He's had so much to drink.

47:42.740 --> 47:44.740
He barfs all over the front of his shirt and he just starts crying.

47:44.740 --> 47:46.740
The bartender comes up and goes... Jesus Christ!

47:46.740 --> 47:48.740
What the fuck is happening over here?

47:48.740 --> 47:50.740
He goes... Look at me. I've been drinking all day.

47:50.740 --> 47:52.740
I told my wife I'd be home hours ago.

47:52.740 --> 47:54.740
The bartender goes... I'll tell you what you do.

47:54.740 --> 47:56.740
Do you have a $20 bill?

47:56.740 --> 47:58.740
He goes... Put it in your shirt pocket.

47:58.740 --> 48:00.740
Fold it nicely.

48:00.740 --> 48:02.740
Go home. Fold it neatly.

48:02.740 --> 48:04.740
Put it in your shirt pocket.

48:04.740 --> 48:06.740
You ran into an old friend from school.

48:06.740 --> 48:08.740
He's gone through rough times.

48:08.740 --> 48:10.740
You heard his whole story.

48:10.740 --> 48:12.740
He got really drunk.

48:12.740 --> 48:14.740
He puked all over your shirt.

48:14.740 --> 48:16.740
He gave you $20 for the dry cleaning.

48:16.740 --> 48:18.740
The guy goes... That's genius.

48:18.740 --> 48:20.740
He walks home.

48:20.740 --> 48:22.740
I heard that he's gone through some rough times.

48:22.740 --> 48:24.740
He puked all over my shirt.

48:24.740 --> 48:26.740
He gave me $20 for the dry cleaning.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.740
The wife says, there's $40 here.

48:28.740 --> 48:30.740
He said, well, he also shit my pants.

48:34.740 --> 48:36.740
The joke has to start with the guy puking on himself.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.740
Well, I didn't say he puked.

48:38.740 --> 48:40.740
You never said it.

48:40.740 --> 48:42.740
You gotta say it.

48:42.740 --> 48:44.740
You never said the guy puked on himself.

48:44.740 --> 48:46.740
Why would someone else shit his pants?

48:46.740 --> 48:48.740
I mean, write a story circle

48:48.740 --> 48:50.740
about this goddamn joke.

48:50.740 --> 48:52.740
Pew!

48:52.740 --> 48:54.740
Pew!

48:54.740 --> 48:56.740
Why were you so focused

48:56.740 --> 48:58.740
on neat folding of the money?

48:58.740 --> 49:00.740
I swear to God,

49:00.740 --> 49:02.740
I wish I had a recording of you.

49:02.740 --> 49:04.740
I told that joke exactly as I told it right now.

49:04.740 --> 49:06.740
You were hungover though.

49:06.740 --> 49:08.740
You were very hungover.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.740
I admit to one thing

49:10.740 --> 49:12.740
is that I forgot that he puked on himself.

49:12.740 --> 49:14.740
Yes.

49:14.740 --> 49:16.740
So let me just...

49:16.740 --> 49:18.740
I was like, so a guy goes...

49:18.740 --> 49:20.740
The attention to so many details.

49:20.740 --> 49:22.740
You avoid him.

49:22.740 --> 49:24.740
Dan Harmon will now tell you the joke I just told you.

49:24.740 --> 49:26.740
A guy goes into a bar.

49:26.740 --> 49:28.740
Let your bets right now.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.740
He doesn't even have to go into the bar.

49:30.740 --> 49:32.740
He's already there.

49:32.740 --> 49:34.740
He gets so drunk, he's already there.

49:34.740 --> 49:36.740
And he's been drinking all day.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.740
And then he pukes on himself.

49:38.740 --> 49:40.740
And he goes like, oh, God, I puked on myself.

49:40.740 --> 49:42.740
I can't go home with puke on me.

49:42.740 --> 49:44.740
And the bartender says, take this $20.

49:44.740 --> 49:46.740
Take 20 of your own dollars.

49:46.740 --> 49:48.740
And say to your wife,

49:48.740 --> 49:50.740
like, yeah,

49:50.740 --> 49:52.740
a guy puked on me, but he's

49:52.740 --> 49:54.740
sorry and he gave me this $20.

49:54.740 --> 49:56.740
And the guy goes, that's good. Cut to.

49:56.740 --> 49:58.740
Cut to.

49:58.740 --> 50:00.740
Because he said he walks home,

50:00.740 --> 50:02.740
but if the camera's objective the whole time,

50:02.740 --> 50:04.740
then you're not there when he shits his pants.

50:06.740 --> 50:08.740
That's on you.

50:08.740 --> 50:10.740
If you can fix this joke

50:10.740 --> 50:12.740
and make him laugh harder, you're my hero.

50:12.740 --> 50:14.740
I think he's doing it.

50:14.740 --> 50:16.740
Cut to.

50:16.740 --> 50:18.740
So the guy goes home and the wife says, what happened?

50:18.740 --> 50:20.740
The person that puked on my shirt

50:20.740 --> 50:22.740
gave me this money.

50:22.740 --> 50:24.740
And she goes, okay, why is there twice

50:24.740 --> 50:26.740
as much money as

50:26.740 --> 50:28.740
the amount of puke?

50:28.740 --> 50:30.740
And he goes, well, but also there's poop in my pants.

50:32.740 --> 50:34.740
And he also wants

50:34.740 --> 50:36.740
she to also watch

50:36.740 --> 50:38.740
that to

50:38.740 --> 50:40.740
be taken care of

50:40.740 --> 50:42.740
as well.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.740
Because he's an affluent.

50:46.740 --> 50:48.740
Why is there twice as much money as the amount of puke?

50:48.740 --> 50:50.740
Because wait, that's the truth!

50:50.740 --> 50:52.740
That's the whole joke!

50:52.740 --> 50:54.740
So put $20 and then she's like, why is there $40?

50:54.740 --> 50:56.740
Because they pooped my pants.

50:56.740 --> 50:58.740
Because the guy pooped in my pants.

50:58.740 --> 51:00.740
Why is it like

51:00.740 --> 51:02.740
it's not even...

51:02.740 --> 51:04.740
That's the joke.

51:04.740 --> 51:06.740
Thanks, kids.

51:06.740 --> 51:08.740
I don't understand.

51:08.740 --> 51:10.740
I don't understand why...

51:10.740 --> 51:12.740
I understand that it's not funny when I say it,

51:12.740 --> 51:14.740
but I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.

51:14.740 --> 51:16.740
The guy puked in his pants

51:16.740 --> 51:18.740
and then he sang to his wife.

51:18.740 --> 51:20.740
I have twice as much money because I pooped my pants.

51:20.740 --> 51:22.740
Here's my feeling.

51:22.740 --> 51:24.740
Here's why I think that you're not great at telling joke jokes.

51:24.740 --> 51:26.740
Also, why...

51:26.740 --> 51:28.740
I don't know if you can connect why you're a good writer

51:28.740 --> 51:30.740
and you're good at writing.

51:30.740 --> 51:32.740
But you can write good stories.

51:32.740 --> 51:34.740
More booze? Goddamn it!

51:34.740 --> 51:36.740
You do want to come up here

51:36.740 --> 51:38.740
and tell a joke?

51:38.740 --> 51:40.740
Thank you, brother.

51:40.740 --> 51:42.740
Sorry, Dan.

51:42.740 --> 51:44.740
I was interrupted by...

51:44.740 --> 51:46.740
People giving me alcohol.

51:46.740 --> 51:48.740
Fucken. Cheers.

51:48.740 --> 51:50.740
Cheers.

51:50.740 --> 51:52.740
Here's why...

51:52.740 --> 51:54.740
That was good.

51:54.740 --> 51:56.740
I think that you're bad at telling jokes, Dan.

51:56.740 --> 51:58.740
And this is...

51:58.740 --> 52:00.740
You get caught up, not just in joke telling,

52:00.740 --> 52:02.740
but I think in your interpersonal relationships,

52:02.740 --> 52:04.740
you get hung up on details

52:04.740 --> 52:06.740
that are not...

52:06.740 --> 52:08.740
That aren't...

52:08.740 --> 52:10.740
That get in the way

52:10.740 --> 52:12.740
of the simplicity of a thing.

52:12.740 --> 52:14.740
A proper joke should be

52:14.740 --> 52:16.740
guy says this,

52:16.740 --> 52:18.740
other guy says that, punchline.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.740
Great, but okay.

52:20.740 --> 52:22.740
Here's the thing about jokes that...

52:22.740 --> 52:24.740
I always laugh at them when people tell them,

52:24.740 --> 52:26.740
but the thing is when you look back on the joke,

52:26.740 --> 52:28.740
everything has been about dishonesty

52:28.740 --> 52:30.740
because everybody...

52:30.740 --> 52:32.740
Because it's all about this matter.

52:32.740 --> 52:34.740
When you laughed at my joke,

52:34.740 --> 52:36.740
when I told you this joke today at the bar,

52:36.740 --> 52:38.740
you laughed so hard you almost hit your hand on the floor.

52:38.740 --> 52:40.740
I'll give you a nickel if you give me a dollar,

52:40.740 --> 52:42.740
and then the guy gives me a dollar,

52:42.740 --> 52:44.740
and then the guy starts sucking his dick,

52:44.740 --> 52:46.740
and he goes, what are you doing?

52:46.740 --> 52:48.740
I told you I'd give me a nickel if you give me a dollar.

52:48.740 --> 52:50.740
It's like, a buck for a fucker.

52:50.740 --> 52:52.740
You know, it's like...

52:52.740 --> 52:54.740
There's some like...

52:54.740 --> 52:56.740
There's some like turn of phrase that you're like,

52:56.740 --> 52:58.740
oh, if the whole...

52:58.740 --> 53:00.740
See, that's a good joke.

53:00.740 --> 53:02.740
It's like a craftsmanship.

53:02.740 --> 53:04.740
Because that's called Three's Company.

53:04.740 --> 53:06.740
That's why when Mr. Ropers

53:06.740 --> 53:08.740
like fixing the toilet,

53:08.740 --> 53:10.740
and he thinks he hears Chrissy...

53:10.740 --> 53:12.740
She's talking about a wart that she has.

53:12.740 --> 53:14.740
It was a show called Three's Company.

53:14.740 --> 53:16.740
And Mr. Ropers

53:16.740 --> 53:18.740
plunging the toilet, and he can hear Chrissy

53:18.740 --> 53:20.740
and Jack Tripper...

53:20.740 --> 53:22.740
He never plunged the toilet.

53:22.740 --> 53:24.740
He's dead now.

53:24.740 --> 53:26.740
John Ritter,

53:26.740 --> 53:28.740
National Treasurer, and he's dead now.

53:28.740 --> 53:30.740
Yeah.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.740
Yeah.

53:32.740 --> 53:34.740
You feel as bad as you should.

53:34.740 --> 53:36.740
And he hears her going like,

53:36.740 --> 53:38.740
what? It's so big.

53:38.740 --> 53:40.740
And he thinks she's talking about

53:40.740 --> 53:42.740
like a baby in her stomach.

53:42.740 --> 53:44.740
And he goes, it's so big.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.740
Like his dick, at least.

53:46.740 --> 53:48.740
Well, every episode of Three's Company

53:48.740 --> 53:50.740
was like that. It was like somebody hearing something

53:50.740 --> 53:52.740
and going, it's so big, it won't fit.

53:52.740 --> 53:54.740
And they're like pushing a

53:54.740 --> 53:56.740
box into a thing.

53:56.740 --> 53:58.740
It's so big, I keep pushing it

53:58.740 --> 54:00.740
harder. And then like

54:00.740 --> 54:02.740
someone's in the outside of the room going...

54:02.740 --> 54:04.740
And they're like, oh,

54:04.740 --> 54:06.740
it's so big, I can't...

54:06.740 --> 54:08.740
Well, put some lube

54:08.740 --> 54:10.740
on it.

54:12.740 --> 54:14.740
And that would be the whole episode.

54:14.740 --> 54:16.740
And that's bad writing. That's bad writing.

54:16.740 --> 54:18.740
Because if you're Spanish and you're watching that,

54:18.740 --> 54:20.740
you're like, what is going on?

54:20.740 --> 54:22.740
Why does that apply to this show?

54:22.740 --> 54:24.740
I just go into the room, just go in the room

54:24.740 --> 54:26.740
and confront them about their sexuality.

54:26.740 --> 54:28.740
Yeah, but you...

54:28.740 --> 54:30.740
If you're so concerned with it, stop

54:30.740 --> 54:32.740
looking at the camera.

54:32.740 --> 54:34.740
I understand that.

54:34.740 --> 54:36.740
Go down there and do something about

54:36.740 --> 54:38.740
what you're excited about.

54:38.740 --> 54:40.740
Go talk to them.

54:40.740 --> 54:42.740
Like Mr. Roper thought they were having an abortion.

54:42.740 --> 54:44.740
In the episode where

54:44.740 --> 54:46.740
he's fixing the sink

54:46.740 --> 54:48.740
and that's literally

54:48.740 --> 54:50.740
the truth is the joke of the episode

54:50.740 --> 54:52.740
is that Mr. Roper thought that Chrissy

54:52.740 --> 54:54.740
was going to have an abortion.

54:54.740 --> 54:56.740
Because she's going, oh, it's so big,

54:56.740 --> 54:58.740
it's in my stomach and I can't...

54:58.740 --> 55:00.740
She was talking about a wart and John

55:00.740 --> 55:02.740
Jack Tripper's going, well, I heard

55:02.740 --> 55:04.740
a doctor said if you rub a lemon on it

55:04.740 --> 55:06.740
and Mr. Roper's like...

55:06.740 --> 55:08.740
But he thinks there's human life

55:08.740 --> 55:10.740
at stake and he doesn't intervene.

55:10.740 --> 55:12.740
And that's bad writing.

55:12.740 --> 55:14.740
Because there's California law that says

55:14.740 --> 55:16.740
he's not allowed to enter their apartment.

55:16.740 --> 55:18.740
Well, he shouldn't be listening to them

55:18.740 --> 55:20.740
through their sink.

55:20.740 --> 55:22.740
Because if your comedy is

55:22.740 --> 55:24.740
based on word

55:24.740 --> 55:26.740
and misunderstanding words

55:26.740 --> 55:28.740
it's not good comedy.

55:28.740 --> 55:30.740
It's like, oh, I thought you said fudge.

55:30.740 --> 55:32.740
You said pudge.

55:32.740 --> 55:34.740
That's not funny.

55:34.740 --> 55:36.740
That's not this joke, either.

55:36.740 --> 55:38.740
It is, because the guy's like...

55:38.740 --> 55:40.740
I slipped in a pussy.

55:40.740 --> 55:42.740
No, I thought you said pussy.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.740
You love this, Joker.

55:44.740 --> 55:46.740
I liked it, but now I'm mad at it.

55:46.740 --> 55:48.740
You laughed at the proper telling

55:48.740 --> 55:50.740
of a simple three act play of a joke.

55:50.740 --> 55:52.740
Well, I'm just saying...

55:52.740 --> 55:54.740
You're mad because you're finally not good at something.

55:54.740 --> 55:56.740
Yeah, well, so what?

55:56.740 --> 55:58.740
I'm not good at a dumb thing. It's dumb.

55:58.740 --> 56:00.740
But you want to be able to tell a joke?

56:00.740 --> 56:02.740
No, a guy goes...

56:02.740 --> 56:04.740
A lobster goes into a bar.

56:04.740 --> 56:06.740
A lobster goes, shut up!

56:06.740 --> 56:08.740
I'm going to tell it.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.740
A lobster goes into a bar

56:10.740 --> 56:12.740
and he goes like, can I...

56:12.740 --> 56:14.740
Before he even finishes talking

56:14.740 --> 56:16.740
the bartender goes, get the fuck out of here.

56:16.740 --> 56:18.740
Get out of here!

56:18.740 --> 56:20.740
Get out of here!

56:20.740 --> 56:22.740
And the lobster goes, oh, he's bummed out

56:22.740 --> 56:24.740
and he leaves, and then there's another guy

56:24.740 --> 56:26.740
at the bar who was there before the lobster came in

56:26.740 --> 56:28.740
and he saw the whole thing and he goes

56:28.740 --> 56:30.740
like, what the fuck was that about?

56:30.740 --> 56:32.740
And the bartender goes, he goes, what was that?

56:32.740 --> 56:34.740
What's the history

56:34.740 --> 56:36.740
between you and the...

56:36.740 --> 56:38.740
And the bartender goes,

56:38.740 --> 56:40.740
that guy, he always comes in here

56:40.740 --> 56:42.740
and it's always like this.

56:42.740 --> 56:44.740
And then for you

56:44.740 --> 56:46.740
for you listening it's

56:46.740 --> 56:48.740
he's making a claw

56:48.740 --> 56:50.740
thing.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.740
That was close.

56:52.740 --> 56:54.740
That was an improvement on your version today.

56:54.740 --> 56:56.740
I'm so irritable right now, I feel...

56:56.740 --> 56:58.740
You know when...

56:58.740 --> 57:00.740
It's okay to be bad at something.

57:00.740 --> 57:02.740
You have to be good at everything.

57:02.740 --> 57:04.740
Your attention to detail really

57:04.740 --> 57:06.740
accentuated itself when we went

57:06.740 --> 57:08.740
on the Halloween Haunt ride

57:08.740 --> 57:10.740
Hey Ride

57:10.740 --> 57:12.740
And

57:12.740 --> 57:14.740
you know

57:14.740 --> 57:16.740
it was just a hey ride

57:16.740 --> 57:18.740
and it takes

57:18.740 --> 57:20.740
you through different spooky moments.

57:20.740 --> 57:22.740
But Dan

57:22.740 --> 57:24.740
is like breaking it down.

57:24.740 --> 57:26.740
It takes you through different spooky moments.

57:26.740 --> 57:28.740
He's going through the story circle

57:28.740 --> 57:30.740
of this goddamn ride.

57:30.740 --> 57:32.740
He's like

57:32.740 --> 57:34.740
is that a setup

57:34.740 --> 57:36.740
to that? I'm like, no, it's just spookiness.

57:36.740 --> 57:38.740
But you had to break it down.

57:38.740 --> 57:40.740
No, but nothing was spooking in.

57:40.740 --> 57:42.740
But nothing was...

57:42.740 --> 57:44.740
I'm not dumb.

57:44.740 --> 57:46.740
Like I understood that the hey ride

57:46.740 --> 57:48.740
was taking you through different spooky scenes.

57:48.740 --> 57:50.740
I was thrown

57:50.740 --> 57:52.740
by the tonal incompatibility.

57:52.740 --> 57:54.740
This is not...

57:54.740 --> 57:56.740
I'm not like a logic guy.

57:56.740 --> 57:58.740
I'm saying I was thrown

57:58.740 --> 58:00.740
by the tonal asymmetry

58:00.740 --> 58:02.740
of in the middle

58:02.740 --> 58:04.740
of the Haunted Hey Ride

58:04.740 --> 58:06.740
which was festooned with

58:06.740 --> 58:08.740
verbal goblins

58:08.740 --> 58:10.740
and gimlets and goobas

58:10.740 --> 58:12.740
going like

58:14.740 --> 58:16.740
everyone's going

58:16.740 --> 58:18.740
and then one guy in the middle of it

58:18.740 --> 58:20.740
in what was the most expensive

58:20.740 --> 58:22.740
scene

58:22.740 --> 58:24.740
because there was like a Cadillac

58:24.740 --> 58:26.740
and there was a 60 song, a needle drop playing

58:26.740 --> 58:28.740
like the Supremes were playing

58:28.740 --> 58:30.740
and everyone was speaking English

58:30.740 --> 58:32.740
and it was a period piece.

58:32.740 --> 58:34.740
That's weird because everyone

58:34.740 --> 58:36.740
after it was like I'm Jack Skelling Boober

58:36.740 --> 58:38.740
but they didn't say that.

58:38.740 --> 58:40.740
They weren't speaking English, they were going

58:40.740 --> 58:42.740
goobagoo, goobagoo

58:42.740 --> 58:44.740
and then there was one guy going like

58:44.740 --> 58:46.740
oh hey, oh hey

58:46.740 --> 58:48.740
you didn't see

58:48.740 --> 58:50.740
anything, did ya?

58:50.740 --> 58:52.740
And everyone was like so uncomfortable

58:52.740 --> 58:54.740
because he was like talking to people.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.740
It was also after he shot somebody in the back of the head

58:56.740 --> 58:58.740
in the back of his car.

58:58.740 --> 59:00.740
I think that's what made everyone uncomfortable.

59:00.740 --> 59:02.740
Well yeah, also

59:02.740 --> 59:04.740
not the story logic.

59:04.740 --> 59:06.740
Well because obviously

59:06.740 --> 59:08.740
also society's consciousness

59:08.740 --> 59:10.740
has shifted and you

59:10.740 --> 59:12.740
you'd be dumb to

59:12.740 --> 59:14.740
it's okay to be frustrated by that

59:14.740 --> 59:16.740
but you'd be a fool to not understand that

59:16.740 --> 59:18.740
I was in the cab and I clicked on one of those ads

59:18.740 --> 59:20.740
because

59:20.740 --> 59:22.740
there's a story about the Bloomingdale's

59:22.740 --> 59:24.740
did you guys see the Bloomingdale's ad thing?

59:24.740 --> 59:26.740
Did you guys know? Because it's in the cab.

59:26.740 --> 59:28.740
This is my favorite joke.

59:28.740 --> 59:30.740
It's the Bloomingdale's holiday

59:30.740 --> 59:32.740
catalog. It's obviously

59:32.740 --> 59:34.740
just like a fucking clusterfuck

59:34.740 --> 59:36.740
of corporate

59:36.740 --> 59:38.740
sales teams.

59:38.740 --> 59:40.740
They take a bunch of pictures of

59:40.740 --> 59:42.740
what?

59:42.740 --> 59:44.740
Is this the thing you were jerking off to earlier?

59:44.740 --> 59:46.740
Come on Jeff.

59:46.740 --> 59:48.740
I will tell you guys, I swear to God

59:48.740 --> 59:50.740
tomorrow night I will tell you I'm going to google her tonight

59:50.740 --> 59:52.740
and make sure she's 18.

59:52.740 --> 59:54.740
And then I'll tell you her name.

59:54.740 --> 59:56.740
It's not AT&T

59:56.740 --> 59:58.740
I know that girl

59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.740
and I'm offended on her behalf

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.740
that is a friend of mine

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.740
that lady

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.740
is a human being

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.740
the possibly underage girl

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.740
I'm talking about is from a completely different commercial

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.740
God damn it, why did you

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.740
distract me with that?

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.740
Oh the Bloomingdale's

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.740
he's kind of guy

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.740
he's a robin thick looking guy

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.740
they photograph people at different times

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.740
and they're all against a white backdrop

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.740
and there's like

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.740
someone's job is to put copy

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.740
on every page of the Bloomingdale's catalog

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.740
so it's like there's a lady

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.740
in a champagne glass

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.740
with new pumps going like

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.740
man!

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.740
And it says cheers to

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.740
feeling alive

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.740
somebody's job is just like

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.740
diarrhea words onto a page

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.740
and it's like someone else is taking the picture

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.740
and there's no communication between these departments

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.740
nobody's trying to send a signal

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.740
and then there's like

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.740
a page in the Bloomingdale's catalog

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.740
so it's like a woman

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.740
going

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.740
and she's like excited to be looking at something

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.740
other than what

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.740
anything other than the guy next to her

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.740
and then like three feet from her

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.740
is like this robin thick

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.740
like a stubble guy

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.740
and they're both in kind of like casual

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.740
like business

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:24.740
business holiday party wear

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.740
and the guy's glaring at her

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.740
and

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.740
she's going and the guy that wrote

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.740
the copy or lady

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.740
equals equals

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.740
I'll bet you any money

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.740
like a 50% chance this dumbass was a woman

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.740
um

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.740
whoever wrote the copy

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.740
wrote it's just like it's just this copy

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.740
that's like stylized offset

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.740
sexy copy it's like the picture

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.740
but the problem is

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.740
it's a woman going

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.740
and the copy says

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.740
spike your

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.740
best friend's eggnog when she's not

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.740
looking

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.740
and everybody's like

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.740
what in the

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.740
rape

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.740
are you selling me

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:10.740
what am I

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.740
why am I supposed to buy pants now

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.740
and there's no heroes

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.740
or villains of the story it's just kind of

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.740
interesting it sounds like there's at least

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.740
one villain in this

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.740
I definitely guarantee you

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.740
that nobody thought

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:28.740
this is hilarious because someone's going to have

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.740
non-consensual sex

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.740
I bet you a million dollars

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.740
nobody ever thought that

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.740
I'm sure someone was like

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.740
like I bet that person

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.740
I'll bet you another million dollars

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.740
that the person wasn't looking at the photos

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.740
wasn't looking at those photos

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.740
the person whose job it is to write a bunch of

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.740
copy

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.740
they were just writing garbage

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.740
that they're just going like

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.740
they were told to write 50 things

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.740
that are like naughty

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.740
sexy holiday

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.740
things

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.740

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.740
I don't work in advertising

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.740
I assume it's not that easy

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.740
spitballing

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.740

hang your stockings where you're sex pussy

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.740
the reason I brought it up is

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.740
why did I bring it up

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.740
because we are living in a world

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.740
and I think this is a good thing

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.740
where everybody's hyper focused on this stuff

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.740
and it's like yeah

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.740
what is my point

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.740
I don't know what my point is

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.740
can we tell a couple IO stories

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.740

do you want to tell this one

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.740
or is that too personal

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.740
well what are you going to tell

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.740

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.740
and he goes like

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.740

and

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.740

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.740
and he's like okay

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.740
and he hands me the phone

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.740
and it's

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.740
a woman that I know

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.740
because it's

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.740
someone that

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.740
slept with Dino

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.740
and it's like

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.740
it's a movie

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.740
having sex and I'm like

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.740
that's Rebecca from marketing

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.740
yeah it's a sex movie

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.740
and I thought

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.740
it would be a French

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.740
thing with like Amelie or something

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:18.740
I thought it was

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.740
like a porno on your phone

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.740
that's why I was asking

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:24.740
to be fair I did

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.740
submit it to Cannes

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.740
but

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.740
I thought

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.740
that you thought that I was asking to see

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.740
a movie of you

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.740
making love

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.740
I really thought our friendship reached a level

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.740
that like whoa okay we're going to share

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.740
but I could get a little help

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.740
it's just her

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:46.740
it was directed by Michelle Gondry

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.740
it was a good movie

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.740
it was gorgeous

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.740
Dino

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.740
can we talk about

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.740
your upcoming rendezvous

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.740
on Sunday?

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.740
yeah I don't care

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.740
whatever

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.740
Dino

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.740
has an ability to do things

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.740
that I think we should all aspire to

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.740
I think we

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.740
in moments in your life

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.740
I don't know the story

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.740
this is act one

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.740
this is fade in on the story

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.740
Dino

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.740
has a threesome lined up

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.740
and he showed me photos of one of the girls

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.740
fucking wow

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.740
and like it's going to be

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.740
and she's a nightmare

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.740
and you said that the one that's a nightmare

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.740
is going to be submissive

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.740
to the other girl

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.740
who hates her

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.740
who hates her

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.740
and you said that girl you hate

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.740
you're going to beat you

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.740
and it's going to be

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.740
yeah it's very intricate

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.740
I'm not sure how it's going to work out

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740
it's a math problem

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.740
but these girls aren't pals

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.740
they're not friends

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.740
are they acquaintances?

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.740
yeah they're acquaintances that's how they hate each other

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.740
okay

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.740
can we talk about the fact that you

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.740
there was a point where you

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.740
you were

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.740
seeing a

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.740
sex worker

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.740
it's okay man it's okay

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.740
she was

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.740
she

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.740
and then

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.740
she

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.740
what is happening you okay?

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.740
can we call 911?

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.740
the sex worker was emailing Dino

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.740
and saying

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.740
can you tell it?

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.740
yeah I think so

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.740
Dan you tell it you're going to do this

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.740
this is crazy

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.740
Dan is definitely I'm not a good storyteller

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.740
but I think he's nerdy

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.740
I think I'm a very gifted storyteller

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.740
but I want to get the

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.740
story right

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.740
so the way I remember the story

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.740
is shut up

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.740
I'm sorry

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.740
this is about redemption

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.740
Dino had a relationship

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.740
with a sex person

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.740
well I was dating this girl who was very submissive

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.740
let me tell the story

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.740
she was very submissive to me

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.740
and I was like

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.740
and then I remembered this

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.740
dominatrix who

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.740
wanted to have a baby

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.740
with me and I'm like

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.740
it's the ultimate domination

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.740
yeah

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.740
35 years

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.740
of college tuition

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.740
oh believe me

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.740
so this dominatrix

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.740
cut me off she's like I don't want to see you anymore

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.740
you know

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.740
she got emotionally involved with me

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.740
and so

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.740
I started dating this other girl

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.740
and I said hey would you like to go see a dominatrix with me

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.740
and she said yes

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.740
and I said can I start an email account

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.740
and put your picture on it

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.740
and pretend I'm you

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.740
and

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.740
she lured the dominatrix

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.740
that didn't want to see you anymore

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.740
but wait I'm not

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.740
the worst guy in the world you'll see

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.740
there's that worst person in this story

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.740
he gets worse and everybody gets worse too

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.740
so

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.740
I'll pretend I'm you

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.740
and you're going to say to her

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.740
you want to have

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.740
a threesome with

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.740
her and this other guy

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.740
and you're going to describe someone

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.740
who looks very much like me

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.740
and you say can you get this guy

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.740
like some guy

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.740
like the dominatrix

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.740
it's not any set person

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.740
it's like she's just describing a guy

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.740
that she would like in her fantasies

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.740
and so I start emailing the dominatrix

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.740
because the girl said okay

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.740
and I said ask her

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.740
yeah I'm looking to date this guy

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.740
like a tall kind of

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.740
greasy

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.740
you know

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.740
kind of Italian

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.740
Turkish dancing around the Greek thing

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.740
like

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.740
right around Greece

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.740
right around the

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.740
not Macedonian

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.740
not Moroccan

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.740
do you know anybody like that

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.740
if you hit Malta

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.740
you went too far south

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.740
just something that generally

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.740
feels swarthy

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.740
with a lot of ruins

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.740
I'd like his columnist to be Ionic

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:28.740
so

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.740
that's not, no

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.740
I disapprove

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.740
I thought it was worth a chuckle

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.740
not a plaza, not a bow

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.740
wait now he's leaving

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.740
there was a gunshot

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.740
there was a single gunshot

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.740
and we spent the rest of our lives

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.740
coming

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.740
back

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.740
so I describe myself

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.740
what I think is to a T

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.740
and she says

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.740
she writes me back

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:02.740
but really the girl

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.740
so I just want to

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.740
clarify

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.740
this ain't

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.740
you've got mail kids

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.740
he's typing to

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.740
his former dominatrix

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.740
pretending to be

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.740
a young lady

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.740
with money saying

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.740
I want to fuck an ugly guy

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:24.740
do you know any

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.740
and he's

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.740
the one typing to her

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.740
and the reason why he can't deal with her in person

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.740
is because she wanted to have a baby and you did not

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.740
but I thought maybe

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.740
cause she knew like I'm into experimenting

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.740
and being into threesomes

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.740
so she wrote me back

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.740
immediately and said

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.740
got the perfect guy for you

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.740
sends a picture

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.740
this

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:50.740
opposite of just

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.740
no hairs

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.740
really skinny bald guy

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.740
I'm not saying that's gross

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.740
I know you're making

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.740
a comment that I'm gross

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.740
that guy's from Queens

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.740
I learned from

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.740
you say a specific area and everyone laughs

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.740
that guy's from Queens

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.740
sounds like someone's

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.740
from Manhattan island

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.740
actually

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.740
actually I'm telling

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.740
it in reverse that was the second picture

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.740
the first picture was like a really good looking

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.740
guy really fit and I had to

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:28.740
write back a no he's way too good looking

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.740
I want a

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.740
I want a scummy or

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.740
now Swarthi

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.740
I used Swarthi the first time around

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.740
now it's got to be like

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.740
scummy sleazy just a gross

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.740
kind of out of shape

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.740
guy and then she sends me

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:46.740
the other skinny bald guy and I'm like

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.740
too short

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:50.740
more hair but like

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.740
just an uglier guy

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.740
I got a shit all over myself now

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.740
in order to try and

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.740
pinpoint me

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:00.740
just so the fun can begin

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.740
so I can start having some fun

01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.740
I want his last name to have five syllables

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:10.740
I want him to sound like an invisible creature

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.740
from Sesame Street

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.740
I want him to sound like someone

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.740
only Big Bird could see

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.740
Stemilophagus

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.740
so the third picture

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.740
is me from community

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.740
and I'm like this guy

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.740
is perfect

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.740
and I'm trying to like go at

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.740
LOL and just trying not to

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.740
talk like me

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:44.740
rough

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.740
this guy is great

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.740
doing your best impression of an unhealthy person

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.740
of an idiot

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.740
mustering

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.740
if I could get into the head of a crazy person

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.740
that would be amazing

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.740
are you keeping the girl whose account

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:00.740
you're pretending to be

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.740
she's in Italy at this point

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.740
she said do whatever you want

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.740
that's her turn on

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.740
some people out there

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.740
they get turned on by identity

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.740
they actually

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.740
they go to ATMs

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.740
and they

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.740
they

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.740
they do their

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.740
ATM

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.740
transactions sideways

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.740
they neatly fold their ATM card

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.740
so I say perfect

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.740
perfect perfect

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.740
this guy is perfect

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.740
so

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.740
so then I get an email

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.740
Dino gets an email from the

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.740
Dominatrix saying

01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:44.740
get a load of this

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.740
LOL

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.740
LOL

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.740
literally

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.740
this girl wants

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:54.740
to have a fucking thing with someone like you

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.740
you were the first person I thought of

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.740
LOL

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.740
LOL

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.740
LOL

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:04.740
the tip off to the rip off

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.740
that's really the best ending

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.740
we ended up

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.740
there were a couple little

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.740
oh well I had to

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.740
what was the first encounter

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.740
she didn't say I want to be clear

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.740
there's more because I had to

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.740
she's

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.740
she wrote back to the girl

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.740
me and said

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.740
I'm going to need some money up front

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.740
and I said oh you know

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.740
my car just got towed and everything

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.740
my credit cards

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.740
and she said sure

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.740
and then she wrote Dino me back and said

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.740
this person is asking for cash I think it's a guy

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.740
LOL

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.740
this guy

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.740
this guy doesn't want to give

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.740
I don't think he's going to

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.740
send me cash you know

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.740
I've got an instinct for this kind of thing

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.740
so I

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.740
you know I'm actually at community

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.740
and Ken Jeong walks by

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:56.740
and I'm trying

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.740
I'm trying to write

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.740
on the envelope and like really

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.740
female writing

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.740
and I'm like Ken does that look

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.740
like a woman wrote it and he's like

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.740
what I don't know

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.740
yeah I guess so

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.740
why and I tell him the whole story and he's like

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:14.740
alright you're fucked up man

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.740
LOL

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.740
I love the idea that

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.740
this guy just said like a lady writing

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.740
why

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.740
I told him all this

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.740
did you have a white beard when you finished

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.740
like that's a long

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.740
story yeah

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.740
well like I said I don't know

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.740
LOL

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.740
yeah

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.740
so anyway so I send the letter off

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.740
in a couple days later she writes Dino

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.740
back the dominatrix and says

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.740
good news got

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.740
got the money

01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.740
handwriting looks feminine

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.740
LOL

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.740
swear to god

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.740
speaking of gender

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.740
roles good segue

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.740
is Jane here? is our old friend Jane?

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:00.740
who?

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:02.740
where's Jane?

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.740
Jane are you here? do you want to come up?

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.740
do you have cold feet? do you want to come up?

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:08.740
she's in New York

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.740
and

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.740
uh

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.740
this is Jane

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.740
that brings the earth shine

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.740
and it's a glass blowing

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.740
scientist

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.740
Hi

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.740
how you doing?

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.740
what's up Jane?

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.740
hello

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.740
so I haven't talked to you

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.740
I'm excited to talk to you because

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.740
I'm going to take you through what I understand

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.740
and maybe I'm going to be

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.740
way off base because I'm an idiot

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.740
but there was a period of time

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.740
there where it was like

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.740
originally I was like

01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:52.740
oh you're our friend and you're trans

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.740
and you talk to us

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:56.740
and by the way

01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.740
not to get sidetracked by this

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.740
but you deserve a purple heart for

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.740
all of the role that you've played

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.740
being a good kind person

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.740
and all of my fracas and ups and downs

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.740
with like

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.740
the most

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:12.740
important thing in the world

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.740
just being a good kind

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.740
smart person

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.740
enabled like I think

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.740
listeners of the show especially me

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.740
to like work through the fucking confusing

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.740
morass that we've been living through

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.740
the last eight years of culture

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.740
not to be insensitive

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.740
but um

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.740
I can't believe your first question wasn't

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.740
did you find my story

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.740
a turn on or what

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.740
219 do you know

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.740
room 219

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.740
nice callback

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.740
so Jane

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.740
not just being a person

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.740
who exists in a

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.740
glass cabinet that's our transgender friend

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.740
that could talk about transgender stuff

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.740
actually has her own life

01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.740
where you're like some kind of like

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.740
James Bond of glass blowing

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.740
where

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:04.740
you developed new ways to blow glass

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.740
and stuff and we're a local hero

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.740
in your own industry and community

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:10.740
right?

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.740
okay

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.740
you can go there if we want to

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.740
so there was a point

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.740
you had been on the show a couple times

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.740
we talked frankly and probably

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.740
ignorantly about

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.740
this emerging

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:26.740
sensitively and with great questions

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:28.740
I'll get it

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.740
and then there's me

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.740
we've never talked before

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.740
219

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.740
where you were succeeding

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:38.740
just as a professional

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.740
as a scientist you were succeeding

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.740
I remember

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.740
just something about what you were tweeting

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.740
and what you were saying made me think

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.740
that there was something happening

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.740
that was like a challenge and you balancing

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.740
your professional life

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.740
with your transition

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.740
it's a very common thing

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:58.740
that has to happen

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.740
because a transition

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:02.740
it's a transition

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.740
it's a time thing

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.740
and when you're in between

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.740
I'm in between

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.740
make some choices

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.740
about

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.740
where are you going to be

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.740
who you are and where are you going to be who you were

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:18.740
because every single

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.740
tax form

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.740
bathroom, sign

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.740
everything is based on

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.740
you exist within a culture

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.740
and that culture makes

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.740
certain demands on

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.740
what we talked about in Toronto last year about

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.740
society is a system

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.740
and systems are all about reducing energy

01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.740
expenditure

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.740
in order to...

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.740
you heard it, system

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.740
system, I hate systems

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.740
I hate system

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.740
you're about reducing energy piece of shit

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.740
what's that, James?

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.740
I agree

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.740
system's not here, system doesn't listen to this fucking show

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.740
people listen to this fucking show

01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.740
yes

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.740
systems run in

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.740
fear of this show

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.740
and Hispanic people

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.740
I don't know why

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.740
that's not my choice

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.740
the idea of

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.740
the idea of Harmontown

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.740
some of the original conceit about

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.740
is it going to be 100 people, is it going to be 300 people

01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:18.740
are they all going to be up at Moon Moon or VIP Moon

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:20.740
are you going to have enough people for you to go to the

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.740
Dock O'Cart?

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:24.740
you mean that premise that we ditched three episodes in?

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:26.740
but that we all hold too very dearly

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.740
going back to it because I hate everybody

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.740
but that idea

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.740
people that are Harmontown fans

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.740
still

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:36.740
I think we all agree on the idea

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.740
that we all connect

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:40.740
the possibility of something better

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.740
whatever that might be

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:44.740
and I think a lot of it is that it's system free

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.740
I mean it's the idea that

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.740
don't be a dick, give more than you take

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.740
that

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.740
there's a point where if you get the number

01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.740
of people down small enough

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.740
you can exist without a system, you can have

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.740
a communal type of governance going on

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.740
an anarchal type of governance going on

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.740
but you get to a certain size

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.740
you get to a certain point where

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.740
you have to start dealing with the lowest common

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.740
denominators

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.740
who are going to drag things down

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.740
you have rules to accommodate for people

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.740
who aren't going to fit and who are going to be dicks

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:16.740
and

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.740
that's where laws come in

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.740
laws are about reducing

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.740
not because any individual is that dumb

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.740
but because in mass

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:26.740
we effectively become that dumb

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.740
statistics start to take over

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.740
and people are allowed to drop down

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.740
Jane, where do you

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:34.740
aside from the fact that you do nothing

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.740
but interesting stuff and make fantastic booze

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.740
that you give me

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.740
she makes fucking earth shine

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:42.740
that will wipe you out

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:44.740
Do you guys see the stuff backstage?

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.740
Oh my lord

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.740
Do you guys know about it?

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.740
Let's bring it out

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.740
Wow, I think

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.740
the feds are going to be honest in a minute

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:56.740
Oh, there it is

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.740
So

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.740
this is something new

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.740
this is something new and shout out to Jenna

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.740
Dustin was hoarding it

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:06.740
Shout out to Jenna

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.740
This is Falconer's Blend

01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.740
Who's under Falconer?

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.740
On Twitter

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.740
something gal said

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.740
So Jenna is now the official Falconer

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.740
of Harmontown

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:20.740
If I hold my wrist up

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.740
with a Falcon land on my arm right now

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.740
It's a hawk, she's got a hawk

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.740
and a Kendrick, which is awesome

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.740
So

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.740
Jenna is a homesteader

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.740
up in the Adirondacks

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.740
She lives alone and is trying to make it

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.740
as a farmer

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.740
She's got sheep, she's got pigs

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.740
She's got a hawk

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.740
So that's authentic transgender whiskey

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:44.740
Trans-Asterisk

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.740
Before we go any further

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.740
We have a hard-out at 8.30

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.740
That's two minutes away

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.740
Oh shit, fuck

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.740
Yeah, I can't

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.740
Fuck you, Bill Burr

01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.740
I can't believe I wasted

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.740
time on that dumb joke

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:02.740
Alright, well, Gene

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.740
Like I said, what's going on with you

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.740
because it's near you

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:08.740
Hey, Gene, what's the goal?

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.740
My question was like

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.740
If transitional

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.740
I'm ignorant as it can possibly be

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.740
If you're going through a transition

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.740
What stage do you think you're at

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.740
and what do you think is at the end

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.740
So if

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.740
30 years ago, so I'm 51

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.740
You and I are the older ones

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.740
I think we're the oldest people in town

01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.740
Oh shit, the trans don't crack

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.740
But

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.740
The

01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.740
So 30

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.740
30 years ago, the goal was

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.740
totally femme

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.740
I wanted to be Madonna 30 years ago

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.740
Who did

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.740
Yeah, who doesn't

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.740
I'm still trying

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.740
But you know

01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.740
That was the first video I masturbated to

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.740
One minute

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.740
People's focus changes

01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.740
Your goals change, your comfort changes

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740
And I've found actually

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.740
that where I'm sitting about right now

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.740
Hello

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.740
Is actually really a comfortable spot

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.740
I have a huge

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.740
huge number of people that I know

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.740
that I work with every day at my job

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.740
who know me as Gene

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.740
I have lots of friends online

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.740
who know me as Gene

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.740
who

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.740
I am accepted

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.740
for who I am

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.740
Even though I don't have

01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:28.740
I haven't had bottom half surgery

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.740
I'm not wearing women's clothes

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.740
I think that's bullshit, because I'm not

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.740
Gramercy Theater so much, I mean we have to leave

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.740
We're so set

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.740
Let's all hang out backstage and drink

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.740
Gene's wonderful moonshine

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.740
Hey Jane, will you come back tomorrow?

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.740
Let's thank Dino Stamatopolous

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:48.740
Can you come back tomorrow?

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:50.740
Jane Cook

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.740
Everybody here at the Grammarcy

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.740
More importantly

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.740
All of the heroes

01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.740
Who brought me alcohol throughout this show

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.740
I owe you all drinks and tenfold

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.740
Take it all your way stuff

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:06.740
Make sure to go to your bar

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.740
Tip these people and make them senseless with money

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.740
We'll see you next time everybody

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.740
Drive fast and take chances

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.740
Everyone escape your dichotomy tonight

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.740
You fucking assholes

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.740
Stop thinking you're one thing or another

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.740
And be whoever you are

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.740
Did you sing that? Make me sexy

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.740
Ershine Jane

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.740
Jane

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.740
Come back tomorrow night

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.740
It's a different show

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:44.740
There's actually believe it or not no script

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.740
So it's a different show

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.740
Come back tomorrow

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.740
Did you get any of that?

01:28:52.740 --> 01:29:04.740
It's a different show
