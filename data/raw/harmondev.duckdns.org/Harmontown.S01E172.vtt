{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:14.000\nHello, Gramercy Theater, the New York Comedy Festival!\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:20.000\nI have a very good feeling about this.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:26.000\nLadies and gentlemen, from New York City, in the great state of New York, Harmontown\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:32.000\nis now in session.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:46.000\nLet's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:56.000\nYeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:06.000\nJeff, you wanted a...\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:08.000\nThat makes it...\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:09.000\nThank you, Arturo.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nDo I owe you money, Arturo?\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:17.000\nI'm being surfaced with gifts right now.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:22.000\nYeah, Agent, this is a real pad, not your Nintendo bullshit.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:30.000\nHello, New York, thank you so much for...\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:34.000\nIt couldn't be happier, you're wonderful people, I hope you're very...\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nI hope you're comfortable, and I just...\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:39.000\nWe're so honored and flattered, particularly...\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nWe're sold out tonight and we're sold out tomorrow night,\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nand I hope that...\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.000\nHe's really, really, really...\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nI mean, you know, it's crazy.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nThis theater is cool, the Ramones play here?\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:52.000\nThis place is sexy as hell.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.000\nYeah, well, every time...\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nYeah, we've never had a bad experience in New York, so let's...\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nIt's time to break that pad.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nThat shinks it.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.000\nBut it's obviously flattering, it's the capital of the world, you know?\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:11.000\nSo when they're excited that you're coming to visit them, it feels legitimizing.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:14.000\nWe're very happy that people like us in Los Angeles, but let's face it,\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nthose people are fucking nincompoops.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nLike, they don't know what they're doing, they're crazy people.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nThey are from the Midwest and they go out to a desert and they draw things\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nand they expect to get paid for it.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\nYou guys are like fucking dealing with reality.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nLike, 9-Eleven's happening over your shoulder.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:37.000\nAnd you're like, yeah, but still, Dan Harmon showing up would be good.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.000\nAnd that's a huge compliment.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nBecause like, getting to work without being stabbed is a big deal for you guys.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nAnd also, like, there's cats going on.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nYou have shows.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nYou mean the play cats?\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:53.000\nIn LA, you can't...\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nCats closing like 89, dude.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:56.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nIf they said they wanted it back, they'd make more cats.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'm gonna guess, I swear to God, I bet I'm right.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nI bet there's a night writer show on Broadway right now.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:10.000\nBecause if they want it, so be it.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:13.000\nThere's a Spider-Man who's dangling all over the place.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nThere's a Harry Potter show on Broadway.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:18.000\nThese guys, what I'm saying is, they can do whatever they want.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:24.000\nAnd so a hug from you really is twice as valuable as everyone that we've ever said we liked.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nI really, like, you guys are...\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nWe've sucked Portland's dick.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nWe've been to Austin and we've said, this is the best town in the world.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:39.000\nHonestly, I hope those people aren't listening right now, but it's all been a lie.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nEven in our own home.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nWe don't like those people as much as we like you.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nYou guys are good, good, good, good people.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nSo thank you.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nGlad we got that out of the way.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nNow onto the show, which we don't have.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:53.000\nThere's no show.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nI don't know.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:55.000\nWe've never had a show.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nWe tried to have a show for the first three Harmontowns before we recorded it.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nWe tried to think about guests and what we're gonna do, and then we just said, fuck it, let's just get drunk.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:04.000\nI did scribble some notes.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nI got some notes.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:06.000\nOh, shit.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:07.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nAll right, so I try to understand that...\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:13.000\nI...\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nOkay, applause for the...\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nHe has the speech impediment.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nNo, it's true.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nI thought you thought that was CG.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nNow you're in there, you're singing.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nOh, he really...\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nHe's like, it's the king speech.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nIt's like, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nOh, it's really cool.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nI can see his lips flapping.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:36.000\nYou all thought that Ferro Audio edited and then like remixed his...\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nYou're singing, it's a real thing.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nDo you believe in life?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nNo, it's real.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nAnd...\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nWe also auto-tune.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nI, I, I...\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nI, I...\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nAre you stuck?\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nNo, I'm...\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nOkay.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nNow when I do it, I know I'm hearing it and it's...\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nI know, you don't, don't apologize.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nThat's beautiful.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nAnd that's another thing about New York.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nBy the way, have we talked about this?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nNew York is the nicest fucking town.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nEveryone had...\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nHere's what nice it is.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nI came out and plugged in my, my iPod or a phone, whatever you call it,\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nand a dude brought me drinks.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nIt's the best place in the world.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nIt's, well, because it makes sense.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nIf you told somebody from Mars you'd go,\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nguess which is the most polite city?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nDo you think it's the one where everyone's stacked on top of each other?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nAnd, and, and that if the lights go out,\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nthey're five seconds from cannibalism?\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\nLike, do you think those people know their P's and Q's?\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nThe, the Martian would go,\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nyeah, I would bet my money on that.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nI would think that the people in Nebraska would turn out to be racist.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:40.000\nWhat was the year when the lights all went out\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:45.000\nand everybody had a million babies?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nOkay, it was the 70s though.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\n77.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\n77 this guy says.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\n2003 too?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nNo, that was...\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.000\nYeah, well...\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nWhy do the lights keep going out in this fucking city?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nBecause they need power to do what they do.\n\n05:58.000 --> 05:59.000\nThey're, they're wonderful people.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nThe lights are controlled by big condom.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:06.000\nWell, there was that night that, yeah, it was like...\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nBut who is him for that matter?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nWhatever.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nBut, but, but, but honestly, like nicer people here, nicer encounters\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:20.000\nbecause everyone has to be, well, more versed in politeness.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nIt's a big...\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\nA guy on the third row said, fuck you.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nIt's their first night here.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nShe's fucked her.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nShe's from Austin.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\nShe's from Austin, Texas.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nBut you know what?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nWe love her here and we accept her.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:39.000\nAnd she could be the senator of New York tomorrow if we, if we so chose.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:40.000\nSenators.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nOkay, so I'm just looking at my notes and I just, okay, I'm trying to...\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nSo I, on the plane, I spilled some chili on my shirt.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nYou had chili on the plane?\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nAnd I found out...\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nWhat plate serves chili?\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:59.000\nJet Blue, if you need to know.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.000\nChili?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nI'm just expressing incredulity.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nWell, it's not like a big pot of it.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nIt looks like a guy going...\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nWoo-hoo!\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nWho, who watched Moon Kid?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nLike, oh, crawdad coming out.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nIt was, it still gets distracted by Jet Blue's menu.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:20.000\nI spilled some shit on my shirt and, and I, and I was like, oh shit.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nAnd I only brought one shirt for five days for...\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nBecause you're a professional.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nSo it's like, once it, once there's chili on it, it's like there's chili on it the whole\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\ntime.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\nAnd so I was like, oh man.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd then, and then Dino said, put some salt on it.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:41.000\nAnd then, and then, and I, and I, I took some salt and I put it on it and I started rubbing\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:46.000\nand it, like, I guess you guys probably can see that it probably didn't all go away.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:49.000\nBut there was chili all over my shirt.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nAnd it worked.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd, and I was like scrubbing.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nI'm like, oh, is that the abrasion?\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nAnd then I was talking to Jeff about it.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nAnd he's like, oh, that's why soda water works.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:03.000\nAnd I was like, soda, sodium?\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:10.000\nI didn't know that for 42 years.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nSodium, soda water.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nIt's very exciting.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nIt's super exciting.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:25.000\nLike a little club soda will get that out because it has salt in it, because the ions, like\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nthey want, they are hungry for chili.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nBut didn't, didn't they?\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:33.000\nIt's just like, it's exciting to learn things.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nDidn't you learn this in the same table at the same restaurant where you've had other\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nepiphanies about stuff that you didn't use to know?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nWell, about the courtesy flesh.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nWell, okay.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nAll right.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nSo thank you.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nSo, so we could call this a segment.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:47.000\nDo you want to give it a theme song?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:48.000\nJust...\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:53.000\nI didn't bring my iPad.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nWe're limited tonight.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nWell, this is stuff, this is stuff that I've learned at 42.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nI'm going to turn that down a bit.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nDo you want to...\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nBecause it is kind of exciting.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nAnd there's, and there's two more.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nOh yeah.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nSo do you want to give it a theme song for real?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:16.000\nDan Harmon learning things that he should have learned when he was a little younger.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nSee, the crowd has gone wild.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nYeah.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nThey're being very nice.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nI thought that was terrible.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:27.000\nI think if we come to a different city, we should...\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nDan Harmon is the world's coolest guy.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:35.000\nBut what is it?\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nWhat is that?\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nThat song is a wall of...\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nI know.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nAgain, it's a real...\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nI think it's our friend, Titanic's and Claire.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nWell, no, I'm not questioning his talent.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nI'm just like, that song is just a wall of sand.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nI know.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nI try to turn it down.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nIt's very loud.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nWell, it's not about lowering the volume.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nIt's about picking a song that has a...\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nHold your horses.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nA beginning.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nI'm going to pick another...\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nOkay.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nReady?\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nWhat's the segment called?\n\n09:58.000 --> 09:59.000\nYou pick a title.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nDan Harmon...\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nNo, you know what?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:10.000\nIt's not about me.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:18.000\nSometimes you learn things even though you've been alive for 40 years.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:23.000\nIt's not too late to learn.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nMammals' brains harden.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:31.000\nThat's why sometimes you have a kitten that fetches and then you tell your friends, my\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:37.000\ncat plays fetch and then the cat doesn't fetch anymore because its brain gets hard.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:44.000\nAnd that's most mammals, but Ben Franklin was 75 going out in the rain and like, what\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nwill happen?\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:56.000\nBecause we are eternally children and our brains are soft and that's also results in\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nracism and...\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nThat's been our show.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nThanks for coming.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nRape and murder.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nDrive safely.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nBut we're eternally at play.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:09.600\nWe're like, well, what would happen if I hated that guy because he's black?\n\n11:09.600 --> 11:12.600\nBut also what would happen if I flew a kite in the rain?\n\n11:12.600 --> 11:20.000\nHey, if you like these lights, maybe you should hate black people.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:24.000\nShould that segment's theme song have its own segment theme song?\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nYeah.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nNo, that would be...\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nThat went wrong.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:32.480\nI'm going to assume Ben Franklin was racist because he didn't know any better.\n\n11:32.480 --> 11:37.320\nBut that, you know, if you're black and you're listening and you like electricity, don't\n\n11:37.320 --> 11:40.720\nbe conflicted.\n\n11:40.720 --> 11:44.040\nThere's room in the world for all of us and there's not...\n\n11:44.040 --> 11:45.600\nI don't think we should accept...\n\n11:45.600 --> 11:52.280\nI think I implied that if you like electricity, you should hate black people and that's not\n\n11:52.280 --> 11:54.840\nthe case at all.\n\n11:54.840 --> 11:56.040\nThe opposite is the case.\n\n11:56.040 --> 11:58.120\nIf you like electricity, you should love...\n\n11:58.120 --> 12:01.200\nWell, you shouldn't love anybody because of their color.\n\n12:01.200 --> 12:04.640\nThat would be as racist as if you hated them.\n\n12:04.640 --> 12:06.800\nAnd you guys are from New York.\n\n12:06.800 --> 12:08.160\nYou know this.\n\n12:08.160 --> 12:11.560\nDon't love people because of the color of their skin.\n\n12:11.560 --> 12:13.720\nThat's fucked up.\n\n12:13.720 --> 12:19.480\nLike there are bad people who are different skin-wise.\n\n12:19.480 --> 12:23.400\nAnd if you just love them for their skin, you're a racist.\n\n12:23.400 --> 12:27.840\nAnd you will pay the price because they'll come to your house and go, hi, I'm purple\n\n12:27.840 --> 12:29.920\nand everyone hates me.\n\n12:29.920 --> 12:34.440\nAnd I come in your house and you'll be like, oh, no, I love purple people.\n\n12:34.440 --> 12:41.800\nAnd then he's like, stab, stab, like you deserved it.\n\n12:41.800 --> 12:48.200\nAre you running for the Republican nomination right now?\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:52.600\nBecause you're making a hell of a lot of sense over there.\n\n12:52.600 --> 12:53.600\nAll right.\n\n12:53.600 --> 12:54.600\nWell, you know what?\n\n12:54.600 --> 12:57.440\nI'm saying what they're thinking.\n\n12:57.440 --> 12:58.440\nIs that guy going to win?\n\n12:58.440 --> 12:59.440\nHe's not going to win.\n\n12:59.440 --> 13:00.440\nOkay.\n\n13:00.440 --> 13:01.440\nAll right.\n\n13:01.440 --> 13:02.440\nLet's talk about that later.\n\n13:02.440 --> 13:03.440\nOkay.\n\n13:03.440 --> 13:05.600\nIs that the salt and the sodium?\n\n13:05.600 --> 13:07.680\nSo we're in the segment.\n\n13:07.680 --> 13:08.680\nHe's on target.\n\n13:08.680 --> 13:10.440\nHe'll never lose the target.\n\n13:10.440 --> 13:13.240\nI get a little drunk when I come to New York.\n\n13:13.240 --> 13:16.160\nJust two more things about me learning things when I'm 40.\n\n13:16.160 --> 13:19.160\nSo 42.\n\n13:19.160 --> 13:21.080\nThe soda is sodium.\n\n13:21.080 --> 13:22.280\nHere's the new one.\n\n13:22.280 --> 13:24.120\nYou brought up courtesy flush.\n\n13:24.120 --> 13:27.560\nSo I never knew what courtesy flush meant.\n\n13:27.560 --> 13:31.440\nI always thought it meant you poop and then you flush twice.\n\n13:31.440 --> 13:35.440\nI was like, how is that a courtesy to anyone?\n\n13:35.440 --> 13:40.920\nI never, I was like, do they mean like, because there's poop flakes in the water?\n\n13:40.920 --> 13:42.800\nThat's a courtesy?\n\n13:42.800 --> 13:46.640\nIf you poop and then what you see in the toilet.\n\n13:46.640 --> 13:50.800\nThis one goes out to the ladies in the house.\n\n13:50.800 --> 13:54.400\nIf what you see demands a second flush, that's not a courtesy.\n\n13:54.400 --> 13:55.640\nThat's gross.\n\n13:55.640 --> 14:00.760\nAnd you should hate yourself and flush second time because there's extra poop because your\n\n14:00.760 --> 14:03.800\nbutt has more poop than a toilet.\n\n14:03.800 --> 14:05.800\nThat's what I thought courtesy flush meant.\n\n14:05.800 --> 14:10.760\nCourtesy flush, as you already know, and I just learned, it means halfway through your\n\n14:10.760 --> 14:20.760\npoop, you reach back and flush your poopus while you're still pooping.\n\n14:20.760 --> 14:21.760\nI didn't know that.\n\n14:21.760 --> 14:22.760\nI just learned that.\n\n14:22.760 --> 14:27.560\nAnd I had to come to New York to learn that because New York has no, like, space.\n\n14:27.560 --> 14:29.280\nYou guys could have gone and seen Hamilton tonight.\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:33.000\nYou could have gone and, we're learning shit here at the Gramercy.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.080\nBecause every place here, it's like, you know, it's a three foot bathroom.\n\n14:36.080 --> 14:38.120\nMatt Dan, have you put the courtesy flush into play?\n\n14:38.120 --> 14:39.120\nHave you used that now?\n\n14:39.120 --> 14:40.120\nNo, I haven't done it yet.\n\n14:40.120 --> 14:44.760\nI'd safe to say at this age, I don't think I'll learn that habit.\n\n14:44.760 --> 14:49.000\nBut I'm still, I'm very charmed by the concept.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.720\nOkay, one more thing, and then we're done with this segment.\n\n14:53.720 --> 14:58.200\nSo here's, okay, so this is going to blow your fucking mind.\n\n14:58.200 --> 15:00.440\nBuckle your holy shit belts, everybody.\n\n15:00.440 --> 15:03.120\nI just found this out in the Rick and Morty writer's room.\n\n15:03.120 --> 15:06.600\nSo I'm not even sure how to, yeah, thank you, thank you, kids, thank you.\n\n15:06.600 --> 15:07.600\nYeah.\n\n15:07.600 --> 15:08.600\nYeah.\n\n15:08.600 --> 15:09.600\nOh, we're...\n\n15:09.600 --> 15:10.600\nYeah.\n\n15:10.600 --> 15:12.600\nThese people love writer's rooms.\n\n15:12.600 --> 15:17.520\nYeah, we're in that writer's room, we're working it up.\n\n15:17.520 --> 15:20.400\nYou guys are mostly topless, you guys are shirts off most of the time on that writer's\n\n15:20.400 --> 15:21.400\nroom.\n\n15:21.400 --> 15:22.400\nSure, whatever.\n\n15:22.400 --> 15:23.400\nYeah.\n\n15:23.400 --> 15:26.200\nOkay, so this is fucking insane to me.\n\n15:26.200 --> 15:28.360\nI don't, okay, so...\n\n15:28.360 --> 15:30.840\nI have no idea where this is going.\n\n15:30.840 --> 15:39.800\nOkay, so you guys know the catch phrase, nobody puts baby in the corner, in a corner, right?\n\n15:39.800 --> 15:56.000\nSo for the last five, eight years, like, I thought that line was from the movie Million\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:02.400\nDollar Baby.\n\n16:02.400 --> 16:04.320\nShe was in the corner a lot of that movie.\n\n16:04.320 --> 16:05.320\nIt makes sense.\n\n16:05.320 --> 16:06.320\nI've never seen the movie.\n\n16:06.320 --> 16:07.320\nPart of being a biker.\n\n16:07.320 --> 16:13.760\nI know that Clint Eastwood teaches a Million Dollar Baby to fight.\n\n16:13.760 --> 16:16.560\nAnd spoilers, I've never seen the movie.\n\n16:16.560 --> 16:21.280\nI know she gets put in a corner and dies.\n\n16:21.280 --> 16:22.280\nI know that.\n\n16:22.280 --> 16:30.000\nI also know how death of a salesman ends, but I, like, I, because I have two reasons.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:35.440\nAnd when I walk you through this, you're going to go, Dan, I forgive you, and I'm actually\n\n16:35.440 --> 16:38.920\nkind of mad at a society that did this to you.\n\n16:38.920 --> 16:45.120\nThe first thing is, I think this is just a distortion of my perception, because apparently\n\n16:45.120 --> 16:51.160\nthat line is from Dirty Dancing, which I've seen the one and a half times that we've all\n\n16:51.160 --> 16:52.160\nseen it.\n\n16:52.160 --> 16:56.360\nThe first time through when you're trying to impress someone, and the half time when\n\n16:56.360 --> 17:00.560\nyou just fall asleep and you're hoping it holds up.\n\n17:00.560 --> 17:06.800\nAbsolutely apropos of absolutely nothing, Patrick Swayze walks up to Jennifer Gray and\n\n17:06.800 --> 17:09.840\nsays, nobody puts baby in the corner.\n\n17:09.840 --> 17:11.440\nIsn't her dad that says that?\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:13.240\nHer father says it about her.\n\n17:13.240 --> 17:14.240\nOh, all right.\n\n17:14.240 --> 17:15.240\nThe plot thickens.\n\n17:15.240 --> 17:16.240\nThe plot thickens.\n\n17:16.240 --> 17:17.240\nOkay.\n\n17:17.240 --> 17:18.240\nYou know what?\n\n17:18.240 --> 17:20.240\nGarbage movie, by the way.\n\n17:20.240 --> 17:22.560\nHer dad says it about her.\n\n17:22.560 --> 17:25.880\nSwayze says it about her, too, her dad.\n\n17:25.880 --> 17:28.960\nI'm so glad we got this fucking sorted.\n\n17:28.960 --> 17:33.880\nDrinks around the house, bar.\n\n17:33.880 --> 17:41.120\nI think her dad says in the movie, he says, I don't want you dancing with that dirty dancer.\n\n17:41.120 --> 17:42.120\nGo in the corner.\n\n17:42.120 --> 17:46.760\nAnd then he goes over to her and he goes, I'm sorry, nobody puts baby in the corner.\n\n17:46.760 --> 17:49.560\nBy the way, your name's baby.\n\n17:49.560 --> 17:50.560\nGet out of the corner.\n\n17:50.560 --> 17:55.440\nSo here's the thing, I saw that movie, I don't remember that line, I don't think it was a\n\n17:55.440 --> 17:56.440\nbig deal.\n\n17:56.440 --> 18:00.320\nIt was like Macaulay Culkin going like this, it's not like the point in the movie, this\n\n18:00.320 --> 18:05.120\nis great, it's a dumb movie and that's just another dumb part of it, right?\n\n18:05.120 --> 18:06.120\nNo, it was a great movie.\n\n18:06.120 --> 18:09.320\nDid anyone here write dirty dancing?\n\n18:09.320 --> 18:10.320\nYou did?\n\n18:10.320 --> 18:11.320\nOkay.\n\n18:11.320 --> 18:13.320\nThese guys wrote it.\n\n18:13.320 --> 18:14.320\nIt's a dumb movie.\n\n18:14.320 --> 18:16.520\nThese two 24-year-olds wrote dirty dancing.\n\n18:16.520 --> 18:22.400\nIt's a dumb movie and honestly, anyone who wants to challenge me on that, I will ‑‑ like\n\n18:22.400 --> 18:23.400\nI usually ‑‑\n\n18:23.400 --> 18:28.080\nWho here is strong enough to do the lift and have Dan go up like Jennifer Gray?\n\n18:28.080 --> 18:30.160\nDo we have somebody strong enough to do the lift?\n\n18:30.160 --> 18:31.680\nNo, we're going to do that down this aisle.\n\n18:31.680 --> 18:36.320\nWe're going to end the show with somebody doing the dirty dancing lift and going down\n\n18:36.320 --> 18:38.520\nthe aisle.\n\n18:38.520 --> 18:40.280\nSo here's the other thing that happened.\n\n18:40.280 --> 18:43.080\nRemember this is the end with Seth Rogen?\n\n18:43.080 --> 18:48.600\nSo his buddy in the movie is in that million dollar baby movie, right?\n\n18:48.600 --> 18:53.320\nSo in the movie, Seth Rogen says to his friend, he says, I don't know, I don't know, I don't\n\n18:53.320 --> 18:54.320\nknow.\n\n18:54.320 --> 18:57.160\nHe says nobody puts baby in the corner and the guy kind of chuckles.\n\n18:57.160 --> 19:01.200\nLike it's his way of seducing his friend into going to the Hollywood party.\n\n19:01.200 --> 19:06.120\nAnd like so that guy was in million dollar baby and then Seth does that joke.\n\n19:06.120 --> 19:09.960\nAnd so I ‑‑ that's what ‑‑\n\n19:09.960 --> 19:12.240\nWhat was that guy in million dollar baby?\n\n19:12.240 --> 19:13.240\nWasn't he in that movie?\n\n19:13.240 --> 19:14.240\nI don't ‑‑\n\n19:14.240 --> 19:15.240\nOkay.\n\n19:15.240 --> 19:16.240\nWell, I haven't seen it.\n\n19:16.240 --> 19:22.600\nI may have also made that up because I haven't seen the movie so ‑‑ so I picture Colleen\n\n19:22.600 --> 19:27.800\nEastwood teaching Hillary Swank how to box and then that guy is like, hey, I love being\n\n19:27.800 --> 19:29.920\nin the corner.\n\n19:29.920 --> 19:31.920\nLet's move on.\n\n19:31.920 --> 19:34.480\nBut it's just ‑‑ I thought you'd enjoy that.\n\n19:34.480 --> 19:35.720\nYou can learn things after ‑‑\n\n19:35.720 --> 19:38.280\nYou promised that Mayans would be blown and I think you proved it.\n\n19:38.280 --> 19:39.280\nI think ‑‑\n\n19:39.280 --> 19:40.280\nYeah, no, I think ‑‑\n\n19:40.280 --> 19:45.040\nYeah, I thought ‑‑ every time someone said nobody puts baby in the corner, I've\n\n19:45.040 --> 19:51.000\nalways pictured Colleen Eastwood talking to Hillary Swank on a hospital bed.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:55.440\nI never pictured Patrick Swayze talking to him.\n\n19:55.440 --> 19:58.520\nWhat if he said that in that movie but he was referencing Dirty Dancing?\n\n19:58.520 --> 19:59.520\nYeah.\n\n19:59.520 --> 20:09.520\nOh, by the way, both movies, garbage.\n\n20:09.520 --> 20:10.520\nYou know?\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:11.520\nDirty Dancing is a game.\n\n20:11.520 --> 20:15.840\nDirty Dancing tackles abortion and tackles ‑‑\n\n20:15.840 --> 20:18.440\nI wrote 28 percent of Monster House.\n\n20:18.440 --> 20:24.920\nSo if I tell you a movie is bad, you fucking listen to me.\n\n20:24.920 --> 20:25.920\nOkay.\n\n20:25.920 --> 20:30.480\nSo I was masturbating today in the hotel room.\n\n20:30.480 --> 20:31.480\nAnd I ‑‑\n\n20:31.480 --> 20:32.960\nThis is how most of Dan's stories start, by the way.\n\n20:32.960 --> 20:35.080\nAnd I had a conference call.\n\n20:35.080 --> 20:37.080\nI was like ‑‑\n\n20:37.080 --> 20:39.760\nIs that why you started masturbating?\n\n20:39.760 --> 20:48.320\nI was in the bed and I was like ‑‑ I want to masturbate and I thought of the person\n\n20:48.320 --> 20:56.640\nthat I wanted to masturbate to and Hillary Swank and I Googled around and I found the\n\n20:56.640 --> 21:00.360\nimage and I was like, okay, I'm going to ‑‑ okay, I'm masturbating.\n\n21:00.360 --> 21:04.640\nAnd then there was a conference call and I was like, okay, but I'm going to masturbate\n\n21:04.640 --> 21:09.240\nfor five minutes and then I'll get on the conference call.\n\n21:09.240 --> 21:13.280\nBut then they changed the dial in number.\n\n21:13.280 --> 21:20.080\nSo then I was masturbating and there was like an intern calling me and she was on the phone\n\n21:20.080 --> 21:25.040\nand she was going, hey, we changed the dial in number and I was like, I had literally\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:34.000\nmy penis in my hand and I was like, okay, well, can you ‑‑ okay, what's the ‑‑ she's\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:39.760\nlike, I'll e‑mail it to you, okay, but I don't really have a point in the story.\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:47.480\nWhat it made me think of was she didn't know I was ‑‑ she didn't know she was talking\n\n21:47.480 --> 21:52.280\nto a man that was like doing this ‑‑ I think if you're a woman and you call a man,\n\n21:52.280 --> 21:55.200\nyou should just have that assumption already in your head.\n\n21:55.200 --> 21:58.600\nThat's ‑‑ the guy is very likely the guy is jerking off on that call.\n\n21:58.600 --> 22:05.280\nBut when Erin ‑‑ my former wife, she worked at 1‑800 Dentist, she would say\n\n22:05.280 --> 22:11.280\nshe said a big part of her job was you would answer the phone and go 1‑800 Dentist and\n\n22:11.280 --> 22:23.280\nthen the guy would go, yeah, I want to get a dentist and a ‑‑ a dentist real bad.\n\n22:23.280 --> 22:28.400\nOkay, sir, do you ‑‑ do you have an insurance provider?\n\n22:28.400 --> 22:29.400\nWhat?\n\n22:29.400 --> 22:35.160\nAnd it was like a big part of her job, it was like a prevalent thing.\n\n22:35.160 --> 22:46.120\nThere were guys that were like clearly masturbating and the idea of talking to a person.\n\n22:46.120 --> 22:51.040\nBut the thing that I don't ‑‑ they kind of ‑‑ because this happened to me and\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:58.480\nI was like, oh, this person doesn't know that I'm kneeling in a New York hotel bed looking\n\n22:58.480 --> 23:04.400\nat a photo of like a girl from a commercial.\n\n23:04.400 --> 23:05.400\nWhat was the commercial?\n\n23:05.400 --> 23:06.400\nI'm not saying.\n\n23:06.400 --> 23:07.400\nI'm not saying.\n\n23:07.400 --> 23:08.400\nDon't say 1‑800 Dentist.\n\n23:08.400 --> 23:15.840\nI'm not saying because I have not verified her birth date and I ‑‑ those records\n\n23:15.840 --> 23:25.640\nare sealed until we officially verify that she was born after 1980, whatever the cigarette\n\n23:25.640 --> 23:26.640\ndate is.\n\n23:26.640 --> 23:31.400\nBut like, believe me, she's on the bubble.\n\n23:31.400 --> 23:33.400\nJesus Christ.\n\n23:33.400 --> 23:34.400\nHey.\n\n23:34.400 --> 23:35.400\nYou know what?\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:38.720\nYou shouldn't have said it was flow from the progressive progressive.\n\n23:38.720 --> 23:43.400\nI should have said lots of stuff, but I didn't.\n\n23:43.400 --> 23:51.640\nI should have done ‑‑ the Wright brothers should have taken a car.\n\n23:51.640 --> 23:54.200\nBut they didn't.\n\n23:54.200 --> 23:59.200\nI'm equating my horrible ‑‑ your late perversion to ‑‑\n\n23:59.200 --> 24:02.240\nTo the birth of the invention of flight.\n\n24:02.240 --> 24:06.840\nAnd how did they know when they were out there going like, what if a car could fly?\n\n24:06.840 --> 24:13.120\nHow did they ‑‑ I bet people were driving by and going like, gross.\n\n24:13.120 --> 24:16.240\nGo home to your wife.\n\n24:16.240 --> 24:17.240\nAge inappropriate.\n\n24:17.240 --> 24:22.680\nAnd they would have called out, you know, Taco Bell put her in the commercial for a\n\n24:22.680 --> 24:23.680\nreason.\n\n24:23.680 --> 24:24.680\nOh, so we got it.\n\n24:24.680 --> 24:25.680\nIt was Taco Bell.\n\n24:25.680 --> 24:26.680\nNo, it's not.\n\n24:26.680 --> 24:27.680\nI made that up.\n\n24:27.680 --> 24:28.680\nI made it up.\n\n24:28.680 --> 24:29.680\nI made it up.\n\n24:29.680 --> 24:30.680\nNo, I made it up.\n\n24:30.680 --> 24:31.680\nWe don't know that.\n\n24:31.680 --> 24:32.680\nI made it up ourselves.\n\n24:32.680 --> 24:33.680\nYou were driven off to a Tawawa.\n\n24:33.680 --> 24:34.680\nYou were driven off to a Tawawa.\n\n24:34.680 --> 24:35.680\nYou were a Taco Bell girl.\n\n24:35.680 --> 24:36.680\nYou're not going to find her.\n\n24:36.680 --> 24:37.680\nI'll tell you.\n\n24:37.680 --> 24:38.680\nI'll tell you next week.\n\n24:38.680 --> 24:41.680\nTell us the commercial.\n\n24:41.680 --> 24:44.100\nYour whole gimmick is full disclosure.\n\n24:44.100 --> 24:46.000\nTell us what commercial you were driven off to.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:52.100\nBut my whole gimmick is not full disclosure if she's 17.\n\n24:52.100 --> 24:54.440\nI saw the commercial.\n\n24:54.440 --> 24:56.480\nI made a mental note of it.\n\n24:56.480 --> 25:00.020\nI called her image up.\n\n25:00.020 --> 25:03.780\nI'm a grown man, I'm in charge of my life.\n\n25:03.780 --> 25:05.900\nNBCUniversal called up, he said,\n\n25:05.900 --> 25:08.140\nI had my pants around my ankles,\n\n25:08.140 --> 25:12.980\nI had my wiener in my hand, it's tiny, I'm powerless,\n\n25:12.980 --> 25:15.140\nbut I'm a bad person.\n\n25:15.140 --> 25:16.940\nIt's funny to me that there was a person\n\n25:16.940 --> 25:18.300\nwho was like an intern going like,\n\n25:18.300 --> 25:20.460\nokay, hold on for, I'm giving you the thing.\n\n25:20.460 --> 25:22.140\nAnd I'm like, okay.\n\n25:22.140 --> 25:23.580\nSo I was just thinking like,\n\n25:23.580 --> 25:25.420\nso what happened, did you go and hold\n\n25:25.420 --> 25:26.260\nand stop drinking after?\n\n25:26.260 --> 25:27.100\nDid you continue?\n\n25:27.100 --> 25:28.500\nOf course I stopped, it like shriveled,\n\n25:28.500 --> 25:31.260\nbut I, because I took,\n\n25:31.260 --> 25:32.420\nbut only because I was like,\n\n25:32.420 --> 25:33.940\nI didn't go there in my head.\n\n25:33.940 --> 25:36.100\nBecause the person on the phone was over 17 years old,\n\n25:36.100 --> 25:36.940\nis that why?\n\n25:36.940 --> 25:40.100\nJeff, you know, Jeff, you're, Jeff.\n\n25:40.100 --> 25:41.980\nAm I connecting the wrong dots, damn.\n\n25:41.980 --> 25:45.900\nJeff, you're the bad person here.\n\n25:45.900 --> 25:47.220\nBecause what I was thinking was,\n\n25:47.220 --> 25:48.140\noh, this is interesting,\n\n25:48.140 --> 25:49.700\nbecause I remember Erin's stories about\n\n25:49.700 --> 25:51.020\nwhen she worked for 1-800-Dentist,\n\n25:51.020 --> 25:53.140\nhow there were the people who would call her,\n\n25:53.140 --> 25:55.860\nI was like, they were clearly getting off on,\n\n25:55.860 --> 25:58.020\nthat the interesting thing to me is like the question of,\n\n25:58.020 --> 26:00.220\nlike there's some people who are,\n\n26:00.220 --> 26:02.220\nthey're getting off on the idea that you,\n\n26:03.180 --> 26:05.820\nit's an assault, that they,\n\n26:05.820 --> 26:09.380\nlike, that they want you to know.\n\n26:09.380 --> 26:10.820\nAnd then I started, I was like, wait,\n\n26:10.820 --> 26:12.940\nbut what if you, what if your thing was\n\n26:12.940 --> 26:14.540\nthat they didn't know?\n\n26:14.540 --> 26:16.620\nWhat if you just called people and were like,\n\n26:16.620 --> 26:20.900\nhey, I was wondering, should I get a new swimming pool?\n\n26:20.900 --> 26:23.500\nWell, sir, I'm looking through my things\n\n26:23.500 --> 26:25.220\nand the whole time you're jerking off.\n\n26:25.220 --> 26:28.220\nLike, is that a fetish?\n\n26:28.220 --> 26:29.620\nAnd how would you ever know?\n\n26:29.620 --> 26:31.180\nYou wouldn't, because that would be the whole point,\n\n26:31.180 --> 26:32.820\nbecause the guy would be like,\n\n26:32.820 --> 26:34.300\nand then you're like, hello?\n\n26:34.300 --> 26:36.180\nI was like, I just love swimming pools.\n\n26:36.180 --> 26:39.340\nIt's not, I was just thinking, like, I didn't go there.\n\n26:39.340 --> 26:41.420\nDan, how many listens do we get on Harmontown\n\n26:41.420 --> 26:42.260\na month or a week?\n\n26:42.260 --> 26:43.100\nDo you know?\n\n26:43.100 --> 26:45.740\nWhat's the ballpark figures in there?\n\n26:45.740 --> 26:46.940\nThat's 10 million.\n\n26:46.940 --> 26:49.900\nOkay, so we got to assume, there's at least-\n\n26:49.900 --> 26:51.460\nFive million women.\n\n26:51.460 --> 26:53.340\nAnd you're saying we just lost them.\n\n26:53.340 --> 26:56.140\nNo, I'm saying, if the number is over a million\n\n26:56.140 --> 26:57.940\nand it's over a few million,\n\n26:57.940 --> 27:01.300\ncertain people are jerking off right as we speak right now.\n\n27:01.300 --> 27:04.260\nHow many people here at the Gramergy Theater\n\n27:04.260 --> 27:06.620\nare currently jerking off in the shadows?\n\n27:06.620 --> 27:08.860\nWell, that's nearly half of the crowd.\n\n27:08.860 --> 27:09.700\nI love that.\n\n27:09.700 --> 27:10.540\nWell, that's sort of the Pandora's Box,\n\n27:10.540 --> 27:11.380\nI was hoping it was like-\n\n27:11.380 --> 27:12.220\nHow many people are jerking off?\n\n27:12.220 --> 27:14.300\nSomebody's sitting next to them is the more important.\n\n27:14.300 --> 27:15.820\nAll right, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.\n\n27:15.820 --> 27:17.220\nThat matters more than anything.\n\n27:17.220 --> 27:18.580\nOkay.\n\n27:18.580 --> 27:19.420\nAll right.\n\n27:19.420 --> 27:20.260\nUh...\n\n27:22.580 --> 27:23.540\nIf somebody brought me a drink over,\n\n27:23.540 --> 27:25.020\nthey can certainly be jerking off.\n\n27:25.020 --> 27:29.300\nSalt stains, phone jerking, soda is sodium.\n\n27:29.300 --> 27:31.140\nNobody puts me in the corner.\n\n27:32.100 --> 27:33.140\nPoop pants.\n\n27:33.140 --> 27:35.860\nIt says, poop pants, let's dance, Bowie.\n\n27:35.860 --> 27:36.700\nOh, because that was last night\n\n27:36.700 --> 27:38.260\nand you were in a blackout drunk\n\n27:38.260 --> 27:41.340\nand we were at a bar and let's dance was playing.\n\n27:41.340 --> 27:44.380\nLet's dance and so I started singing poop pants\n\n27:44.380 --> 27:47.220\nand then you were certain that tonight,\n\n27:47.220 --> 27:49.060\nif we sang the song, let's dance,\n\n27:49.060 --> 27:51.020\nbut use the lyrics to poop pants,\n\n27:51.020 --> 27:52.820\nthat it would be podcast dynamite.\n\n27:52.820 --> 27:53.660\nYeah.\n\n27:56.540 --> 27:57.860\nSounds like I was...\n\n27:58.980 --> 28:01.180\nSounds like on paper I was right.\n\n28:01.180 --> 28:02.020\nI believe so.\n\n28:02.020 --> 28:06.620\nPoop pants, put on your brown shoes to match your pants.\n\n28:06.620 --> 28:09.140\nAll right, so no one knows.\n\n28:09.140 --> 28:13.580\nPoop pants, let the poop go.\n\n28:13.580 --> 28:16.620\nWhen I say run, that means I have the runs.\n\n28:16.620 --> 28:18.780\nYeah, that's my favorite part is that\n\n28:18.780 --> 28:20.700\nwhen it goes into the like cosmic prayers,\n\n28:20.700 --> 28:24.900\nit's like, when you poop, you poop your pants.\n\n28:24.900 --> 28:28.420\nMy ass feels like a flame.\n\n28:30.100 --> 28:35.100\nPoop pants, put on your special brown shoes\n\n28:35.100 --> 28:37.780\nso no one sees.\n\n28:37.780

29:05.780\nOkay, so I don't suppose you have a 4-1-1 on this.\n\n29:05.780 --> 29:07.500\nI just have the word sandwich.\n\n29:09.180 --> 29:10.660\nThe inventor of the sandwich.\n\n29:10.660 --> 29:11.500\nWait, what?\n\n29:11.500 --> 29:14.020\nThis is today, we were talking about the...\n\n29:14.020 --> 29:15.660\nWoody Allen.\n\n29:15.660 --> 29:17.780\nWoody Allen and either Side Effects are getting even\n\n29:17.780 --> 29:18.620\nor one of his books,\n\n29:18.620 --> 29:20.380\nnot without feathers I don't think,\n\n29:20.380 --> 29:22.420\nit was a bit about the role of sandwich,\n\n29:22.420 --> 29:23.260\nyou wouldn't think it was sandwich.\n\n29:23.260 --> 29:24.260\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n29:24.260 --> 29:25.100\nYeah.\n\n29:25.100 --> 29:27.740\nAnd you wrote it down and you're like,\n\n29:27.740 --> 29:28.740\noh no, I'm not gonna tell you,\n\n29:28.740 --> 29:30.940\nnot gonna tell you, not gonna tell you what it is.\n\n29:30.940 --> 29:34.180\nYou had something fucking good for the sandwich a bit.\n\n29:34.180 --> 29:36.260\nYeah, but I feel like, okay, so I guess Woody Allen...\n\n29:36.260 --> 29:38.540\nDo we need our guest out here for this?\n\n29:38.540 --> 29:40.740\nWell, yeah, we'll bring him out in a second.\n\n29:40.740 --> 29:42.580\nJust let me get, okay, one more thing.\n\n29:42.580 --> 29:46.300\nA guy called me, a guy mistook me in a bar today.\n\n29:46.300 --> 29:48.140\nI was, I had my back to the guy\n\n29:48.140 --> 29:51.340\nand he came out of the bathroom in the spring lounge\n\n29:51.340 --> 29:55.940\nand he came out of the bathroom and he saw me from behind\n\n29:55.940 --> 30:00.060\nwearing this jacket and he went, Mr. Grossman?\n\n30:00.060 --> 30:05.060\nAnd I turned to him and he's like, oh, sorry.\n\n30:05.500 --> 30:08.180\nAnd I was like, this is a big step for me.\n\n30:08.180 --> 30:12.460\nLike, if you're 25, you're never mistaken for Mr. Grossman.\n\n30:13.980 --> 30:16.100\nThat's like a big, that's a threshold.\n\n30:16.100 --> 30:19.980\nBut whenever, even if your name's Shiv Grossman,\n\n30:19.980 --> 30:22.020\nyeah, someone's gonna go, Shiv,\n\n30:22.020 --> 30:24.860\nbut like, I was mistaken today\n\n30:24.860 --> 30:27.540\nfor a man called Mr. Grossman.\n\n30:27.540 --> 30:29.020\nAnd then I pressed the guy for details\n\n30:29.020 --> 30:31.140\nand it's a cartoonist from the New Yorker.\n\n30:32.900 --> 30:35.620\nSo I was like, I'll take it, I'll take it.\n\n30:35.620 --> 30:36.460\nI like it.\n\n30:36.460 --> 30:37.300\nNow, do you Google his
