meet that person\n\n36:26.400 --> 36:28.400\nand so there was a part of me that was like\n\n36:28.400 --> 36:30.400\noh this trauma is going to\n\n36:30.400 --> 36:32.400\nmake me realize something\n\n36:32.400 --> 36:34.400\nand I got to the other side of it\n\n36:34.400 --> 36:36.400\nand there was nothing\n\n36:36.400 --> 36:38.400\nI was the same person\n\n36:38.400 -->

no\n\n37:34.400 --> 37:36.400\neven if you don't\n\n37:36.400 --> 37:38.400\nso there are scientific studies that show that prayer\n\n37:38.400 --> 37:40.400\nworks as a healing\n\n37:40.400 --> 37:42.400\nlike prayer\n\n37:42.400 --> 37:44.400\nmakes you heal and I was like\n\n37:44.400 --> 37:46.400\nyeah but I'm pretty sure you have to believe\n\n37:46.400 --> 37:48.400\ngreat and it's not

49:00.400\nit's weight training and then you decide what you want to do with it\n\n49:00.400 --> 49:02.400\nshoot\n\n49:02.400 --> 49:04.400\nI love gay people\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:06.400\ncome on come

does this have THC in it or not\n\n49:36.400 --> 49:38.400\nI think that's\n\n49:38.400 --> 49:40.400\nI mean that to me\n\n49:40.400 --> 49:42.400\nnot that my opinion fucking matters\n\n49:42.400 --> 49:44.400\nbut that is the actual way to be Christian\n\n49:44.400 --> 49:46.400\nin which I would actually then\n\n49:46.400 --> 49:48.400\nlike start to merge with that freeway\n\n49:48.400 --> 49:50.400\nwhen it's like the Joseph Campbell thing\n\n49:50.400 --> 49:52.400\nwhere it's like I don't\n\n49:52.400 --> 49:54.400\ntruck with like what the hierarchy\n\n49:54.400 --> 49:56.400\nis telling me the older men of my church\n\n49:56.400 --> 49:58.400\nor it doesn't go up to any kind of\n\n49:58.400 --> 50:00.400\nthing so\n\n50:00.400 --> 50:02.400\nit's like politics where like some of the shit is amazing\n\n50:02.400 --> 50:04.400\nthe good that gets done\n\n50:04.400 --> 50:06.400\nand then it's not\n\n50:06.400 --> 50:08.400\nsome of the shit is garbage\n\n50:08.400 --> 50:10.400\nactually just straight up corruption and garbage\n\n50:10.400 --> 50:12.400\nlike I go to church now\n\n50:12.400 --> 50:14.400\nand the church that I go to\n\n50:14.400 --> 50:16.400\nwas able to get to Haiti before\n\n50:16.400 --> 50:18.400\nany other relief organization\n\n50:18.400 --> 50:20.400\nbecause there were doctors in the church\n\n50:20.400 --> 50:22.400\nand there were pilots in the church\n\n50:22.400 --> 50:24.400\nand they were able to commandeer X-ray machines\n\n50:24.400 --> 50:26.400\nand planes and get on the ground\n\n50:26.400 --> 50:28.400\nfirst and I do\n\n50:28.400 --> 50:30.400\nI try to do charity but sometimes\n\n50:30.400 --> 50:32.400\nif you really want to do charity you have to join a church\n\n50:32.400 --> 50:34.400\nbecause they've got this incredible infrastructure\n\n50:34.400 --> 50:36.400\nso like if you're trying to save people from New Orleans\n\n50:36.400 --> 50:38.400\nwhen the floods happen like the first\n\n50:38.400 --> 50:40.400\nplaces that were on the ground\n\n50:40.400 --> 50:42.400\nand that were able to get supplies out or churches\n\n50:42.400 --> 50:44.400\nso it sort of comes in handy\n\n50:44.400 --> 50:46.400\nand there's that prayer thing\n\n50:46.400 --> 50:48.400\nthat works.

opinion about\n\n53:58.400 --> 54:00.400\ntrajectory\n\n54:00.400 --> 54:02.400\nI used to be the kind of\n\n54:02.400 --> 54:04.400\natheist who was angry at because\n\n54:04.400 --> 54:06.400\nI grew up very Christian and then\n\n54:06.400 --> 54:08.400\nI read the Bible and then I was no longer\n\n54:08.400 --> 54:10.400\nChristian\n\n54:10.400 --> 54:12.400\nthat's the genesis of atheism\n\n54:12.400 --> 54:14.400\nyeah\n\n54:14.400 --> 54:16.400\nso\n\n54:16.400 --> 54:18.400\nmy experience\n\n54:18.400 --> 54:20.400\nso I know a ton about Christianity\n\n54:20.400 --> 54:22.400\nand specifically\n\n54:22.400 --> 54:24.400\nI was raised Lutheran and they're very dogmatic\n\n54:24.400 --> 54:26.400\nand so I knew\n\n54:26.400 --> 54:28.400\na lot of like the dogma like the crunch\n\n54:28.400 --> 54:30.400\nof religion\n\n54:30.400 --> 54:32.400\nand then\n\n54:32.400 --> 54:34.400\nLutheranism is the Linux of\n\n54:34.400 --> 54:36.400\nChristianity\n\n54:36.400 --> 54:38.400\nit's a singing church\n\n54:38.400 --> 54:40.400\nyou shouldn't have to touch a mouse\n\n54:40.400 --> 54:42.400\nCatholics would use a

first\n\n54:50.400 --> 54:52.400\ncame out of it I was very angry at Christians\n\n54:52.400 --> 54:54.400\nbecause I was like how have you not\n\n54:54.400 --> 54:56.400\ndone your homework like just do your\n\n54:56.400 --> 54:58.400\nfucking homework and you'll see that this is all ridiculous\n\n54:58.400 --> 55:00.400\nand then\n\n55:00.400 --> 55:02.400\nI\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:04.400\nrealized this boy\n\n55:04.400 --> 55:06.400\nsaying this is a form of\n\n55:06.400 --> 55:08.400\narrogance and narcissism\n\n55:08.400 --> 55:10.400\nlove it\n\n55:10.400 --> 55:12.400\nbut I realized\n\n55:12.400 --> 55:14.400\nthat it was narcissistic\n\n55:14.400 --> 55:16.400\nand arrogant to tell other people\n\n55:16.400 --> 55:18.400\nthat I knew more about\n\n55:18.400 --> 55:20.400\nwhat they had\n\n55:20.400 --> 55:22.400\nexperienced in life than they had\n\n55:22.400 --> 55:24.400\nlove it and\n\n55:24.400 --> 55:26.400\nfrom that elevated\n\n55:26.400 --> 55:28.400\nposition\n\n55:28.400 --> 55:30.400\nlove it\n\n55:30.400 --> 55:32.400\ndecided\n\n55:32.400 --> 55:34.400\nthat if I was to truly be\n\n55:34.400 --> 55:36.400\na nihilist when it came to\n\n55:36.400 --> 55:38.400\nthe afterlife and our experience of the present\n\n55:38.400 --> 55:40.400\nthen\n\n55:40.400 --> 55:42.400\nI had\n\n55:42.400 --> 55:44.400\nthere was no difference between being Christian\n\n55:44.400 --> 55:46.400\nand being an atheist\n\n55:46.400 --> 55:48.400\nlove it\n\n55:48.400 --> 55:50.400\nyes queen\n\n55:50.400 --> 55:52.400\nso\n\n55:52.400 -->

she was like well that's not good\n\n58:00.400 --> 58:02.400\nbecause\n\n58:02.400 --> 58:04.400\nno because if you think\n\n58:04.400 --> 58:06.400\nso there's another study where if other people\n\n58:06.400 --> 58:08.400\nare praying for you you're more likely to die\n\n58:08.400 --> 58:10.400\nwhoa\n\n58:10.400 --> 58:12.400\nwhat are these studies? whether you know it or not\n\n58:12.400 --> 58:14.400\nokay well that's backwards math\n\n58:14.400 --> 58:16.400\neveryone prays for clearly\n\n58:16.400 --> 58:18.400\ndying people more\n\n58:18.400 --> 58:20.400\nthat's a backwards\n\n58:20.400 --> 58:22.400\nbut no they've done like a blind study\n\n58:22.400 --> 58:24.400\nand like if nobody's praying for you\n\n58:24.400 --> 58:26.400\nand you\n\n58:26.400 --> 58:28.400\nare more likely to live and if even if you don't\n\n58:28.400 --> 58:30.400\nknow the person and they don't\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:32.400\nknow you're praying for them you're more likely to\n\n58:32.400 --> 58:34.400\ndie no wait come on\n\n58:34.400 --> 58:36.400\nit's quantum entanglement\n\n58:36.400 --> 58:38.400\nor some bullshit like who knows\n\n58:38.400 --> 58:40.400\nthat means that god only cares about\n\n58:40.400 --> 58:42.400\nyou and if\n\n58:42.400 --> 58:44.400\nother people care about you then you die\n\n58:44.400 --> 58:46.400\nbut if you only care about you then you live\n\n58:46.400 --> 58:48.400\nI believe in that god there's like\n\n58:48.400 --> 58:50.400\nthere's a religion yeah he's a jealous guy\n\n58:50.400 --> 58:52.400\nhe's like\n\n58:52.400
