the mayor of Harmit Town

00:49.400 --> 00:56.400
Mr. Dan Harmo!

00:56.400 --> 01:06.400
oh my god what a show you've got on your hands you came to a special show

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
special show

01:07.400 --> 01:10.400
now you're gonna have a good time

01:10.400 --> 01:16.400
I remember the time when your show wasn't that good

01:16.400 --> 01:23.400
and I still paid the same amount of money for it

01:23.400 --> 01:26.400
okay

01:26.400 --> 01:29.400
let's just leave that guy in his own desert

01:29.400 --> 01:31.400
who was that guy?

01:31.400 --> 01:34.400
Mr. Nostalgia that apparently hates some episodes of the show

01:34.400 --> 01:36.400
he wasn't ready for the evolutions

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
fuck that guy

01:37.400 --> 01:39.400
I'm glad he's not here tonight

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
where is he?

01:40.400 --> 01:43.400
oh shit I spilled all over the closing of the mail today

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
they look nice

01:44.400 --> 01:46.400
that's a great shirt

01:46.400 --> 01:50.400
for everybody that pays for the live video feed

01:50.400 --> 01:52.400
I'm wearing clothes I got in the mail

01:52.400 --> 01:54.400
from Bomfell

01:54.400 --> 01:56.400
it was a former sponsor at one point

01:56.400 --> 01:59.400
I think I'm grandfathered into some AI warehouse

01:59.400 --> 02:02.400
that's just like making Bomfell deliveries

02:02.400 --> 02:04.400
like the company maybe chapter 11

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
and it's just like there's just robot arms

02:06.400 --> 02:08.400
mailing clothes to me

02:08.400 --> 02:10.400
this is here I am

02:10.400 --> 02:12.400
it is a great shirt

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
and I spilled on it

02:14.400 --> 02:17.400
look last week I listened to the show

02:17.400 --> 02:18.400
I listened to it back

02:18.400 --> 02:19.400
sometimes I do that

02:19.400 --> 02:21.400
I don't think you guys understood

02:21.400 --> 02:23.400
that one car per green each lane

02:23.400 --> 02:25.400
oh shit

02:25.400 --> 02:27.400
it's absurd

02:27.400 --> 02:29.400
alright fine

02:29.400 --> 02:31.400
I think there should be more

02:31.400 --> 02:33.400
I think it should say

02:33.400 --> 02:35.400
I don't know what it should say

02:35.400 --> 02:37.400
I think they should make it

02:37.400 --> 02:40.400
I think they should block off one lane

02:40.400 --> 02:42.400
do you know that there is an exit

02:42.400 --> 02:44.400
it is right before the bar exit

02:44.400 --> 02:46.400
it's two cars

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
those are luxurious

02:48.400 --> 02:52.400
so it says two cars per green each lane

02:52.400 --> 02:55.400
what the fuck does that mean

02:55.400 --> 02:58.400
that means because everybody is trying to get on

02:58.400 --> 03:00.400
that means four cars go right

03:00.400 --> 03:02.400
if it's two lanes

03:02.400 --> 03:04.400
and if it's three it's six

03:04.400 --> 03:08.400
if I'm behind one of two cars

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
I'm in a quad of cars

03:10.400 --> 03:12.400
you're sitting there

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
so I get to go at the same speed

03:14.400 --> 03:16.400
as the person ahead of me

03:16.400 --> 03:18.400
because two cars per green each lane

03:18.400 --> 03:20.400
wow

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
thank you

03:22.400 --> 03:24.400
Mr. Infrastructure

03:24.400 --> 03:26.400
not you

03:26.400 --> 03:28.400
I want to be called Mr. Infrastructure

03:28.400 --> 03:30.400
they're looking at a big map

03:30.400 --> 03:32.400
on a wall of a 70's office

03:32.400 --> 03:34.400
and they're like looks like the i5

03:34.400 --> 03:36.400
is getting a little red by Kawanga

03:36.400 --> 03:38.400
well maybe

03:38.400 --> 03:40.400
up up the cars per green each lane

03:40.400 --> 03:42.400
to two

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
these dudes are trying to help you out

03:44.400 --> 03:46.400
and this is the impression you do

03:46.400 --> 03:48.400
they're trying to stop my car Brandon

03:48.400 --> 03:50.400
I love that you

03:50.400 --> 03:52.400
shit on these dudes

03:52.400 --> 03:54.400
I'll say two car lane

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
I think that they're

03:56.400 --> 03:58.400
I think they're nerds

03:58.400 --> 04:00.400
they're like how can we ease congestion

04:00.400 --> 04:02.400
you think they're trying to help me out

04:02.400 --> 04:04.400
really

04:04.400 --> 04:06.400
you think it's me and them against who

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
Zeus

04:08.400 --> 04:10.400
if they're not on the other team

04:10.400 --> 04:12.400
who is

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
give me a break

04:14.400 --> 04:16.400
they love

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
they love

04:18.400 --> 04:20.400
they'd love to make an alt right lane

04:20.400 --> 04:22.400
they'd love it

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400
they'd be like hey man

04:24.400 --> 04:26.400
the only color I see

04:26.400 --> 04:28.400
is traffic

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
okay alright buddy

04:30.400 --> 04:32.400
alright

04:32.400 --> 04:34.400
pick a lane

04:34.400 --> 04:36.400
I'd say to them

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400
anyways no they're not on anyone's side

04:38.400 --> 04:40.400
they're fucking

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
I don't doubt their intelligence

04:42.400 --> 04:44.400
we all saw singles

04:44.400 --> 04:46.400
what was Campbell Scott's character

04:46.400 --> 04:48.400
wasn't he in charge of like looking at traffic

04:48.400 --> 04:50.400
mixing up a bunch of like 90's movies

04:50.400 --> 04:52.400
yeah come on

04:52.400 --> 04:54.400
we all saw singles

04:54.400 --> 04:56.400
maybe there'd be like a 45 year old in the audience

04:56.400 --> 04:58.400
yes you got a Campbell Scott's character in singles

04:58.400 --> 05:00.400
definitely studied traffic

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
look it up

05:02.400 --> 05:04.400
but that's presented as an occupation

05:04.400 --> 05:06.400
it goes like oh if you do this

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
no no no they're traffic specialists

05:08.400 --> 05:10.400
I'm there

05:10.400 --> 05:12.400
they're not necessarily good people

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
who would take that job

05:14.400 --> 05:16.400
to put a sign on an on ramp

05:16.400 --> 05:18.400
that says hey

05:18.400 --> 05:20.400
put your left foot in and your right foot out

05:20.400 --> 05:22.400
do the hokey pokey

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
then you can get on the freeway

05:24.400 --> 05:26.400
home by five

05:26.400 --> 05:28.400
no dude come on

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
go to Capitol Hill

05:30.400 --> 05:32.400
get your money

05:32.400 --> 05:34.400
tell them what you

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
tell them there needs to be two fucking ramps

05:36.400 --> 05:38.400
I agree with you on that that's why I was trying to

05:38.400 --> 05:40.400
make your day by letting you know that they existed

05:40.400 --> 05:42.400
alright well we already talked about

05:42.400 --> 05:44.400
so many more cars

05:44.400 --> 05:46.400
that's two more cars

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
right

05:48.400 --> 05:50.400
two cars per green each lane

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
oh yeah

05:52.400 --> 05:54.400
it's great you know that light

05:54.400 --> 05:56.400
it gets a yellow

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
I thought that would get a bigger reaction

05:58.400 --> 06:00.400
no

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
I'm reading the room these guys

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
had it up to here

06:04.400 --> 06:06.400
guess what we've got some delightful guests for you

06:06.400 --> 06:08.400
so you can stick them up your ass

06:08.400 --> 06:10.400
I'm not gonna warm you up for them

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
I'm gonna bring them out you're gonna love them

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
and you're gonna be like I feel bad about the lukewarm

06:14.400 --> 06:16.400
response I had at the time of the show

06:16.400 --> 06:18.400
this is a better show

06:18.400 --> 06:20.400
than I thought it was gonna get

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
and I'm gonna be like you don't deserve it

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
whoa but you get it anyway

06:24.400 --> 06:26.400
but you're gonna get some great people

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
you're gonna make some new friends

06:28.400 --> 06:30.400
you're gonna love our conversation

06:30.400 --> 06:32.400
go home and tell that to your dumb parents

06:32.400 --> 06:34.400
terrible people

06:34.400 --> 06:36.400
there's some great conversations

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
what did I write in here some of you are nice I'm sure

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
I wrote down

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
apologizing to Mrs. Momfrey for jumping off

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
the garage roof with plastic bags

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
I think I probably told that story though

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
when?

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
I don't know I just remember like

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
I think it was a story about how my mom was like

06:52.400 --> 06:54.400
it was like I remember me and my best friend

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
like we were jumping off

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
the garage roof

06:58.400 --> 07:00.400
his garage roof with hefty bags

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
oh like a parish

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
we wanted to see if it slowed our descent

07:04.400 --> 07:06.400
right and

07:06.400 --> 07:08.400
someone saw us doing it and told my mom

07:08.400 --> 07:10.400
and I think my mom's

07:10.400 --> 07:12.400
response was

07:12.400 --> 07:14.400
I'm taking you over there

07:14.400 --> 07:16.400
and you're gonna apologize

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
for being

07:18.400 --> 07:20.400
seen by her

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
putting myself in danger that's not what she wanted

07:22.400 --> 07:24.400
but

07:24.400 --> 07:26.400
hey some moms are 23

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
I don't know

07:28.400 --> 07:30.400
I look at it like right now like what would you do Dan

07:30.400 --> 07:32.400
I'd be the worst dad

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
and I'm twice that age

07:34.400 --> 07:36.400
you have to jump a whole pack

07:36.400 --> 07:38.400
what's up you'd be like get up there

07:38.400 --> 07:40.400
and jump 20 times in a row

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
yeah I'd be like why yeah I don't know

07:42.400 --> 07:44.400
if my kid said I'm gonna jump off the

07:44.400 --> 07:46.400
garage with a hefty bag I'd be like

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
well

07:48.400 --> 07:50.400
let's shoot it

07:50.400 --> 07:52.400
I don't know what

07:52.400 --> 07:54.400
I would actually still think

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
I'd be like well maybe it'll work like a parachute

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
why wouldn't it you're like 80 pounds

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
the bag says it holds

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
a lot of garbage

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
no

08:06.400 --> 08:08.400
I prefer quiet

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
I think that's the new uber setting

08:10.400 --> 08:12.400
I prefer quiet and now I'm locked in it

08:12.400 --> 08:14.400
we talked about this

08:14.400 --> 08:16.400
I saw it I got excited I predicted

08:16.400 --> 08:18.400
like this is gonna lock you in

08:18.400 --> 08:20.400
like what happens the day I have had it

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
I've been like you know I'm a little lit

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
I'm on my way from here to there

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
I'd actually love to talk to somebody a little chatty

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
tonight and then I look at the thing I'm really

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
I can't force someone to talk to me

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
it already says I prefer

08:32.400 --> 08:34.400
quiet by default I'm not gonna select

08:34.400 --> 08:36.400
talk to me that poor fucker

08:36.400 --> 08:38.400
you know

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
talk to me also means

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
hey if you want to talk

08:42.400 --> 08:44.400
I know but like that because

08:44.400 --> 08:46.400
it's creepy to not talk to each other in the car

08:46.400 --> 08:48.400
I love it

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
if you sit the way I sit I sit

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
you just stare at the driver

08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
I sit backwards facing in the front seat

08:54.400 --> 08:56.400
it's nice that

08:56.400 --> 08:58.400
you guys are trying to react to me like it's a

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
good show and I appreciate that

09:00.400 --> 09:02.400
you're trying

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
you're like well that's a thing to talk about

09:04.400 --> 09:06.400
sure

09:06.400 --> 09:08.400
life is like a flowerpot and you're like Jesus Christ kill me

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
alright

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
let's bring out our friends

09:12.400 --> 09:14.400
we're not one at a time just because we don't want them to

09:14.400 --> 09:16.400
compete

09:16.400 --> 09:18.400
let's first bring out

09:18.400 --> 09:20.400
I'm not gonna call her a close friend

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
but I am gonna call her somebody that I was

09:22.400 --> 09:24.400
so enamored with and I never

09:24.400 --> 09:26.400
I don't know

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
there's a thing whatever I'm not gonna over talk it

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
why don't you give her her credits because she's amazing

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
I don't know anything she does

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
she was a writer for SNL

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
I met her through

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
Jeff kind of through the improv community

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
great on who's line

09:40.400 --> 09:42.400
to talk about she's been working on the Jordan Peele

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
Twilight Zone show

09:44.400 --> 09:46.400
but let's let her speak for herself

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
please welcome Heather Anne Campbell

09:52.400 --> 09:54.400
I put my guest

09:54.400 --> 09:56.400
on the seat

09:58.400 --> 10:00.400
Heather Anne Campbell

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
damn

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
Heather Ann

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
looking good

10:06.400 --> 10:08.400
back of a van

10:08.400 --> 10:10.400
yep

10:10.400 --> 10:12.400
now that tracks

10:12.400 --> 10:14.400
well I'll freestyle till it gets gross that's my rule

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
how are you thanks for coming out and visiting

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
I'm good how are you

10:18.400 --> 10:20.400
I'm always happy to see you

10:20.400 --> 10:22.400
I'm happy to see you always

10:22.400 --> 10:24.400
like the last time that we sat down

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
it was like two hours of video game talk

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
and I did most

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
of the listening which blew my mind

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
yeah we talked about video games

10:34.400 --> 10:36.400
because you play way more video games

10:36.400 --> 10:38.400
yeah I mean

10:38.400 --> 10:40.400
I play a lot of bad ones now

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
but I used to play really good video games

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
and it was really great and fun

10:44.400 --> 10:46.400
and I think we talked about those times

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
yeah we talked about the old times

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
the new times the third person

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
times the first person times

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
you got a new podcast called how did this get played

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
yep

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
as the name would imply

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
thank you very much

11:00.400 --> 11:02.400
I haven't listened to it

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
so like you want to describe

11:04.400 --> 11:06.400
so

11:06.400 --> 11:08.400
Nick Weiger and I

11:08.400 --> 11:10.400
play a terrible video game

11:10.400 --> 11:12.400
and then

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
we talk about it with a guest

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
and the guest also plays the terrible video game

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
and there are infinite terrible

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
video games so the show will last forever

11:20.400 --> 11:22.400
and does it span all of time

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
does the guest get to pick

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
we've asked a couple

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
guests if they have a pick

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
and they have chosen but generally they're like

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
I don't know whatever and then we tell them

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
well enjoy Leisure Suit Larry

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
and they're like

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
fuck

11:38.400 --> 11:40.400
hope you like playing that again

11:40.400 --> 11:42.400
but we're playing new games

11:42.400 --> 11:44.400
old games

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
it's actually really nice to pull out all of my old

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
video game systems

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
I pulled out my old Dreamcast for a recent episode

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
that hasn't been released yet

11:52.400 --> 11:54.400
and I was

11:54.400 --> 11:56.400
follow Heather Ann on Instagram

11:56.400 --> 11:58.400
you'll get intimidated

11:58.400 --> 12:00.400
post a photo of

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
a fucking

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
engine also

12:04.400 --> 12:06.400
do you wrench on cars and shit

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
no

12:08.400 --> 12:10.400
I have a

12:10.400 --> 12:12.400
problematic car

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
and I

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
try to take care of it

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
I've learned how to

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
so I drive a 1978 Datsun

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
T-Tops folks

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
come on

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
T-Tops

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
he looks upset

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
I reached out

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
when you posted it

12:32.400 --> 12:34.400
it's amazing

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
I sealed over

12:36.400 --> 12:38.400
this is going to break your heart

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
I had the sunroof patched

12:40.400 --> 12:42.400
it's alright

12:42.400 --> 12:44.400
she made it an O-Top

12:44.400 --> 12:46.400
is that cool

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
but so the car has

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
a fuel injection system

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
so the lines go over the top of the engine

12:52.400 --> 12:54.400
and one day I started it

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
and gasoline sprayed all over

12:56.400 --> 12:58.400
my windshield

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
and it was terrifying because that means

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
I could die

13:02.400 --> 13:04.400
so I've learned how to fix that problem

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
so that

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
is the only wrenching that I do on my engine

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
and the rest of the time I usually have it toed

13:10.400 --> 13:12.400
still but in that

13:12.400 --> 13:14.400
in that three sentences

13:14.400 --> 13:16.400
about you doing something wrong

13:16.400 --> 13:18.400
with a car I was like oh you would have bullied me

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
in high school no

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
cause you were like brave enough to

13:22.400 --> 13:24.400
oh no

13:24.400 --> 13:26.400
you were in the key

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
it just seems like you know your way around things

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
we would have been loser friends

13:30.400 --> 13:32.400
really?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
what was your archetype?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.400
I was a

13:36.400 --> 13:38.400
dragon lance nerd

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
so I used to

13:40.400 --> 13:42.400
what?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
general enthusiasm

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
I read a lot of dragon lance

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
and I played D&D

13:48.400 --> 13:50.400
with a guy who would draw

13:50.400 --> 13:52.400
his maps on lamb skin

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
whoa

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
he also had

13:56.400 --> 13:58.400
a full suit of armor so he was like

13:58.400 --> 14:00.400
a rich kid

14:00.400 --> 14:02.400
but like a not

14:02.400 --> 14:04.400
you know what I mean

14:04.400 --> 14:06.400
so yeah

14:06.400 --> 14:08.400
I did that

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
okay so there's no

14:10.400 --> 14:12.400
how big was your high school?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.400
so my high school was

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
400 kids total

14:16.400 --> 14:18.400
and it was not a good

14:18.400 --> 14:20.400
place I hated it very much

14:20.400 --> 14:22.400
so 400 kids means

14:22.400 --> 14:24.400
that there's a social allowance

14:24.400 --> 14:26.400
for one art kid

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
yeah we had one art kid

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
in our and it was not me

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
it was not you, you were the D&D kid

14:32.400 --> 14:34.400
I was the D&D video game kid

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
and it's hard to be the D&D video game kid

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
when there's only one allowed

14:38.400 --> 14:40.400
the truth is

14:40.400 --> 14:42.400
you really want another D&D kid

14:42.400 --> 14:44.400
the guy who drew on the maps

14:44.400 --> 14:46.400
he was from a different school

14:46.400 --> 14:48.400
so you're totally right

14:48.400 --> 14:50.400
there was no community of nerds

14:50.400 --> 14:52.400
that way

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
I spent so much time in middle school

14:54.400 --> 14:56.400
being into D&D it never played it

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
I literally

14:58.400 --> 15:00.400
my whole identity

15:00.400 --> 15:02.400
was

15:02.400 --> 15:04.400
I had three D&D shirts that I bought

15:04.400 --> 15:06.400
at GenCon

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
because I lived in Milwaukee

15:08.400 --> 15:10.400
so I was GenCon adjacent

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
and I bought

15:12.400 --> 15:14.400
these D&D sweatshirts there

15:14.400 --> 15:16.400
and I just wore those

15:16.400 --> 15:18.400
and I had these

15:18.400 --> 15:20.400
AD&D books

15:20.400 --> 15:22.400
but

15:22.400 --> 15:24.400
I didn't play with anybody

15:24.400 --> 15:26.400
that was just my identity

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
it was just me saying step off

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
or you've already stepped off

15:30.400 --> 15:32.400
and it was my idea first

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
but it was almost

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
just as satisfying

15:36.400 --> 15:38.400
I spent so much of it

15:38.400 --> 15:40.400
but then in high school

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
I had a 600 student high school

15:42.400 --> 15:44.400
that I transferred to

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
there were three

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
nerds allowed

15:48.400 --> 15:50.400
and they found me

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
and my brain blossomed

15:52.400 --> 15:54.400
I met these guys and we would get together

15:54.400 --> 15:56.400
and play D&D

15:56.400 --> 15:58.400
from 3 to 9pm

15:58.400 --> 16:00.400
that's great

16:00.400 --> 16:02.400
but you did that with

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
by the way thank you for

16:04.400 --> 16:06.400
letting me be a guest on your show

16:06.400 --> 16:08.400
do you have any other questions for me

16:08.400 --> 16:10.400
I wanted more details on this

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
Dungeons & Dragons sweatshirt

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
it was all the

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
black sweatshirts

16:16.400 --> 16:18.400
and they were just the illustrations

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
from the covers of the second edition

16:20.400 --> 16:22.400
oh hell yeah

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
that's really fucking cool

16:24.400 --> 16:26.400
the easily

16:26.400 --> 16:28.400
paintings whatever

16:28.400 --> 16:30.400
the cover of

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
Unearthed Arcana

16:32.400 --> 16:34.400
the cover of the Dungeon Masters guide

16:34.400 --> 16:36.400
the cover of the Players Handbook

16:36.400 --> 16:38.400
I think I had those three sweatshirts

16:38.400 --> 16:40.400
they were jet black

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
accentuating

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
it was like a black light on my shoulders

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
everywhere I went just a big

16:46.400 --> 16:48.400
dotted

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
sign that said back off buddy

16:50.400 --> 16:52.400
back off ladies

16:52.400 --> 16:54.400
did it work

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
oh yeah man people gave me space

16:58.400 --> 17:00.400
but how do you reconcile

17:00.400 --> 17:02.400
being a nerd with

17:02.400 --> 17:04.400
being a you seem

17:04.400 --> 17:06.400
marketable to me

17:06.400 --> 17:08.400
you went into

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
improv

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
it's not

17:12.400 --> 17:14.400
you seem like you could have made it

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
well you

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
you can pass

17:18.400 --> 17:20.400
for like not a nerd

17:20.400 --> 17:22.400
but you're fucking harder

17:22.400 --> 17:24.400
core than me frankly

17:24.400 --> 17:26.400
I sold out as soon as I could

17:26.400 --> 17:28.400
you still stick to your guns you like

17:28.400 --> 17:30.400
cosplay and like you

17:30.400 --> 17:32.400
you're fucking like it's infused in your life

17:32.400 --> 17:34.400
you get joy from our legacy

17:34.400 --> 17:36.400
you think that I should

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
have given up those things

17:38.400 --> 17:40.400
so that I could make it

17:40.400 --> 17:42.400
oh no you didn't

17:42.400 --> 17:44.400
you have a show that is those things

17:44.400 --> 17:46.400
no it's not listen to this interview it's terrible

17:46.400 --> 17:48.400
what

17:48.400 --> 17:50.400
I'm just circling

17:50.400 --> 17:52.400
like you're such an effervescent person

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
you never sold out

17:54.400 --> 17:56.400
you're not

17:56.400 --> 17:58.400
you're an island

17:58.400 --> 18:00.400
that's what you are

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
and like you

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
do you have anxiety about

18:04.400 --> 18:06.400
yourself and shit

18:06.400 --> 18:08.400
or is it like what I see is what I get

18:08.400 --> 18:10.400
right now I am having

18:10.400 --> 18:12.400
anxiety

18:12.400 --> 18:14.400
you radiate confidence

18:14.400 --> 18:16.400
oh thank you

18:16.400 --> 18:18.400
so I'm just yeah I mean

18:18.400 --> 18:20.400
are you

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
swallowing down insecurity

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
the best thing about

18:24.400 --> 18:26.400
I think about being

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
like an improviser for example

18:28.400 --> 18:30.400
is that I don't ever have to be myself

18:30.400 --> 18:32.400
I can't imagine being like a stand up

18:32.400 --> 18:34.400
and it took a lot of

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
it was a lot of like

18:36.400 --> 18:38.400
mental homework

18:38.400 --> 18:40.400
to do a podcast because I was like oh

18:40.400 --> 18:42.400
over the course of like 20 episodes

18:42.400 --> 18:44.400
people are going to figure out who I am

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
and they're going to hate that person

18:46.400 --> 18:48.400
and you know some of the comments

18:48.400 --> 18:50.400
have gotten there really quickly

18:50.400 --> 18:52.400
and they know who I am

18:52.400 --> 18:54.400
they hate me

18:54.400 --> 18:56.400
yeah I

18:56.400 --> 18:58.400
what are the things that you think people are going to

18:58.400 --> 19:00.400
what is that kite tail that you carry with you

19:00.400 --> 19:02.400
because I feel that too

19:02.400 --> 19:04.400
these people are going to google me

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
and they're going to like pick through

19:06.400 --> 19:08.400
what is it about you that you're worried people are going to

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
so I wear so much of my

19:10.400 --> 19:12.400
my

19:12.400 --> 19:14.400
my fandom all of those things on my sleeve

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
but I am always afraid

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
my imposter syndrome

19:18.400 --> 19:20.400
manifests as I don't know

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
enough about any of the things that I actually

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
love like when people

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
see that I drive that car and then I fix it up

19:26.400 --> 19:28.400
twice they're like oh she's a gear head

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
but I'm not a gear head

19:30.400 --> 19:32.400
you're like I'm not going to stand up

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
to that fucking scrutiny don't ask me a bunch

19:34.400 --> 19:36.400
of fucking gear head questions are you going to shame me

19:36.400 --> 19:38.400
right but the only thing that I feel

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
like I could like go pretty deep on is

19:40.400 --> 19:42.400
video games and then

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
even that and that's a forgiving crowd

19:44.400 --> 19:46.400
yeah that's a

19:46.400 --> 19:48.400
that's a good pit to dive into

19:48.400 --> 19:50.400
people love it when women

19:50.400 --> 19:52.400
talk about video games

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
the more the merrier

19:54.400 --> 19:56.400
people hate it so much that

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
it changed politics

19:58.400 --> 20:00.400
literally

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
like I mean for real

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
began there

20:04.400 --> 20:06.400
but

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
you I mean so

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
have you

20:10.400 --> 20:12.400
just regarding that like in

20:12.400 --> 20:14.400
terms of your relationship with like other people's

20:14.400 --> 20:16.400
opinions and your

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
identity and stuff

20:18.400 --> 20:20.400
are there epiphanies that you've come into over the

20:20.400 --> 20:22.400
last five years

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
that you could share with me

20:24.400 --> 20:26.400
like about

20:26.400 --> 20:28.400
about just in that general

20:28.400 --> 20:30.400
area about like what

20:30.400 --> 20:32.400
people like you're talking about

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
yourself being out there being

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
visible you having an identity

20:36.400 --> 20:38.400
people having opinions about it

20:38.400 --> 20:40.400
what's your relationship with that how has that

20:40.400 --> 20:42.400
changed from 2009

20:42.400 --> 20:44.400
to now

20:46.400 --> 20:48.400
so

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
a decade ago

20:50.400 --> 20:52.400
I was writing for

20:52.400 --> 20:54.400
magazines and there were

20:54.400 --> 20:56.400
very vocal

20:56.400 --> 20:58.400
I feel like I was I got

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
a trailer for

21:00.400 --> 21:02.400
Gamergate

21:02.400 --> 21:04.400
in the kinds of

21:04.400 --> 21:06.400
language that met me when I was

21:06.400 --> 21:08.400
a video game journalist

21:08.400 --> 21:10.400
there were places that

21:10.400 --> 21:12.400
really really ruthlessly called

21:12.400 --> 21:14.400
me a dumb cunt

21:14.400 --> 21:16.400
and like

21:16.400 --> 21:18.400
diatribes of stuff and I was like oh this

21:18.400 --> 21:20.400
is unfamiliar

21:20.400 --> 21:22.400
and then after I stopped

21:22.400 --> 21:24.400
being a games journalist and sort of disappeared

21:24.400 --> 21:26.400
into comedy for the next few years

21:26.400 --> 21:28.400
I every time

21:28.400 --> 21:30.400
I'd like poke my head up out of that

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
that water and somebody would be like

21:32.400 --> 21:34.400
bitch and I'd go back under

21:34.400 --> 21:36.400
I'd be like ah that yes I remember

21:36.400 --> 21:38.400
um so I

21:38.400 --> 21:40.400
I feel like that I was really lucky to get

21:40.400 --> 21:42.400
a preview of it before it

21:42.400 --> 21:44.400
came down like a sledge hammer

21:44.400 --> 21:46.400
on everybody later

21:46.400 --> 21:48.400
um so that would

21:48.400 --> 21:50.400
be what I've learned is that like

21:50.400 --> 21:52.400
I was very

21:52.400 --> 21:54.400
um I've always been

21:54.400 --> 21:56.400
very internet like I love

21:56.400 --> 21:58.400
internet so much I was a

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
I had prodigy like

22:00.400 --> 22:02.400
on a black and white screen in my

22:02.400 --> 22:04.400
house and like was posting on

22:04.400 --> 22:06.400
um

22:06.400 --> 22:08.400
prodigy forums back in the day

22:08.400 --> 22:10.400
uh like I've always really you had

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
one keyboard under each hand

22:12.400 --> 22:14.400
I did

22:14.400 --> 22:16.400
I had a split keyboard I had

22:16.400 --> 22:18.400
a Microsoft ergonomic

22:18.400 --> 22:20.400
because that's how you I mean

22:20.400 --> 22:22.400
like a girl who's like hey

22:22.400 --> 22:24.400
mom and dad will you get me an ergonomic

22:24.400 --> 22:26.400
keyboard

22:26.400 --> 22:28.400
they're like oh no

22:28.400 --> 22:30.400
I had as many as I could because I would see

22:30.400 --> 22:32.400
in TV and movies that that's if you were a hacker

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
you had more keyboards and more screens

22:34.400 --> 22:36.400
were you were you ever a hacker

22:36.400 --> 22:38.400
I was a poser hacker

22:38.400 --> 22:40.400
I was like a phone

22:40.400 --> 22:42.400
phone freak PHRE

22:42.400 --> 22:44.400
did you make the thing from the like the back of

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
your mechanics where you uh got free

22:46.400 --> 22:48.400
phone calls was that with phone

22:48.400 --> 22:50.400
was that like a whistle or something no no

22:50.400 --> 22:52.400
I never I was on a whistler okay I

22:52.400 --> 22:54.400
was a I was a code

22:54.400 --> 22:56.400
uh I was just I was

22:56.400 --> 22:58.400
just seeing finding codes on

22:58.400 --> 23:00.400
bbs's and then we go like oh this

23:00.400 --> 23:02.400
is a code you can type in and then you

23:02.400 --> 23:04.400
get you get free long distance awesome

23:04.400 --> 23:06.400
and then we call like sex lines oh just

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
to test it I was like I was just like

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
oh for real if you do use this code

23:10.400 --> 23:12.400
you don't get charged for a 900 number

23:12.400 --> 23:14.400
and like I don't even know if it was true

23:14.400 --> 23:16.400
or if my parents are just like oh good he's not gay

23:16.400 --> 23:18.400
I don't I don't know I have no

23:18.400 --> 23:20.400
idea like but I did the codes did

23:20.400 --> 23:22.400
work and I was excited the coaches let

23:22.400 --> 23:24.400
that person listen

23:24.400 --> 23:26.400
in on your conversation but that's not

23:26.400 --> 23:28.400
a hacker I didn't hack anything

23:28.400 --> 23:30.400
I was a programmer I was

23:30.400 --> 23:32.400
very into Commodore 64

23:32.400 --> 23:34.400
basic you know programming

23:34.400 --> 23:36.400
I almost had basic cable

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
but anyways

23:38.400 --> 23:40.400
um uh

23:40.400 --> 23:42.400
shit like like where were we at though

23:42.400 --> 23:44.400
we're talking about what we've learned what have you learned

23:44.400 --> 23:46.400
in the last 10 years no I don't

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
get me started that's what this dumb

23:48.400 --> 23:50.400
show is all about I was I was curious

23:50.400 --> 23:52.400
and you let me know I mean what I got

23:52.400 --> 23:54.400
there was an education of actually like way

23:54.400 --> 23:56.400
before like long ago

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
you've dwelt among

23:58.400 --> 24:00.400
like environments where

24:00.400 --> 24:02.400
you can't

24:02.400 --> 24:04.400
please everybody all of the time is more

24:04.400 --> 24:06.400
than just a comforting platitude

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
if you don't win a

24:08.400 --> 24:10.400
competition at school it's

24:10.400 --> 24:12.400
like an actual thing you have to live with

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
that that's what you're describing is like

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
you were acid washed

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
and and so is it that as

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
it these many years later

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
are you

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
is there a philosophy that you carry with you where you're like

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
don't don't read the comments

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
or fuck them if

24:28.400 --> 24:30.400
they can't take a joke or don't drink

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
the Haterade or like what is

24:32.400 --> 24:34.400
the I mean is there any guiding

24:34.400 --> 24:36.400
philosophy at the risk of giving up

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
my my bit

24:38.400 --> 24:40.400
which will then I think make it ineffective

24:40.400 --> 24:42.400
is that any time

24:42.400 --> 24:44.400
somebody says something terrible to me online

24:44.400 --> 24:46.400
I reply with okay I will do that

24:46.400 --> 24:48.400
or yes thank you I agree

24:48.400 --> 24:50.400
and usually they're like

24:50.400 --> 24:52.400
oh okay like if somebody

24:52.400 --> 24:54.400
is like you've got a fucking terrible

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
smile

24:56.400 --> 24:58.400
which I got on a video

24:58.400 --> 25:00.400
it was like the top comment

25:00.400 --> 25:02.400
was like this girl shouldn't

25:02.400 --> 25:04.400
fucking smile she's got a terrible smile

25:04.400 --> 25:06.400
I was like I also

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
hate my smile

25:08.400 --> 25:10.400
and I wish that I didn't have it

25:10.400 --> 25:12.400
and then after that they're like

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
no it's not that bad

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
it doesn't yeah I

25:16.400 --> 25:18.400
see what you mean about like yeah I don't give it up

25:18.400 --> 25:20.400
because it's like oh god

25:20.400 --> 25:22.400
that is the one fear

25:22.400 --> 25:24.400
but yeah it makes perfect sense

25:24.400 --> 25:26.400
I feel like we've all gone through that phase

25:26.400 --> 25:28.400
and it's always yielded results and I think I just

25:28.400 --> 25:30.400
like my fear is what bumps me off of that path

25:30.400 --> 25:32.400
it always works

25:32.400 --> 25:34.400
yeah no just

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
being healthy

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
just going like

25:38.400 --> 25:40.400
not attacking the person back

25:40.400 --> 25:42.400
which is just what is that

25:42.400 --> 25:44.400
that's exactly

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
either nothing at all

25:46.400 --> 25:48.400
or even better

25:48.400 --> 25:50.400
yeah I guess my dick's pretty small

25:50.400 --> 25:52.400
and just letting it take its course

25:52.400 --> 25:54.400
which is what a Taoist would do

25:54.400 --> 25:56.400
what water would do

25:56.400 --> 25:58.400
it always works

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
yeah it does

26:00.400 --> 26:02.400
stop doing it because we have a bad day

26:02.400 --> 26:04.400
I don't know

26:04.400 --> 26:06.400
because we get super clever and we want to fire back

26:06.400 --> 26:08.400
yeah I got good jokes

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
and listen to the time to let them fly

26:10.400 --> 26:12.400
god damn right

26:12.400 --> 26:14.400
speaking of great jokes

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
it's time to bring out professional comedy writer

26:16.400 --> 26:18.400
SNL writer alum

26:18.400 --> 26:20.400
Rick and Morty writer Nick Rutherford

26:20.400 --> 26:22.400
please welcome him out

26:22.400 --> 26:34.400
music

26:34.400 --> 26:36.400
you guys both wrote on SNL

26:36.400 --> 26:38.400
but not the same year

26:38.400 --> 26:40.400
no

26:40.400 --> 26:42.400
see different comedy philosophies

26:42.400 --> 26:44.400
no we did not

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
write at the same time

26:46.400 --> 26:48.400
no I didn't get hired

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
along with a bunch of my buddies who got hired

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
and then I was working with Heather at the time

26:52.400 --> 26:54.400
and she

26:54.400 --> 26:56.400
had just gotten fired from it

26:56.400 --> 26:58.400
I was not renewed

26:58.400 --> 27:00.400
it's different

27:00.400 --> 27:02.400
oh I say I was fired

27:02.400 --> 27:04.400
they probably never fire anybody

27:04.400 --> 27:06.400
you don't have to fire writers in TV

27:06.400 --> 27:08.400
you just don't pick up their option

27:08.400 --> 27:10.400
yeah that's what happened

27:10.400 --> 27:12.400
yeah it all feels the same

27:12.400 --> 27:14.400
no I wish I was

27:14.400 --> 27:16.400
I reached the end of my contract

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
and then was fired

27:18.400 --> 27:20.400
okay great

27:20.400 --> 27:22.400
it said fired

27:22.400 --> 27:24.400
it sent me a new contract

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
that said fired

27:26.400 --> 27:28.400
I would like to hire you to be fired

27:28.400 --> 27:30.400
why would they mail this

27:30.400 --> 27:32.400
plus one option plus one

27:32.400 --> 27:34.400
if we like your job of being an ex-employee

27:34.400 --> 27:36.400
we may fire you again

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
yeah and they didn't like me as an

27:38.400 --> 27:40.400
as an ex-employee there

27:40.400 --> 27:42.400
because they didn't fire me again

27:42.400 --> 27:44.400
but you told me a lot of terrible stories

27:44.400 --> 27:46.400
that made me feel good about not getting hired

27:46.400 --> 27:48.400
and then I got hired

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
and I was like

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
Heather doesn't know shit

27:52.400 --> 27:54.400
and then I had

27:54.400 --> 27:56.400
a terrible year

27:56.400 --> 27:58.400
you guys have suicide dreams

28:00.400 --> 28:02.400
I have dreams where I just

28:02.400 --> 28:04.400
bite people really hard

28:04.400 --> 28:06.400
yeah

28:06.400 --> 28:08.400
makes me feel good

28:08.400 --> 28:10.400
you have a dream that you're the guy being bit

28:10.400 --> 28:12.400
that's working on SNL

28:12.400 --> 28:14.400
and then I knew

28:14.400 --> 28:16.400
that you were right the whole time

28:16.400 --> 28:18.400
thank you

28:18.400 --> 28:20.400
everybody has a different

28:20.400 --> 28:22.400
experience there

28:22.400 --> 28:24.400
ours was the same

28:24.400 --> 28:26.400
it's weird that the phrase

28:26.400 --> 28:28.400
36th season

28:28.400 --> 28:30.400
shouldn't be

28:30.400 --> 28:32.400
said along with comedy

28:32.400 --> 28:34.400
isn't it 46?

28:34.400 --> 28:36.400
well now it probably is

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
it's just like

28:38.400 --> 28:40.400
someone's worked on the 36th season

28:40.400 --> 28:42.400
of a sketch show

28:42.400 --> 28:44.400
it's shit

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
it's its own thing

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
it's more like a sport

28:48.400 --> 28:50.400
there aren't seasons of sports

28:50.400 --> 28:52.400
it's a dynasty

28:52.400 --> 28:54.400
it's an institution

28:54.400 --> 28:56.400
it's fun

28:56.400 --> 28:58.400
it's good

28:58.400 --> 29:00.400
everybody loves it when they're 10 years old

29:00.400 --> 29:02.400
when they turn 17 they're like this sucks now

29:02.400 --> 29:04.400
I wonder if that's still trying to get back on the show

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
so if we could

29:06.400 --> 29:08.400
move the conversation

29:08.400 --> 29:10.400
let's do your audition

29:10.400 --> 29:12.400
we've got the right kind of crowd tonight

29:12.400 --> 29:14.400
oh yeah I can tell they're hot

29:14.400 --> 29:16.400
they're ready to

29:16.400 --> 29:18.400
produce SNL

29:18.400 --> 29:20.400
here's a guy

29:20.400 --> 29:22.400
here's a

29:22.400 --> 29:24.400
well I just did this impression of a guy

29:24.400 --> 29:26.400
who got fired from SNL

29:26.400 --> 29:28.400
five years ago and can't stop talking about it

29:28.400 --> 29:30.400
alright that's one

29:30.400 --> 29:32.400
that was solid

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
don't you have a guy named Hammerhead?

29:34.400 --> 29:36.400
yeah of course I got a guy named Hammerhead

29:36.400 --> 29:38.400
cause you're a trained improviser

29:38.400 --> 29:40.400
ohhhh

29:40.400 --> 29:42.400
I'm gonna nail ya

29:42.400 --> 29:44.400
someone told me

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
you do an incredible viola Davis

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
of course

29:50.400 --> 29:52.400
and that of course is as we all know

29:52.400 --> 29:54.400
the woman who is half violin

29:54.400 --> 29:56.400
that's right

30:00.400 --> 30:02.400
I thought that people would be more enamored

30:02.400 --> 30:04.400
with my lack of knowing who viola Davis is

30:04.400 --> 30:06.400
at least currently

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
I thought it was one of your better pieces

30:08.400 --> 30:10.400
thank you

30:10.400 --> 30:12.400
uh no I don't uh

30:12.400 --> 30:14.400
I don't know who that is

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
alright let's go in

30:16.400 --> 30:18.400
we're gonna go round

30:18.400 --> 30:20.400
should I know who that is?

30:20.400 --> 30:22.400
wait who is she

30:22.400 --> 30:24.400
maybe I do I'm bad with names

30:24.400 --> 30:26.400
he's a guest make him feel good

30:26.400 --> 30:28.400
my first time I'm nervous

30:28.400 --> 30:30.400
I had vodka

30:30.400 --> 30:32.400
you forgot who viola Davis is it's fine

30:32.400 --> 30:34.400
thanks Phantom

30:34.400 --> 30:36.400
this is Dungeon Master

30:36.400 --> 30:38.400
now I feel bad

30:38.400 --> 30:40.400
it's time for our lightning round

30:40.400 --> 30:42.400
we're gonna go round

30:42.400 --> 30:44.400
round Robin with the guests and talk about their experience

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
with breast cancer

30:46.400 --> 30:48.400
we'll start with Heather Ann

30:48.400 --> 30:50.400
thank you

30:50.400 --> 30:52.400
you recently

30:52.400 --> 30:54.400
like it was

30:54.400 --> 30:56.400
just fucking

30:56.400 --> 30:58.400
it hit you like a truck

30:58.400 --> 31:00.400
I didn't see it coming for sure

31:00.400 --> 31:02.400
and when

31:02.400 --> 31:04.400
Heather was diagnosed

31:04.400 --> 31:06.400
I wasn't ready for it

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
that's how I felt honestly

31:08.400 --> 31:10.400
I felt more affected by it

31:10.400 --> 31:12.400
um

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
but like

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
whether we talked about

31:16.400 --> 31:18.400
you talked about the fucking brevity of it

31:18.400 --> 31:20.400
from start to finish

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
so I went in for my

31:22.400 --> 31:24.400
my OBG was like

31:24.400 --> 31:26.400
hey you should get a mammogram at some point

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
for like a baseline

31:28.400 --> 31:30.400
and I was like okay sure

31:30.400 --> 31:32.400
I got my first mammogram

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
and they were like oh god

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
this doesn't usually happen on the first one

31:36.400 --> 31:38.400
yeah the serious doctor came in

31:38.400 --> 31:40.400
and like that's what you every time I go to the doctor

31:40.400 --> 31:42.400
I'm like oh they're gonna

31:42.400 --> 31:44.400
I'm dying for sure I'm dying at the dentist

31:44.400 --> 31:46.400
and

31:46.400 --> 31:48.400
so they were like well

31:48.400 --> 31:50.400
so all of these things

31:50.400 --> 31:52.400
these are calcium and usually that forms

31:52.400 --> 31:54.400
around a tumor

31:54.400 --> 31:56.400
Heather did you work on SNL at all

31:56.400 --> 31:58.400
I did

31:58.400 --> 32:00.400
it was as exciting

32:02.400 --> 32:04.400
but yeah so they were like

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
you have stage 3 breast cancer

32:06.400 --> 32:08.400
there's only 4

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
4 is politely

32:10.400 --> 32:12.400
sorry but like

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
it's over

32:14.400 --> 32:16.400
I mean not over over

32:16.400 --> 32:18.400
if you have stage 4 and you're listening

32:18.400 --> 32:20.400
you're gonna make it if you have stage 4

32:20.400 --> 32:22.400
you still can pull out of it

32:22.400 --> 32:24.400
it's kind of like a video game

32:24.400 --> 32:28.400
I was playing on difficult but not hard

32:28.400 --> 32:30.400
I was not playing on casual

32:30.400 --> 32:32.400
or normal

32:32.400 --> 32:34.400
but you went in for this thing

32:34.400 --> 32:36.400
and they were like it's stage 3

32:36.400 --> 32:38.400
it was like

32:38.400 --> 32:40.400
it was a matter of minutes

32:40.400 --> 32:42.400
until stage 4

32:42.400 --> 32:44.400
and there's a big difference between stages

32:44.400 --> 32:46.400
yes so

32:46.400 --> 32:48.400
I went in

32:48.400 --> 32:50.400
on one let's see

32:50.400 --> 32:52.400
I went in on a Thursday

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
and by Thursday of the next week

32:54.400 --> 32:56.400
I was seeing a surgeon

32:56.400 --> 32:58.400
and then

32:58.400 --> 33:00.400
seeing them like them prepping you

33:00.400 --> 33:02.400
walking me through all the stuff

33:02.400 --> 33:04.400
and they were like

33:04.400 --> 33:06.400
we would recommend a double mastectomy

33:06.400 --> 33:08.400
and I was like okay great

33:08.400 --> 33:10.400
and they were like you don't want to consult

33:10.400 --> 33:12.400
and I was like no let's go

33:12.400 --> 33:14.400
fucking cut them off

33:14.400 --> 33:16.400
so then they did

33:16.400 --> 33:18.400
so less than a month from

33:18.400 --> 33:20.400
mammogram to surgery

33:20.400 --> 33:22.400
and

33:22.400 --> 33:24.400
I had a double mastectomy

33:24.400 --> 33:26.400
and that was that

33:26.400 --> 33:28.400
and I didn't tell anybody

33:28.400 --> 33:30.400
ahead of time like I didn't post on instagram

33:30.400 --> 33:32.400
or anything

33:32.400 --> 33:34.400
because I really didn't want anyone to worry

33:34.400 --> 33:36.400
and I also didn't want to be

33:36.400 --> 33:38.400
identified as

33:38.400 --> 33:40.400
the person who had

33:40.400 --> 33:42.400
glad I can help

33:42.400 --> 33:44.400
thank you

33:44.400 --> 33:46.400
but that was so baller

33:46.400 --> 33:48.400
so then I had it done

33:48.400 --> 33:50.400
and the only

33:50.400 --> 33:52.400
truly scary thing

33:52.400 --> 33:54.400
there were two scary moments

33:54.400 --> 33:56.400
one was I came out of surgery

33:56.400 --> 33:58.400
and I didn't feel well

33:58.400 --> 34:00.400
and I was like no

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
I really don't feel well

34:02.400 --> 34:04.400
and they have like drains

34:04.400 --> 34:06.400
that go into your rib cage

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
to drain all the fluid

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
from what is a huge traumatic injury

34:10.400 --> 34:12.400
to your body

34:12.400 --> 34:14.400
that's the

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
because you didn't do chemo

34:16.400 --> 34:18.400
for the first two weeks

34:18.400 --> 34:20.400
one week after you have lines

34:20.400 --> 34:22.400
the surgery is an injury and your body

34:22.400 --> 34:24.400
is like building up these fluids

34:24.400 --> 34:26.400
I've been traumatized

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
so you have these drains that are hanging out of you

34:28.400 --> 34:30.400
and one of them was filling up with

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
really dark red liquid

34:32.400 --> 34:34.400
like darker than blood

34:34.400 --> 34:36.400
and I was like that can't be right and they were like no it's fine

34:36.400 --> 34:38.400
and I was like well can we talk to my surgeon

34:38.400 --> 34:40.400
and they were like no it's fine

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400
and then an hour and a half later I was like

34:42.400 --> 34:44.400
I really don't feel well can we please just

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
like well being

34:46.400 --> 34:48.400
get my surgeon back in and she can be like

34:48.400 --> 34:50.400
that's fine and she came in and went

34:50.400 --> 34:52.400
oh no

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
and I was like

34:54.400 --> 34:56.400
we have to bring you back in immediately

34:56.400 --> 34:58.400
you're bleeding internally

34:58.400 --> 35:00.400
and so I had to go under again

35:00.400 --> 35:02.400
and that was scary like that's when my dad

35:02.400 --> 35:04.400
cried and stuff like that was

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
rough for everyone

35:06.400 --> 35:08.400
my girlfriend fainted

35:08.400 --> 35:10.400
that was scary because they were like

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
you're not supposed to go under twice in a day

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
you know if you're bleeding internally

35:14.400 --> 35:16.400
it's much worse than cutting off your boobs

35:16.400 --> 35:18.400
so that was scary

35:18.400 --> 35:20.400
and then I think that was it

35:20.400 --> 35:22.400
after that I was fine

35:22.400 --> 35:24.400
and the whole thing spans

35:24.400 --> 35:26.400
though when you described it to me you're like

35:26.400 --> 35:28.400
January blah blah blah

35:28.400 --> 35:30.400
I got the thing and it was like

35:30.400 --> 35:32.400
and then the number of days

35:32.400 --> 35:34.400
was like from start to finish

35:34.400 --> 35:36.400
yeah January 27th to February 18th

35:36.400 --> 35:38.400
was the entirety of my cancer journey

35:38.400 --> 35:40.400
that means before

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
you're like zippity-doodle

35:42.400 --> 35:44.400
time to

35:44.400 --> 35:46.400
have a formal play date with

35:46.400 --> 35:48.400
a mammogram

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
just to do my due diligence

35:50.400 --> 35:52.400
and then boom worst news

35:52.400 --> 35:54.400
ever except

35:54.400 --> 35:56.400
if we had caught it a little later

35:56.400 --> 35:58.400
and then you had this whole

35:58.400 --> 36:00.400
spiritual experience

36:00.400 --> 36:02.400
that barely anybody listening

36:02.400 --> 36:04.400
is going to have

36:04.400 --> 36:06.400
until later

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
which is like holy shit

36:08.400 --> 36:10.400
that might be it

36:10.400 --> 36:12.400
and then you come out to the other side

36:12.400 --> 36:14.400
and one thing that you said to me

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
was like

36:16.400 --> 36:18.400
so

36:18.400 --> 36:20.400
a couple women reached out and they were like

36:20.400 --> 36:22.400
you're going to be a different person

36:22.400 --> 36:24.400
on the other side of this journey

36:24.400 --> 36:26.400
and it's going to be really great to meet that person

36:26.400 --> 36:28.400
and so there was a part of me that was like

36:28.400 --> 36:30.400
oh this trauma is going to

36:30.400 --> 36:32.400
make me realize something

36:32.400 --> 36:34.400
and I got to the other side of it

36:34.400 --> 36:36.400
and there was nothing

36:36.400 --> 36:38.400
I was the same person

36:38.400 --> 36:40.400
and I was like

36:40.400 --> 36:42.400
no there's got okay

36:42.400 --> 36:44.400
I'm going to feel on a daily

36:44.400 --> 36:46.400
basis I'm going to have more gratitude

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
or more like fear

36:48.400 --> 36:50.400
and there was nothing it was the same

36:50.400 --> 36:52.400
miserable

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
person on the other side just like

36:54.400 --> 36:56.400
well fucking get back

36:56.400 --> 36:58.400
to work so they didn't get all the cancer

36:58.400 --> 37:00.400
no I am the cancer

37:00.400 --> 37:02.400
you are the cancer

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
you were the cancer the breasts feel great

37:04.400 --> 37:06.400
they're somewhere

37:06.400 --> 37:08.400
they're free

37:08.400 --> 37:10.400
would you call yourself an atheist

37:10.400 --> 37:12.400
would you let yourself be okay

37:12.400 --> 37:14.400
what was your relationship with oblivion

37:14.400 --> 37:16.400
but the important thing is it didn't change

37:16.400 --> 37:18.400
your relationship was like

37:18.400 --> 37:20.400
whatever and then you were kind of

37:20.400 --> 37:22.400
surprised to find out on the other side of this

37:22.400 --> 37:24.400
it hadn't changed

37:24.400 --> 37:26.400
so here's two things that happened during the thing

37:26.400 --> 37:28.400
which is my therapist said

37:28.400 --> 37:30.400
you should pray

37:30.400 --> 37:32.400
and I was like

37:32.400 --> 37:34.400
and she's like no

37:34.400 --> 37:36.400
even if you don't

37:36.400 --> 37:38.400
so there are scientific studies that show that prayer

37:38.400 --> 37:40.400
works as a healing

37:40.400 --> 37:42.400
like prayer

37:42.400 --> 37:44.400
makes you heal and I was like

37:44.400 --> 37:46.400
yeah but I'm pretty sure you have to believe

37:46.400 --> 37:48.400
great and it's not the actual thing

37:48.400 --> 37:50.400
and she's like no

37:50.400 --> 37:52.400
you can believe in the study

37:52.400 --> 37:54.400
so pray to the study

37:54.400 --> 37:56.400
I actually think that's a smart therapist

37:56.400 --> 37:58.400
and I was like

37:58.400 --> 38:00.400
oh and she's like if you know

38:00.400 --> 38:02.400
scientifically it works then you're praying

38:02.400 --> 38:04.400
to the results

38:04.400 --> 38:06.400
and so for like that month

38:06.400 --> 38:08.400
I prayed to the study

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
like I was like

38:10.400 --> 38:12.400
and you did do it? yeah oh yeah

38:12.400 --> 38:14.400
every night I was like

38:14.400 --> 38:16.400
please study

38:16.400 --> 38:18.400
good

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
please Harvard Journal of Medicine

38:20.400 --> 38:22.400
yeah I wish well she was like

38:22.400 --> 38:24.400
you know whatever it is that you want to

38:24.400 --> 38:26.400
put as the thing you're praying to

38:26.400 --> 38:28.400
uh and you're

38:28.400 --> 38:30.400
going to go to the choir

38:30.400 --> 38:32.400
yeah

38:32.400 --> 38:34.400
please keep spider manning me

38:34.400 --> 38:36.400
through this

38:36.400 --> 38:38.400
so I prayed to that

38:38.400 --> 38:40.400
thing I prayed to like

38:40.400 --> 38:42.400
the idea of prayer

38:42.400 --> 38:44.400
as a self

38:44.400 --> 38:46.400
is that the right word?

38:46.400 --> 38:48.400
self? yeah

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
thank you

38:50.400 --> 38:52.400
I get a letter a week later

38:52.400 --> 38:54.400
it would have been nice if you had all accepted

38:54.400 --> 38:56.400
my sentence

38:56.400 --> 38:58.400
the other thing was that

38:58.400 --> 39:00.400
I got really sad about music

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400
was I guess something

39:02.400 --> 39:04.400
that changed because I would

39:04.400 --> 39:06.400
a song that would come on that I really loved

39:06.400 --> 39:08.400
and I was like man there's a possibility

39:08.400 --> 39:10.400
I'm not going to hear this song more than like five more

39:10.400 --> 39:12.400
times oh god

39:12.400 --> 39:14.400
and that bummed me out like of all the

39:14.400 --> 39:16.400
everything else was okay like I

39:16.400 --> 39:18.400
was too stressed out to eat

39:18.400 --> 39:20.400
and so I wasn't like

39:20.400 --> 39:22.400
manifesting as like oh I should eat my

39:22.400 --> 39:24.400
last meal although that did occur to

39:24.400 --> 39:26.400
me but then I was like

39:26.400 --> 39:28.400
but you're telling me that having experienced

39:28.400 --> 39:30.400
those things those moments

39:30.400 --> 39:32.400
like that didn't

39:32.400 --> 39:34.400
I mean I don't want to say

39:34.400 --> 39:36.400
that didn't change you I'm saying like

39:36.400 --> 39:38.400
but it's like you didn't

39:38.400 --> 39:40.400
I don't mean

39:40.400 --> 39:42.400
my question to be like what are you

39:42.400 --> 39:44.400
some kind of freak I mean you're my hero

39:44.400 --> 39:46.400
because like when you told me that I'm like oh god

39:46.400 --> 39:48.400
you're yeah because that's my biggest

39:48.400 --> 39:50.400
fear is like

39:50.400 --> 39:52.400
dying? no the not feeling

39:52.400 --> 39:54.400
shit oh the

39:54.400 --> 39:56.400
the stuff where you go like oh is there

39:56.400 --> 39:58.400
something like I'm not like this other person

39:58.400 --> 40:00.400
this fairy tale story about

40:00.400 --> 40:02.400
when I get this and then I overcome

40:02.400 --> 40:04.400
that and then I'm supposed to feel this

40:04.400 --> 40:06.400
and you go like oh that's not me that's not

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
how I'm feeling well maybe

40:08.400 --> 40:10.400
maybe it could be that

40:10.400 --> 40:12.400
for you you're already living

40:12.400 --> 40:14.400
in a way where the thing

40:14.400 --> 40:16.400
that most people transform into

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
you've already actualized and that's sort of

40:18.400 --> 40:20.400
what I was I'm like a I'm like a person

40:20.400 --> 40:22.400
you've already died

40:22.400 --> 40:24.400
you've already

40:24.400 --> 40:26.400
experienced

40:26.400 --> 40:28.400
like the full death because of my diet

40:28.400 --> 40:30.400
yeah yeah

40:30.400 --> 40:32.400
so you're already there

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
I've seen you eat

40:34.400 --> 40:36.400
I've seen you eat

40:36.400 --> 40:38.400
I mean that's kind of

40:38.400 --> 40:40.400
when I talked to people about it

40:40.400 --> 40:42.400
like my therapist I was like

40:42.400 --> 40:44.400
I was looking forward to this thing

40:44.400 --> 40:46.400
and it didn't happen

40:46.400 --> 40:48.400
and she was like well you

40:48.400 --> 40:50.400
talked a lot about death before you got this diagnosis

40:50.400 --> 40:52.400
I feel like you lived

40:52.400 --> 40:54.400
with it as a presence in your life

40:54.400 --> 40:56.400
like you talk about like well I gotta go

40:56.400 --> 40:58.400
on this vacation

40:58.400 --> 41:00.400
that is a little bit more expensive than I want to

41:00.400 --> 41:02.400
because what if I die

41:02.400 --> 41:04.400
next week and then I won't have done it

41:04.400 --> 41:06.400
so and it was sort of I had a watch

41:06.400 --> 41:08.400
for a while called ticker

41:08.400 --> 41:10.400
which I got off Kickstarter

41:10.400 --> 41:12.400
and it you went online and you filled

41:12.400 --> 41:14.400
in all of this stuff about your life

41:14.400 --> 41:16.400
and all of your habits and your

41:16.400 --> 41:18.400
heart rate and everything and then

41:18.400 --> 41:20.400
it counts down from

41:20.400 --> 41:22.400
your expected death date

41:22.400 --> 41:24.400
and I had that watch until it ran out

41:24.400 --> 41:26.400
of batteries

41:26.400 --> 41:28.400
it couldn't count that

41:28.400 --> 41:30.400
does the watch say

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
you do fill in I've been diagnosed

41:32.400 --> 41:34.400
with well you could

41:34.400 --> 41:36.400
if I mean like if I went back

41:36.400 --> 41:38.400
and filled it out now you could like add a cancer diagnosis

41:38.400 --> 41:40.400
to it and it would probably take off like 20 years

41:40.400 --> 41:42.400
well isn't that convenient

41:42.400 --> 41:44.400
but yeah so

41:44.400 --> 41:46.400
I've wore that watch a lot and I'd be like well

41:46.400 --> 41:48.400
you know that's gonna happen hopefully

41:48.400 --> 41:50.400
in 60 years or whatever

41:50.400 --> 41:52.400
and so I should go eat

41:52.400 --> 41:54.400
shrimp

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400
Rutherford what are your near death

41:56.400 --> 41:58.400
what's your relationship with death

42:02.400 --> 42:04.400
I can't follow

42:04.400 --> 42:06.400
that man this

42:06.400 --> 42:08.400
you don't have to follow it just open

42:08.400 --> 42:10.400
for her next thing

42:10.400 --> 42:12.400
go lateral

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
be like here's an impression of Nixon

42:14.400 --> 42:16.400
getting fucked in the boo boo

42:18.400 --> 42:20.400
mix your way out of that shit DJ

42:20.400 --> 42:22.400
I was at my

42:22.400 --> 42:24.400
I was at my parents house this weekend

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
are you afraid to die

42:26.400 --> 42:28.400
god damn

42:28.400 --> 42:30.400
I don't think I can

42:30.400 --> 42:32.400
die that's the problem

42:32.400 --> 42:34.400
oh you can and you will

42:34.400 --> 42:36.400
oh Jesus this is

42:36.400 --> 42:38.400
the worst podcast

42:38.400 --> 42:40.400
for the guests and for me

42:40.400 --> 42:42.400
I am being

42:42.400 --> 42:44.400
attacked on all fronts

42:44.400 --> 42:46.400
I thought I'd come up here and do like

42:46.400 --> 42:48.400
voices

42:48.400 --> 42:50.400
or be like meow

42:50.400 --> 42:52.400
and you'd be like that sounds like a funny cat

42:52.400 --> 42:54.400
and now I'm thinking about

42:54.400 --> 42:56.400
things and the audience isn't laughing

42:56.400 --> 42:58.400
a lot and

42:58.400 --> 43:00.400
what about you Nick what have you struggled with

43:00.400 --> 43:02.400
and I'm like I was with my parents for a weekend

43:02.400 --> 43:04.400
the audience is thoughtful

43:04.400 --> 43:06.400
tonight they've been that way since the beginning

43:06.400 --> 43:08.400
it was a little

43:08.400 --> 43:10.400
jarring at the top of the show but they're thoughtful

43:10.400 --> 43:12.400
they're listening they're sincere

43:12.400 --> 43:14.400
they're here for the long haul

43:14.400 --> 43:16.400
and they'd like to know if you're afraid of death

43:20.400 --> 43:22.400
they don't want your

43:22.400 --> 43:24.400
what my ex-girlfriend

43:24.400 --> 43:26.400
would call

43:26.400 --> 43:28.400
what did she call it

43:28.400 --> 43:30.400
deflection

43:30.400 --> 43:32.400
they don't want your deflection

43:32.400 --> 43:34.400
we hate that

43:34.400 --> 43:36.400
same thing

43:36.400 --> 43:38.400
I don't know if

43:38.400 --> 43:40.400
you don't know if you're gonna die

43:40.400 --> 43:42.400
I

43:42.400 --> 43:44.400
I don't know if I'm gonna die

43:44.400 --> 43:46.400
I don't

43:46.400 --> 43:48.400
think about it that's how I deal with

43:48.400 --> 43:50.400
death I don't think about it

43:50.400 --> 43:52.400
I do whatever I want to do when I want to do it

43:52.400 --> 43:54.400
as long as it's not hurting somebody then I do that

43:54.400 --> 43:56.400
and if I find I've hurt somebody I try my best

43:56.400 --> 43:58.400
to kill them so they can't tell anybody

43:58.400 --> 44:00.400
do you worry about anything

44:00.400 --> 44:02.400
happening after

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
you die

44:04.400 --> 44:06.400
you know I

44:06.400 --> 44:08.400
think

44:08.400 --> 44:10.400
now I'm getting real guys buckle in

44:10.400 --> 44:12.400
oh shit

44:12.400 --> 44:14.400
I

44:14.400 --> 44:16.400
think that

44:16.400 --> 44:18.400
you just become like a little thing of energy

44:18.400 --> 44:20.400
and it like poops into a flower somewhere

44:20.400 --> 44:22.400
and maybe you're not aware of that

44:22.400 --> 44:24.400
but you're still that flower or you're

44:24.400 --> 44:26.400
a worm on another planet

44:26.400 --> 44:28.400
or something I don't know

44:28.400 --> 44:30.400
so that's comforting to me

44:30.400 --> 44:32.400
and um

44:32.400 --> 44:34.400
just a worm or a flower

44:34.400 --> 44:36.400
I'll be happy with either of those

44:36.400 --> 44:38.400
but I don't have to worry about that because

44:38.400 --> 44:40.400
I'm immune to death baby

44:40.400 --> 44:42.400
oh god

44:42.400 --> 44:44.400
well I

44:44.400 --> 44:46.400
I don't think about it either

44:46.400 --> 44:48.400
that's my solution

44:48.400 --> 44:50.400
it's great isn't it

44:50.400 --> 44:52.400
I can't imagine it

44:52.400 --> 44:54.400
I get so mad at my

44:54.400 --> 44:56.400
fiance Cody

44:56.400 --> 44:58.400
her dog is dying

44:58.400 --> 45:00.400
we're all dying

45:00.400 --> 45:02.400
if you have a dog right now

45:02.400 --> 45:04.400
you have subscribed to death

45:04.400 --> 45:06.400
all dogs are dying was the prequel

45:06.400 --> 45:08.400
all dogs are going to heaven

45:10.400 --> 45:12.400
Cody's subscription

45:12.400 --> 45:14.400
is running out

45:14.400 --> 45:16.400
I got mad at Cody

45:16.400 --> 45:18.400
today because Cody was upset because

45:18.400 --> 45:20.400
the dog disappeared in the yard

45:20.400 --> 45:22.400
and she was like Barbara Barbara where are you

45:22.400 --> 45:24.400
and then

45:24.400 --> 45:26.400
I can't handle Cody

45:26.400 --> 45:28.400
handling

45:28.400 --> 45:30.400
a dog's death

45:30.400 --> 45:32.400
and I keep thinking to myself like Harmon

45:32.400 --> 45:34.400
you got to get your shit together

45:34.400 --> 45:36.400
you have chosen a woman

45:36.400 --> 45:38.400
you're going to spend the rest of your life with

45:38.400 --> 45:40.400
that means probably you

45:40.400 --> 45:42.400
maybe her shouldn't matter

45:42.400 --> 45:44.400
one of you is going to

45:44.400 --> 45:46.400
watch the other person get sick

45:46.400 --> 45:48.400
or wander out into the yard

45:50.400 --> 45:52.400
if that if that can't be

45:52.400 --> 45:54.400
the definition of the lowest

45:54.400 --> 45:56.400
fucking bar

45:56.400 --> 45:58.400
of my ability to adjust

45:58.400 --> 46:00.400
when she's like where's Barbara

46:00.400 --> 46:02.400
don't talk to me like that

46:02.400 --> 46:04.400
you need to check the whole yard

46:04.400 --> 46:06.400
before you go into hysterics

46:06.400 --> 46:08.400
this is like election night

46:08.400 --> 46:10.400
I told you Hillary was going to win

46:10.400 --> 46:12.400
you didn't believe

46:14.400 --> 46:16.400
I get upset

46:16.400 --> 46:18.400
when she's upset

46:18.400 --> 46:20.400
living with a partner

46:20.400 --> 46:22.400
were you with a partner when you

46:22.400 --> 46:24.400
yes

46:24.400 --> 46:26.400
it was really hard

46:26.400 --> 46:28.400
I'm dating this girl Mary

46:28.400 --> 46:30.400
and

46:30.400 --> 46:32.400
she was

46:32.400 --> 46:34.400
Mary

46:34.400 --> 46:36.400
she's not here she's working

46:36.400 --> 46:38.400
she doesn't listen to this show

46:38.400 --> 46:40.400
she

46:40.400 --> 46:42.400
she might

46:42.400 --> 46:44.400
she might

46:44.400 --> 46:46.400
she was waiting

46:46.400 --> 46:48.400
for me when I was getting the mammogram

46:48.400 --> 46:50.400
and I was like

46:50.400 --> 46:52.400
I've got to be the doctor now

46:52.400 --> 46:54.400
going in and being like I got low

46:54.400 --> 46:56.400
and I was like so okay

46:56.400 --> 46:58.400
this isn't easy news

46:58.400 --> 47:00.400
to say

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400
and that was hard

47:02.400 --> 47:04.400
she was incredible

47:04.400 --> 47:06.400
because there were times where

47:06.400 --> 47:08.400
the doctors would be rattling off

47:08.400 --> 47:10.400
shit and I'd be like I don't care

47:10.400 --> 47:12.400
just tell me when the appointment is

47:12.400 --> 47:14.400
I don't need to know any of the options

47:14.400 --> 47:16.400
and she wrote it all down

47:16.400 --> 47:18.400
in a journal

47:18.400 --> 47:20.400
of everything said to me

47:20.400 --> 47:22.400
during the whole thing

47:22.400 --> 47:24.400
she was phenomenal

47:24.400 --> 47:26.400
I don't think I could have done it

47:26.400 --> 47:28.400
as well without her

47:28.400 --> 47:30.400
and this is the

47:30.400 --> 47:32.400
is it okay to talk a little bit about this

47:32.400 --> 47:34.400
this is the

47:34.400 --> 47:36.400
partner that we

47:36.400 --> 47:38.400
talked about that's that relationship

47:38.400 --> 47:40.400
the one that you're still in

47:40.400 --> 47:42.400
yes I assume

47:42.400 --> 47:44.400
you assume you're still in a relationship

47:44.400 --> 47:46.400
or

47:46.400 --> 47:48.400
I just want to make sure

47:48.400 --> 47:50.400
she's Christian

47:50.400 --> 47:52.400
and not just Christian

47:52.400 --> 47:54.400
secular Christian

47:54.400 --> 47:56.400
she thinks Jesus is coming back

47:56.400 --> 47:58.400
for reals

47:58.400 --> 48:00.400
that's that with all Christians

48:00.400 --> 48:02.400
maybe not

48:02.400 --> 48:04.400
it's kind of a generalization

48:04.400 --> 48:06.400
are you Christian

48:06.400 --> 48:08.400
I'm half Catholic half Baptist

48:08.400 --> 48:10.400
what does that

48:10.400 --> 48:12.400
there's a punchline coming

48:12.400 --> 48:14.400
that means my mama told

48:14.400 --> 48:16.400
my daddy put the rowboat

48:16.400 --> 48:18.400
in the attic

48:18.400 --> 48:20.400
my great grandfather

48:20.400 --> 48:22.400
were Baptist ministers

48:22.400 --> 48:24.400
and my mother was

48:24.400 --> 48:26.400
this close to being a nun

48:26.400 --> 48:28.400
Catholic and I went to Catholic high school

48:28.400 --> 48:30.400
okay so

48:30.400 --> 48:32.400
are you a believer

48:32.400 --> 48:34.400
I am oh okay great

48:34.400 --> 48:36.400
because I grew up in a neighborhood

48:36.400 --> 48:38.400
a city that was very Jewish

48:38.400 --> 48:40.400
and I watched people observe every Saturday

48:40.400 --> 48:42.400
and then I observed

48:42.400 --> 48:44.400
from like six o'clock in the morning

48:44.400 --> 48:46.400
until

48:46.400 --> 48:48.400
maybe four o'clock

48:48.400 --> 48:50.400
because I had to actually feed people after church

48:50.400 --> 48:52.400
so you think Heather's going to hell

48:52.400 --> 48:54.400
no because well Baptist

48:54.400 --> 48:56.400
are cooler about that

48:56.400 --> 48:58.400
I mean look

48:58.400 --> 49:00.400
it's weight training and then you decide what you want to do with it

49:00.400 --> 49:02.400
shoot

49:02.400 --> 49:04.400
I love gay people

49:04.400 --> 49:06.400
come on come on come on

49:06.400 --> 49:08.400
I'm spotting you bro

49:08.400 --> 49:10.400
I'm spotting you

49:10.400 --> 49:12.400
like it's sort of like weed

49:12.400 --> 49:14.400
we're like people introduce it to you

49:14.400 --> 49:16.400
and then you can pick the strain that you like

49:16.400 --> 49:18.400
and how it affects your body

49:18.400 --> 49:20.400
and how much you really want to smoke all day

49:20.400 --> 49:22.400
you don't have to smoke all day

49:22.400 --> 49:24.400
you can smoke at parties

49:24.400 --> 49:26.400
Methodist makes me sleepy

49:26.400 --> 49:28.400
Baptist gives me paranoia

49:30.400 --> 49:32.400
Unitarian I don't even think

49:32.400 --> 49:34.400
that's the CBD

49:34.400 --> 49:36.400
it's like does this have THC in it or not

49:36.400 --> 49:38.400
I think that's

49:38.400 --> 49:40.400
I mean that to me

49:40.400 --> 49:42.400
not that my opinion fucking matters

49:42.400 --> 49:44.400
but that is the actual way to be Christian

49:44.400 --> 49:46.400
in which I would actually then

49:46.400 --> 49:48.400
like start to merge with that freeway

49:48.400 --> 49:50.400
when it's like the Joseph Campbell thing

49:50.400 --> 49:52.400
where it's like I don't

49:52.400 --> 49:54.400
truck with like what the hierarchy

49:54.400 --> 49:56.400
is telling me the older men of my church

49:56.400 --> 49:58.400
or it doesn't go up to any kind of

49:58.400 --> 50:00.400
thing so

50:00.400 --> 50:02.400
it's like politics where like some of the shit is amazing

50:02.400 --> 50:04.400
the good that gets done

50:04.400 --> 50:06.400
and then it's not

50:06.400 --> 50:08.400
some of the shit is garbage

50:08.400 --> 50:10.400
actually just straight up corruption and garbage

50:10.400 --> 50:12.400
like I go to church now

50:12.400 --> 50:14.400
and the church that I go to

50:14.400 --> 50:16.400
was able to get to Haiti before

50:16.400 --> 50:18.400
any other relief organization

50:18.400 --> 50:20.400
because there were doctors in the church

50:20.400 --> 50:22.400
and there were pilots in the church

50:22.400 --> 50:24.400
and they were able to commandeer X-ray machines

50:24.400 --> 50:26.400
and planes and get on the ground

50:26.400 --> 50:28.400
first and I do

50:28.400 --> 50:30.400
I try to do charity but sometimes

50:30.400 --> 50:32.400
if you really want to do charity you have to join a church

50:32.400 --> 50:34.400
because they've got this incredible infrastructure

50:34.400 --> 50:36.400
so like if you're trying to save people from New Orleans

50:36.400 --> 50:38.400
when the floods happen like the first

50:38.400 --> 50:40.400
places that were on the ground

50:40.400 --> 50:42.400
and that were able to get supplies out or churches

50:42.400 --> 50:44.400
so it sort of comes in handy

50:44.400 --> 50:46.400
and there's that prayer thing

50:46.400 --> 50:48.400
that works. And Heather, your partner

50:48.400 --> 50:50.400
like she's also a playwright

50:50.400 --> 50:52.400
which already Christian

50:52.400 --> 50:54.400
playwright like

50:54.400 --> 50:56.400
she's a playwright

50:56.400 --> 50:58.400
and she's a showrunner now

50:58.400 --> 51:00.400
she's got a show on Hulu

51:00.400 --> 51:02.400
she's fucking doing it

51:02.400 --> 51:04.400
Can you tell us the name?

51:04.400 --> 51:06.400
The name has not been announced

51:06.400 --> 51:08.400
but yeah

51:08.400 --> 51:10.400
she's about to move to New York and film it

51:10.400 --> 51:12.400
and I'm gonna miss her

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
My girlfriend survived breast cancer

51:14.400 --> 51:16.400
and look at me

51:16.400 --> 51:18.400
on Hulu, that's the name of the show

51:18.400 --> 51:20.400
you told me back say

51:20.400 --> 51:22.400
do we edit the podcast?

51:22.400 --> 51:24.400
I need to know

51:24.400 --> 51:26.400
This is live to air

51:26.400 --> 51:28.400
Oh yeah

51:28.400 --> 51:30.400
You look so, are you really

51:30.400 --> 51:32.400
angry about the breast cancer thing?

51:32.400 --> 51:34.400
I'm pissed about it, nobody takes my head away from me

51:34.400 --> 51:36.400
No, he's doing a thing

51:36.400 --> 51:38.400
it's like you guys are double guests

51:38.400 --> 51:40.400
it's not fair, I told him

51:40.400 --> 51:42.400
we're ending the show and at the time

51:42.400 --> 51:44.400
I thought we were ending the show end of September

51:44.400 --> 51:46.400
and I was like come on, come on the show

51:46.400 --> 51:48.400
everybody get on the show, hurry up Jesus Christ

51:48.400 --> 51:50.400
we're ending it

51:50.400 --> 51:52.400
Now I'm ending it in December

51:52.400 --> 51:54.400
and I love you guys both

51:54.400 --> 51:56.400
Nick is sitting in the

51:56.400 --> 51:58.400
in the less favorable seat

51:58.400 --> 52:00.400
and he's playing it up like a gentleman

52:00.400 --> 52:02.400
like he's kind of going like

52:02.400 --> 52:04.400
well I'm not, I don't have anything

52:04.400 --> 52:06.400
I can't like butt in with my story

52:06.400 --> 52:08.400
about Burt Reynolds

52:08.400 --> 52:10.400
Anything wrong with your dick?

52:10.400 --> 52:12.400
No, there's nothing right

52:12.400 --> 52:14.400
dick is perfect

52:14.400 --> 52:16.400
fucking tits are awesome

52:16.400 --> 52:18.400
they're firm and great

52:18.400 --> 52:20.400
I can't relate to this conversation

52:20.400 --> 52:22.400
Well I just wanted to

52:22.400 --> 52:24.400
I'm

52:24.400 --> 52:26.400
fine with that

52:26.400 --> 52:28.400
also Nick's working on Rick and Morty

52:28.400 --> 52:30.400
and he's like a wonderful

52:30.400 --> 52:32.400
super fucking cool guy

52:32.400 --> 52:34.400
like

52:34.400 --> 52:36.400
also as his own show right now

52:36.400 --> 52:38.400
while we're drilled down in this moment though

52:38.400 --> 52:40.400
when you're going through this fucking matrix

52:40.400 --> 52:42.400
where the bullet is going by you

52:42.400 --> 52:44.400
you have a Christian playwright

52:44.400 --> 52:46.400
girl friend

52:46.400 --> 52:48.400
and I want to just like

52:48.400 --> 52:50.400
finish up this thing

52:50.400 --> 52:52.400
this is a two month story

52:52.400 --> 52:54.400
she's there with you

52:54.400 --> 52:56.400
she was

52:56.400 --> 52:58.400
like oh I'm gonna go get my first mammogram

52:58.400 --> 53:00.400
ha ha ha

53:00.400 --> 53:02.400
like and then you're coming out

53:02.400 --> 53:04.400
from the end of the way and going

53:04.400 --> 53:06.400
well that went about as bad as it can go

53:06.400 --> 53:08.400
and then she's in a relation

53:08.400 --> 53:10.400
go from there

53:10.400 --> 53:12.400
so one of the

53:12.400 --> 53:14.400
ah boy

53:14.400 --> 53:16.400
this is or don't by the way

53:16.400 --> 53:18.400
I'm thinking about what

53:18.400 --> 53:20.400
a nightmare would be if she's like in New York

53:20.400 --> 53:22.400
and she's like oh I want to listen

53:22.400 --> 53:24.400
I miss and then it's just an hour

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
of me being like so what Mary said was

53:26.400 --> 53:28.400
well let me

53:28.400 --> 53:30.400
let me refine it what I want to hear

53:30.400 --> 53:32.400
about your relationship

53:32.400 --> 53:34.400
with her faith

53:34.400 --> 53:36.400
does that make sense because you're an atheist

53:36.400 --> 53:38.400
you're having this

53:38.400 --> 53:40.400
specific experience with oblivion

53:40.400 --> 53:42.400
but you happen to be life partners

53:42.400 --> 53:44.400
at the time with this person who

53:44.400 --> 53:46.400
has this other faith which can take

53:46.400 --> 53:48.400
all forms and then

53:48.400 --> 53:50.400
that's the thing that I'm interested in

53:50.400 --> 53:52.400
when you're like facing this thing

53:52.400 --> 53:54.400
and like the other person

53:54.400 --> 53:56.400
has a completely different

53:56.400 --> 53:58.400
theoretical opinion about

53:58.400 --> 54:00.400
trajectory

54:00.400 --> 54:02.400
I used to be the kind of

54:02.400 --> 54:04.400
atheist who was angry at because

54:04.400 --> 54:06.400
I grew up very Christian and then

54:06.400 --> 54:08.400
I read the Bible and then I was no longer

54:08.400 --> 54:10.400
Christian

54:10.400 --> 54:12.400
that's the genesis of atheism

54:12.400 --> 54:14.400
yeah

54:14.400 --> 54:16.400
so

54:16.400 --> 54:18.400
my experience

54:18.400 --> 54:20.400
so I know a ton about Christianity

54:20.400 --> 54:22.400
and specifically

54:22.400 --> 54:24.400
I was raised Lutheran and they're very dogmatic

54:24.400 --> 54:26.400
and so I knew

54:26.400 --> 54:28.400
a lot of like the dogma like the crunch

54:28.400 --> 54:30.400
of religion

54:30.400 --> 54:32.400
and then

54:32.400 --> 54:34.400
Lutheranism is the Linux of

54:34.400 --> 54:36.400
Christianity

54:36.400 --> 54:38.400
it's a singing church

54:38.400 --> 54:40.400
you shouldn't have to touch a mouse

54:40.400 --> 54:42.400
Catholics would use a mouse

54:42.400 --> 54:44.400
this is command line

54:44.400 --> 54:46.400
kneelers are good

54:46.400 --> 54:48.400
but the mouse we don't

54:48.400 --> 54:50.400
but so when I first

54:50.400 --> 54:52.400
came out of it I was very angry at Christians

54:52.400 --> 54:54.400
because I was like how have you not

54:54.400 --> 54:56.400
done your homework like just do your

54:56.400 --> 54:58.400
fucking homework and you'll see that this is all ridiculous

54:58.400 --> 55:00.400
and then

55:00.400 --> 55:02.400
I

55:02.400 --> 55:04.400
realized this boy

55:04.400 --> 55:06.400
saying this is a form of

55:06.400 --> 55:08.400
arrogance and narcissism

55:08.400 --> 55:10.400
love it

55:10.400 --> 55:12.400
but I realized

55:12.400 --> 55:14.400
that it was narcissistic

55:14.400 --> 55:16.400
and arrogant to tell other people

55:16.400 --> 55:18.400
that I knew more about

55:18.400 --> 55:20.400
what they had

55:20.400 --> 55:22.400
experienced in life than they had

55:22.400 --> 55:24.400
love it and

55:24.400 --> 55:26.400
from that elevated

55:26.400 --> 55:28.400
position

55:28.400 --> 55:30.400
love it

55:30.400 --> 55:32.400
decided

55:32.400 --> 55:34.400
that if I was to truly be

55:34.400 --> 55:36.400
a nihilist when it came to

55:36.400 --> 55:38.400
the afterlife and our experience of the present

55:38.400 --> 55:40.400
then

55:40.400 --> 55:42.400
I had

55:42.400 --> 55:44.400
there was no difference between being Christian

55:44.400 --> 55:46.400
and being an atheist

55:46.400 --> 55:48.400
love it

55:48.400 --> 55:50.400
yes queen

55:50.400 --> 55:52.400
so

55:52.400 --> 55:54.400
then I was like this is great

55:54.400 --> 55:56.400
she's Christian that's great

55:56.400 --> 55:58.400
that's Campbell

55:58.400 --> 56:00.400
he's just like alright fuck it

56:00.400 --> 56:02.400
me as well no wrong answers

56:02.400 --> 56:04.400
right

56:04.400 --> 56:06.400
because none of it doesn't matter

56:06.400 --> 56:08.400
anyway

56:08.400 --> 56:10.400
so yeah that's how I felt

56:10.400 --> 56:12.400
about it is that do you go to church with her

56:12.400 --> 56:14.400
I have gone to church with her

56:14.400 --> 56:16.400
I went to the church for the first time in

56:16.400 --> 56:18.400
more than 20 years

56:18.400 --> 56:20.400
I found it really charming

56:20.400 --> 56:22.400
yeah

56:22.400 --> 56:24.400
I was like

56:24.400 --> 56:26.400
oh man I really expected

56:26.400 --> 56:28.400
I expected to be deeply uncomfortable

56:28.400 --> 56:30.400
and have a lot of social anxiety in that

56:30.400 --> 56:32.400
space and instead I was like this is

56:32.400 --> 56:34.400
kind of a great

56:34.400 --> 56:36.400
meditation camp like everybody's

56:36.400 --> 56:38.400
standing and sitting at the same time

56:38.400 --> 56:40.400
big church

56:40.400 --> 56:42.400
we went to the one on

56:42.400 --> 56:44.400
on Highland behind Hollywood

56:44.400 --> 56:46.400
is that Hollywood showrunner church

56:46.400 --> 56:48.400
I don't know man

56:48.400 --> 56:50.400
that's where

56:50.400 --> 56:52.400
yeah that's Hollywood showrunner church

56:52.400 --> 56:54.400
it's where you have a lot of guilt

56:54.400 --> 56:56.400
for how good

56:56.400 --> 56:58.400
you've got it

56:58.400 --> 57:00.400
Dan does sermons there

57:00.400 --> 57:02.400
me and Vince Gilligan

57:02.400 --> 57:04.400
like give each other communion

57:06.400 --> 57:08.400
other we put our heads up

57:08.400 --> 57:10.400
each other's asses and pull it out

57:10.400 --> 57:12.400
yeah

57:12.400 --> 57:14.400
we do an interview with the rap

57:14.400 --> 57:16.400
but at the end

57:16.400 --> 57:18.400
of it I was like you know if you want to do this

57:18.400 --> 57:20.400
I would totally do it again

57:20.400 --> 57:22.400
because it was she

57:22.400 --> 57:24.400
really really really likes it

57:24.400 --> 57:26.400
what denomination was that

57:26.400 --> 57:28.400
is she Methodist? yeah she's Methodist

57:28.400 --> 57:30.400
yeah so

57:30.400 --> 57:32.400
did you false? I adjusted

57:32.400 --> 57:34.400
furniture I thought it was a good time

57:34.400 --> 57:36.400
right

57:36.400 --> 57:38.400
you gotta

57:38.400 --> 57:40.400
sneak it in

57:40.400 --> 57:42.400
her uh

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
everybody

57:44.400 --> 57:46.400
everybody she knew

57:46.400 --> 57:48.400
was praying for me and they would like

57:48.400 --> 57:50.400
text me that they were praying for me

57:50.400 --> 57:52.400
and all her friends are very Christian

57:52.400 --> 57:54.400
and I have no Christian friends

57:54.400 --> 57:56.400
so it's very like they would be like

57:56.400 --> 57:58.400
we're praying for you and then I talked to my therapist

57:58.400 --> 58:00.400
about it and she was like well that's not good

58:00.400 --> 58:02.400
because

58:02.400 --> 58:04.400
no because if you think

58:04.400 --> 58:06.400
so there's another study where if other people

58:06.400 --> 58:08.400
are praying for you you're more likely to die

58:08.400 --> 58:10.400
whoa

58:10.400 --> 58:12.400
what are these studies? whether you know it or not

58:12.400 --> 58:14.400
okay well that's backwards math

58:14.400 --> 58:16.400
everyone prays for clearly

58:16.400 --> 58:18.400
dying people more

58:18.400 --> 58:20.400
that's a backwards

58:20.400 --> 58:22.400
but no they've done like a blind study

58:22.400 --> 58:24.400
and like if nobody's praying for you

58:24.400 --> 58:26.400
and you

58:26.400 --> 58:28.400
are more likely to live and if even if you don't

58:28.400 --> 58:30.400
know the person and they don't

58:30.400 --> 58:32.400
know you're praying for them you're more likely to

58:32.400 --> 58:34.400
die no wait come on

58:34.400 --> 58:36.400
it's quantum entanglement

58:36.400 --> 58:38.400
or some bullshit like who knows

58:38.400 --> 58:40.400
that means that god only cares about

58:40.400 --> 58:42.400
you and if

58:42.400 --> 58:44.400
other people care about you then you die

58:44.400 --> 58:46.400
but if you only care about you then you live

58:46.400 --> 58:48.400
I believe in that god there's like

58:48.400 --> 58:50.400
there's a religion yeah he's a jealous guy

58:50.400 --> 58:52.400
he's like

58:52.400 --> 58:54.400
I don't want Dan Harmon

58:54.400 --> 58:56.400
to be hedging in on my game

58:56.400 --> 58:58.400
I feel like my heart stopping

58:58.400 --> 59:00.400
while I say that it's not a Lutheran

59:00.400 --> 59:02.400
thing like do you feel

59:02.400 --> 59:04.400
blasphemous when you do bits about

59:04.400 --> 59:06.400
anything that's like in that area

59:06.400 --> 59:08.400
no not anymore I mean when I first

59:08.400 --> 59:10.400
when I first I feel like shortness of breath

59:10.400 --> 59:12.400
oh yeah when I first did it I was like

59:12.400 --> 59:14.400
this when I first even in myself

59:14.400 --> 59:16.400
in my head secretly quietly was like

59:16.400 --> 59:18.400
I don't believe in God I was sure I was gonna die

59:18.400 --> 59:20.400
immediately and then nothing happened

59:20.400 --> 59:22.400
for years

59:22.400 --> 59:24.400
Lutheranism is the deep fry

59:24.400 --> 59:26.400
of Christianity

59:26.400 --> 59:28.400
of Protestant Christianity it basically

59:28.400 --> 59:30.400
was like you don't even have to go to church

59:30.400 --> 59:32.400
your family just has to be

59:32.400 --> 59:34.400
fucking repressed

59:34.400 --> 59:36.400
like they have to just have infused

59:36.400 --> 59:38.400
into them the idea

59:38.400 --> 59:40.400
that Jesus Christ is Freddy Krueger

59:40.400 --> 59:42.400
and he will get you

59:42.400 --> 59:44.400
he's gonna get you like you've

59:44.400 --> 59:46.400
done it wrong and it's like

59:46.400 --> 59:48.400
fuck Catholics but

59:48.400 --> 59:52.400
fuck you

59:52.400 --> 59:54.400
that's my

59:54.400 --> 59:56.400
personal testimony and according

59:56.400 --> 59:58.400
to today's politics I get to say it cause

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.400
I'm technically Lutheran

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.400
it's a bag of shit

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
it started with a good idea

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.400
hey this Bible should be in German

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400
now look at it

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.400
you know what I

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.400
rhubarb pie

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.400
it's true

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.400
wait what isn't everybody in Lake

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.400
Wobagon it doesn't matter

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400
it doesn't matter

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400
let's move on

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400
Nick were you raised religious

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.400
Nick

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.400
yeah

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
don't fuck this up

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400
I don't want to hear what Heather has to say

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400
no don't I was raised Catholic

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400
okay

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.400
my grandmother is

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.400
from Mexico

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.400
yeah I know

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.400
who said oh

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.400
that was me

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
that was me you think this audience

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.400
is gonna make an audible sound

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400
no they haven't yet

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400
and when did you

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400
stop going to church

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.400
as soon as I got confirmed

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400
my grandmother was

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400
really Catholic

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400
well

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.400
we would go on major holidays

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400
but it just seemed

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.400
like a big ritual

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400
okay hey Catholic

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.400
what are they confirming

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.400
what is being confirmed

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.400
being confirmed means that

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400
Jesus likes you

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.400
come on

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.400
I don't know

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400
you don't know what was confirmed

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400
I really did like a latecomer Catholic

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400
course where like it was like

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400
I can't get a straight answer

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400
about this I'm 46 years old every Catholic

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400
I go like what was

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.400
confirmed

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400
you have to go through

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400
so everybody's got like a 12

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400
here we go Baptist town everybody

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400
what to do

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400
here's why the Catholics don't like

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400
your body is

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400
I thought

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400
I thought

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.400
everybody's got to write a passage

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400
in about 1213 even even Jews

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.400
sure I mean yeah but

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.400
why is it that's what I'm saying

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400
everyone also has a spring equinox

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400
it's a reinforcement

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400
that you're sort of

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400
involved in the church and you're able to do things

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400
in the church it's sort of like

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.400
well you can be an altar boy

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400
do things you can be an altar boy

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400
it's like when evite sends you an email and says

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.400
are you coming

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.400
and then you have to click the link again

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400
because the guests are like freaking out

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.400
they want to know

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.400
I think it's that

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.400
when you're baptized you're too young

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.400
to know what you are accepting

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400
and confirmation is a confirmation

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400
of the things that you accepted

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400
in your soul when you consent

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400
you consent

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400
look at me I've been close to that

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.400
it's a spiritual age of consent

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.400
it's a little bit of a mix because if you're

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400
Baptist you get dumped all

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400
this is bullshit but you get dumped

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400
all the way down and then you

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.400
well they're Baptist if they don't fucking

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.400
stuff that shit

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.400
they're gonna lose to the next

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.400
confirmed you're christened

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400
just a little just a little different

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.400
wait confirmed then you're christened

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400
first you get christened then you get confirmed

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400
they dribble a little water on you

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.400
I feel like I remember some water

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.400
getting dribbled on me

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.400
but I'm Lutheran

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400
that would be confirmation

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400
I'd be a Baptist

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400
you can get baptized as a little baby

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400
you remember getting baptized as a baby

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400
shit

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.400
you are the Messiah

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.400
I remember going to church with my grandma

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.400
and

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.400
they were something and they were like come up

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.400
now for the cracker

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400
or the wine and then like

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.400
you were a baby crawled up

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400
I was like six or something

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.400
and I went up and did a thing

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.400
and then like it was a big to do

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.400
when I came back to the seat everyone was like

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400
I can't believe you did that oh my god

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400
I'm like what are you talking about

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400
they're like you oh

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400
he ate the cracker and drank the wine

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400
like the whole family

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400
talked about it the rest of the day I was like what did I do

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.400
I did something wrong

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.400
and now everyone's happy

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400
I went up and I did two things

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.400
as a baby

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.400
well it wasn't a baby no I wasn't a baby

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400
this isn't my baptism story

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400
but you remember the baptism as well

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.400
no I don't remember a baptism

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.400
I remember having some water trickle on me

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400
sorry

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.400
let's talk about

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400
Mario Brothers

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400
I

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400
I want to get this straight

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.400
I have a memory

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400
of some water being

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400
trickled on my head

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400
I don't know what that was

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.400
probably it could be really anything

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.400
yeah

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.400
yeah

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400
that could be $50

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.400
in Reno

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.400
I'm not talking about religion anymore

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400
were you smoking

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.400
I have a separate memory

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400
without telling you I was running through

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400
all of my memories of being in a church

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.400
ever

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.400
and so then the second one was that I

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.400
yeah and then I was running into that

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.400
and you guys were picturing a baby

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.400
but no the second memory was

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.400
there was something about communion and like a thing

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400
with the wine or something

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.400
yeah it doesn't matter

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.400
no it matters a lot to some people

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.400
yeah

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400
especially God

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.400
give a fuck about the monkey ass rituals

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.400
who has the shortest weddings

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.400
Greek Orthodox is the longest

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.400
who's the shortest wedding

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.400
out of all the Christian religion

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.400
I imagine that like poor

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.400
poor people

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.400
because they're like no

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.400
they're like you will not be getting a meal

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.400
after we say I do

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.400
so I do goodnight

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.400
you ever go to a Greek Orthodox wedding

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.400
those people don't give a fuck

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.400
about what

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.400
about whether you leave there

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.400
with a favorable opinion about their

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.400
well I should be Greek

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.400
nope you're not going to think that

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.400
you're going to be like I got better things to do

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.400
that is a two hour wedding

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.400
I don't think I have is that Jesse from

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.400
Full House

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400
he's the only one

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.400
he's great

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.400
if you have a wedding with

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.400
Greek Orthodox will put your ass on the ground

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.400
I don't know any

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400
Greek Orthodox people

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.400
you do Bill Cot

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400
oh okay

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400
the Orthodox wedding where the

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.400
bride and groom

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.400
stare at a statue for three minutes

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.400
wait what?

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.400
the bride and groom are now going to contemplate

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400
the Virgin Mary

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400
oh

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.400
just look at it

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.400
I said it was Olmec from

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.400
Legends of the Hidden Temple

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.400
it would be a good statue to stare at

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.400
the silver snakes

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.400
look

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.400
we got a lot of time to fill

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.400
let's pick it up

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.400
like a Greek Orthodox

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.400

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.400
in Greek Orthodox

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.400
Greek Orthodox

work on anything else

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.400

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.400

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.400
ah

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.400
ah

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.400
ah

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400
ah

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.400
that really is wrong

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.400
that's brandon's impression of

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.400
starting Rob Schrab as a car

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.400
yeah yeah he's going to kill me

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.400
I

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.400
ah

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.400
I did that's the full

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.400
impression

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.400
there seems to be an inordinate

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400
amount of spiders at my house

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.400
but we don't care about that

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.400
is that a topic that you have

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.400
is that a transition

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.400
did you

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400
did you put up notes and were just like

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400
spiders

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400
coiling cable

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.400
that's it

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.400
that's the only thing I have

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.400
I have one thing about you

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.400
which is that you were the featured singer in improv

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.400
everywhere's food court musical

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400
boy

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.400
I want to hear about that

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400
because I saw that on wikipedia and I was like

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.400
oh I remember improv anywhere

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.400
can we play it?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.400
no

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400
there was a pilot for NBC

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400
for improv everywhere

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400
oh that's what this is

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.400
and I was in a bit

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.400
and for whoever it is

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.400
the choices made on my wikipedia

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.400
of what to highlight

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.400
it baffles me

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.400
it's like a web series I did

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.400
in like 2007

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400
that's got prime placement

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.400
but

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400
we went down to

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.400
a mall

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.400
here

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400
I don't even know the name of the mall

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400
it was not

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.400
the grove or the americana

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400
then who cares

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.400
a mall

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.400
and I had to work as a

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.400
hot dog on a stick

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400
girl for the entirety of the day

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.400
and the manager came from

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.400
central management and taught me how to do

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.400
the job

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.400
and I had an earwig in

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.400
and at some point during the day

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400
the earwig would go beep beep beep

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.400
and that was the sound

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.400
of that was go

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.400
and the note

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.400
of the beeping was my

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.400
key

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400
they're just going to decide that

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400
oh it's D sharp this time

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.400
beep beep

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.400
and then I had to start singing

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.400
to whoever I was serving

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400
and then I would leap over the counter

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.400
and eventually the entire food court

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400
would turn into a full musical

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.400
for half of the people there

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.400
one of those pranks without any

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400
nobody was being pranked

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400
except the people doing it

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400
which I would prefer

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.400
to the actual

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.400
let's watch what this guy does

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.400
when he thinks he's not being recorded on camera

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400
someone tells him that there's shit on his

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.400
car

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.400
or the people getting in the elevator

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.400
and the elevator floor drops out

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400
that's a nightmare

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400
I want to go back to dance prank

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400
so

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.400
they just go up to a guy and say there's shit on your car

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.400
I don't like

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.400
prank shows

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.400
I don't like that

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.400
you have a bunch of cameras on a person

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400
that doesn't know they're on camera

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.400
and they're the mark

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.400
the least you could do is

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.400
elevate that person

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.400
I want to hear more about this show

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.400
I've already talked about my feelings about prank shows

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.400
that was it

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400
so I sang a song

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.400
but how many tanks?

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.400
we did two because you had to wait until the mall

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.400
cleared

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.400
because I imagine so everyone

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.400
shopping in the mall

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.400
here's this event happening

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.400
and they'd be like what the fuck is happening

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.400
and there were people dancing

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.400
not me

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.400
I saw y'all do that the first time

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.400
improv everywhere

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.400
she going to start singing everybody

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.400
I'll take a giant coke

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400
cause shit to me

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.400
that dude

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.400
how did they get everybody out

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400
it was hours

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.400
that's why I had to know how to do the job

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.400
did you make the lemonade?

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400
I did the whole job

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400
for hours

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400
I always wanted to work at hot dog on the stick

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.400
the hats

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.400
they're so tall

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400
there is something like really Dennis Hopper

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.400
70's

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.400
conceptual movie about that

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.400
there were definitely

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.400
not even arguably but definitely more people

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.400
on the payroll than there were

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.400
civilians

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.400
the prank show was allowing them

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400
improv everywhere started

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400
with the idea of like

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.400
we'll set up on the street corner

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.400
and there will be normal people

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.400
and then we're doing it for NBC

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.400
and then they're like

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.400
ok well

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400
everyone involved has to sign an NDA

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400
and a waiver

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.400
and get a job somewhere else

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.400
people

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400
and you're churning butter

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400
and packing

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.400
you're doing actual work

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.400
and you're waiting for that's amazing to me

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.400
it's funny

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.400
the improv everywhere stuff started

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400
it was the grand central station stuff

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.400
at the same time

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.400
the fucking pressure though

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.400
wait was the song written?

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.400
yeah the song was written

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400
and it was acapella

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.400
for the first like 2-3

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.400
measures or something

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.400
but the important thing to the show

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.400
the important thing to the show was that the customer

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.400
was a genuine

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400
person

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400
so if they started screaming the N word at you

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.400
like if they were like

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.400
I'll take a Diet Coke and you're like

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.400
they have a feeling and they're like

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400
N word, N word, N word

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400
because they're from 4chan and they're like

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400
let's culture jam

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400
the day is shot

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.400
we would have reset and waited

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.400
because there were 3 attempts

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.400
but only 2 takes

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400
and one of the attempts

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.400
the woman was on her cell phone

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400
when she ordered

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.400
and her hand just started shaking

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.400
and she wouldn't look up from her phone

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400
because she thought she was going

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.400
crazy

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400
Jesus Christ you could have driven someone in singing

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400
like she just

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.400
stared at her phone

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.400
I'm like singing right here with a big smile

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.400
the subtle feeling that everyone is watching you

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.400
is absolutely

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.400
symptomatic of like fucking

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.400
oh my god you could have driven

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.400
someone to snap

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400
so we didn't use that

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.400
we bailed

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.400
you didn't use that snuff film

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400
but if

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.400
shit had gone wrong

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400
are you telling me

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.400
you guys didn't get

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.400
a safety that was a

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.400
PA going up and going

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.400
I'll have a hot dog

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.400
oh what's happening

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.400
just while you're there

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.400
I've been on other prank shows

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.400
where we have

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.400
I wrote for a kids show where they used

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400
a couple plans name it

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.400
it's cancel culture

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.400
that's a great name

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.400
cancel culture

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.400
cancel this show

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.400
super sloppy double dare

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400
you're finished

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400
what's the thing

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.400
it was called incredible crew

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.400
it's over

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.400
no but redone

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.400
and there were a couple plants

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.400
because there were a couple times where they couldn't get a reaction

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400
out of a regular person

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.400
to what

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.400
what kind of reactions were there

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.400
what was a kids show

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.400
I'm picking your nose while making your smoothies

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.400
I got your nose

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.400
it was

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.400
a little more elevated than that

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.400
I'm picking my butt while making

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.400
your smoothies

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.400
there was a girl with a dog

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.400
in a carrier

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.400
and there was a dog

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.400
in a cat carrier

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.400
which would be fucking nuts

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.400
it's not built for them

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.400
but the carrier was going

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.400
crazy and people didn't care

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.400
they were just like

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.400
who cares about that person's dog

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.400
so you had to have somebody

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.400
go up and be like oh no

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.400
which would cue other people to be like

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400
I've talked about this way too much

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.400
but my favorite prank show

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.400
the only one that ever made me feel good to watch

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.400
was the Alan Funt Playboy Channel

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.400
prank show

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.400
that he did 12 episodes of

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.400
and it was like I'm Alan Funt

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.400
and I'm famous for candid camera

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.400
but I'm doing this playboy show

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.400
and so it was like

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.400
the budget was $500

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.400
so it was basically just like any guy

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.400
who answered an ad that was like

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.400
you can work

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.400
today for this amount of money

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.400
which is more money than he was ever going to get

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.400
they tell him your job is

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.400
to sit at this desk in this identical

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.400
ridiculous shitty

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.400
sparse office building room

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.400
and if anything

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.400
happens just give me a call

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400
and the guy

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.400
all they did

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.400
was just 12 episodes of guys sitting

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.400
in an office and then naked women would come in

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.400
or women that would

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.400
come in fully clothed and then when they heard

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.400
they had to wait they would get naked

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.400
or like guys that were like magicians

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.400
they would generate a naked woman

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.400
but it was just like 12 variations on

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.400
a naked lady and the guy reacting

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.400
but the guy was never the mark

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.400
the guy would always be like

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.400
I think you were the mark in that show

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.400
I fucking loved it

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.400
before I realized as an adult I realized

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.400
oh fuck you know what ruins this show

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.400
for me is I just realized like

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.400
it's probably not Alan Funt's voice

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.400
that's actually talking to them

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.400
because why wouldn't he if he was available

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.400
why wouldn't he have been part of the show

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.400
as a 15 year old who was

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.400
busy jerking off to all the other

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.400
Playboy Channel content

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.400
I was like not thinking about it but I was like

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.400
this is a good prank show

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.400
because Alan Funt was basically calling

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.400
these guys on the phone and going

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.400
hey how's it going over there

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.400
and then the guy would go

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.400
uh I don't know

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400
there's a naked lady

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.400
what there's a naked lady

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.400
what the fuck are you talking about

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.400
why is she naked

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.400
I don't

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.400
I don't know I don't know

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.400
well ask her

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.400
he wants to know

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.400
why are you naked

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.400
cause I'm the best

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.400
I'm the booby dooby

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.400
and the woobie

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.400
she said hey what

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.400
can I ask you a question

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.400
what's your name

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.400
Mario

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.400
Mario what in the fuck

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400
is going on over there

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.400
it was fucking

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.400
fantastic I like that this show is just your

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.400
refractory period between

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.400
jerking off

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.400
he would just be exhausted laying out

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.400
I had two weeks to change

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.400
the channel what else is up

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.400
okay this is a good transition

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.400
they used to call that channel

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.400
the only unscramble one

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.400
that was

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.400
next up is another girl four years older

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.400
than you even though you're

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.400
anyways

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.400
so what uh oh gosh

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.400
what's it like to be a lesbian

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.400
go in any order

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.400
yeah

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400
I imagine it's great

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.400
it would be the best

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.400
you know women are

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.400
understanding and accepting

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.400
and god damn

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.400
if I can only be one

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400
that was really beautiful

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400
thanks

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.400
I'm sure you have a different opinion

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.400
it's great

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.400
well I'll tell you how it really is

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.400
okay please

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.400
I think it's like

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.400
Millennium Falcon

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.400
uh huh yeah I'm in no I'm in

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.400
go ahead

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.400
I didn't know you had a real answer

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.400
who me

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.400
wait was that not a real question

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400
oh god

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.400
please answer it for God's sake

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.400
it's great it's great

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.400
it's great it's great

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.400
I love it I love it

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.400
I participate in lesbian culture

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.400
I hate it

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.400
I hate it so much

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.400
I mean I'm a gay woman

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.400
who doesn't identify as a gay woman

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.400
it's probably impossible to identify

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400
as anything right

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400
but I

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.400
talk about the relationship

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.400
with performer status as long as we're there

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400
like because it's like there's

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.400
a part of you we had this conversation

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.400
years ago

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.400
it's like you weren't not

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.400
out but you hadn't come out

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.400
yeah so

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.400
for a long time I was out to

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400
you know anybody who I knew

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.400
uh but then I was not

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.400
out like on social media

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.400
or anything because I didn't want it to be

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.400
my brand yeah I don't

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.400
I don't want to be I don't want to be

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.400
a gay writer I don't want to be a gay

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.400
comedian or like

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.400
I'd be a loser

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400
comedian that works for me but

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400
like I don't it's I don't

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.400
think about it

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.400
at all and I don't have any

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.400
pride in it

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.400
at all like I don't feel like I did anything

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.400
Sarah Silverman said the same thing about

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400
like well and this was like

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.400
a million years ago she said the same thing about

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.400
Judaism about being Jewish yeah

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.400
yeah and it was like and that's important

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.400
I interject that in case anyways fur bristles

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.400
because we're like living this age of like

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400
fucking own it or like whatever

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.400
you would war with this or it war with that but like

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.400
Sarah's never she's not

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.400
hiding from her Judaism but at the same

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400
time I remember her

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.400
saying back then it's like oh I try to

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.400
like like try to like cushion

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400
this distance like you don't want to like

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400
am I the Jewish this some of the Jewish

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400
that or am I am I

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.400
just all of this other stuff and on top

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400
of that I'm Jewish yeah I think that there's a

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400
new you know obviously there's a new school

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.400
of thought where like identity is

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.400
like all of the pride that you take

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400
in your gender

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.400
slash sexual identity

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.400
slash personal identity

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.400
all those things are like important

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.400
because then you are also demonstrating

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.400
a confidence to younger generations

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.400
and and providing that I don't

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.400
feel like I owe those

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.400
people anything so I don't want to do

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.400
so what was the because you

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.400
came out yeah a year ago

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.400
so I came out a year ago

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.400
in large part

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400
because I felt like hiding

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.400
my

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.400
relationship with my girlfriend was

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.400
denying that I was in a

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.400
relationship with my girlfriend

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.400
like I would talk about literally

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.400
everything else like I talked about like going

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.400
to the fucking hospital or

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.400
like you know

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.400
anything but I wouldn't

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.400
I didn't ever talk about my relationships

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.400
online

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.400
and it's sort of came to

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.400
a place where I was like this is weird

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.400
like it's it's actively weird

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.400
it's weird that you can't do what other comics do

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.400
which is involve their

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.400
life and their work

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.400
yeah yeah so I so I was like well

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.400
I guess for coming out they all come out

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.400
and that was that and then now I'm out

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.400
and it's a nightmare

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.400
it's a nightmare

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.400
it's an awful nightmare

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.400
you don't have to answer that

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.400
no it's fine nothing changed

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.400
nothing matters

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.400
is that why it's a nightmare

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.400
no no I

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.400
I don't like this line

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400
question yeah man I don't know man like it's

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.400
all right well I didn't

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.400
yes I did I asked it but

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.400
no nothing's changed it's the same

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.400
you expect there to be

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400
a transformation at the end

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.400
of that journey and there isn't one

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.400
no I mean I don't I think

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.400
you're using the royal you

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.400
I see all people as a beam of light

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.400
whoa is that true

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.400
that's gotta be crazy I don't even know who you are

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.400
have you worked with Jeff

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.400
have you guys ever been on the same stage at Who's Line

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.400
Jeff Davis yeah we

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.400
weren't at Who's Line but we did a

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.400
show called Drew Carey's Improvaganza

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400
together and just keep it seems like

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400
you miss each other just coincidentally

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400
we on Who's Line

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400
that's because there's only four chairs

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.400
so three chairs are permanent and the fourth chair

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.400
is rotating so

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.400
we can't ever be on the same episode

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.400
excellent

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400
more importantly you were

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.400
on screen with Jeff Davis

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400
when you

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400
me and he won an Emmy

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.400
for Chris Hardwick

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.400
we gave them their Emmy winning episode

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.400
yeah of course we did

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.400
it was excellent we did a great

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.400
it was an amazing fucking episode

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.400
it won an Emmy

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.400
no I wasn't fishing for it actually

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.400
the pause you took before you

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.400
it makes your clap

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.400
it's fruit of the poison tree

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.400
I think their pause was like what the fuck

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.400
are they talking about

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.400
what are we supporting with this

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.400
then don't applaud

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.400
if you don't applaud

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.400
spontaneously don't applaud at all

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.400
I don't want your favor

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.400
I don't know if that's true

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.400
well at the

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.400
yeah

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.400
it's goddamn professional y'all

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.400
goddamn pro

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.400
this is one of those episodes

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.400
I don't listen back to

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.400
this one's good

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.400
that doesn't mean anything

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.400
goddamn

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.400
give us the fucking dirt on Jordan Peele

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.400
does he even show up around there

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.400
at Twilight Zone

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.400
he comes in and he goes you know what

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.400
I think this time should be

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.400
less Twilight I wonder what that's like

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.400
come on

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.400
you're gonna foam it

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.400
you know what I don't like Rick and Morty anymore

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.400
no

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.400
I don't want to say

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.400
we continue to be the same person

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.400
he gets in a space ship

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.400
he's got his kid grand kid

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400
with him whatever they go do some flubid

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.400
are we sure this isn't the last episode

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400
of the show

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.400
Jordan Peele shows up less than I do for sure

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.400
no he's running the room he's there

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.400
every day

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.400
lies

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.400
it's true

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.400
he's there

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.400
he's there every day

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.400
but if he was just there on Monday

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.400
it would still be true

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400
wait no he's there

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.400
every time we're in the room he's there

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.400
that's the truth

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400
does he have a world book for Twilight Zone

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.400
I think thought in his movies

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.400
he made like extensive world books

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.400
oh like a

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.400
encyclopedia of the world of his episode

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.400
like a big bible well like yeah like a show bible

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.400
that helps kind of like direct ideas

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.400
in the show

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.400
that's fine no wait I'm hung up on this thing

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.400
are you for real no irony

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.400
nothing like Jordan Peele

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.400
is for real

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.400
in the Twilight Zone writers room

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.400
every single

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.400
what the fuck

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.400
he's really there every time yeah

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.400
he's just hanging out

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.400
obviously working he wouldn't want to hang out

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400
he's running the room it's great

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400
what the fuck

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400
what's it like

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400
I mean keep peeled

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.400
I mean at a certain point don't you want

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400
these dicks to chase their tails for a while

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400
he uh he

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.400
he what he what he was not

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.400
he supports you he gives you his guidance

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.400
does he encourage you

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400
sure he sure sometimes he'll

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.400
tell you you've done wrong but that's okay

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.400
look they're not staffing

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.400
it's

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.400
you never know I tried to get her on

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.400
Rick and Morty you can't

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400
you're not migrating over there

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400
you know

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.400
what they got it you know what

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.400
Dan they got it easy over there

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.400
writing horror

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.400
what yeah you

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.400

say it Dan well that is my next

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.400
question so

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.400
yeah easy peasy

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400
yeah

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.400
wasn't funny but everybody

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400
still laughed

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.400
worse horror schmarr

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.400
comedy comedy comedy

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.400
I don't know why I'm creating

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.400
this weird rift

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.400
I'm too

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400
I'm seeing triple of everything

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.400
well there are three people

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.400
you

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.400
you've uh you've been in comedy

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.400
writers rooms sketch writers rooms so like

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.400
for real like in a post black

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.400
mirror world like this

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.400
Twilight Zone thing happens like

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.400
what is there any insight you can give us

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.400
what the difficulty is when you're

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.400
in a writer's room working on

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.400
Twilight Zone I'm gonna give some insight

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.400
into writing on it and Morty

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.400
if you needed time to think about it

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.400
go ahead go ahead

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.400
it wouldn't have been funny if I followed

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.400
your answer I just

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.400
my me interrupting

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.400
was this what I wanted to say

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.400
that was it me interrupting

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.400
what I want to say

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.400
me interrupting was a big interruption

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.400
because there's something

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400
there that you interrupt

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.400
was the thing I wanted to say I really

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.400
wanted to hear what I say whatever it is

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.400
so the the

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.400
I can't I don't know what I can the

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.400
NDA for that show is fuck that

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.400
fucking thick it can't be that what

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.400
don't talk about anything big deal

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.400
right that's beatable

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.400
I can beat that in court I'll take

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.400
the heat dance go

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.400
do not do not

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.400
let him

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.400
hey I said it's okay

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.400
to talk about everything

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.400
the first season was different than

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.400
the second season Jordan's there all the time

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.400
yes and

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.400
it's I mean it's

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.400
fucking great it's great I

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400
look it's all of my sketch

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.400
and comedy ideas were

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.400
Twilight Zone ideas previous to

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.400
being on the Twilight Zone they were always

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.400
nightmares for whoever was in

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.400
the thing like they're not

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.400
they're not fun

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400
they're not fun the things that I

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.400
wrote as comedy were horrible

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.400
nightmares and now I just don't have to

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.400
put in the laugh bits it's great I know

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.400
it would have been nice to have you and stuff

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.400
I would I mean I'm hoping

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.400
well yeah I would really

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.400
that was so cool

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.400
you're hoping you're hoping but you know

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.400
like the Twilight Zone train just keeps chugging

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.400
and you know

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.400
but who conducts the train

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.400
see that's pretty good for

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.400
horror stuff right a train

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.400
that there's no conductor on that would work

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.400
tell Jordan about that

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.400
tell them that was my idea

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400
tell them that was my idea

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.400
they're not hiring

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.400
but you go there and it's just a conductor hat

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.400
they pulled up and it's a skeleton

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.400
that'd be fun right that'd be a fun episode

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.400
I wish I thought you said who can touch

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.400
the train

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.400
now we collaborate on one that's ours that's ours

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.400
that's hilarious that's ours

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:44.400
it's a train that can't be touched

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.400
when Jordan

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.400
comes into the writer's room is he like

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.400
he's like

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.400
he comes in at like 11 30 right

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.400
no he's touched really early

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.400
and he's like god damn I finally

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.400
figured out how to instagram my work out

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.400
I think it's crazy that you think 11 30

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.400
is an early time to come into an office

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.400
I don't think he thinks it is

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.400
early I think he thinks it's fine

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.400
he wants to know it's a fine time

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.400
all right let's move on

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.400
fine I just I just honestly

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.400
you really did it to yourself

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.400
every day Jordan Peele goes into the toilet

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.400
you are doing it to yourself

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.400
get out of that hole

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.400
I mean

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.400
you know he wrote key appeal and get out

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.400
in the same time frame

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.400
can I can I monster

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.400
since you have his ear

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.400
can you

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.400
can I can I pitch that's a good episode

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.400
ooh I've got Jordan

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.400
can you pitch Jordan Peele

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.400
where's my ear I'm Jordan

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.400
ooh it's right here

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.400
this is my pitch for a Twilight Zone

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.400
imagine being a showrunner

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.400
that goes in at

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.400
10 a.m. every day

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.400
guys first off he was on

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.400
your show he's on rigging morning

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.400
like you can talk to him

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.400
well yeah he didn't make the

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.400
Twilight Zone yet he was playing

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.400
a testicle head

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.400
but I didn't have a chance to talk to him

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.400
but I didn't get a chance to say to him

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.400
like if you like

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.400
make if you if you're

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.400
allowed to not are you going to

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.400
show up in the writer's room at a drama

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.400
yeah yeah it's a good

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.400
anthological drama

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.400
damn why is this mine going to you

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.400
yeah

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.400
incredible also didn't show up for the

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:26.400
record when Jordan Peele stopped by

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.400
bruh that's true

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.400
god damn

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.400
what does it take

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.400
you were meant to direct

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.400
this isn't what this podcast is supposed to be about

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.400
brother bird where are you going

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.400
I'm just like look

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.400
here I want to mic this

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.400
oh yeah

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.400
oh that's delicious I see

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.400
your ghost is pouring themselves a drink

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.400
that'd be a good episode

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.400
ghost alcoholic

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.400
that was the thing that broke

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.400
my heart Heather by the way

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.400
we were talking

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.400
is that you

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.400
you like me you're like

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.400
hey let's drink

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.400
and then like just by virtue

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.400
of this garbage thing

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.400
that you would think just shoots through your life

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.400
and either leaves you living or dead

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.400
and then it's like

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.400
but you're not

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.400
allowed to really drink

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.400
yes I was a heavy

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.400
an enthusiastic drinker

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.400
previous

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.400
actually a few years ago

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.400
I took a boxing

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.400
and I was boxing so much that it was

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:36.400
harder for me to drink so there was

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.400
a nice

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.400
gradient between like the years

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.400
where I was like this is the thing

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:44.400
that I love

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.400
more than anything and then not being able

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.400
to drink really anymore

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.400
and so it was a bummer that when we

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.400
finally got to sit down and have a drink

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.400
I was like I get to have a beer

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.400
and that's it

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400
and I'm like

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.400
you complained about it the whole time

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.400
wait what do you mean

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.400
give it to me

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.400
damn it

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.400
that's how I'm going out

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.400
what did I do

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.400
you were very kind

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.400
and understanding of the fact that I

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.400
wanted to drink and couldn't drink

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.400
but you know

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.400
there's a ghost boxer

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.400
fuck

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400
but you know what's funny

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.400
when I was sitting down was

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.400
this isn't funny to us but

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.400
I want people listening to hear this

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.400
because I kind of

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.400
it was like

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.400
I did like in short order

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.400
you and I were talking about your diagnosis

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.400
and your experience and stuff

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.400
and then it's like you're coming from this

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.400
Han Solo position and you're like

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.400
you're the protagonist

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.400
and the story about this shit

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.400
and then there was a precise point

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.400
when you're like I don't want to be that person

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.400
hanging out with me and treating me different

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.400
because of this thing and I was like

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.400
I think

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.400
I'm doing that

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.400
but at the same time

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.400
it was like that's not

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.400
deserved at all

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.400
I don't

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.400
there's nothing to do with that

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.400
and it made me want to run out in the street

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.400
and stop traffic and go

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.400
treat every single person you've ever known

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.400
the way you would treat them

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.400
if you just found out on Instagram

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.400
that they had breast cancer

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.400
and like beat it

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.400
it's such a corn dog thing

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.400
no question but take it

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.400
you went through grief

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.400
you're basically breaking down the grief

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.400
that you went through and it's okay to

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.400
be as sad as you were

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.400
about your friends diagnosis

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.400
that's completely legit

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.400
thank you Brandon

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.400
honestly there is this thing

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.400
we

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.400
it's almost like you had been through a surgery

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.400
I think we're all here for Dan tonight

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.400
hey let's give it up for Dan

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.400
for going through that

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.400
and coming in is still strong

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.400
I knew you were a good audience

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.400
you just needed to be warmed up over two hours

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.400
what the fuck did you get here by bus

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.400
go fuck yourself

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.400
we made it this far I don't need you

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.400
you can boo for the rest of the night

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.400
I'll still finish the show

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.400
anyways Heather what are your thoughts

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.400
I was gonna say that what was really

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.400
what was really wild about

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.400
that feeling and then also

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.400
the end of cancer is that

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.400
so my first

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.400
I got to see exactly how long

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.400
people will mourn me

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.400
when I die because my first

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.400
show back

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.400
sold out people who brought

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.400
signs and they were like

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.400
like standing ovation

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.400
and then over the course of the next few months

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.400
the audiences went back to

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:46.400
just a few people

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:48.400
and I was like that's exactly the

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.400
arc of when people find out

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.400
that I'm dead and then when

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.400
they won't care anymore

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:56.400
it's like exactly five

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:58.400
months

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.400
that's great this is why you chose this

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.400
show to announce your next cancer

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.400
tell me where you're gonna be

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:08.400
that's a healthy number

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.400
five months feels right

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.400
but it's funny

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.400
because I'm thinking about the friends

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.400
we've lost we live in a vocation that is

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.400
yeah

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.400
well they're famous

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:22.400
so they

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.400
I'm going

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.400
oh yeah that's the nightmare

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.400
it's not the

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.400
going from this to oblivion

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.400
it's the actual thought

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.400
maybe of oh

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.400
oh Jesus

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400
but why does that matter

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.400
does it not

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.400
be there for it

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.400
well it's

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.400
there's a I feel like

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.400
if you are an atheist and you feel like

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.400
nothing happens after dead then there's some

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.400
comfort in knowing that like the memory

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.400
if you lives on but it really bums you out

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.400
when you're like even then my best friends

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.400
I feel

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.400
when I think about my death as a

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.400
visible person this is the one

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:04.400
thought I have is I feel

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.400
advanced animosity

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.400
towards the public because I know

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.400
that it doesn't matter how

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.400
I die I could get hit by a Ferrari

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.400
I could a

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.400
safe call on me from

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.400
from a skyscraper I will probably die

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:20.400
of prostate cancer or a heart

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.400
attack or a stroke or a god damn

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.400
it our fucking bodies are designed

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.400
to fail and a mind will fail but

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.400
because

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.400
of the life that I've led because

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.400
of the because I've been visible

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.400
my

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:36.400
my death will be

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.400
marked

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.400
mostly by conversations about addiction

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.400
like people will say it won't

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.400
matter if I just like my pancreas

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.400
just failed people will go

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.400
you know if you need to talk to somebody about

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.400
your love of chocolate

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.400
like they'll just like

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.400
talk about addiction they'll talk about alcohol

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.400
it won't matter if my lungs failed

01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.400
or and I'm like like come on fuck

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.400
off you could be an Olympic athlete

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.400
and you're getting lung cancer and fucking

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.400
dicks but

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.400
people want like they'll that's

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.400
what I fear that about my legacy

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.400
I

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.400
feel I don't want people to like say

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.400
after I died you should have combed his hair

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.400
that's because it's like Jesus Christ

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:18.400
I thought I beat this you won't be here for

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.400
yeah I know but I fucking hate that's

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.400
the one thing I hate it's that five month

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.400
I'm like fuck you fucking so you don't

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.400
you you feel so I should I didn't

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.400

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.400
like I want I want to be like fuck you

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.400
so you're

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.400
your biggest feeling about it is that

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.400
you don't have control over the narrative

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.400
over my image after your death

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:40.400
yes well wait a minute

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.400

high road me you're allowed to

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.400
my biggest fear is the is the end

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.400
it's that is the is that

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.400
yeah but that transition moment the one

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.400
molecule of time

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.400
that scares me too however

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.400
TMZ

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.400
what

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.400
is that

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:04.400
molecule was like

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.400
a little guy god

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.400
guy named Markey

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.400
and Markey was like I'm here to help

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:12.400
you across the threshold that'd be a good

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.400
that'd be a good episode

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.400

I can write it with esteemable acts

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.400
what I can go to the kitchen

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.400
for a while right and then

01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.400
my obituary I'll say

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.400
Dan Harmon did this this and that

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.400
and he was famous for this and that

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.400
for the last ten years of his life he worked

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.400
in a soup kitchen it's not going to say

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.400
it won't say that it'll say

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.400

about him and the comment section I'll say

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.400

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.400

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.400

that's my fear

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.400
I don't want to be a fucking cautionary tale

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.400
I had fun you're gonna get to be

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.400

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.400
I just thought about that

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.400
I just thought about that

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.400
I was talking

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.400
about that

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.400
and I just realized that

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.400
that I'm basically like guaranteed

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.400

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.400

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.400
it depends on nothing

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.400

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.400
no I want an Emmy

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.400

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.400
no one's famous sir when you die

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.400

12 killed at one time

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.400
I'm not gonna win

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.400
any popularity contest for saying this

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:34.400
but I look forward to the fact there's gonna be

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:36.400
a slight swell and applause

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.400
even though

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:40.400
everyone knows it's crass

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.400
I'm gonna be between Spuds

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.400
McGinty the

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.400
Grip who worked on Bonanza

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400
and then

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.400
the

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.400
Frasier Frasier script supervisor

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.400
but

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.400
you're gonna play it back on your hologram

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.400
and it's gonna go the applause is gonna go

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.400
hahahaha

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.400
because you know what

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:04.400
I was

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.400
I was better

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.400
and my death is more important

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.400
hahahaha

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.400
have you thought about

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.400
that it'll probably be a clip of

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.400
Rick Sanchez going like

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.400
damn it Morty

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:20.400
and it's like you just had your name under it

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.400
and it wanted to be your voice

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.400
either that or me fucking a baby

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:26.400
that was

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.400
non-union that was non-union

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.400
a fake baby

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.400
that got a spirit award

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.400
it was independent for sure

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.400
no I don't know

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.400
it'll be my headshot from high school

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:40.400
or whatever

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.400
I don't think it will

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:44.400
you gotta send him that headshot now man

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.400
it'll be like a photo of me

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.400
high school that's not what they do

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.400
that's what they do

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:52.400
it's not your bachelor party

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.400
they're not like

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.400
let's find a goofy picture of this guy who just died

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.400
what photos did they show

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.400
it'll be you looking at a

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.400
strip of film or something

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.400
I'm not just looking at film

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.400
I'm not gonna look at film

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.400
it'll be black and white

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.400
why would I look at film

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.400
they mock it up

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.400
if someone invites me to look at film

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:16.400
I'm gonna know that I'm gonna die

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.400
I'm not doing it

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.400
that's a bigger demarcator of death

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.400
and christianity

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.400
the praying

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.400
we want you to come in and look at a roll of film

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.400
Shelly Default is just acting on it

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.400
what's all this smoke here for

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.400
don't worry about it

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.400
what if they put a sheet over you

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.400
when you take the photo

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.400
hold still for 15 minutes

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.400
we're not gonna put your face on the side

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.400
of a fucking studio at Sony

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.400
maybe it's just a clip of a crying

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.400
orbit

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.400
got you mother fuck

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.400
hell yeah

01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.400
it's interesting to think about fame

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.400
Brandon what are your thoughts

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.400
about fame

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.400
it's useful

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.400
yeah

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.400
it's the best goddamn thing created

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.400
can you imagine you're stuck on a planet

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.400
right you're stuck here

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.400
but you fucking famous

01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:12.400
that is a wonderful thing

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.400
Spencer what's your relationship with fame

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.400
I think it's useful

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.400
yeah it's like we live in the social

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.400
world and so fame

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.400
is like social capital you could leverage

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.400
it's great

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.400
I mean it's obviously a two-ended sword

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.400
but I don't know I like it

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.400
I get recognized

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.400
today I was walking and some guy was like

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:34.400
literally a block and a half and I heard behind me

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.400
dungeon master and I was like oh that's cool

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.400
I'm not gonna turn around but that's cool

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.400
and then you saw a woman

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.400
you gotta go to Best Buy

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.400
there's like

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.400
you gotta go to Best Buy go to Best Buy

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.400
oh yeah like I'm telling you like every

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.400
single person at Best Buy

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.400
every employee every customer

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.400
it's just good like if you want to fucking boost

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:56.400
to me every employee won't

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.400
look to see if something's in the back

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.400
no that's the thing

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.400
it's like at first people

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.400
it just seems like the system's working

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.400
well I need a USB-C cable

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:08.400
to a thing and the person just seems like

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.400
they're like oh well let me help you with that

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.400
and it just seems like you're living

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:14.400
in like heaven

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.400
because they're like oh they're willing to help

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.400
and then after a while they check you out and they're like

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.400
by the way are you just talking about a

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.400
store yeah Best Buy

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.400
yeah I'm telling Spencer to go to Best Buy

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:26.400
before Nick's famous on two coasts

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.400
I went to the comic book store and that happened there

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.400
like by the way I love Harmon Quest I'm like hell yeah

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.400
this fucking guy feels great

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:34.400
I'm like the comic book store

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.400
isn't it great because like the thing is

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.400
like you're not famous for

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.400
punching a old lady

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.400
that would be fucking great

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400
holy shit you're famous

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.400
for nerdy shit

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.400
so like people that recognize you

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.400
you're like it's done

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.400
but the prestige of the old lady

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.400
punching and they come up and they go like

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.400
oh I'm sorry

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.400
could you mind if I like

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.400

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.400
it's great it's fleeting and it's great

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.400
it's all gonna be over soon do you get recognized

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.400
it'll be over soon

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:14.400
do people run up to you and go Heather Anne Campbell

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.400
yeah sometimes you hate it

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.400
no I don't

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.400
I had a conversation with a friend

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.400
who was like his ideal level

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.400
of fame was NBA

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.400
superstar like he was like

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.400
I want to not be able to leave

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.400
my house and I was like that sounds

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.400
like hell to me that sounds like hell

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.400
you're subscribing the actual part of it

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.400
that's bad

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.400
he was like I want

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.400
I want if I go to

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.400
a restaurant I want to be so famous that they have to

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:44.400
put me in a section and they put curtains up

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.400
and I was like that's

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.400
I love this guy for his

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.400
honesty yeah that was his

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.400
ideal level of fame and my ideal

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.400
level of fame is exactly where I am

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.400
right now which is like

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:58.400
once in a while at a coffee shop they'll be like

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.400
hey I really like the thing

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.400
and then I'll be like oh thanks

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.400
wow but like

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.400
most of the time I can go to

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:08.400
a bar or a restaurant with a book

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.400
and nobody talks to me and that's wonderful

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.400
go to Home Depot no one's gonna tell you how to

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.400
buy a sword

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.400
or whatever the fuck they sell there

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.400
but it's like

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.400
people are like

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:22.400
they go like by the way

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.400
by the way

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.400
do you get recognized at Home Depot

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400
no no god no

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:30.400
that's why I just hold this by

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.400
there's a craftsman

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.400
there are men who work with their hands

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.400
men and women who build things

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.400
any place that sells anything sharp

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.400
are you saying that craftsmen

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.400
don't appreciate stories

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.400
nope they don't

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.400
they're creating their own

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.400
there's no instructions

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:50.400
they're building the stories

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.400
how about you do you get recognized

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:54.400
occasionally

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.400
but I don't

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.400
I don't know how I feel about it

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.400
I like it

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.400
I feel like this is intro'd weird

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.400
and now it's gonna be weird

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.400
I had lunch with

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.400
an ex-girlfriend

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.400
who was just like we should catch up

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.400
and we were having lunch

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.400
and somebody came up

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:20.400
and was like

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.400
hell yeah

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:24.400
I want your girl

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.400
he was like

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.400
I like you I like what you do

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.400
and I never do this

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.400
I love it when people say hi

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.400
because it doesn't happen much

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.400
so I never do this but he was very

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:38.400
I felt like I had the opportunity to do it

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.400
and I was just like

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:42.400
I'm having lunch with my friend right now

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.400
and he was like oh of course

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.400
I wasn't a dick but I was just like

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.400
I appreciate it but right now I'm trying to

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.400
have lunch with the friend and he walked away

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.400
that's a tumblr

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.400
essay

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.400
the way I said it

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400
he didn't

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:00.400
survive

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.400
why you do that

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.400
it's a story

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.400
so you did that

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.400
I was just like oh thank you thank you

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.400
and then he kept going and then I was like

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.400
oh you know I'm having lunch with the friend

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.400
and that felt good because I would never

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:16.400
do that

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.400
I would just be like have a seat

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.400
because I love it I love fame

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.400
but it felt good

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:24.400
to rub it into an ex-girlfriend's face

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.400
yeah that's what you want

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.400
but now she knows

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.400
because if she listens to this

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.400
she'll know

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:34.400
she doesn't listen well she might

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.400
but she's also an ex of like 15 years ago

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.400
so it doesn't really matter

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.400
I have a running joke where I text my

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:42.400
fiancé every time

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.400
someone

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:46.400
recognizes me in public

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:48.400
and I'll text her about it

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.400
I don't know what the joke is

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.400
I really don't know what it is

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.400
what do you text

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.400
I text her as if I'm

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.400
I'm just tallying it

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400
so I'll just go

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.400
three recognitions

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.400
Venice promenade

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.400
I give it hard stats

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.400
like I'm trying to like horn her up

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.400
oh that's a joke I think that's a problem

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.400
I don't know what my joke is

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.400
I wonder sometimes

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.400
is my bit not inviting her

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400
to have

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.400
because sometimes I'm kind of resentful

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.400
people are like well what's your bit

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.400
what's my role in it

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:26.400
I don't really know what her role in it's supposed to be

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.400
it's like when a bird collects colorful rocks

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.400
and feathers to adorn the nest

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.400
it's like does you like this one

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.400
I'll put that there

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.400
yeah but that bird doesn't usually do it

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.400
next to their current bird mate

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.400
but that's you're showing it to them

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.400
you're like huh this is good

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.400
oh I see I see yeah

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.400
I just think it's like part of the humor

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.400
though is that I can't talk to her about it

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.400
like I just keep on

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:52.400
like every time someone

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:54.400
recognizes me I text Cody

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.400
and I'll take a photo

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.400
with the person and I'll text her to Cody

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.400
and I'll go like hey

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.400
Kmart electronic section

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.400
like guys a big fan

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.400
and I don't know

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.400
and she's always like

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.400
she doesn't she's nailing it

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.400
and she posts it to Instagram

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.400
yeah I mean she does post it

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.400
these are illustrious stories you're visiting

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:18.400
alright alright alright

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.400
well no it's getting to that point

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:22.400
it says airplane mode enabled

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.400
apple watch

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:26.400
that could be good

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.400
I mean

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.400
it's time to stop doing the show

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.400
no

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.400
and don't forget

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.400
to stop doing it entirely in December

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.400
so

01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.400
for anyone who doesn't like this

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.400
I know you're booing

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.400
the stopping of the show

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.400
which is the equivalent of what you

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.400
should have done tonight

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.400
which is applaud the presence of the show

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.400
but you couldn't

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.400
well that's

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.400
that's

01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.400
not bad applause

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.400

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.400
let's not engage in an unhealthy

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.400
relationship we're going to have a finite

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.400
like we're and therefore a loving one

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.400
we're going to do a countdown

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.400

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:14.400
Cody keeps telling me

there's some person that she keeps

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.400
Cody

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.400
we're all guessing

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.400
we don't know

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.400
we'll find out next week

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.400
Marie Kondo though I have a few words for her

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.400
whoa

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.400
I keep trying

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.400
to apply her things

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:40.400
and then I'm like

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.400
what if Marie Kondo's next book was like

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:44.400
oh shit wait

01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.400
because she keeps telling you

01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.400
to throw everything away people

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:50.400
yeah

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.400
she don't have my shit

01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.400
that's anybody who preaches that gospel

01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.400
they don't have nice shit

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.400
well there's different

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.400
I think there's different attachments

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:02.400
Marie Kondo's thing is that she doesn't have good stuff

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.400
yeah you go around

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.400
so she's like throw it all away

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.400
because she doesn't like her own stuff

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.400
that's the thing like one of her books is like

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.400
oh shit

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.400

of Debbie does Dallas 3

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.400
and then she's like people wait stop don't

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.400
don't throw anything away

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.400
her second book is buy all that shit back

01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:24.400
