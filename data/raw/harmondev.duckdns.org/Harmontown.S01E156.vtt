00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Come, come, come there. Come, come, come, come all. Come, come, everywhere and bring your scarf and shawl. I'm the little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.

00:12.000 --> 00:24.000
Come, come, over there. Come, come, to the south. Come, come, on your feet. Come, come, to my mouth. I'm a little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm a little velvet man that lives in a tree. All I do is promote shows, all that I say. Please go to see Rob Schneider at the truck show.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
He was into some hazard, there was nowhere to go. Because his car had a racist flag on it. I'm a little show promoter and I wear a bonnet.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
It was my mom's idea, she made me a baby. I want to fuck her or kill her or maybe.

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harlin.

00:57.000 --> 01:09.000
Come, come, come there. Come, come, come all. Come, come, everywhere and bring your scarf and shawl.

01:09.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you. Thank you. That song was created by a fellow named Michael Hartigan if you're out there. Michael, thank you very much for your beautiful service.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
Dan, you have an enormous thermos on stage right now. Please tell me that's not all vodka in there.

01:26.000 --> 01:48.000
I have switched my cheat day to Sundays on my diet and this is a pina colada that Aaron made me. I think it's a gallon.

01:48.000 --> 02:01.000
She's really been feeding me today. I'm kind of in a food coma. I may puke onto the microphone and onto Anatoly.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
So you just this week decided to switch to Sunday cheat day?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
So last week when you ate the cheeseburger out of the Bloody Mary on stage, that was just comedy sake, right? That was just entertainment.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, yeah. No, I was, I stayed on the, wait, what do you mean? Last week was the show was on Sunday.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
All right. So you switched it last week?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Jesus Christ, who cares?

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
So we're in the light of these people.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Is there a logo on that thermos? That thing is enormous.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, I gotta remember to bring this back to Aaron.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
And I enjoy a pina colada. A gallon seems a little over the top.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I don't want to waste my cheat day.

02:51.000 --> 03:05.000
But I may puke all over everyone because I got up this morning at 6.45 a.m. and I used Postmates to order McDonald's breakfast.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Did you get up that early because you always wake up at that early or because it's a cheat day and you want to start eating it?

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, it's because I've been, you may have noticed I've never lost any weight ever.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So you're probably wondering, is this diet work?

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, it can if you stick to it. I've never stuck to it. I have like cheat days, turn into cheat weekends, turn into cheat weeks.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
So I just basically am the same fatness that I always am.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
But I've lasted like three weeks or so. I've been really committing to the diet.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
So then this last period was particularly hard on me.

03:42.000 --> 03:51.000
The idea of the cheat day being that you fool your body back into a glycemic thing and then you go off it.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah, I think you're just keeping your body off rhythm. I never read the book that Aaron read it.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
I think it's basically like Atkins Without Dairy, you're allowed to eat beans.

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
So it's beans, meat, and veggies all week and then one day a week so that your body, probably so your body doesn't go into ketosis or just adjust metabolically.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
You're supposed to spike your blood sugar and you're, you know, your blood sugar. You're supposed to spike your blood sugar.

04:19.000 --> 04:28.000
And you're supposed to eat like a birthday cake and just rub Big Macs on your balls and just wear a pizza for a hat.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
And I do. I really take it very seriously.

04:33.000 --> 04:41.000
And so I got the McDonald's and I sat down and I played Witcher 3.

04:41.000 --> 04:51.000
And then at some point Aaron came home with some Del Taco and I just didn't move.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
And I just kept eating in the room slowly filled up with farts and so she would like slide stuff over to me.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
And she made sliders and like mac and cheese with Doritos sprinkled on them and a big pina colada and a pineapple.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
And I said I should bring this to the show and she made me a big pina colada.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
So if you're on the fence about getting married, you know, you know, it's fine.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I said, I said, Aaron, what's this? What is this straw? What's the straw from?

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
And she said, that is an unused, I said, stop, don't.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
If you have to say it's unused, you're not about to say amaze a straw from the party store.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
It's probably an anti-freeze.

05:40.000 --> 05:49.000
A licensed pre-owned bull catheter.

05:49.000 --> 05:58.000
But do you think the holes of bull's penises are bigger than...

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Some woman in the audience went, no.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Well, I heard a guy go, I'm like, no. Do we have two different people?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I think they're probably a little bigger.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I mean, they've got to be like a little... Why do I mean they've got to be?

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
I wonder if urethras are all the same diameter. Of course not.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
No.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Of course not. A goldfish doesn't have...

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
A mouse's urethra is thinner than mine, I hope.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
It's like a party straw. Mine's like a party straw.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Mouse's is like a little baby party straw.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
And then, so I'm sure like a whales, you could probably put a ping pong ball down it.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
And it would probably have space around it.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
The ping pong ball.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
Number three, probably not going to get any high marks on the feminist gamer report card.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
I kind of got tit fatigue playing that game. There's a lot of titties in that game.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
A lot of strong women, I guess, but they're strong and they have their tits are everywhere.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm truly bored with tits right now.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Are the guys semi-clad too or negative?

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
No, it's the same old, I think, hypocritical thing.

07:21.000 --> 07:30.000
The protagonist is, I guess he's kind of a beefcake, but he's covered in scars and he's pale.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And then everyone else is just a big fat guy, I think, or a dwarf.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
I'm not saying dwarves can't be attractive. Sorry, fellas.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
But it's a lot of decups and a lot of acting.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
It's just normal for them to just be out.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm really enjoying it.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
It's one of those games where it has relationship options.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
There's different characters and you're sort of like, while you're playing the game,

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
you have these multiple kind of romantic roads you can go down.

08:10.000 --> 08:19.000
There's this woman in the beginning of the game that you like and then she's treating you like garbage,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
even though you clearly like her.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
But then it's kind of clear like, oh, she must be the female lead kind of thing.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I guess I'm supposed to have a will, they won't they with her?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
And I guess I'll meet up with her later.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
But then in the meantime, there was this redhead and I was just like, will you marry me?

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
So now the rest of the game, I'm like, the regular one keeps on.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't know, the game kind of fucks you over because it definitely gives you the option

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
of totally full-on monogamous commitment to this redheaded sorceress.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
If the first woman that treats you cruelly were a redhead, would you be more into her?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yes.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
And that's not my fault because it's a video game, so it's like the hair especially.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
It's like, what else is there?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I don't know.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
Like I said, the first one, I don't like the strident type.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I don't go for that business.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
But it doesn't make my little wiener jump up when somebody's like, you're a piece of shit.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm not like, yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah, I like a little equivalence.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Wasn't the redhead in the recent Jurassic Park kind of strident?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Wasn't she kind of a tough nut?

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Well, there's a difference between withdrawn and mean.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Because the mean thing seems dishonest if you're going to end up actually, you know,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
coupling with someone.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Then you didn't mean it when you said I was a poopoo face, right?

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Because otherwise, you're a poopoo face fucker.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
So now I'm a liar fucker and a poopoo face, but not a poopoo face.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
We know people that like being called a poopoo face.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
That's what turns them on.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah, like Dino.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Dino likes being called a poopoo face.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
He likes poopoo on his face.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, me not so much.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I get mad when people humiliate me.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Even in the video game realm?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Like even as part of the program of that game?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Yeah, well, especially, anyway, so that's the thing.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
So this game really sets you up to...

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I'm in the midst of this right now.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
I almost want to stop playing the game because I am kind of immersed in it.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
The first girl, it wasn't working, I decided.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It was like, well, she decided.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
She said, you know, she's like cold-shouldering me.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
For the first couple levels, I'm like, hey, what do you think of me?

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
And she's like, oh, I'm British and I have black hair.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
So I'm like that archetype and I'm gone.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
And then this redhead sorceress and she's nurturing

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
and she cares about the other mages and I helped her do this whole

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
like Harriet Tubman underground mage railroad story.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
We got the mages out of the city

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
before the horrible anti-mage Hitler was going to kill them all.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
That kind of, that turns me on.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah, but that sounds to me like you're supposed to fall in love with her

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
and not the black-haired British lady from the beginning.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Wait, sorry, what?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
That's something they're setting you up to love her.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
They set me up.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Yes, because it's obviously available in the program because I did.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I was like, I kissed her.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
You know, I could have not kissed her.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
So I chose to kiss her because she looks like my wife.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
And then I was like, yeah, I'm going to choose her

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
because I see this as one of these multiple choose-your-romance games.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
So I'm definitely, this is good that they let me not choose this

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
this strident, you know, British cold, cold, cold, cold applesauce person.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
It's like, you know, I'm a raven-haired heartbreaker.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
I'm going to, hmm, I'm so mean to you like your mommy.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I'm not, thank you for not making me do that.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I like this, I like this nurturing type.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Are there other options?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Is there a third woman?

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Well, I'm not, I feel like I'm in like a quarter through the game

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
and I'm already fucked because I, so I, like the redhead, I was like, you know,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I was like, well, don't, it was okay, we did the adventure.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And then there was an option that said, please don't go.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And I was like, please don't go.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And then there was an option that said, I love you.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
And I was like, I love you.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And then, and then she's like, okay, I'll stay.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
And I'm like, okay, great.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
And then, and then we had sex in a lighthouse.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
And are you typing things in?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
No, I'm not typing.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
These options that come up on the screen.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
These are like, these are like, these are like story options you're choosing

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
based on like, you know, three dialogue decisions.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
So now you're married to this redhead in the video.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Well, I'm married here, but I might as well have.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I like, yeah, I might make love in this.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
What level of intimacy do they, do they show you while you're making?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
It's really weird.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Do they cut your train going into a tunnel?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Well, they don't.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, they don't.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
They show you both naked.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Then they show like her naked butt.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And then they show my hand slide over her butt.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
And then, but then they cut to it just a wall.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
And there was like, but there wasn't even like a shadow of humping or anything.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
But it was like, there's like, they already showed like boobs and butts.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And like, it's clearly, it's not for kids this game.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Like they say the C word in it.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And the F word all the time.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Fuck is the F word.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
Anyway, so, so, so I made love to Redhead.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
On a lighthouse?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
In a lighthouse.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
In a lighthouse.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Not on a lighthouse.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
That's dangerous.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
In it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
They're kind of pointy on top.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
So then, and then, and then she goes like, so I guess, and then we had the conversation

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
of like, oh, so I guess, I guess we're going to be together forever.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
But I got a piece of, I got to finish this video game though.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Like I was like, I got to finish like the next 85% of the game.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Without her.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Right.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Because it's not like the game is so sophisticated that now she's just hanging out.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Like going like, we're in love too.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
So you, so I just said, I love you to see her butt and then she leaves the game.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
And now, I mean, the part of the game, well, now that I have to go be with the brunette

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
and the, but the game is making my character keep flirting with the brunette.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
It's not a choice.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
He keeps saying stuff like, oh, you smell good.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
And I'm like, no, I didn't say that.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm from Wisconsin.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I wouldn't pull this shit.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
This is the kind of guy I hate.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
And they're making me, so I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Am I supposed to, is the game supposed to.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
There should be an option or maybe they shouldn't, but to go back to the redhead woman and say,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
look, I know that there's probably 80% more video game out there.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
But I'd rather hit game over with you.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's kind of where I'm at.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
I wish I kind of, honestly, I would push the brunette off a cliff if it was an option.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, because she won't, I mean, well, because I would say I'm sorry.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
It's, I'm, you smell nice.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
The game, the game, the game keeps making me act like I want to fuck you, but I don't want to.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So I'm going to murder you.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And she's like, you're mentally ill.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Because she doesn't know it's a video game.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
So she's, is there, can you come on too hard where she hates you?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Like, like a Jack Tripper or Threes Company episode?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I'm not, I'm not going to try that.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
There are options where it says like you can lay it on even thicker and I'm just choosing the neutral,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
just like all business, you know?

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
And I can't wait for her to ask what's going on.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I would be like, I am a married man.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I made love in a lighthouse.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
And I just want the rest of the game to just be about killing werewolves.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Do you think the game is designed for people to like,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
the first girl I meet, I'm going to date her.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
She's like the evil part of my mother.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
She's hard to please.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I'm going to date this British lady, like a school mom.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And then you realize, oh, she sucks.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And then later on, you're supposed to meet the redhead.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It's definitely, it's laid out that way.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
It's pretty ingenious.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Like it's kind of, it's very, for a video game, if it was a movie, you'd be like,

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
well, this isn't very smart, but for a video game, it's pretty sophisticated like stuff.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
The Game Dragon Age Origins had some stuff like that I thought was pretty fun.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm old.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm playing video games.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
I like that some of them have like a more nuanced story component to them.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
But the danger of that is that now it's like the game is about anxiety.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Now I can't escape life.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm like in a worse life.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
It's like a terrible, I'm like living a lie in the video game.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
In the real life, I have a beautiful woman bringing me cheeseburgers.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
And I'm, there is no...

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
You're hanging that with a poopoo face later.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Tess, Triss, Marygold.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
That's the red, that's the...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Sorceress as well.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
You said that with such wistful, what's her name, Tess, Marygold?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Triss.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Triss?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
She's...

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Triss.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
You know, Triss.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
All right, so anyways.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Oh, you forgot to bring Spencer up.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Oh, shit.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I got mesmerized with the Ty Brickson song.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Spencer Crittenden, everybody!

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Sorry, Spencer.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I was remiss.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm very sorry.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Don't even trip.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
This is a great song, man.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
It's a lot better than me.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
No, don't.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
No, not like that.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I mean, it's really that good of a song.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I've been...

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
I've literally just been driving around and I'll be like, I'm singing.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm like, come, come over here.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
It's so good.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Hey, guys.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
How far down that gallon of opaque jug of pina colada do you think you are?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh, I can't tell.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Hey, lick off the whole straw and do like the dipstick test.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
That is a bull catheter.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
That is some viscous shit.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
It's really good.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I have a perfect wife.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I have the perfect wife.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
She's not here tonight.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
What does she have to do?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
She's fatigued from cooking for you all day?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
She's got a lot of...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
She's got to make...

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
You know, it's our friend Kimber's birthday tomorrow, I think.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Oh, yeah?

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
So she's making some stuff.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I think I should switch DJ back to Saturday.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
This is not good for performance.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Does it feel sluggish?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And I'm also like the summer heat.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Oh, yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
So I lose a little job of the hut.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I should just go back.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Is that a proper pina colada in terms of...?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Oh, yeah.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
This is pretty standard.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Like booze to mixer ratio?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Oh, I don't know.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I mean, it's boozy.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
It's pretty boozy.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Damn.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
That's a lot of booze, Jackson.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
I'll try a sip.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It's so great.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I got to try it.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
I got a long way to go.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, what's in a pina colada?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm not good at alcohol.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
It's rum, coconut, milk, pineapple, and something else.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Shit.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You like booze and milk?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yeah.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Try it, Spencer.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Come on.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Take a bite off of that sandwich, man.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Come on.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Do you guys remember the Darwin Awards?

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
There's a guy who won a Darwin Award for trying to make alcohol by mixing beer...

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
No, if he started with beer, that'd be good.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
No, he was mixing milk with just car gasoline.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Because that's how booze is made.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And he died from drinking it?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
He drank so much that he died.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
I mean, I don't know how much you'd have to drink, but yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
Do you remember, I mean, it might be apocryphal, but when I was in college, do you remember

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
the story of the guy that died?

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
He was doing a headstand and he put a bottle of Jack Daniels up in his butt and he let

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
the booze drain into his butt and he just died.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah, I don't think that was an urban legend.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I think it really happened to a guy.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
That's some serious butt chugging.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
That's what they call that.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
That's not some Saturday morning brunch butt chugging.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
This isn't your grandmother's butt chugging.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
That's not like a casual mimosa.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Mimosa butt chugging.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
Pour down your anal cavity at 45 degree angles by a group of well-meaning friends before

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
going to see a Marvel movie.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
This is hardcore butt chugging.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I would have butt chugged a little bit of that pina colada.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
That was delicious.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
That would be cold.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
You want cold though.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
You wouldn't want hot.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
How come putting stuff in your butt makes it go into your blood faster than putting

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
it in your mouth?

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
I think it's a more closer capillary network to the edge of the skin probably.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
But that doesn't...

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Oh, okay.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
It's not...

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Your skin is like protective tissue.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
It's designed to prevent absorption, but you're like inner insides or not.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
So I think that things can just pass into your blood easier.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Why wouldn't they save that apparatus for up here?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
It's the answer because you don't want that much to get through up here.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I think that's the answer.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
But then again, what's down there is poop.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
But that's your intestines, right?

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
I think the idea is throughout your entire digestive tract, your body is trying to reabsorb

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
anything that's valuable all the way until the last drop.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, so that's the last resort.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
That's the ultimate filter back there because that's the last shot you got, man.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
You know, elephants, you know how everybody goes to the zoo and they see an elephant eat

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
grass out of another elephant's asshole?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Oh, yeah.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And they always think they saw the craziest thing in the world.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
But this elephant shit is basically just grass.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
You could eat it.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
It would be great.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Because they just like animals that digest cellulose, which we cannot do.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
If we ate a handful of grass, our stomach would be like, why are you doing that?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
That might as well be just a house or something.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
And I'm not a termite.

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
But deer and rabbits and elephants, certain mammals have the enzymes so they can break

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
down cellulose so they can eat grass.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
Whatever that is, basically, but they pass so much of it through.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
It's such an inefficient engine that their poop is practically edible.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
They're the original butt sugars.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
They're the opposite of butt sugars.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
They're butt munchers.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
They're buffet butts.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
The elephant that's eating the poo out the first elephant, he's a butt muncher.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
He's a butt muncher.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
We got that settled?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
All right.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
We're getting a lot done tonight.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
It's a low energy show.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
I got a lot of food in my stomach, but we're getting some stuff done.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Dorito, mac and cheese?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
That's just mac and cheese with Doritos sprinkling.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
You make me puke.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Oh, another thing about Witcher 3.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Not the gallon of pina colada.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I'm going to make you puke.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Go ahead.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Witcher 3 is like, I didn't mean to, I wasn't decrying it as a sexist game or anything.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
I just think that in the last five years with the world changing under her feet, I don't,

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
I don't have a horse in that race.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
So I'm just going like, ooh, those are neat tits.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
But like, and I think, I think that it's a very enjoyable game for everybody.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
I just think in that one particular area, it's sort of like, kind of like, it's just

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
sort of funny because it's like, takes place in this fantasy world.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
And it's just like, literally everybody, it's just like the equivalent of a receptionist

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
will just come up and go, can I help you?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
And her shirt will just be just unbuttoned to her kknave. for no reason.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
It's just like, just boobs in your face.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Is Trish Marigold putting it out there too?

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
She was one of the more tasteful ones, I would say.

24:07.000 --> 24:16.000
She wore pants and she, you know, you could see that she had boobs, but, but I don't think

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
she, I think it was an accident.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
I was more taken with her magic and her politics.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
Anyways, I just wanted to say one more thing about Witcher 3.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
They have strumpets in the game.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Can we bring the word strumpets back?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That's adorable.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
I mean, you can't ask men to not be sexist overnight, but we could, maybe if we brought

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
back a word like strumpets, at least we could make us a little more adorable while

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
we're being misogynist.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
You know, the guy that invented the word strumpet in like a fit of misogyny, he must

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
have been so bummed out when it came out of his mouth.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
He's like, you fucking strumpet.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
And then the woman is like, I'll take it.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
That's adorable.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
He's like, God damn it.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Strumpet.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
This sounds like, well, it sounds like trumpet or and crumpet.

25:14.000 --> 25:24.000
You got no arguments from me on that one.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
Let's do a new segment called Boring News.

25:31.000 --> 25:38.000
It's just so far we have not been doing that.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Yo.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yo.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Yo.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Yo.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Yo.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yo.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Yo.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yo.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Yo.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Yo.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Yo.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yo.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Yo.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Yo.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yo.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Yo.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Yo.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yo.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Yo.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Yo.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Yo.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yo.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I wanna do a clip about these two lines from one to one.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Alright.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
You like this one?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah, yeah, yo, slow rapping.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Yo, yo, scary, scary neighborhood.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Yo, yo, driving down a spooky street, yo.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.380
Halloween, look at all the costumes, trick or treat.

26:18.380 --> 26:19.380
Fuckin'.

26:19.380 --> 26:20.380
Motherfucker.

26:20.380 --> 26:23.680
The girls dressed like a pumpkin.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.180
That girl's dressed like a pumpkin.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.980
I hope she gets a lot of candy.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.660
Roll down the window.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.660
Look at my foot.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.540
OK, fuck that.

26:34.540 --> 26:36.500
Fuck that.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.540
I think I'd work like this.

26:37.540 --> 26:38.260
I think, yeah.

26:41.460 --> 26:45.460
I only listen to the first eight bars of that one, Spencer.

26:45.460 --> 26:46.580
Sorry, that's a corrupt final.

26:46.580 --> 26:47.540
Yeah, is that a banff?

26:47.540 --> 26:48.500
Sorry, man.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.620
That was the one off of the YouTube.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.740
I clicked the link and downloaded right to the thing.

26:52.740 --> 26:55.420
I use that YouTube link all the time, so I don't know.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.020
I don't know.

26:56.020 --> 26:56.700
Sorry, everybody.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.140
Everybody get your shit together.

26:58.140 --> 27:00.100
This is not what the people pay us for.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.820
All right, so this is, OK, one more time.

27:03.820 --> 27:04.580
This is boring.

27:04.580 --> 27:06.300
I can play it off the YouTube that he sent me.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.780
Boring news segment.

27:07.780 --> 27:08.580
Boring news segment.

27:08.580 --> 27:11.220
Boring news segment.

27:11.220 --> 27:13.140
Are we going to do this theme again?

27:13.140 --> 27:14.220
You want the same one?

27:14.220 --> 27:14.940
Yeah.

27:14.940 --> 27:16.140
The wonky one that we just did?

27:16.140 --> 27:18.140
Yeah.

27:18.140 --> 27:29.500
Yeah, yeah, what's happening ain't always entertaining.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.980
Sometimes it's boring.

27:32.980 --> 27:35.500
Nothing much happened.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.260
Boring news.

27:37.260 --> 27:39.060
Boring news.

27:39.060 --> 27:39.560
OK.

27:42.860 --> 27:47.940
We got a new saltwater aquarium installed in our home.

27:47.940 --> 27:53.580
And go on.

27:53.580 --> 27:57.740
These, in order, are my 10 picks for our fish.

28:00.740 --> 28:02.100
Dan, I'm going to stop you there.

28:02.100 --> 28:05.460
This is called boring news.

28:05.460 --> 28:09.020
My top pick is the blue-spotted jawfish.

28:09.020 --> 28:09.500
Look it up.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.460
You'll see why.

28:11.460 --> 28:13.300
Tell me why, because I don't have the option.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.660
It's like a little snake guy.

28:14.660 --> 28:17.260
And he can make a little hole in the sand

28:17.260 --> 28:21.460
like act like a snake sometimes.

28:21.460 --> 28:22.940
How large are these fish we're talking?

28:22.940 --> 28:23.980
How big is the aquarium?

28:23.980 --> 28:25.620
Is it a giant one or a small one?

28:25.620 --> 28:26.180
I don't know.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.900
It's an aquarium size.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.980
I don't know.

28:29.980 --> 28:32.100
Somewhere between 50 and 1,000 gallons.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.820
It's a decent size one.

28:33.820 --> 28:37.060
You wouldn't call it big, but it's certainly good sized.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.780
We'll get extra little fish.

28:39.780 --> 28:43.060
Number two, the yellow watchman Gobi.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.140
Nothing really to say about him.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.700
I can't remember anything about him.

28:46.700 --> 28:50.740
Number three, the court jester Gobi.

28:50.740 --> 28:53.020
Why is he playing second fiddle to the other Gobi?

28:53.020 --> 28:53.580
I don't know.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.500
I can't remember.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.860
Number four, the lawnmower Blenny.

28:58.860 --> 28:59.620
I think I remember him.

28:59.620 --> 29:02.300
He scoots along the dirt.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.700
Number five, Jeff, you're going to like this one.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.260
The blue tang.

29:08.260 --> 29:08.760
Yeah.

29:08.760 --> 29:13.120
Yeah.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.520
Somewhere that Smurf pussy.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.680
Number six, the hellfreaky dartfish.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.560
They're making these up.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.120
This is not even.

29:22.120 --> 29:22.880
These aren't real fish.

29:22.880 --> 29:26.680
That one I got just because it reminded me of the Diantword

29:26.680 --> 29:27.280
song.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.760
I think hellfreaky and I like you a lot.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.520
Number seven, I can't remember the name,

29:33.520 --> 29:39.280
but Aaron and I call it the pajama boushemi cardinal fish

29:39.280 --> 29:42.160
because it reminded us of Steve Boushemi.

29:42.160 --> 29:47.080
Number eight, the royal grandma, I know, typical.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.000
Number nine, the bang-guy cardinal.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.960
Number 10, the Bartlett anthias.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.800
I mean, that's one.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.280
That one can go fuck its off.

29:57.280 --> 29:57.880
It's number 10.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.960
Dan, give me the 30 fish that didn't make the cut.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.080
I don't know.

30:02.080 --> 30:05.320
There's a bunch of blendies and grammas that don't make it.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.800
Are you going to combine these fish?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.640
You're going to pick one sort of fish?

30:08.640 --> 30:13.160
Well, we'll defer to our aquarium guy who, you know,

30:13.160 --> 30:17.040
he'll go, oh, a blendie will eat a goby.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.360
You've been with me, too, at Damon's and Glendale, right?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.480
That Tiki place, the bar, with the head

30:21.480 --> 30:22.320
to make the chi-chis.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.120
Yeah, they got some aquariums in there.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.800
Yeah, they have a bunch of aquariums.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.640
I'm not a big aquarium.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.760
I grew up with fishing aquariums.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.520
I liked them as a kid.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.600
But there was one fish that takes dirt and sucks it up

30:30.600 --> 30:33.040
in his mouth, and he goes and makes little towers over here.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.520
And he makes a little building of dirt over here, or gravel.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.280
That's one of these guys, I can't remember.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.800
That might be the blue snaky guy.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
And then they suck it up, and he gets bored with that shit

30:40.800 --> 30:42.080
and starts making one over there.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.120
And the other fish are just swimming around looking at you.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.120
They're doing nothing.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.640
This guy's working for 11.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.440
Salwater takes a very meticulous, you know,

30:50.440 --> 30:51.400
they're hard to maintain.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.960
So we got, you know, they're taking it step by step.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.160
They got to put living rock in it.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.000
Then they put some coral in it later.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.240
But first, they brought in three starter fish.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.320
Yeah, that's how you got to do it.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.400
That sounds like a shitty gig.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.720
What do they have to do?

31:08.720 --> 31:09.920
They start the water off?

31:09.920 --> 31:11.920
Yeah, well, Dino and I spent like 45 minutes

31:11.920 --> 31:14.160
like disagreeing on what the Pixar movie would be,

31:14.160 --> 31:17.680
like about starter fish.

31:17.680 --> 31:20.520
Because Dino was, I wish he was here to like defend his movie,

31:20.520 --> 31:21.760
but I was like, you don't get it.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.240
You just don't get it.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.720
Because he was like, he was obsessed with this idea

31:25.720 --> 31:29.520
that it would be the story of a starter fish's relationship

31:29.520 --> 31:31.400
with the little girl who got the aquarium,

31:31.400 --> 31:32.920
but her parents kept telling her,

31:32.920 --> 31:34.000
don't get attached to him.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.120
He's just a starter fish.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.360
Like he's going to die.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.640
And I was like, dude, your narrative's all over the fucking

31:39.640 --> 31:40.760
place.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.360
And he's like, you said the toy story.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.840
I said, yeah, exactly.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.480
Andy's a fucking meteorological phenomenon.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.240
He's moving.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.040
He likes this toy.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.040
He doesn't like that toy.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.680
The toys are the ones with the fucking complicated

31:51.680 --> 31:52.960
relationships.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.440
You can't bounce back and forth in and out of the tank.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.120
There's grownups talking to a kid and going like,

31:58.120 --> 31:59.120
don't get attached to her.

31:59.120 --> 32:02.360
What the fuck is he talking about?

32:02.360 --> 32:03.280
What's your opening?

32:03.280 --> 32:04.200
I'm glad you asked.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.360
Obviously, I mean, I don't even know

32:08.360 --> 32:09.760
that you have a choice in this matter.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.120
If it's a movie called Starter Fish, it's like, hey,

32:12.120 --> 32:12.920
we're starter fish.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.720
We're like the blue collar fish.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.080
We go into the tank and we can handle hardier water

32:18.080 --> 32:19.880
and we get things started.

32:19.880 --> 32:24.120
And we know that we do a good job when the big bright fish come

32:24.120 --> 32:26.840
in who are more sensitive and delicate

32:26.840 --> 32:28.000
and who cost more money.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.800
And they're the reason that people get the tank.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.400
I'm sorry I spit all over you.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.280
Hit pause for a second.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.960
So the Starter Fish's job is to what?

32:34.960 --> 32:36.280
They're just in there because they're cheap.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.560
And if they die, it's not as big a deal.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.920
You're making sure you've got the levels of the thing.

32:40.920 --> 32:43.280
But they actually set the levels themselves.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.360
It's like they shit.

32:44.360 --> 32:48.040
And then bacteria and stuff can grow in the carbon

32:48.040 --> 32:49.840
and the living material they put out.

32:49.840 --> 32:53.400
And that actually puts bacteria in the water.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.360
Then that bacteria eats and puts air into the water.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.280
They can breathe.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.760
They jump start the biosphere.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.120
It's called a murder fish.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.440
Anyways, my, obviously my story.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.960
That's the name of your movie, Murder Fish.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.880
Well, I think someone could throw that out at one point.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.840
Go, why don't they call you Murder Fish?

33:09.840 --> 33:10.320
Maybe.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.080
That could be like a thing in Act 1, I guess.

33:12.080 --> 33:15.920
It's in the trailer for sure.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.120
My movie's about the little starter fish that decides

33:19.120 --> 33:21.400
he wants to be the center of attention.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.600
He's not a starter fish.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.800
He's going to be the most important fish in the tank.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.800
And then everyone's like, look at that fish.

33:27.800 --> 33:31.960
And then all the, you know, you don't set the story

33:31.960 --> 33:32.880
outside the aquarium.

33:32.880 --> 33:33.720
You have all the other fish.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.000
You're like, what the fuck are you doing, starter fish?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.880
The other fish is saying, look, don't get too big

33:37.880 --> 33:38.400
for your boots.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.640
You know where we're going.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.840
We're going right down the toilet.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.000
See, you and Dina were obsessed with this lifespan thing.

33:45.000 --> 33:45.640
That's the thing.

33:45.640 --> 33:46.640
I don't want to get to that.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.120
It's not.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.360
Well, wouldn't it be Threshold Guardian starter fish?

33:49.360 --> 33:51.360
Or they would all go get them.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.400
No, no, I think yes.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.720
Of course, he would have his family would be like,

33:54.720 --> 33:55.840
don't, don't, Mickey.

33:55.840 --> 33:59.320
Don't, like, don't, you're a starter fish.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.520
Now, I don't know why.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.280
I got to finish writing the movie.

34:02.280 --> 34:07.400
But I don't know what's at stake for anybody.

34:07.400 --> 34:08.240
They're in a tank.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.120
So I don't know.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.480
Maybe there's a fish contest at the end of the movie.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.600
I don't know.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.760
I'll work on it later.

34:15.760 --> 34:18.080
Yeah, how does he go from being a starter fish to making

34:18.080 --> 34:21.240
the cut for these flashier pajamas,

34:21.240 --> 34:23.520
bushammies, and stuff like that when they come in?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.560
Well, I don't know.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.440
OK, I'm just riffing this, OK?

34:26.440 --> 34:27.480
Bad pitch.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.360
OK, Tommy, the starter fish, comes in and they go,

34:30.360 --> 34:31.640
like, kid, you're a starter fish.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.160
Do you know the code of starter fish?

34:33.160 --> 34:33.680
No, I don't.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.440
Tell me.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.560
Really, you're telling the audience.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.160
You tell them, huh?

34:37.160 --> 34:37.880
It's a starter fish.

34:37.880 --> 34:38.840
This is our code of ethics.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.240
OK, a starter fish.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.760
OK, here come all the fucked up fish.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.920
So they're the non-fucked up fish.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.920
And then, OK, so it's a love story.

34:45.920 --> 34:49.520
He falls for a girl.

34:49.520 --> 34:49.880
You know what?

34:49.880 --> 34:52.480
Maybe it needs to take place in the aquarium store

34:52.480 --> 34:54.200
in order for it to work, because then there's

34:54.200 --> 34:55.880
that whole adoption thing.

34:55.880 --> 34:56.960
Where are you going to go?

34:56.960 --> 34:58.440
That's what it has to be.

34:58.440 --> 35:03.800
It's like, oh, he falls in love with a tetra or a blue tang,

35:03.800 --> 35:04.300
probably.

35:10.800 --> 35:11.800
Or just wants to be friends.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.280
It doesn't have to be falls in love,

35:13.280 --> 35:15.400
because some people might go, they can't reproduce.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.120
Are they going to, why do you want

35:17.120 --> 35:20.520
to think about these fish fucking?

35:20.520 --> 35:23.560
And then, but then he's like, I want to go with her,

35:23.560 --> 35:24.440
so I'm going to go.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.360
So he's just in a tank full of starter fish,

35:26.360 --> 35:31.360
so then what do you do when you're just a kid born off

35:31.360 --> 35:33.480
Broadway, but you've got big dreams?

35:39.760 --> 35:42.160
So he starts flashing around.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.400
It's like a subtle, if you do it right,

35:44.400 --> 35:51.960
it could be like a subtle commentary for drag queens.

35:51.960 --> 35:55.120
He decides, I want to be flashy.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.640
And the people are like, you're weird.

35:56.640 --> 35:57.280
Stop it.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.360
That's not in your nature.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.320
You're a starter fish.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.800
And he's like, so what?

36:01.800 --> 36:03.240
That's what I was born.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.360
I don't care.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.800
I want to be a different kind of fish

36:05.800 --> 36:07.840
and get scooped out of here.

36:07.840 --> 36:13.080
And I'm going to go be on the metaphor for whatever RuPaul

36:13.080 --> 36:17.160
show, which is going into some little girl's

36:17.160 --> 36:18.040
tank in her bedroom.

36:23.160 --> 36:26.480
What's the bottoming out of that?

36:26.480 --> 36:28.480
What's the Randy Newman theme song?

36:28.480 --> 36:30.320
Oh, that's that.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.200
I guess so.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.680
Because I got a thing for you.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.840
No, no, no.

36:36.840 --> 36:40.280
That's his terrible size where he's just talking.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.120
Oh, swimming water.

36:42.120 --> 36:46.040
Water, swimming, friend.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.520
It's not a song, just because there's

36:47.520 --> 36:48.760
a piano in the background.

36:51.680 --> 36:55.200
All right, so next week, we're not here,

36:55.200 --> 36:58.000
because we're doing the Rick and Morty Premier Party.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.200
It's the premieres on Sunday.

36:59.200 --> 37:08.720
So apparently, I've been asked to host a streaming of the thing.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.160
Yeah, you're helping us out there at the party.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.080
I should probably get to see the episode

37:13.080 --> 37:15.560
before that happens, so I know what the hell I'm talking about.

37:15.560 --> 37:23.320
Yeah, it could be a disaster, because you'd be like,

37:23.320 --> 37:25.000
what are you going to see?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.760
I don't even know what you're going to be doing.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.480
Me neither.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.760
Then the week after that, it gets more confusing.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.840
We're going to be in New York.

37:32.840 --> 37:33.320
Right?

37:33.320 --> 37:34.440
Is that right?

37:34.440 --> 37:36.160
We are, but I guess.

37:36.160 --> 37:37.800
That show's already sold out, because it's

37:37.800 --> 37:38.800
in a teeny little theater.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.080
Not that you guys were going to fly to New York to see us,

37:41.080 --> 37:45.000
for those of you listening to New York.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.280
And then we're back here, and we're rolling like James Brolin.

37:56.000 --> 37:56.840
Do you think I?

37:56.840 --> 37:59.000
Do you?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Are you?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.720
Is there anybody here that's lactose intolerant?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.200
There's got to be.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.680
OK.

38:05.680 --> 38:09.840
So I'm going to ask you a couple yes or no questions.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.520
Do you fart a lot when you?

38:11.520 --> 38:12.020
OK.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.760
Does it hurt?

38:17.760 --> 38:18.520
OK.

38:18.520 --> 38:24.560
So it's just like, so if you just had a cheeseburger.

38:30.240 --> 38:34.280
So is it possible that I could have been lactose intolerant

38:34.280 --> 38:37.200
my whole life, and I'm just now noticing,

38:37.200 --> 38:39.520
because I fart so much?

38:39.520 --> 38:40.440
What did you say?

38:40.440 --> 38:42.080
You shart yourself a lot.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.440
Shart yourself?

38:43.440 --> 38:44.720
What are you, what are you, British?

38:48.280 --> 38:49.680
You do poop your pants a lot.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.160
Well, yeah, but that's alcoholism.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.160
That's.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.600
I'm a drunk, too.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.560
I don't poop my pants ever.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.840
Well, it could be a combination.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.040
If I'm drunk and eating a lot of dairy,

39:01.040 --> 39:03.840
then I'm farting so much that I'm

39:03.840 --> 39:05.720
my inhibitions and judgment are lowered,

39:05.720 --> 39:08.400
so then I'm like, here comes a great fart.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.480
I'm like, I don't realize.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.240
Now, have you ever pooped your pants sober?

39:12.240 --> 39:13.360
Let's figure this out.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.240
Well, I don't know.

39:14.240 --> 39:18.280
Yeah, I have, because I remember in comedy sports,

39:18.280 --> 39:21.880
I remember at the Marriott Hotel.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.240
I went up to.

39:23.240 --> 39:24.840
Yeah, I remember very distinctly,

39:24.840 --> 39:27.440
because Dick Chudnow, the founder of comedy sports,

39:27.440 --> 39:29.560
was setting up the stage.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.520
And he said something like, I wonder

39:32.520 --> 39:35.440
if we should play this game or that game tonight, or whatever.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.840
And I said, well, you know, Dick, I

39:37.840 --> 39:39.400
felt like a fart coming.

39:39.400 --> 39:44.960
And I said, well, you know, a real crowd pleaser is if we.

39:44.960 --> 39:48.720
And I just shit in my pants.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.680
There was no sound.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.840
And I just walked away and had to throw my pants

40:01.840 --> 40:03.320
and my underwear in the garbage.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.720
I was like, I had no pants.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.240
I had to borrow someone else's pants.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.240
And they knew.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.480
It's not like I took a shower.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.920
It's like, so they knew that they'd then

40:10.920 --> 40:13.600
have to throw their pants away, too.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.120
Did they know what happened?

40:15.120 --> 40:15.800
Everyone knew.

40:15.800 --> 40:20.360
There was no way I was going to let that be a secret.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.720
And that's just more humiliation.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.680
As soon as that shit starts, I'm going to ground zero,

40:26.680 --> 40:29.480
wait, a Def Con, whatever.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.200
I'm not going to let somebody go.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.520
Damn shit, his pants.

40:33.520 --> 40:36.160
I was on stage in LA with a guy, one of the dudes

40:36.160 --> 40:38.200
in our show, who was the referee.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.840
Right before, a good set of intermission

40:39.840 --> 40:40.960
is called halftime.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.040
And all of a sudden, it smelled like somebody

40:43.040 --> 40:43.800
shit their pants.

40:43.800 --> 40:47.160
And certainly enough, our referee had just completely

40:47.160 --> 40:49.360
filled his pants.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.680
And so he came back out at halftime for the second act.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.200
And instead of having black trousers on,

40:56.200 --> 40:59.000
like he'd had to start the thing, now he had like navy blue

40:59.000 --> 41:00.680
or royal blue sweatpants.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.480
But no underwear, so you could see a little wiener

41:02.480 --> 41:04.160
in the clothing.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.960
And it was mesmerizing.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.320
He'd talk over here and a wiener over here.

41:07.320 --> 41:11.320
And he'd talk over there and wiener over there.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.400
I know who that guy is, because he's totally like that.

41:13.400 --> 41:14.720
I wanted to mention his name so bad.

41:14.720 --> 41:18.080
There was this kid named Noah in my grade school, Noah.

41:18.080 --> 41:21.800
I can't remember his last name or boy, I'd tell you.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.160
But I remember his first name was Noah.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.600
And by his own account, he was allergic to cheese.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.560
So I think we just didn't know it was called lactose intolerance

41:29.560 --> 41:30.320
back then.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.200
But he said, I'm allergic to cheese.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.520
And we go, what do you mean?

41:33.520 --> 41:35.080
Like you sneeze when you eat it?

41:35.080 --> 41:36.640
And he's like, no, I shit my pants.

41:39.640 --> 41:43.200
But then it was the 80s, and it was a public school.

41:43.200 --> 41:47.400
So he would take a dollar to eat cheese.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.640
People would give him a dollar.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.600
And he'd go like, really?

41:49.600 --> 41:50.600
A dollar?

41:50.600 --> 41:53.600
I was like, just moose.

41:53.600 --> 41:57.320
And he had some witticism like, poops temporary.

41:57.320 --> 41:58.440
Money's forever anyway.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.400
I wish that were true, Dan.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.600
Like, my pants will be cleaned tomorrow.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.280
Like, yeah, but it's going to cost a dollar to wash them.

42:08.280 --> 42:10.280
Yes, tomorrow my pants will be cleaned.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.480
But I shall be rich.

42:13.480 --> 42:18.680
And I remember one time he shit his pants in the cafeteria.

42:18.680 --> 42:19.680
What age are we talking?

42:19.680 --> 42:20.180
I'm sorry.

42:20.180 --> 42:21.040
No, it wasn't him.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.040
I mean, Noah would shit his pants all the time.

42:23.040 --> 42:26.600
But he did it on purpose, and then I

42:26.600 --> 42:27.640
think he'd just go home.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.440
And I think he would just whistle the theme

42:29.440 --> 42:30.560
from the ending of the show.

42:30.560 --> 42:36.160
And it's like, I guess he was the kid that was nailing it,

42:36.160 --> 42:36.660
right?

42:36.660 --> 42:39.880
It's like, I shit my pants when I eat cheese.

42:39.880 --> 42:42.200
I'll give you a dollar to do that.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.120
OK.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.160
Goodbye, school.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.400
Hello, dollar.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.520
I have to go do two things.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.320
I have to go do some laundry and go to the bank.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.680
So, but there was this kid.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.960
I can't remember his name, but.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.720
I wish you could because the names of your friends from school

43:04.720 --> 43:06.360
are hilarious.

43:06.360 --> 43:10.800
OK, I want to say his, I do remember his name.

43:10.800 --> 43:11.920
And I remember his full name.

43:11.920 --> 43:12.960
His first name was Henry.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.880
I want to say his last name because it's adorable,

43:14.880 --> 43:16.960
but it's alliterative.

43:16.960 --> 43:22.080
But he was an adorable, very quiet kid, and he shit his pants.

43:22.080 --> 43:27.040
And for some reason, this is what's really weird.

43:27.040 --> 43:31.560
This is what would have been first grade, not kindergarten.

43:31.560 --> 43:35.880
Because in kindergarten, I told you the story of how I,

43:35.880 --> 43:37.800
in kindergarten, you don't even know where you're going.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.840
They used to take me to that special room when I was in

43:39.840 --> 43:41.400
kindergarten because I knew how to read.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.440
And they would like, they left me in this room.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.640
And I didn't know how to read the clocks.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.680
Has he told the story before?

43:46.680 --> 43:47.680
I had to.

43:47.680 --> 43:48.160
Yeah.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.360
Yeah, yeah.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.640
I was like, I know when the bell rings,

43:50.640 --> 43:51.880
I get to go to the bathroom.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.080
But I don't know what time it is.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.720
And I don't know when the bell's going to ring.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.320
And I had to pee.

43:55.320 --> 43:58.040
And I just peed in the chair.

43:58.040 --> 44:00.480
I just was in the middle of this walking closet surrounded

44:00.480 --> 44:01.280
by textbooks.

44:01.280 --> 44:04.560
And I just went, pssh.

44:04.560 --> 44:08.520
And right in the middle of it, it was like, prrrrring the bell.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.160
And I was just like, psh.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.520
And it just kept going.

44:12.520 --> 44:16.520
And then I just got up and took a look back.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.040
And there's this big ocean of pee.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.040
And I just hit the lights.

44:19.040 --> 44:23.520
And while I left it, I just piss all the way past.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.920
And went and got in the lunch line thinking, oh, yeah,

44:25.920 --> 44:26.680
no one will notice.

44:26.680 --> 44:32.200
I was like, you look like you were riding a painted horse

44:32.200 --> 44:33.160
that hadn't dried yet.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.640
Of course, people are going to notice.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.120
And the guy who really pointed it out,

44:36.120 --> 44:37.920
my brother, who was in sixth grade at the time,

44:37.920 --> 44:39.960
was like, did you piss your pants in the whole school?

44:39.960 --> 44:41.240
I was like, you pissed your pants.

44:41.240 --> 44:44.280
Anyways, when I was in first grade,

44:44.280 --> 44:44.880
Did you cry?

44:44.880 --> 44:46.760
Like, was that horrible?

44:46.760 --> 44:47.360
I don't think.

44:47.360 --> 44:51.360
I think that was so weird that I don't think I cried.

44:51.360 --> 44:52.720
I think I've cried it.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.440
I've cried it less.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.960
Did you realize you could have been making money on this

44:55.960 --> 44:57.560
the whole time?

44:57.560 --> 45:00.760
You could have peed in your pants for $1 a pop.

45:00.760 --> 45:06.600
So this kid, Henry, Miss Piana comes up to me at lunch,

45:06.600 --> 45:07.400
first grade.

45:07.400 --> 45:10.520
And she goes, she's got Henry.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.560
She's holding his hand.

45:12.560 --> 45:16.160
And she goes, Daniel, will you take Henry to the bathroom?

45:16.160 --> 45:18.600
He had an accident.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.960
Now, I never shit my pants in school as far as I know.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.240
So I don't know why I'm an expert.

45:22.240 --> 45:23.280
Like, send him with Noah.

45:23.280 --> 45:27.520
You know, like, Noah, I'll show him the ropes.

45:27.520 --> 45:31.120
Maybe that's what she was worried about.

45:31.120 --> 45:34.560
We don't need another poop tycoon in our school.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.560
I think it was like, because I was smart.

45:36.560 --> 45:37.680
I was the smart kid.

45:37.680 --> 45:39.160
I was supposed to handle it.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.480
It was like, I could be like an expert.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.200
Or that you dealt with the trauma of peeing yourself

45:42.200 --> 45:45.040
so well that you thought, I can take it.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.040
Yeah.

45:47.040 --> 45:50.000
Yeah, I remember going into the coat room where the bathrooms

45:50.000 --> 45:51.440
were, and he just went into a stall.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.360
And I was just kind of like, I have

45:53.360 --> 45:54.680
such a clear memory of that.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.040
Like, I was just hanging out by the winter coats,

45:57.040 --> 45:59.520
just kind of trying to talk him through it,

45:59.520 --> 46:03.040
like an old war buddy or something.

46:03.040 --> 46:07.080
I pooped my pants all the time, uh-huh, OK.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.360
Oh, man, it's everywhere.

46:08.360 --> 46:08.920
It's all right.

46:08.920 --> 46:09.600
It's OK, man.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.680
Just clean it up.

46:11.680 --> 46:17.080
I don't know what I was supposed to do.

46:17.080 --> 46:17.920
That's so weird.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.800
Yeah.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.360
It's a positive memory for me, though,

46:21.360 --> 46:22.680
because I felt like I did it right.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.200
But I'm sure I didn't.

46:24.200 --> 46:24.760
I don't know.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.880
I'm sure I wasn't supposed to help him.

46:26.880 --> 46:30.880
That would be crazy if the teacher wanted me to help.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.960
She couldn't have wanted that.

46:31.960 --> 46:36.680
Yeah, how would she have judged the success of that task?

46:36.680 --> 46:38.400
Like, what was she hoping would happen?

46:38.400 --> 46:40.840
I mean, usually you go to the nurse,

46:40.840 --> 46:42.400
or they call a parent or something, right?

46:42.400 --> 46:44.120
I guess this was in the past.

46:44.120 --> 46:47.320
Yeah, this was in dinosaur times.

46:47.320 --> 46:51.400
There weren't, there were probably just as many pedophiles

46:51.400 --> 46:53.760
and kidnappings, but there was no internet yet.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.280
So it was just sort of like, well,

46:55.280 --> 46:58.240
as long as he's with someone, we can't just

46:58.240 --> 47:00.320
send him off into the world.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.200
We'll send him with two kids, so they'll

47:02.200 --> 47:03.160
be harder to kidnap.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.880
We had beatings in my elementary school.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.440
Like, you got corporal punishment.

47:07.440 --> 47:10.840
Like, there were hard spankings at our school.

47:10.840 --> 47:12.160
I don't think we ever, we would get,

47:12.160 --> 47:12.960
That's hilarious.

47:12.960 --> 47:16.080
For our birthdays there were.

47:16.080 --> 47:18.960
We got, we got paddled for our birthdays.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.040
You could hear kids getting spanked

47:20.040 --> 47:20.880
or someone did something bad.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.280
I feel like I've told the story before,

47:22.280 --> 47:24.200
but there was a ping-pong paddle supposedly,

47:24.200 --> 47:26.320
and they really whacked the crap out of you.

47:26.320 --> 47:30.000
Not quite, but you could hear it from outside the building.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
And so you'd be in there like, it was like,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.800
like a scene from some World War II, like prisoner movie,

47:34.800 --> 47:36.840
and you could hear the kids screaming, you'll wham!

47:36.840 --> 47:40.040
Ah, this is the fucking worst.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.560
And then what, supposedly the legend was there was one kid

47:42.560 --> 47:45.080
that was so badass, he clenched up his butt cheeks

47:45.080 --> 47:46.640
and broke the ping-pong paddle.

47:46.640 --> 47:52.280
Like, he was famous whether or not that ever happened,

47:52.280 --> 47:53.680
but he was like, he was Paul Bunyan.

47:53.680 --> 47:57.240
His ass is so muscular.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.040
He just fought it so hard,

47:59.040 --> 48:03.080
he's like, it's fucking, he destroyed a ping-pong paddle.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.080
Well, my mom would hit us with a wooden spoon,

48:05.080 --> 48:06.800
and every once in a while, the wooden spoon would break.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.600
Oh yeah, I'm sure that there was stress crack,

48:08.600 --> 48:09.600
there was fatigue in that wood.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.320
I hate that that kid got credit for,

48:12.320 --> 48:13.600
because it's like, if you just hit a rock

48:13.600 --> 48:15.600
with a ping-pong paddle, it's not going to break.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.400
It's not like because it's so hard.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.280
Yeah.

48:18.280 --> 48:23.400
Like, he just, someone else's ass wore that thing out for him.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.440
Yeah, where's their credit?

48:24.440 --> 48:26.600
Yeah.

48:26.600 --> 48:29.320
No, I don't think anybody got...

48:29.320 --> 48:31.000
They call those starter butts.

48:31.000 --> 48:47.000
Like...

48:47.000 --> 48:50.120
I'm trying to remember, even like maybe before,

48:50.120 --> 48:51.640
because my brother was five years ahead of me,

48:51.640 --> 48:53.400
so like, any stories about,

48:53.400 --> 48:55.720
I hear stories about teachers throwing erasers

48:55.720 --> 48:58.760
and throwing chalk and throwing tantrums and stuff.

48:58.760 --> 49:01.560
Like, yeah, there were teachers who would have

49:01.560 --> 49:03.320
like, nervous breakdowns, but then they would get,

49:03.320 --> 49:04.760
like, they would disappear, you know,

49:04.760 --> 49:06.120
because they did something physical.

49:06.120 --> 49:06.960
We had a crazy teacher that locked, like,

49:06.960 --> 49:08.920
if you made her mad, she was kind of like,

49:08.920 --> 49:12.280
on and off medication, and if she was off her medication,

49:12.280 --> 49:15.360
she would just lock kids in a cabinet.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.400
And like, that was the punished man.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.440
And then people, she got fired for that, of course.

49:18.440 --> 49:19.600
We found out about that.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.240
But suddenly, she would go like,

49:21.240 --> 49:22.880
Mr. Davis, get out of here.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.560
Like, yeah, you've disrupted the class too many times.

49:25.560 --> 49:28.400
You go run around the school.

49:28.400 --> 49:29.880
Now, our school was enormous.

49:29.880 --> 49:31.640
Like, it would take you the rest of the day,

49:31.640 --> 49:34.520
so I just went to my car and went home.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.520
Then we found that out, so we would just try to piss her off,

49:36.520 --> 49:38.040
and she would go take a lap,

49:38.040 --> 49:39.240
and then we would just go to like,

49:39.240 --> 49:40.080
Derewienerschnitzel.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.560
I almost died at Derewienerschnitzel at lunch, by the way.

49:45.560 --> 49:46.960
The guy was taking a bite of a corn dog,

49:46.960 --> 49:49.840
and my friend John, while I was taking a bite of his corn dog,

49:49.840 --> 49:52.040
he just thought it'd be funny if he gave me more than I wanted,

49:52.040 --> 49:54.480
and he'd shoved the entire corn dog down my mouth.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.640
But before I knew it was happening,

49:55.640 --> 49:57.600
I had bitten the corn dog off.

49:57.600 --> 50:00.600
Now I've got an entire corn dog in my throat,

50:00.600 --> 50:02.000
and it's not gonna come back out.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.400
There's no way to get a handle on the corn dog

50:04.400 --> 50:07.240
with your mouth, and I'm just going, I'm dying here.

50:07.240 --> 50:08.960
And then everybody looked at me and realized

50:08.960 --> 50:11.400
that I was dying, and everybody froze.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.360
And so then, one big strong friend of mine,

50:14.360 --> 50:16.960
we called Bam Bam, he just came up and picked me upside down,

50:16.960 --> 50:18.320
shook me by my ankle.

50:18.320 --> 50:19.160
Oh, man.

50:19.160 --> 50:22.640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

50:22.640 --> 50:23.640
But I digress.

50:24.840 --> 50:27.480
I do remember thinking in that moment of crisis

50:27.480 --> 50:28.680
when I thought, okay, I can't breathe.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.880
It's been a while now.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.120
I need to start breathing soon.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.800
There's nothing I can do to help this thing out.

50:32.800 --> 50:33.680
It will not go down.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.160
It's not gonna come out.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.360
And I remember thinking, not like this.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.320
Oh, man.

50:39.320 --> 50:42.280
Well, did you notice, like, so everybody in this room

50:42.280 --> 50:43.960
probably has had, like, a choking incident

50:43.960 --> 50:45.880
where you actually, like, you kind of, like,

50:45.880 --> 50:48.880
it triggers this very specific response in your brain.

50:48.880 --> 50:52.360
Like, you feel like this could be it.

50:52.360 --> 50:56.160
Like, and it takes very little for that to get triggered

50:56.160 --> 50:59.240
because you're like, oh, my God, I didn't realize

50:59.240 --> 51:01.840
how accustomed I am to breathing whenever I want.

51:01.840 --> 51:05.520
And it's weird how, number one,

51:05.520 --> 51:07.080
how everyone around you kind of freezes.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.000
And I've been that guy.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.160
Dino and I were eating at Little Dom's

51:11.160 --> 51:15.080
with our newly hired CFO at the time.

51:15.080 --> 51:17.360
He was just having dinner with him to talk about

51:17.360 --> 51:19.680
how excited we were for him to be turning the company

51:19.680 --> 51:21.880
around to our animation studio.

51:21.880 --> 51:23.640
And he's like, yeah, and it's gonna be great.

51:23.640 --> 51:26.240
And he's eating this, you know, the hanger steak.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.880
And he's just like, yeah, I'm really excited about it.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.520
And I can't wait to get some health plans

51:29.520 --> 51:31.320
for the staffers.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.040
And I'm like, yeah, morale could be higher over

51:33.040 --> 51:34.920
if the animation thing, we could kind of fix

51:34.920 --> 51:35.760
that air conditioning.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.600
And he's like, yeah.

51:36.600 --> 51:41.200
And I really want to, and Dino and I were kind of like,

51:41.200 --> 51:45.440
like, it's weird.

51:45.440 --> 51:49.720
Like, I don't know, like, and he, he, he, he, he, he.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.280
You're supposed to overreact to possible choking.

51:52.280 --> 51:56.640
And the bartender did, like, he, he was coming around

51:56.640 --> 52:00.400
soon enough that before Dino and I started to do

52:00.400 --> 52:02.720
the right thing, he was already over there.

52:02.720 --> 52:05.440
Plus on top of it, by the time anybody got close to him,

52:05.440 --> 52:10.440
he, he just came out onto the floor and he picked it up

52:12.040 --> 52:13.720
with a napkin and continued the conversation.

52:13.720 --> 52:16.840
But, but we were sort of like, oh, we can never

52:16.840 --> 52:17.920
unlive that experience.

52:17.920 --> 52:21.760
Like, like, I just might have just watched a guy die,

52:21.760 --> 52:22.600
I guess.

52:22.600 --> 52:23.840
Like, I don't know what, what I would have done

52:23.840 --> 52:24.800
and when I would have done it.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.800
And the other, the other weird thing is that

52:26.800 --> 52:30.680
on the choking side, the instinct very often is to like,

52:30.680 --> 52:33.760
hide, like people die because they start to choke

52:33.760 --> 52:35.360
and then they like go to the bathroom

52:35.360 --> 52:36.760
because they're embarrassed.

52:36.760 --> 52:39.360
I, and I, I've, I've, I've been in that situation.

52:39.360 --> 52:42.000
And it is weird how much shame gets triggered.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.280
Cause you, you're, you're choking.

52:43.280 --> 52:46.760
And I guess cause you, maybe you feel like a pig

52:46.760 --> 52:47.600
or something.

52:47.600 --> 52:50.560
Like you just feel, you feel like, well, what's inside

52:50.560 --> 52:52.720
your body shouldn't be anyone's business or something.

52:52.720 --> 52:55.080
And so you're just like, you kind of want to go hide

52:55.080 --> 52:58.160
somewhere until it's over, which could kill you.

52:58.160 --> 52:59.960
For me, I, I thought I'll handle this.

52:59.960 --> 53:02.120
Like, like, let me get this corn dog out of my mouth.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.080
And at some point, like I'm dying and I need somebody's

53:04.080 --> 53:05.080
else's help here.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.240
By that time, I kept waving everybody off, I think.

53:07.240 --> 53:10.160
So everybody was like in stasis the whole time.

53:10.160 --> 53:11.000
Yeah.

53:11.000 --> 53:11.840
That's good.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.120
I mean, in the seventies, they had that whole Heimlich

53:13.120 --> 53:15.080
awareness campaign.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.720
I guess there must have just, it must have just been

53:16.720 --> 53:20.800
terrible like to, it must have happened all the time.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.800
People just like eating in a restaurant and they just

53:22.800 --> 53:25.520
like turned blue and everyone's just going, oh no,

53:25.520 --> 53:26.360
Harold.

53:26.360 --> 53:29.240
And they just watch them die.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.080
I always thought that that would be like, if I, I don't

53:31.080 --> 53:34.520
have tattoos and I don't want any, but like CPR diagram

53:34.520 --> 53:36.240
and Heimlich maneuver diagram.

53:36.240 --> 53:39.000
So, oh, if you're choking, just rip open your shirtling.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.680
You know, there's a trick for the CPR cause you know, you

53:43.680 --> 53:44.960
do chest compressions, right?

53:44.960 --> 53:47.480
But you got to do it like a special rhythm.

53:47.480 --> 53:51.040
The rhythm is the beat of the song, Stayin' Alive.

53:51.040 --> 53:53.040
The disco song, you know?

53:53.040 --> 53:54.200
When you compress, you go pump.

53:54.200 --> 53:58.360
You go, ha, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' Alive, Stayin' Alive.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.840
Oh, oh, you don't stop for the thing.

53:59.840 --> 54:03.520
No, to the beat, you know, ha, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' Alive.

54:03.520 --> 54:04.360
You just keep pumpin'.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.440
But couldn't that also be, I want to fuck you

54:06.440 --> 54:09.080
like an animal?

54:09.080 --> 54:10.400
I want to.

54:10.400 --> 54:14.160
Just hear those sleigh bells going around.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.880
I guess that the picture of this is Stayin' Alive.

54:15.880 --> 54:19.360
It's also a morale booster.

54:19.360 --> 54:23.080
I think it makes people excited to know something.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.760
It made me excited.

54:25.760 --> 54:28.720
We are the world.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.560
We are the children.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.480
I mean, just pump their chest.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.360
If it helps, pretend it's a song.

54:36.360 --> 54:40.920
Fuck the police.

54:40.920 --> 54:41.760
Fuck the police.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.520
Come on down for the men and women.

54:50.640 --> 54:54.040
Will you know my name?

54:54.040 --> 54:55.640
If I see you in heaven.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.240
Oh, no.

54:59.240 --> 55:02.040
No, not the air-exlecting.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.800
It's also too slow a tempo.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.560
It's too slow.

55:06.560 --> 55:09.960
All right, well, back to this farting thing.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.120
So I'm lactose intolerant, for sure, I think.

55:12.120 --> 55:15.000
Because it's like, when I'm eating beans and stuff,

55:15.000 --> 55:16.960
I fart like regular people that eat beans.

55:16.960 --> 55:20.040
Like, it's a musical fruit, as you know.

55:20.040 --> 55:22.560
But it's like predictable amount of bean farting.

55:22.560 --> 55:27.080
But then, if I have like a pint of ice cream or, you know,

55:27.080 --> 55:32.200
dairy, like, I'm capable of generating so much.

55:32.200 --> 55:34.320
There must just be some incredible thing happening.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.720
Have you tried cutting out all dairy

55:35.720 --> 55:36.840
just to see if that goes away?

55:36.840 --> 55:39.000
Well, I effectively have with this.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.520
Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

55:40.520 --> 55:45.480
I finally, it took me 42 years to accidentally

55:45.480 --> 55:46.880
have that experiment.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.680
I never tried it.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.480
But today you had a load of dairy, right?

55:50.480 --> 55:51.240
Like, are you?

55:51.240 --> 55:55.360
Yeah, I'm saying, today you're farting because of that.

55:55.360 --> 55:57.160
But when you cut it out, that stops.

55:57.160 --> 55:58.920
Yes, for the rest of the week, it's not there.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.040
But then it's like, oh, and then I

56:00.040 --> 56:02.720
have like some ice cream or a pina colada or something.

56:02.720 --> 56:05.120
And then it's like, holy gemoli.

56:05.120 --> 56:08.320
Like, I feel like I could fill a hot air balloon.

56:08.320 --> 56:13.640
And there might be a way to tap it for global energy.

56:13.640 --> 56:15.920
It just seems like an amazing thing

56:15.920 --> 56:17.560
that a human being can generate so much.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.440
We can at least have our own hot air balloon.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.600
Yeah.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.280
My friend Sam, he was my neighbor.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.280
He had this lovely family.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.600
They were a very cohesive nuclear family.

56:26.600 --> 56:30.920
And they all had, the family joke was cherries made them

56:30.920 --> 56:32.320
all fart like mad.

56:32.320 --> 56:34.160
So they would all, you go to their house,

56:34.160 --> 56:35.560
and they would put out a bowl of cherries,

56:35.560 --> 56:36.960
and they'd all start laughing.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.560
So I was eating cherries, and they're laughing.

56:39.560 --> 56:41.960
Mom, dad, like old people, young people,

56:41.960 --> 56:44.440
everyone's just farting.

56:44.440 --> 56:45.040
Cherries.

56:45.040 --> 56:48.400
I don't like that story.

56:48.400 --> 56:49.160
So yeah.

56:49.160 --> 56:49.800
I don't know why.

56:49.800 --> 56:50.400
I don't know why.

56:50.400 --> 56:53.720
Their past time is to invite guests over and just fart

56:53.720 --> 56:54.640
all over the place.

56:54.640 --> 56:56.000
I guess because it's a family, I guess

56:56.000 --> 56:57.120
that's what I don't like about it.

56:57.120 --> 56:57.880
Yeah.

56:57.880 --> 56:58.600
I don't like that it's a family.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.080
You resent that the family bonded over anything?

57:01.080 --> 57:02.920
It's like the hills have eyes, kind of.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.480
Yeah.

57:05.480 --> 57:05.960
Yeah.

57:05.960 --> 57:06.920
Except they don't.

57:06.920 --> 57:09.240
Because if the hills had eyes, some of those eyes

57:09.240 --> 57:14.200
would lend to self-awareness.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.200
If the hills had enough eyes, the hills

57:16.200 --> 57:18.360
could see themselves for what they were.

57:18.360 --> 57:19.440
And that family can't.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.040
So you are not upset about family farting.

57:21.040 --> 57:27.560
You just that resonated for you of a close, cohesive family.

57:27.560 --> 57:31.320
I don't think I'm jealous of the cherry farted family.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.520
I don't like them.

57:33.520 --> 57:36.160
I think they're too close.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.760
I don't like that.

57:37.760 --> 57:39.320
Where are they doing that together?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.160
Well, tell me more about them.

57:45.160 --> 57:51.720
What did they do with bananas?

57:51.720 --> 57:54.000
Did they shower together?

57:54.000 --> 57:56.240
They were the Smotherman family.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.280
And I went to high school.

57:57.280 --> 57:58.400
The Smotherman family?

57:58.400 --> 58:00.160
Smotherman.

58:00.160 --> 58:04.680
When I moved back from when I was on the play on Broadway

58:04.680 --> 58:06.640
when I was 10, 11, and then I came back to L.A.

58:06.640 --> 58:06.880
It's 9, 11.

58:06.880 --> 58:08.720
For the first time, 9, 11.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.220
OK.

58:09.220 --> 58:09.720
All right.

58:09.720 --> 58:10.520
Woo-hoo!

58:14.520 --> 58:15.000
Good.

58:15.000 --> 58:15.520
Good.

58:15.520 --> 58:16.840
That was good.

58:16.840 --> 58:20.320
That's a healthier response to 9, 11.

58:20.320 --> 58:22.840
My first day back, I moved back to Whittier,

58:22.840 --> 58:25.520
which I'd never lived in, but my grandmother lived there.

58:25.520 --> 58:27.520
When I was a little kid, we had like a big house

58:27.520 --> 58:28.520
with horses and stuff.

58:28.520 --> 58:30.560
And then gradually, my family lost all of our money.

58:30.560 --> 58:32.520
And then I went on the road with my mom.

58:32.520 --> 58:34.440
And then my dad was back home.

58:34.440 --> 58:35.720
I think they would have gotten divorced.

58:35.720 --> 58:38.240
We came back, and we lived in this really small house

58:38.240 --> 58:40.120
with this shitty car.

58:40.120 --> 58:41.520
I didn't know anybody would move in this kind of.

58:41.520 --> 58:43.240
It's not a great neighborhood.

58:43.240 --> 58:45.960
It wasn't like living in a horrible Detroit

58:45.960 --> 58:49.200
or some terrible gunfire going off all night long.

58:49.200 --> 58:52.600
But it was like I lived in a really nice, hilly, beautiful

58:52.600 --> 58:53.240
childhood.

58:53.240 --> 58:55.520
Now I didn't know anybody.

58:55.520 --> 58:57.800
And I remember laying on my parents' bed

58:57.800 --> 58:59.040
in this new little house.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.600
And all I could hear was a plane going overhead.

59:01.600 --> 59:04.280
And when you fly into L.A.X., if you're coming back into L.A.

59:04.280 --> 59:06.040
and when you hear the flaps go down,

59:06.040 --> 59:08.080
if you look at the window, you can see my high school.

59:08.080 --> 59:09.880
That's the sound of, you can hear it from the ground.

59:09.880 --> 59:13.240
That whew of the planes decelerating.

59:13.240 --> 59:16.680
And I started crying, because it was the only noise I heard.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.720
And I just lived in New York for about a year,

59:18.720 --> 59:21.360
where it's just all this input and action and stuff.

59:21.360 --> 59:22.680
So I was really depressed.

59:22.680 --> 59:24.280
And this kid went by on a skateboard.

59:24.280 --> 59:25.240
And that was Sam Smotherman.

59:25.240 --> 59:26.400
And he lived just down the block.

59:26.400 --> 59:28.640
And their family was so cool.

59:28.640 --> 59:30.800
And their dad, they were all really Christian,

59:30.800 --> 59:33.880
but the most adorable, wonderful version of that.

59:33.880 --> 59:35.400
And if everybody were like that, you

59:35.400 --> 59:39.080
wouldn't have any negative attachments to that.

59:39.080 --> 59:40.160
They would sit around.

59:40.160 --> 59:42.600
Sam got really sick as a kid, like some disease.

59:42.600 --> 59:44.560
And then he got really wounded in a car accident.

59:44.560 --> 59:47.480
And all this, they went through a lot of family crises.

59:47.480 --> 59:49.200
And they would sit down as a unit.

59:49.200 --> 59:50.400
And they would just talk it out.

59:50.400 --> 59:53.120
And they would, like, if it came down to it,

59:53.120 --> 59:54.480
the father would just say, well, you know,

59:54.480 --> 59:56.240
it says in the book of James or whatever.

59:56.240 --> 59:58.960
And they were not like in a pedantic or pedagogical

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.800
or a preachery way.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.240
I just sat there watching it.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.280
And it was just like, this is marvelous.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.160
And then the cherries would come to the table.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.840
Well, I hung out there so often.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.520
I still have dreams where I'm knocking on Sam's motherman's

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.240
door from when I was 13 or 12.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.200
But that kitchen, and that one day, I hung out there so much,

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.520
there was a bowl of cherries out there.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.600
And I took one, and they all started snickering.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.320
And I was like, what's the joke?

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.160
And they're like, it makes the smotherman's part.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.560
It makes the smotherman's part.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.160
Now do you like them?

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.040
Yeah, the smotherman's are fine now.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.640
I was pictured on more like white trash,

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.120
like they drank antifreeze.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:45.760
And one of them like huffed himself to death in the basement.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.960
But he was still kind of half alive in the hospital.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.920
And they would like in order to make their cars go faster,

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.440
they would spit into the air scoop.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.120
Spencer, are you OK?

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.720
How did they reach the air scoop from there?

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.200
They climb out into the hood.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.840
This is assuming someone else is driving.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.680
Yeah, of course.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.800
And you're trying to catch somebody

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.400
to keep them from taking all the petrol or the.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.320
Is that actually a thing?

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.480
Are there car people here?

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.040
Did we know that that works, spitting fuel

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.280
into the air scoop, you think?

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:22.760
Wait, what?

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.400
Do we know that that actually works, like Mad Max?

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.320
I don't know.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.960
Anybody here?

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.280
We're not a car crowd.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:27.800
Yeah.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.040
I mean, what are you even asking?

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.480
And Mad Max, when they go out in the thing

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.640
and they're spitting the second fuel out of a hose,

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.840
and they're spitting it into the intake valves

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.560
on the hoods of the car, and the car gets super boosted

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.480
and goes really fast.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.240
I'm not.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.320
Oh, yeah.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:42.960
Anybody?

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.760
I'm sure that works perfectly.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.440
It's not.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.760
That doesn't work?

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.200
No, it would flood the engine.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.040
It would flood the engine.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.520
What if it was like crazy Mad Max cars, though?

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.120
OK.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.200
I mean, you mean it would flood the engine eventually.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.000
Damn.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.040
Like, that's why they didn't design the cars to just

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.800
have a guy spitting tape to the front of the car,

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.080
because that would have been impractical.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.200
But they're like, this is life or death.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.520
They could have just invented a little hose

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.600
when he's like a little squirt model,

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.160
like a just like fire.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.120
But then they'd overuse it.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.160
You know, those guys are nuts.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.200
Those little, they're anemic guys covered in tumors.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.480
They're spray painting their war boys.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.080
War boys.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.960
Those guys are crazy.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.640
They have no impulse control.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.480
You can't give them a hose and say,

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.000
only do this when you really need it.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.440
Your whole society is founded on their feral ferocity.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.000
You can't then just ask them to do something in moderation.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:42.760
How dare you?

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.400
So after like 70 years in the making,

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.880
like we finally close the deal, we're going to actually start

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.880
shooting Harmon Quest.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.880
Woo-hoo!

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880
Woo-hoo!

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.240
Are we going to do new characters, same characters?

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.640
I think we're going to kind of restart from the ground up.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.480
Yeah, I think it'll basically be the same.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.720
Maybe a few tweaks here or there.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.400
Because it's actually going to be a fancier version of it

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.880
than we originally planned, because people got excited about it.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.840
Now we're going to tape 10 episodes,

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.280
and it's going to be on some tiny or experimental,

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.480
I don't know how much I'm allowed to say and not allowed to say,

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:34.880
but it'll be out on some platform that you'll be able to find or something.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.760
It may or may not play in Canada.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.720
I don't know.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.600
I have no idea how that shit's going to work, but it's not Yahoo.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.440
It's something else.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.000
But we're going to do 10 episodes, so certainly they'll exist.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:48.840
That's so awesome.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.360
I can't wait.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.240
And we'll have tapings and stuff, and we'll

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.760
make sure you guys know where to go.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.000
That'll be in September, so you can come and watch us.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
We'll get the old celebrity guests to come and play with us,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.440
and then we're going to animate.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.480
Have you picked your dream team yet?

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.160
That's probably too soon to talk about that.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.400
I think it's just going to do five episodes with Vince Vaughn,

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.520
and then three with Colin Farrell.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.480
Did you notice that you know our little dog Nigel?

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.080
Do you think he looks like Colin Farrell?

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.640
He looks a lot like Colin Farrell.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.320
He does.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.320
I don't know if Aaron's like Instagrammed it yet,

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.720
like with a split screen, but he looks.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.800
I think I see where you're going.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.320
Yeah, I can imagine that.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.080
Yeah, all right.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.840
Well, I like Nigel more than Colin Farrell, though.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.760
I think the show's been like a five, five and a half out of 20.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.880
I call it a solid five and a half.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880
Solid five?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.080
That's no good.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.160
What do we got to do to make it memorable and extreme?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160
Extreme?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.000
Well, maybe not.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.960
I mean, not like racist extreme.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.000
I got two words.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.600
Butt chug him.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.640
We could be the first podcast of Butt Chug,

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.360
two live stream of Pina Colada Butt Chug.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.840
Somebody did come up and was like, I'll butt chug,

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.640
and then they died.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.200
And that was just it.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.520
Everything in your whole life was leading up to that.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.880
Can we generate some sort of waiver

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.200
that they signed their life away?

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.200
It still wouldn't matter.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.800
It'd still be the podcast that killed a guy

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.160
by pouring Jack Daniels in his butt.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.640
Or girl.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.120
Why don't we start off with butt chugging something

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.800
nutritive, like just a big, like, we'll

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.720
fill a bottle of Jack Daniels with, like, pediolite,

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.240
or something like that that won't kill you.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.200
There's still butt chugging, right?

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.440
What if we brought up a guy stood him on his hands,

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.560
poured pediolite down his butt, and he became, like,

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.240
a senator, or, like, an astronaut or something.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.160
Like, he became, like, we found out

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.360
that that's what you have to do.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.360
I think there's only one way to find out.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:05:59.840
Who here?

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.680
I mean, there's people that volunteered to go to Mars

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.400
and never come back.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.840
I think somebody is willing to take that chance.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.120
I mean, we'd need a funnel.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.760
We'd need pediolite.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.040
Yeah.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.080
OK, we can't afford that.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.600
Yeah.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.280
Well, I mean, the overhead's too extreme.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.000
I don't know if you're seriously thinking about it right now.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.200
I'm just, like, honestly, like,

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.840
I like that you're getting logistical about this.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.200
It means you're actually going to.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.920
I do know that there would be someone in the audience

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.680
that would be willing to.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.560
Would there be, like, should we build, like, a little stand?

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.680
Or, like, like, like, like, gravity boots

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.760
with their heels clipped?

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.720
Yeah.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.240
Wide in the mouth.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.280
What would you wear?

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:31.800
That's another thing.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.720
What do you have somebody wear?

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.880
Just nothing?

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.440
Or do you make them a little, like, a chaff, I guess, right?

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.760
Chaff, but, like, on the side, it's just sponsored

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.680
by Nike and Reebok or something like that.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.080
Well, wouldn't it just be regular pants

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.880
but just a little hole for the butthole?

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.480
The women were unanimous on chaps on that one.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.800
That's their, that's women's solution to everything.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.680
They just like chaps.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.880
But if we're, I mean, either, I would just, I would say,

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.200
I need to understand the context.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.120
Do you mean if we're doing this six weeks from now,

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.680
what kind of equipment would we have NASA build for us?

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.640
Do we just hold the guys' legs in the air and do it, like,

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.360
really, like?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.480
I mean, that's what, that's what the cavemen did.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.880
I'm saying, we're putting, you spend a lot of money

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.240
on this, on this live streaming.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.440
I say we give, like, we put on a little David Copperfield

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.200
kind of show, like, a white tiger comes out.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.960
Dan, you already have an inversion table, right?

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.280
So, we just get, you turn them stomach down on it

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.960
and then you invert them and you're ready to go.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.120
Can you start it off like the guy that gets chained

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.040
into the thing in Temple of Doom and he's like,

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:34.880
I'm gonna show you back.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.560
Yeah, that's exactly what the inversion table is.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.400
I'm gonna show you back.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.240
I'm gonna show you back.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.080
I'm gonna show you back.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.240
That's what the inversion table is.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.080
And there's gravity boots.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.560
They hook up with, yeah, we can just bring that in.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.400
Okay, and then.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.680
You do something like muller ram

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.520
when we do the whole thing.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.360
Yeah, oh yeah.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.440
And then you have the PD light thing

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.560
and it's like a beating heart or Shankara stone

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.400
or whatever.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.240
Yeah, that's great.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.240
Yeah, never tell.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.440
And we gotta have, like, lawyers, like,

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.720
clear the paperwork and stuff.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.560
That's the easy part, Dan.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.880
The person could, like, die or become a senator.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.160
So, and the inversion table can be dedicated to that

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.320
because I'm going to the chiropractor

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.440
three times a week now.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.520
That was the only last thing that's new for me.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.160
So that thing's just going to waste.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.600
Yeah, I don't, yeah.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.920
My back's all fucked up, Jeff.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.760
Okay.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.280
Are you in pain currently, like, as we speak?

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.160
I'm all right right now, right at the moment.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.000
But if I sit for more than 20 minutes

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.040
and then I get up, it's like, ow.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.320
Sitting's the new smoking, I gotta say.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.960
Sitting's the new smoking, yeah, yeah.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.040
But as the guy is, like, adjusting my back,

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.600
I think I'm having like a Kundalini awakening or something.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.200
Like, I think my, he was talking to all this,

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.240
you know, chiropractors are like,

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.520
that's my chiropractor.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.280
See, you know, they're kind of knuckleheads.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.000
They're not real doctors and they always have to like,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.840
they kind of have to like, they feel compelled

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.720
to like add extra stuff to the chiropractic stuff

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:54.720
because it makes them feel more than a backcracker.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.440
Like, you know, they have to be like,

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.200
also, you know, this helps cure the cold

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.520
and you should bring your baby in.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.760
And it's like, nah, come on, quit being a crazy person.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.840
Like, just crack my back.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.320
But so I'm going to the one of these guys

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.240
but now I'm like, at this point,

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.000
the only thing I can do from here is back surgery,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.920
which I don't want to do.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.680
So I'm just, for the next year,

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.600
I'm just going to commit to whatever this guy says

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.960
and he's like, don't sit for more than a half hour at a time.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.200
Jesus Christ.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.320
And he's like, he's got a little jackhammer device

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.120
that he's using to hammer my vertebrae

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.920
and I'm going in there three times a week.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.960
But then I'll be like, walking around my house

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.280
and then I'll start crying for no reason.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.720
So I think maybe some of the stuff he's like saying

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.160
is like, not total bullshit.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.640
I thought it was because it's like,

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.520
so you know, like a chiropractor, you go in and they go,

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.080
they go, where does it hurt?

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.520
And you go, right here.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.000
And they go, okay, look at the chart.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.560
This is, I don't know why I say this happened to me

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.480
several times, but this is what the guy did recently.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.560
This is exactly what happened.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.120
Like Monday I go in, where does it hurt?

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:00.960
Right here.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.760
So he holds up this cartoon of a back

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.320
and then there's like next to each vertebrae,

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.760
there's like this list of shit.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.040
And they're kind of like horoscopes.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.320
It's like, it says like L one vertebrae.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.920
You're outgoing, but a little withdrawn.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.400
You know, except instead of that,

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.480
it says like organ function, kidney function,

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.080
kidney with a little bit of organ.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.880
You know, and it's like kind of like not that scientific.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.760
But so, so he's like, look at this.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.760
It says like, yeah, it says erectile dysfunction,

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.920
bowel, do you have any problems with your bowels?

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.240
And I said, well, I mean, I don't,

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.760
I don't like taking shits.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.080
I mean, I don't look forward to them.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.000
They don't, they're not like,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.480
I don't like high five myself after I shit.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.480
It's not really a problem with your bowel function though.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.320
Right.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.560
And he goes, uh-huh.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.160
And then I go, and, and hey,

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.760
who doesn't want more hard ons?

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.160
And he goes, mm-hmm.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.800
So, so, so anyways, and then crack my back.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.640
Okay.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.280
So then the next time I go in, he goes like,

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.960
so I put together a full report

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.480
and he's like showing me all this stuff.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.320
And then he's going,

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.040
so remember those bowel problems

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.000
and erectile dysfunctions that you talked about?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.240
Well, guess what vertebrae that correlates to?

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.320
And look where your pain is.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.920
I'm like, dude, I told you all that, what?

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.000
You can't.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.840
Corn ball.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.680
The mentalist.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.520
Yeah, it's like a carnival trick or something.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.960
But I don't think it's intentional.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.600
He's not, he's not, he's just, he's just not a doctor.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.040
Like he, like he, I took off my shirt and he's like,

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.680
ah, you have open sores all over your back.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.920
I'm like, it's acne.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.120
Like I have acne on my back.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.480
He's like, yeah, but they're, that's not acne.

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.400
I'm like, yeah, it is.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.400
It's gross acne.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.320
Like, like, have you ever had acne in your back?

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.160
No.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.560
Well, quit bullying me.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.480
Like, I don't have, I don't have open sores on my back.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.160
He's like, oh, are you, did you scratch?

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.520
I was like, yeah, look at my back.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.560
It's covered in fucking Ron Jeremy hair.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.600
Like, yes, I'm scratching my back.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.200
Oh, you're, but then he was talking about like,

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.280
yeah, and there's like, I think that,

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.680
I think that, you know, that sarcoidosis thing

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.200
you told me about, you know, that and those open sores

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.440
and stuff, and I'm like, what does sarcoidosis have to do

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.640
with open, what do you, stop calling them open sores.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.480
They're zits.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.600
Like you're making me feel really bad.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.520
And he's like, he's like, well, you know,

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.520
but you know, there's sores, you know,

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.840
and you, when you have something outside your body,

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.000
you know that inside your body, you know,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.080
you have the same thing.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.320
And you're saying I have acne on my spleen?

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.160
Like you're, will you just crack my back?

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.480
You're not a doctor.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.520
This is crazy talk.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.960
You could really upset somebody.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.400
And like you're making me feel like,

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.720
this is why I don't go swimming.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.240
This is the same guy you still go to?

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.800
Yeah, but I said, but I said, but he's not like,

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.760
he's not, he's not doing it on purpose.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.600
Like he just doesn't know what he's talking about.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.080
Like he does know backs.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.840
He does know like the nervous system.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.120
Like he's, and as my back is getting adjusted,

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.200
like I am like, I feel like my memory's improving.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.920
Like, like, kind of like, like.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.760
I think we were talking about this the other day.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.720
You know, I started weeping.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.040
I was just like whacking around my house.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.760
I was just starting crying for no reason,

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.720
absolutely no reason.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.600
I got a massage, like a friend gave me a birth certificate.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.440
Jesus Christ.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.440
My friend gave me a birth certificate.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.280
What'd you do?

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.120
I'm a father.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.440
I give certificate to Brooke Williams Spa.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.560
Like if you go to Brooke Williams, that's a spa where like,

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.240
I don't expect to go like find magical healing there.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.280
It's more of just relaxation.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.720
And you, I love massages.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.560
I like deep tissue.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.400
I want it to hurt.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.240
Like I want a massage to be like a street fight.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.240
I want to, I want to come out.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.640
I want to whimper the whole time and just be like,

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.440
just bruised and battered.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.960
And so I got this woman named Carmen is no longer there,

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.160
which is sad because she instantly,

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.480
like the moment she put her hands on.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.320
Karma?

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.160
Carmen.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.240
And she was like this, like this kind of short squat,

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.080
like fit, like Latina woman.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.400
And she was very quiet and stuff like that.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.440
And she's like, where does it hurt?

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.680
I said, I've always got stuff on my right shoulder.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.800
And she said, all right.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.280
She starts working everywhere else.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.800
And I was like, what if she's gonna get there?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.600
It's like, just so you know,

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.200
this is where you're feeling it starts here.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.640
And I was like, girl.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.920
Like she just touched me, like my collarbone.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.480
And I instantly like almost came to pieces,

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.880
like it in pain.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.720
And she goes, just so you know,

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.560
we're not gonna start there.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.400
We're gonna do this and that.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.520
And she goes, it also goes all the way down

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.520
in a sciatic nerve, which is, you know,

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.040
like your butt cheeks.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.720
And she was kneading on my right butt cheek.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.760
And I, she goes, by the way,

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760
you're gonna start crying and not from pain.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.000
Like she goes, you're very emotional

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.320
and you hide it all right here.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.160
She goes, can you butt?

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.440
She goes, we all, she goes, she said.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.240
She goes, we all hide a lot of sadness in our butts.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.720
So she does it.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.040
And I'm like, she's like, Jeff, she goes,

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.360
you're not gonna let like all that sadness go right now.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:45.720
But yeah, I was just sobbing like completely.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.720
She's like, she's like, she's like,

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.200
just try as like, and let as much of that sadness

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.480
sounds like, like also you need,

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.280
you need to come and get a lot more massage.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.000
Like, fuck yeah, but like,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.720
it's really weepy and emotional.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.760
I never saw myself as like this whole like,

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.760
like, like stress guy, but I clearly am.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.320
Like that whole respiratory alkalosis thing

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.360
was just ridiculous.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.040
It was just such a stupid thing.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.320
And then this back thing, like it's just like,

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.720
it's very clear, like I've been like under a lot of like,

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.920
I just like don't deal with my stress at all.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.640
Yeah, I said, I told somebody a long time ago,

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.160
all these like what they call like,

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.640
not scar tissue, pardon me, am I shoulders?

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.400
What's that character?

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.040
Frog in the throat.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.400
My name is Dr. Frog in the throat.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.720
Scar tissue.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.960
Oh, it's carnival carol.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.480
Are you cough shaming me right now?

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.160
I'm just trying, I'm self shaming about

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.520
how uneventful the show's been.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.320
I'll be like, wait, is that a character?

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.960
I went back and listened to the whole

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.920
Ty Brickson thing.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.040
I was on the right here crying laughing.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.680
Yeah, well, I mean, don't rub it in like look at tonight.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680
Tonight's been awful.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.400
It's been terrible.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.240
It's, you know what?

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.200
It's summertime, it's hot.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.040
We're never gonna.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.000
So fucking hot.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.120
And I ate so many tacos.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.520
And I just, and I just sat in my own farts all day

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.960
and played a video game, which is a tear.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.120
I should never do that on Sunday.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:04.960
Are you farting?

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.800
Are you on stage farting?

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.400
No, I'm clenching and clenching it in.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.160
When you walk off the stage, you just gonna like.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.160
No, I've learned to, I can hold a fart real good.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.280
I like, I do it until it finally,

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.040
then there's that point where it reverse farts

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.840
up into your lungs.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.360
I don't think, I don't think.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.360
You guys know what I'm talking about.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.160
I don't think Ryan Stiles would mind me mentioning this.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.880
Ryan Stiles cannot burp, but he can fart on command.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.960
I go, Jeff, he's never been able to burp,

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.240
but he goes, I can always give you a fart

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.560
and they never smell.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.000
He'll come out to me and goes, Jeff, give me a never.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.480
I go, 11.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.960
And he goes, for, for, for, for, for,

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.160
to fucking give you 11.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.280
Perfect little like equal farts.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.520
Also, when he travels on a plane, everywhere we go,

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.920
so I travel with this guy all the time,

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.400
he always has an extra pair of pants in his bag

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.960
and his carry on, in case he shits his pants.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.600
And which, and you know, he's 53, I don't know what he is,

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.600
like something around there.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.560
I said, have you, in your life, have you ever shit

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.400
your pants?

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.240
He goes, no, but I don't want to find,

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.840
I don't want the first time to be on a plane.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.240
So everywhere he goes, he's got an extra pair

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.520
of Ryan Stiles pants on.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.560
Does it take a different, does it take a special scale

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.560
when you choose the grain, the grain size?

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.480
Pardon?

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.240
Does it take, do you need a different scale

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.840
for each, for each size of grain?

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:27.880
I guess so, yeah.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.960
When you're, when you're picking,

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.560
when you're picking the kind of rice

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.040
that you're going to have thrown at your wedding

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.080
to Ryan Stiles.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:44.560
I mean, who is this guy?

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.040
Some, some kind of Dan Harmon replacement.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.160
You jealous again?

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.280
You were jealous of his mother,

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.600
you were jealous of Ryan Stiles?

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.960
Oh, he farts so much.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.360
Oh, he farts all the time.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.080
Oh, and he carries a special pair of pants

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.680
in case he, because he poops his pants too.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.000
What am I, chop liver?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.360
You're so jealous right now.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.200
Yeah.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.040
Yeah.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.040
Dan, I'm here every Sunday with you

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.880
because I love you more.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.640
And I do it for free, I get paid to go out with Ryan.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.840
I do this for free out of the love that I feel for you.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.960
Well, this is really awkward for me

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.960
because I already, I made love to the red head

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:40.960
in the lighthouse, so I can't reciprocate.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.520
Oh.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.200
I feel bad.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.160
Oh, it's OK.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.560
You're going to miss like 40 minutes of the video again.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.160
Hey, Spencer.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.000
Hey, Dan.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.240
Did you guys watch him deflect that fucking shit?

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.040
Did you see the jujitsu matrix back bend

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.800
bullet fly over his head?

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.280
I remember the first time I hugged you,

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.760
you looked like you wanted to shrivel up and die.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.400
You're more of a hugger now than you were.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.840
You're still not really a hugger.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.160
Dan, let me love you.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.960
I love everybody.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:29.960
The giant pina colada makes this whole thing so sad.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.960
I don't want to hug.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960
How did your chiropractor feel about you

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.400
carrying around giant drinks that heavy?

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.280
I always, like, you know, every time someone dies,

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.760
Rob always like, we already talked about that, right?

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.360
I don't remember.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.880
Rob's always like, hey, man, take care of yourself.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:07.240
I'm like, come on, quit making me feel like, he sent me a,

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:13.880
he sent me, he texted me like an animated gif

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.680
of how the human heart works or something.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.640
But it wasn't like, love.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.160
It was like valves and stuff.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.280
It was like, I hope you're taking care of yourself or something.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.680
It was like, are you just calling me fat?

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.560
I saw that text message.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.360
Was that a group text or what?

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.320
Because I saw that.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.400
Did he, was that after Harris died?

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.920
It was also after Robin Williams died and after Harris died,

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.680
after every, every time someone dies,

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.840
Rob makes me feel like he puts me in the same category

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.520
as people who died because I'm going to die next.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.440
And he wants, he wants me to not die next.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:55.400
So, and he thinks that it's as simple as telling me not to,

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.560
which it wouldn't be.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.680
Like, I'm not going to take a poll before I die.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.760
Who doesn't want me to die?

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.440
Okay, got it.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.560
Just checking.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.480
Like, I thought everyone wanted me to die.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.320
But like, but also like, it's like, I can't tell,

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.680
are you saying I'm fat?

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.880
Are you saying I should work out?

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:17.920
Or are you saying like, you're worried about me mentally?

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.040
But in either case, can't you just,

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.920
can't you just be nice to me?

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.040
Why do you have to, that makes me,

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.520
doesn't it, wouldn't that make you feel bad

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.000
if people were like, hey man, you okay?

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.080
You'd be like, well, what's wrong with me?

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.480
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.320
You know?

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.160
I get it.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.000
I get it.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:35.840
It's weird.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.320
Does he never, does he not reach out like personally

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:41.880
and like have, but also, I mean,

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.720
I don't know what it with the impulses there,

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.680
but to come and throw my arms around you

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.680
and hug you and tell you I love you,

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.200
would make you very uncomfortable,

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.880
which might make people less inclined

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.200
to come at you in that direct way.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.280
And maybe you have to start making heart gifs and stuff.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.960
Maybe, I mean, there's probably

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.880
a happy medium somewhere in between.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.160
Did you know the correct pronunciation is jiff?

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.000
Yeah.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:06.840
Yeah.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.160
I don't know, okay.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.640
Ha ha ha ha!

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.480
Damn!

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.320
Wow.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.120
Did you know it's, you know, it's,

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.600
when people say that's not my forte,

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.120
it's supposed to be fort?

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:19.960
Yeah.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.040
Did you know it's not chomping at the bit?

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.000
It's supposed to be chomping at the bit?

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.680
Ha ha ha ha!

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:28.520
Oh!

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.960
No, he...

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.320
But here's the thing.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.360
He just took that guy's concept and reiterated it.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.880
It's not original or daring, really.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.920
You're saying he recycled the heckle from behind him?

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:45.000
Yes, I mean, essentially.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:45.840
Okay.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.800
You didn't hear it.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.160
I didn't really take it as a slam.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.000
I thought it was funny.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.600
I thought he was like, man, this shit's getting exciting.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.000
Wait.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.640
This isn't still boring news, is it?

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.440
I think he knew it would be funny to say

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.200
this is still boring, because, yeah,

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.040
we really went down the road.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.920
Because the last guy demonstrated it worked.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.000
Yeah, and I'm not a hypocrite.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.800
I'm not gonna stand up here and shit the bed,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.040
and then get mad at people for talking.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:07.880
I will.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.440
Is anybody in the audience feeling particularly passionate

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.680
about anything at all tonight?

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.720
Like, well, I mean, it's not a yes or no question.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.440
I mean, it is if you want to come up and talk about it.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.640
Does anybody feel strongly enough?

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.640
Is that Dave Kline?

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.560
Oh, we should have added Dave Kline, I don't know.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.560
Dave Kline!

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.560
Dave!

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.560
Glitchy rap.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.560
Glitch rap.

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560
Just sit there for the cameras.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.880
Yo, I can tell by the lack of the audience

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.040
replied that I wasn't requested, but my boy, Dan,

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.880
he denied that he was ready to go solo against his motherfucker

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:56.120
that said he's on solo, ready to get into the fucking carbon

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:56.600
night.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.040
I'm saying it's his night.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.640
I'm saying he's getting ready to fight.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.120
I'm saying his dick is harder than a fucking rock.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.480
He's talking about motherfucking, my dick don't work.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.920
He's saying, yo, my dick's working.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.920
It's industry for longer than you've been alive, motherfucker.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.080
All right.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.760
So Dave, how you been?

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.960
So it's been a long time since I've been here.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.480
I want to give a shout out to Colorado.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.560
My secondary home, I want to give a shout out to New Jersey,

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.240
my home that I love, but that I left,

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.320
because I heard Dan Harmon speaking

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.800
from his chest and his heart.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.840
I met this guy that you guys won't know at the bar

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.920
after the night, and I'm going to drop some shit he

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.200
don't want me to drop.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:45.320
Guy is operating on a level that you're not ready for.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.920
And I can only let a beautiful man like this sit on my lap

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.600
because he knows what I'm talking about.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.320
Here's what happened.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.440
I went to Denver after I saw these guys

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.920
because I saw bad shit in LA.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.400
I'm from Jersey in New York, and I

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.960
seen some weird and bad shit.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.240
What did you see?

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.160
What did you see?

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.000
My friend lost his heart, and he's not with us anymore.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:12.720
Damn.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.960
You saw that happen?

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.480
I live an interesting life, and we'll talk about it

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.640
another time, but I want to give a shout out.

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.760
What do you mean he lost his heart?

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.680
Like it stopped?

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.360
He had a heart attack?

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.480
I have a friend who is a really wonderful and creative

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:33.680
individual out here who lost his heart and commit suicide.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.240
But you asked me, and I didn't want to get there.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.680
I was trying to bounce around that.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.080
But that's the truth of it.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.520
And I've seen it happen too often,

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.880
and when you said your boy sends you the thing with the jiff,

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.600
and then he says something really prescient,

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.840
like maybe they couldn't address you really clearly.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.560
We've talked about this on the show.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.560
I'll cut it right to this.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.120
Why are we all here?

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.000
This guy.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.360
Why are we all here?

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.800
These podcasts.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.320
Why are we here on a quiet night when we're not sure,

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.280
and the show isn't ripping it on 700 levels that

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.720
we're used to it ripping on?

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.760
Like when they were at fucking San Diego.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.320
When they were ripping it, squatchy.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.800
When they were ripping it on 700 different levels.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.840
And we have a down night.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.520
We're like, wait, what's going on tonight?

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.040
It's that there's 200 people in a basement in LA.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.680
And we love each other so much that a lot of us

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.080
actually show up to hang out on weeks

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.440
when this doesn't even happen.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.160
That I have friends in LA because of you.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.680
And the people that choose to show up to a thing like this

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.960
because you're honest.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.080
And you come up to a thing not with like,

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.400
you're degenerate alcoholic, you know, swank thing.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.080
I see that a lot where I live.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.160
You come up here with the thing your wife made you

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.960
because she loves you and she knows you.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.960
And she was taking care of you when you're back hurt

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.760
and you're a good guy playing witcher,

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.040
staying true to that wife.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.440
So you, to be clear, though, you agree

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.760
this is not one of our best episodes.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.320
This is a bad, like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.600
Like, like, like, like, like to be really clear,

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.880
like to be really clear and like pseudo self deprecating.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.560
If Dave Kline, like, if Dave Kline's

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.760
appearing on the show, we hit a pothole,

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.240
we're trying to fix it or like whatever,

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.120
or you're just being really generous to a guy

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.120
that I swear to you, I'm not here for fame.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.040
I swear to you, I didn't move to LA to like,

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.040
get on the mic.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.240
I came to LA because I fucking love this guy.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.400
And that everyone I knew that I cared about

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.840
gave a lot of shits about what he makes.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.240
And then all the rest of the people

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.560
I didn't give a shit about cared about what Jeff makes.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:31.720
I can take it.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.560
Everyone I know from Greg Proops to the rest of the fucking

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.920
crew that you roll with, to the fucking crew

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.280
that you roll with, to the community you created.

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.280
Wait, who's that character?

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:44.960
Who's that character?

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.200
No, no, no.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.920
Come on, Jeff.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.480
Uh-oh.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.480
The character that he created is us.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.080
And the joke is on everyone who isn't here tonight.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.360
Oh, shit.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.920
That everyone.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.000
You hear that?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:58.720
No, no, really.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:27:59.600
And I love you all.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.640
That's right, me and Jeanne.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.000
And then I'm going to break his little neck.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:04.680
I love everyone.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.560
And there's a strange thing, even like looking at it,

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.640
and like you don't see that there's

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.360
like some interesting paper, whatever.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.440
There's a crew here that's so beautiful

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.960
and is like so inspiring that on like the LOL shows

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.720
that we call them or like whatever.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.680
Yo, you know what, man?

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.360
Those are my favorite ones because it's,

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.240
I'll quote Tarantino.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.960
He says, there's a genre of movie called a hangout movie.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.840
I just saw on Magic Mike XXL, everybody see it.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.920
Like instantly.

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.360
It was like an ultimate mandate with my bro friend.

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.160
And God, I loved it.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:39.960
But this podcast is on the level of like Rio Grande,

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.280
Magic Mike XXL.

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.240
And Land Before Time.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.720
And it's like the hangout thing that like the why we come here

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.200
and even on the LOL shows, even when

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.000
you're in a hypoglycemic pseudo coma

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.920
and you're popping on that gorgeous thing

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.040
like you are from that beautiful woman you married

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.440
and swindled into loving you forever.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.920
We're here because we love you.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.880
And maybe I'm just here to just say,

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.840
fucking never give up.

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.760
Fucking never stop doing this.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.200
And my name is Dave fucking Klein.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.200
I'm dropping the mic.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.200
Dave Kline.

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.680
Let's bring out DeMorge Brown.

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.680
DeMorge, are you here?

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:29.760
You know, Dave, what I love about you are the things

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.480
are manifold.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.120
But I love that you know how to make an entrance

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.840
and how to make an exit.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.920
Because that's always a valuable currency.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.200
Yeah, any equity that was withdrawn or deposited at all

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.520
in the end, none of it matters.

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.200
Because he just evaporates.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.640
Like a scot-miss.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.800
He's actually the little train that

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.320
comes through Mr. Rogers' living room.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:57.640
He's like a winger's speech personified.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:02.440
I kind of feel like I'm a visual thinker.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:07.560
Like my image of him, the image of him

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.680
is the little fire extinguisher inside the glass

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.080
that says break in case of emergency.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.960
And then on the fire extinguisher, it says, yep.

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.880
He's a very positive guy.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.200
Yeah, well, I was actually thinking

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.720
that it was kind of a disservice to him

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.200
that it was a low energy show.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.600
And then he would come up.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:34.200
Because it might have been better to have somebody just

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.640
come up and go like, I'm going to get a divorce.

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.040
And we'd be like, why?

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.480
And she's like, because of 9-11.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.640
And then we'd be like, holy shit, she started crying.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.440
And I don't know why I made it a woman.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.280
So it could be emotional.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.760
And then we would have won a castee.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.040
The prestigious podcast award?

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.920
Which is what?

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.520
It's a podcasting award.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:30:59.920
Ah, gotcha.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:01.480
I made it up.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.760
There we go.

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.160
What's up, DeMorge?

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.200
You know, same old table.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.680
I can't follow that.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.040
Jesus Christ.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.080
I feel like femurs.

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:16.920
Damn, there's a full dose of this.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.920
Rrrrrrr.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.920
Jesus Christ.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.080
That's a Fuji to scale five.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.680
Here's my pitch, Dan.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.760
Before we say don't do cheat day on Sundays

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.720
because you're overly fed or whatever and sluggish,

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.200
why don't we try different, like all Indian food?

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.640
All Indian food, you're going to do.

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.640
Well, I was going to say maybe I could double my Adderall

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.880
dosage on Sundays.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.080
Rob Schrab's going to double his GIF dosage on you.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:51.820
Well.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760
What do you think?

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.200
What's left in the tank?

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.360
You got to try that, DeMorge.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.320
Oh, jeez, then.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.720
Oh, god.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.360
Don't look at it.

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.360
Just try it.

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:08.120
Oh, do you want to try something?

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.520
Spencer, did you try?

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.480
Oh, no, no.

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:13.240
Spencer's not a real alcohol guy.

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.600
No, it makes me sick.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.800
I get my joints start to ache.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.320
DeMorge, butt-chug it.

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.520
Butt-chug it.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.920
Careful, there's a spill on here.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.600
Oh, wow.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:26.680
All right.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.040
The suspense is killing us.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:40.000
It's the coldest thing in a room.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.600
It's delicious.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.040
That's great.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:41.920
That's fantastic.

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.400
You're not a video game guy, are you?

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:49.600
If it's sports video games and fighters and stuff.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.240
People are disappointed.

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.680
It just kept my damn mouth shut.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.200
If my mind was sharper, I could come up

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:58.440
with a great analogy for sports video games is like.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.640
And in the punchline, I have to throw it to a room, though.

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.800
Well, let's say it was a video game guy, what were you?

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.520
Oh, I don't know.

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.560
I was going to ask if you've been playing Witcher 3.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.080
Oh, yes.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.800
Absolutely, I have been.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.760
I just got through the thorn level.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.800
No, I haven't.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.280
They're tricky.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.800
Are there any female gamers here that

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.120
don't play sports video games?

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.400
Are you playing Witcher 3?

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.440
Are they going to hear who do?

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.600
Any women playing Witcher 3 in the audience, young ladies?

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.560
What game are you playing?

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.400
Beyond Yourself.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.000
Oh, I played that.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.800
That's kind of fun.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.320
That's the one with Juno and Ellen Page.

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.840
Ellen Page is in a game.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.000
Juno.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.920
Yeah, did you play?

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.640
Well, do you want to come up?

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.720
And so we can talk to you about video games for a second.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.120
And then you can play Shadowrun with us.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.600
Woo-hoo!

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:09.080
Oh, it's so bright up here.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.200
Yeah, and it's hot.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.360
Like, it'll make you feel in a second you'll be sweating.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.280
And you'll be like, what kind of horrible monster am I?

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:15.680
You're not.

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.760
You're just a French fry.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.600
It's not you.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.160
It's the lights and it's the heat.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.080
What's your name?

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:22.560
Emily.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.120
Hello, Emily.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.480
Hello.

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.480
Welcome to Harmonton.

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.560
Yeah.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:26.120
Yeah.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.920
OK, so did you play Heavy Rain?

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:29.400
Oh.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.640
Hard Rain or Heavy Rain?

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.080
Heavy Rain.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:31.440
Heavy Rain.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.040
Yes, with the origami killer.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.840
But that compared to those are the same people that made it?

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:36.440
I agree.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.360
No, Heavy Rain was much better.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.000
Like, they figured out how to, they

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.960
made loops and bounds with that video game style.

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:44.520
Yes.

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.160
And I think that's why Quantic Dream is so good,

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.760
is because it's like an interactive movie.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.920
And but Beyond Two Souls is like,

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.720
I was not expecting it to be so scary.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.200
Yeah.

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.120
Like, holy shit.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.040
It's basically, if nobody knows what this game is about,

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.920
it's basically Ellen Page is recreated as Jody.

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:08.040
And she is this character who has this entity that

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.600
is attached to her.

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.640
And basically, it's the whole time,

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.640
like all these people are trying to control her

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.280
and make her do all these things that she doesn't want to do

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:16.960
and blah, blah, blah.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.440
Anyways, it ends up being like.

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.120
No, I don't have a company.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:19.600
Yeah.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.200
This is what you're going to spoil it.

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.560
The French, this French company made this, right?

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.400
Is this the game?

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.160
French company?

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.400
I hung out with her for a while and she was in town

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.600
and she was making a game.

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.400
She was in France, though, I think.

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.880
Yeah, it's Willem Dafoe was in it.

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.920
Yeah, that's what she was making for all that time.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.800
OK.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.600
And it's weird how Willem Dafoe looks as a CG person.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.720
Yeah, I thought he looked like a cartoon in person.

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.680
And then it was like, wow, he actually

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.520
looks better as a cartoon.

01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:50.040
Yeah, it's a weird effect, yeah.

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:50.440
Yeah.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.480
Anyways, yeah.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.120
Yeah, video games are getting more immersive, Jeff.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:00.480
Can you guys handle that with your soccer?

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.480
Soccer?

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.960
Yeah, you got to be careful with the margin.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.080
If you and I share our love of anything right now, Dan,

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:08.560
I did.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.640
I did an hour and a half podcasts before this.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.680
Dan, you're in a very vulnerable, jealous, kind

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.120
of emotionally precarious place right now.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.040
Because I've been, for the last 30 minutes,

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.760
I've been holding in farts.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.400
And now, as of my last sip of pina colada,

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.800
now I'm also holding down vomit.

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:27.480
No, it's so funny, because I actually.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.320
So I'm like a Chinese finger trap?

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.160
No.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.400
Look at me.

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.920
I'm the opposite of a Chinese.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:40.040
I'm like a water balloon that's untied on two ends.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.440
No.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.240
I'm like a toothpaste tube in a vice grip with a cap on each end?

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.040
You're like a pipe bomb.

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.400
No, without the bit on the end to hold the stuff in.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.320
It's just all going to go out both sides.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.520
I'm like, maybe we should get Ryan's styles in here.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.440
You should probably don't up.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.080
I'm sure he could come up with.

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:06.480
Oh, he would.

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.680
He'd come up with 20.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.080
You know why?

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.120
Because he's a gifted.

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.520
He wouldn't let the show fucking sink

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.640
like this fucking going down right now.

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.480
Because he's a hard worker, and he gets up here,

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.360
and if he has to skin and knee or chip a tooth to make these

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.040
people laugh, he fucking does it.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.160
We should bring cherries out.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.720
No, the smothermans aren't here.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.160
To us, they're just regular fruits.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.520
To the smothermans, they're treasure trod.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.440
I hate cherries.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.320
You hate cherries?

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.760
I do not like cherries.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.560
You do hate them.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.760
I don't like the fear when I have a cherry.

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.280
I'm like, fuck, I'm going to break a tooth this time,

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.880
because you bite it, and then the seed is so hard.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.600
I hate pits.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.120
I hate it.

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.960
I love olives, like marinated olives.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.640
And then sometimes you get them.

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.240
And then you're like, this better not have a pit in it.

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.160
I swear to God.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.920
And then it has a pit in it.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.160
And you're like, what am I supposed to do with this fucking

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.080
rock in my mouth?

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:07.240
And then you spit it into a napkin like an animal.

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.120
What are you supposed to do?

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.440
Why do they have those things?

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.920
I swallow cherry pits.

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.640
What?

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:15.160
And then I swallow them all.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.040
And then when I poop them, there's people in New

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.160
York that make very expensive coffee out of them.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.640
You can't even afford it, it's so expensive.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.040
It's called Jeff Davis Cherry Poop Coffee.

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.480
I swallow.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.120
I don't know if this is an urban legend or not,

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:35.480
but they say that.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.480
I think this is an urban legend, because it started from

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.040
urban living in the 50s.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.760
And then it became a big thing in the 70s.

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.600
The idea that kids were eating cherry pits,

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.160
and they were pooping, and that in the sewers, there's a

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.560
whole population of little George Washington's.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.800
Not cherry trees.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.200
Well, there are cherry trees, yeah, obviously, little

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:00.680
cherry trees.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.200
But then there's these little tiny George Washington's.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.840
Yeah, chopping down the, yeah.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.480
Are they also telling lies?

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.400
Well, that's the ironic thing, is that I think the whole

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.840
story is a lie, but in the story, no, none of them are

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.840
lying about chopping down the trees.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.920
Why in this day and age where our political culture is so

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.520
bereft of intellect and leadership, aren't we

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.800
cultivating this sewer full of George Washington's?

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.200
Well, because he wasn't really a leader.

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:34.680
He was a warrior, and he's the leader our nation needed at

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.480
that time in history.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.120
But the truth is, if you brought George Washington out

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.680
now, first of all, he'd be tiny and covered in poop and

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.240
teeth or wood, weird.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.960
Second of all, he's just, by all accounts, he was sort of a,

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.400
you know, he was sort of a dumb dumb and just sort of

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.400
inspiring because he was courageous and a good general.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.600
Could he do any worse?

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.000
Could he do any worse?

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.800
Could we do any worse, you're asking.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.120
Oh, no, no, he couldn't, yeah.

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.640
He might be like legit, like better than.

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.960
Oh, yeah, I'm sure anybody from, if you went back in time

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.920
and pulled anybody from back yonder, I'm sure there would be

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.440
a couple scandalous remarks that would be like, no, that's

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.520
now called anti-semitism, like they would be like, oh, no,

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:23.400
I'm sorry, I'm from 1921, but as far as their attitude about

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.280
the role of government, I bet we'd be like, holy shit,

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.680
this guy's like amazing.

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.560
Way back then, the office of the presidency was not a

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.800
really prestigious job.

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.520
Yeah, so they'd be like, you know, they'd have that

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:41.720
Ross Perot, Bernie Sanders, charm, no, no, they'd be the

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.040
third party candidate that wasn't allowed in the debates

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.880
because they'd be like, I don't understand why we're talking

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:46.880
about this.

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.640
And we'd be like, boo.

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.960
Did you just fart right now?

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.040
No, that was my mouth.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:54.680
Are you asking, was he covering a fart?

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.040
Was that a substitute?

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.920
I sometimes do that, like I'll make a laugh really loud

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.120
and then I'll fart at the same time.

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:04.640
And it's like, I didn't know.

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.040
Truth be told, Emily's been farting ever since she sat

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.440
down up here, you guys.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.760
It's a maelstrom.

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.120
Well, we don't have much time.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.160
I wanted to actually, I actually might have been

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.800
fruitful to ask Emily as an ambassador of a female gamer,

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.760
like what, if a game's really cool, but there's like, as

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.080
with Witcher 3, where it's just like, wow, this is really

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.040
cool, but it's like this fantasy game, and it's just like

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.560
all of these sorceresses with the cleavage and the kind of

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.040
like very like mythic gender roles, like does that throw

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.240
the modern, I guess the answer is, you know, speak for all

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.440
women, like some women are probably totally thrown by

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:40.960
that.

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.040
I feel like, yes, some women are thrown by that, and that's

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.720
fine and whatever, but I'm just like, I love tits.

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.560
Like I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.040
Like I feel like it's a very bold stance.

01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:56.080
No, it should be a thing that women, we're giving boobs.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.240
We should be happy and, you know what I mean?

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.440
Like that's something we should use to our, you know, and

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.360
makes cosplaying fun and like all that kind of thing.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.520
I think that, you know, if we're gonna get all offended

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.120
about it, I don't know, that's just me.

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.200
I like, I've always wanted to love and love my boobs, and

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.360
I think every woman should.

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.000
Well, I think the counterpoint to that would be, yeah.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.400
If a woman's gonna be offended by it, then that's okay.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.440
You can be entitled to your own opinion, but me, I'm like,

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.320
girl, rock the titties, love them.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.720
Well, I don't think the offense is coming from the

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.640
exposure of them as if it's like people who are like

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.480
puritanical.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.840
I think it's, I think it's, it's that there's a fine line,

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:32.240
but it's like people that are like, well, there's an

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.800
objectification happening when they're on display.

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.360
So it's, if it reduces the person's role to a

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.560
dehumanized role, so that they're simply a tray of dessert.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.320
And if they're not also saying equals MC squared.

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.280
I don't know.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.000
But I'm mansplaining.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:49.840
Yeah.

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.520
And, and, and white knighting and, and, and Chubbocker.

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.760
No, that's actually very, it's, it's in tearing me.

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:56.480
Wimbledon and.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:02.440
I just want to, I just thought come back as it's like,

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.400
it's kind of a straw dog argument that it's like,

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.720
like everybody likes boobs.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.840
I mean, nobody, I don't think any women are like,

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.920
get these things off me.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:10.160
They're terrible.

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.360
And no one, they're terrible, evil things.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.200
And we should never see them.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.960
I think, I think any, any, any person who's, who's coming

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.520
down on the other side is, is more, it's, it's, it's

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.880
coming more of the angle of like, uh, uh, what, uh,

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.360
thoughts that we're putting in people's head about the

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.640
role of. No, no, no, no.

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.000
I totally get where you're coming from.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.720
And, and I do think that there is something that is

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:33.520
endearing about making a woman be sexy without

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.400
showing the tits.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.240
Of course.

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.920
Like her, her, her ability to be a badass.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.480
Like, you know, uh, what's an example of someone.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:43.760
There's, see, whenever I think of games, there's just

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.960
like so many girls with big boobs.

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.800
Harriet Tubman.

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.640
Like everywhere.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:52.000
She just farted again.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.320
Uh, yeah, well, yeah.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.200
Nobody, nobody's, nobody's disagreeing up here.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.480
I mean, I, I, I think that, but it's not my job to

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.320
agree or disagree.

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.640
I just sit there and fart and play the game.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.840
The girl, she does have that big of boobs and I think

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.680
she's hot.

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.200
Well, that's the thing that I always find myself

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.760
wondering as a guy when I, when I, I always wonder on

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.360
behalf of men, I always wonder why do we even have to

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.440
like, cause I always say like, well, I used to say

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.720
before things got so, you know, I'm like, I used to

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.920
joke to women, everything that you need to know about

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.560
men you can learn from a men's prison.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:38.560
Like the, like the, like, like, how is, how is that a

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.600
controversial statement at all?

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.680
Like when you, when you lock men in a building together

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.880
and take away all of their wealth and all of their

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.680
hegemony over society.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.120
They, it turns out that we don't have a lot of like

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:59.720
super nuanced needs in order to get an erection or

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:04.640
become violent or like we are drones and we turn on

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.280
each other and ourselves as quickly as we turn on

01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.360
anyone we're allowed to on the outside.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.240
So you take away the necktie and you take away the

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.480
bank and you take away the skyscraper and you take

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.280
away the history and the momentum and you see what,

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:23.720
what, what, how little men really need to objectify.

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.920
Like, like, like we, you could, you could give a

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.960
female voice to a banana and the, the men, the men

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.440
would be like, I want to fuck that banana because

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.880
they'll say it eventually about their cellmate.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.040
Like, like, like they, they, because we're just like

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.400
biologically we're just kind of drones.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.600
Like we're not, so, so I always, I always wonder in

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:46.720
my own head I'm like, well, you know, if the cleavage

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.080
weren't there, like if that's really the issue, like,

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.760
or, but it, but it, but it isn't, you know, it's like,

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.720
if Mary Curie was like a character in a video game,

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:59.520
you know, it's, it's, you, even more so the whole rule

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.920
34 thing would start applying, I don't know if I'm

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.800
making sense, but I was like, when there's like a

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:10.280
strumpet on parade and it's like, she's all dolled up

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.800
and she's like the cleavage is boo-boo-boo-boom-booming

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.680
and the thing and it's just like, she just looks like

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.040
she's designed for these thoughts to be thought

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.880
about her.

01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.720
I just, I'm always amused by the idea that it's like-

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:23.520
Is that the argument that that overwhelmingly that's

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:26.320
almost all of what you see in, in, in character

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.440
or female, like game and character?

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.240
Yeah, I guess my thought about it is it's like-

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.760
They're starting to go away from it though.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.720
They're starting to make it where like girls aren't,

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.560
you know, like the Hunger Games and things like that.

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.600
Like girls becoming badasses and yeah, they're hot,

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.640
but like, you know, it's, it's more like, no, she's smart

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.920
and she's got, she acts like she, she's the one saving

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.960
the dude cause the dude's a dumbass.

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:47.800
You know what I'm saying?

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:48.640
Right.

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.560
Like it's, it's not all about, oh, and she's got a huge rack

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.960
and she's like, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo the whole time.

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.440
Right, and actually because those thoughts are like a lot,

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.440
that like I draw an analogy between clothing and,

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.000
between clothing and gender roles and language and,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.960
and race issues.

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.680
And like the language is certainly a reflection.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:14.880
Like if all the video games are of women like looking like

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.840
they're ready to go and they're, and they're,

01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:20.080
and they're not saying anything of value on top of that.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.840
Like they have no agency and all that stuff.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.200
They're, that's the, the, the clothing is a reflection,

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:30.280
but just as you can make genuine racist people use

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:33.440
the most polite language in the world and they might be

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:36.440
even more racist than ever, you could totally like

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:39.840
count on men to like be like, the clothing, the clothing is

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:44.000
not, it's a, it's the, it's the snot of the cold.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.320
Like you can wipe it all you want.

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:49.160
Like, like the virus is more dealt with when you,

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.400
when you're talking about characters that have agency

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.280
and the bec, bec, bec del test and stuff like that.

01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:55.960
Like that stuff that actually gets to the heart of the matter

01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.440
like is the character.

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:01.760
Are people watching characters that happen to share

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.800
physical characteristics with themselves?

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:06.720
Are they getting trained to think that they hold a certain

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.440
role in a dynamic?

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:12.280
Like, like the, the, the clothing is like so secondary

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:15.400
to all of that and whatever, there's no point to it.

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:17.000
I'm not proposing that anything change.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.080
I just kind of amused by the idea that men would, men would,

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.360
men would hump a concrete wall.

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.200
Like, like, like, like we would not, we, we just don't,

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.480
it's not, it's not like, that's not where the war is being

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.320
fought, you know?

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:34.120
Yeah, there's a lot of armpit fucking imprisoned.

01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.440
Wait, for real?

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.920
A lot of consensual armpit sex.

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.120
That's just good old fashioned human ingenuity.

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.080
Yeah, that's, that's an invasive.

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.400
The inventions I made when I was 12 years old.

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.800
We've, we've talked about that.

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.400
Boy, boy, oh boy.

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.080
So glad those days are over.

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.720
Now you can use like real inventions, like buy online,

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:01.640
things like that.

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:02.480
Yeah.

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.440
I kind of want to make sure my back stays somewhat out of whack

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:09.160
because I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a.

01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.360
Now that I'm regaining my memory and bursting into tears,

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.760
I'm worried that I might, that you might adjust something

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.120
and then I'll be like, oh, I.

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.520
Yeah.

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.960
Wow.

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.080
I almost said cliffhanger at the end of the show man.

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.440
I just remember being 12 years old and like not being able

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.560
to get through an episode of inspector gadget.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:35.240
Like, like, like, just let alone more commending,

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.320
let alone anything.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:41.120
Like I just like, like everything was like on fire.

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:44.720
And it was like not a place to get a lot of work done.

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.440
Girls were like that too.

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.480
Like, well, I was at least, I was like crazy.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.360
Like my whole family was like that.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.680
Like as soon as we went into puberty, I was like,

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.680
what is happening?

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.760
Like, oh my gosh, boobs and craziness and all that stuff.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.440
But it's just girls don't, yeah.

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.800
Like you said, girls don't like to talk about it as much.

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.320
But we definitely are the same way.

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.080
I know a lot of women that I've had friends of mine

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.040
that I grew up with and friends I met later that like,

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.040
started masturbating a hundred years before I did.

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:10.880
Like, before I did.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:11.720
Yeah.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:12.560
I did like second grade.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.400
But is it, is it?

01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:14.240
I know.

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.080
Insane, right?

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:16.120
Second grade?

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:16.960
Yeah, dude.

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:18.480
It happens earlier for girls.

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.320
Yeah.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.880
It's weird because we mature faster.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.560
There's also a lot of accidental masturbating.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.600
You don't need like.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.240
No, okay.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.080
Second grade.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.480
First thing is accidental masturbation.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.840
Let me tell you, Jeff.

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.520
I'm gonna fuck your armpit so hard

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.280
that I'm just doing it right now.

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.480
Also, girls do that.

01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:42.680
Uh-oh, here we go.

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.080
Hey, we started talking about this.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.760
This next sentence brought to you by a pina colada.

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:55.880
Well, I'm, is that a politically correct thing to say

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.800
that girls do this or do that, but I've had a lot of girlfriends.

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:01.600
I've had a lot of conversations like,

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.560
and I've noticed that girls have a lot of early memories

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.720
of they practice with each other.

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.040
They go, they.

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:10.920
Like, like, like, not, not.

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.760
No, no, no.

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.600
I see you guys.

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.160
Sorry, Emily Fartin again.

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:23.760
They play, they practice kissing and stuff.

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.600
Oh yeah, no, no, no.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.440
Yes, of course.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.760
Guys, don't do that much.

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:29.200
But I famously told that story of me being like,

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.880
like eight years old next to my buddy Ramstack,

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.040
like humping a couch pillow,

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.200
we're high-fiving each other.

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.200
We're like, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're.

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.040
Yeah, girls do it too.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.000
Yeah, like pillow, like this feels good.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.560
Dave Ramstack.

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.400
That's the great, that's the,

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.840
if you're gonna make out with your first guy,

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:43.680
that's the guy.

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.520
It was Dan Ramstack.

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.520
I don't know what his lawyer's name is, but.

01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:51.520
But he's probably watching, but uh.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.240
That's why I used the wrong name.

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.880
He was a, he was a, he was a great dry-humper.

01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.440
He really let that pillow have it.

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.480
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I mean,

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.600
obviously the most important thing that,

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.160
that people are always so shocked to learn is that,

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.960
if everybody's a little snowflake

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:12.520
and it's all so incredibly different.

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.920
It makes us, it makes us comfortable to make observations.

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:18.320
Like, girls do this and guys do this by age 11

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.800
and by age 13 and girls do that.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.360
It was like, but like every conversation you have,

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.880
it's like a second grade.

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:26.880
And then someone goes, but Jeff lost his virginity

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.160
at like 32 or whatever, like, you're a late bloomer.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.000
24.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:32.840
And uh.

01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.200
I was too, I was 22.

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:37.200
Yeah, I mean, I, like, that's, but that's the,

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:40.720
like the masturbating and the coming and the.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.560
As we're talking about this, I never really thought about

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.320
this, like, you know, like when I came to your house

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.120
and you had that consolidated folder of redheads

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.200
from Playboy magazines to save space.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.000
And I was like, wow, you sure like your redheads,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.720
you're like, oh shit, I never really thought about that.

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.680
And they go, oh my, yes, I do.

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:57.120
I'm looking back, like, I don't know about like

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.640
for young girls, certainly not in second grade.

01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.320
Like for little boys, we find the Sears catalog

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:04.120
or the, or the anything that has a picture of a woman,

01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:07.800
like with any measure of clothing on a nun or whatever,

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.160
or a face, like it's a visual thing for me anyway.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.640
And I remember the most potent visual image that I,

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.520
and I saved this picture.

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:21.280
It was Nadia Komenich, the gymnast, like the gold medalist.

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.120
And I told her, was she Russian?

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.640
It was Nadia Komenich from Romania.

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.800
Romania.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:25.880
I don't know why she out of the house.

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.520
And it's only like, what the fuck do you always,

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:32.880
again with this fucking shit.

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.200
I don't even know, fuck you, you guys, the fucking.

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.560
But she had all of her clothes on, but she had short hair.

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:42.600
And like, so like then later on it's like,

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.360
like Sid Cherise, Audrey Hepburnia Farrow,

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.520
like I don't know what it was,

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:50.160
but it was like my first moments of having like sexual

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.160
visual like turn-ons was always like thin,

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:58.280
never va-va-vom, never like super curvy,

01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:01.720
like a little wafy like girls with short hair.

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.440
And like, why is that?

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.280
It's so strange.

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.200
Well, why do men like long hair traditionally?

01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.680
I know you've all heard the joke,

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:12.640
or maybe not joke explanation of like, yeah,

01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:15.480
it's like cavemen like want to handle or something.

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.520
It's like, looks like you're more controllable.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.560
But I think it's like, I think it's like,

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:24.160
the way cats like, like focus on things that move,

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.800
like, like, like, like, like women wear earrings and stuff,

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.200
like, like, like think shit's moving around.

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:34.000
Like, I think, I think, I think, I think over time,

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
maybe that's like a thing that triggers men to like,

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:36.840
be fascinated.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.440
Like they're like, just dogs or cats,

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:41.960
they're just like, you're shaking your head.

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.680
I don't think that's what, I think it's just,

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:46.560
everything that's attractive is a show of youth and health.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.640
And so when you get older, your hair's thinner.

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:49.520
Ah, got it.

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.760
And it makes to have long hair.

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.360
You have to be like, young and fit.

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.200
If you can't hear in the back,

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.080
because I'm sure that's absolutely true,

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:56.920
because I just realized,

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.200
because we talked about makeup on the show,

01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.960
and it's like makeup is like,

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.520
she said, she said, because it's young,

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:04.720
it's young girls have longer hair,

01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.720
and as women get older,

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:09.560
their hair gets more brittle and unmanageable,

01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.360
and they tend to go with the shorter stuff.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.600
And so, yeah, everything is sort of,

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.040
all of our standards for female beauty

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.600
are somehow rooted in puberty,

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.560
are somehow rooted, like rouge is just flushed cheeks,

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.840
and lipstick is flushed lips,

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.040
and it's all basically you spend your life

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:28.680
chasing this image of a,

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.240
of the most inappropriate thing in the world,

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:34.320
which is a cussing biological female specimen.

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.440
All right, Spencer, I'm gonna ask you the impossible right now.

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:37.280
Okay.

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:38.440
But I know that you're up to the task,

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.320
because you are a genius and a showman.

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.480
Okay.

01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:46.040
Let's do the world's only one liner

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.400
shadow run, where we set it up.

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.520
Well, I don't wanna know but that,

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.520
but I was pretty content once we could have skipped shadow run.

01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.360
Oh, yeah?

01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:58.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.000
Oh, I figured once I got to be 10.05, I was like, oh.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.520
Kind of pants, yeah.

01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.360
Okay.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.200
But I was like, we're on a roll,

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.560
we're talking about icky stuff.

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:06.960
All right.

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.080
Icky stuff.

01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:09.400
Yeah.

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.560
Sex is icky.

01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.000
It doesn't have to be, man.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.760
How many ounces?

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:18.280
DeMorge, what, how old were you when you,

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.120
when you had your first experience with your,

01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:24.680
I was five and I was, I went to the school on the bus.

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:27.960
See, see, it's done, Charlie, it's done, that's weird.

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:30.200
There was a kid on a bus who was older,

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.280
he had just had, I went to this amazing school

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:36.400
when I was a kid and his birth, for his birthday,

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.760
I think he was 10 or 11, 12 maybe?

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.280
They had given him, his parents had given him

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.800
a subscription to Playboy for his birthday.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.120
So this kid, so I had never seen this before

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.000
and the kid had a thing, he wasn't bringing it

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.560
for show and tell, but it was just,

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.320
he had it and he was bringing it to the school

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:54.760
and it was wrapped in paper and he took it out

01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.040
and he showed it to us and I was like,

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.400
what the hell is that?

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.000
And we just went through it and he explained

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.120
the whole concept to me and that's sort of what it was.

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.720
And then later that week, I think,

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.280
at dinner my parents asked me about school

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.440
and then they asked me about my every day at dinner

01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:13.080
and they asked me, your birthday's coming up,

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:13.920
what do you want?

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.400
And I asked for a subscription to Playboy.

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:20.400
And my parents is very measured fashion,

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.880
we're like, A, a what?

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.320
And I said, there's a new Playboy

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.680
and they said, do you even know what that is?

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.680
And I went through it so clearly I knew.

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:33.880
And they said, how did you,

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.480
and so I told them the story, I just told you

01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:39.640
and they said, all right, well, we'll see what we can do.

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:43.440
And then in my head, I think, I mean, just being my age now

01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:45.720
and imagining that them being their age at that time,

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.560
they, for whatever reason, had to wait until I left the room

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.760
and just high five each other.

01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:53.320
And then they got kids all right.

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:55.600
Just to save a couple, a little bit of money,

01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.760
they gave you a subscription to Muff Diver.

01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:02.760
A sherry or a sherry, I don't know, some knockoff.

01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:05.720
They're like, we can't afford that.

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:07.040
Morgan Fairchild's on the cover every day.

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:09.280
Erin texted me because she must be watching

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.600
as we're talking in this area.

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:13.400
Because remember the episode where we did Labyrinth

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.280
and she was talking about Labyrinth, but we were,

01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:18.840
I mean, she's really like, that movie was like her,

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:21.360
she was describing like, being in the theater

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.360
with her parents and watching Labyrinth

01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:27.600
and you know, at a certain point in that movie,

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.840
like her physically like awakening,

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:33.160
like her cheeks fleshing and like her,

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.480
her nethers tingling and like,

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:39.400
I call them the nethers because it's like,

01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:41.640
appropriate, mythical and minecraft.

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:46.440
You go to the nether and there's like,

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.560
but she, I mean, that was like,

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:52.640
she can remember the actual like moment of like,

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:54.280
oh my God, my body.

01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:56.600
And it does like literally happen overnight,

01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.320
like literally overnight, like puberty happened.

01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:01.720
A friend of mine, Samantha, she was like 11 or 12

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.560
went to a Prince concert and she told me,

01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:05.080
she was like, I was standing there watching Prince

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.920
on stage and she goes, and I had an orgasm.

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.960
I wasn't touching myself, I just stood there

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:10.400
and she's like, I didn't know what was happening,

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.280
but later on I would come to understand,

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:14.560
it's like, what, that was the first time I came,

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.600
but just by standing there watching this dude.

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:18.520
I definitely know I was watching work in Mindy.

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:19.600
I was like, I was like,

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:24.120
I was watching Pam Dabber and I was like,

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:26.440
but I was like, I think I could have been watching anything

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.240
because it was really more about like,

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.560
I was like laying, I would lay supine,

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.400
is that what it's called?

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:32.240
It's on your stomach.

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.720
And I was like laying after school alone

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.440
in my mom's apartment and like,

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.760
so I was just like watching work in Mindy

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.920
and it was just going like this.

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:44.240
And I was like, and then I was just like, kept doing it.

01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:47.360
And I was like, what the, oh, oh my God.

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:50.680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:51.520
and nothing.

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.760
Get your GIFs ready everybody,

01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:54.800
get those GIFs ready.

01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:57.440
And nothing, nothing, you know,

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:01.320
I looked to see if anything had,

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.840
because I was like, is that what I think that was?

02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:06.200
And nothing had happened,

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:11.200
but it felt like something that you would want to do forever.

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:16.560
So, and then from that moment until around 39,

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.480
I pretty much was just like dedicated

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:25.520
to making that feeling happen over and over again.

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:27.560
Cause I remember like that very week,

02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.960
or like like within a few days it was like,

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.920
like I'm just going to keep doing this over and over again.

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:33.120
And I remember being really excited

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.720
that nothing, I'm getting really graphic,

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.920
but like, oh, let's stay safe and stop now.

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:43.600
The, I just, I remember being really stoked

02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:45.960
that nothing was coming out,

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.000
because I thought I was like cheating the system

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.360
because I was like, I wasn't touching myself,

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:53.840
which I already had like shame loaded into my mind about,

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:56.040
like that one day I was going to start touching myself

02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:58.200
and that that was, my mom would say like,

02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.280
it's going to be a natural thing.

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:02.000
It was like, I don't want to think about my mom

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.080
giving me permission to touch myself.

02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.200
And so I was like, I'm not, I didn't touch myself.

02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.200
I just humped a pillow and thought about Pam Dabber.

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.200
And then I had this amazing feeling.

02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:13.120
I'm like, I'm the king of the world.

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.040
Like, and I would just like run home from school

02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:16.200
as fast as I could.

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.360
All my friends would be like,

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.960
don't you want to stay and talk about LL Cool J?

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.960
No, I gotta go.

02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:22.480
I gotta go.

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:24.840
Man, he's so dedicated to his schoolwork now.

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:27.000
And I was just like, slam, lock the door.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.560
And I was like, and then slowly, but surely,

02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:34.560
I was just like starting with like one little drop coming out.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.640
I just remember like every, every successive like little

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:41.720
tonight on a very special part.

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.800
Just a tip.

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:46.240
But I'm telling you, for those 11 year olds listening,

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.480
it's all downhill from there.

02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:54.480
Just keep doing that and like don't involve other people.

02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:57.480
We have 8 billion too many.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.480
Just keep doing that.

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:05.480
Just eat cookies and watch more communities.

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.480
All right.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.480
Well, we got to the bottom of some stuff, I think.

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.480
Typically stuff that we've already gotten to the bottom of,

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.480
I guess.

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.480
But it's worth going there again sometimes.

02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.480
I think it was a nice introspective.

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.480
There's no losers in it.

02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:26.480
We got to meet Emily, who's fantastic.

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.480
Thank you.

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:32.480
We got a...

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:36.480
We got a good shot of Vitamin D from Dave Kline, man.

02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.480
He's always been.

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:44.480
But you know, I've always had, it's a problem with me.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.480
It's like, I always like, when I was a kid on the playground

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.480
and people would pick up me, I would never cry.

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:51.480
And then when the guy would come over and say,

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.480
stop picking on him, I'd start bawling.

02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:57.480
Because I feel so ashamed of myself for needing to be stuck up for.

02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.480
And so, when Dave came up and was like,

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.480
come on, Hulkamaniac, it's not that bad a show.

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:05.480
I almost started crying.

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:08.480
I was like, it's terrible, it's that bad a show.

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:11.480
I said we end the show playing the Ty Braxton theme song

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.480
while you body surf and fart all over the entire audience.

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.480
Body surf and fart.

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:18.480
Body surf and fart.

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.480
Don't set me up for failure.

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.480
You know that my back is hamburger.

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.480
But that's...

02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:26.480
Would that be therapeutic to be rolled gently through human hands?

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:30.480
You've obviously never had actual back problems in your life.

02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:34.480
How about some good old fashioned butt chugging?

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:36.480
I mean...

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.480
It can't hurt, man.

02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.480
Great weight in the show.

02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:40.480
Who's going to butt chug?

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:41.480
You.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:42.480
How?

02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.480
How is that possible?

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:47.480
Right, that's too complicated.

02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:49.480
That's what butt chugging really is.

02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:50.480
Everyone does that.

02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:51.480
I did that before the show.

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.480
Everyone does that.

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:53.480
I'm doing it right now.

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.480
Emily's on her second tank time.

02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.480
I'm like, keep them coming.

02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:02.480
Erin's like, end the show.

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.480
Yeah.

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:05.480
Everybody.

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.480
Five, four, three, two...

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:10.480
Cliffhanger!

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:14.480
Emily, everybody.

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.480
Please welcome her.

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:19.480
I love you, Erin.

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:20.480
Hi, Erin.

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.480
Hi, Erin.

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:25.480
Dave Kline.

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:26.480
DeMorge Brown.

02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:28.480
Spencer Crittenden.

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:29.480
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.480
Your mayor.

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.480
Everybody at one, go up and hug him and tell him you love him

02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:35.480
and make him all sad.

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.480
Dan Harmon.

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:52.480
Does it look a little sad, baby?

02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.480
Emily, go.

02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:54.480
Good, Hannah.

02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.480
Give that to her.

02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:56.480
Or maybe...

02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.480
Did you get any of that?

02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:27.480
It's a good show.
