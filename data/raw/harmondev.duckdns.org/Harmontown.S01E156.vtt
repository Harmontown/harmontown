I'm the little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:24.000\nCome, come, over there. Come, come, to the south. Come, come, on your feet. Come, come, to my mouth. I'm a little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:33.000\nI'm a little velvet man that lives in a tree. All I do is promote shows, all that I say. Please go to see Rob Schneider at the truck show.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:42.000\nHe was into some hazard, there was nowhere to go. Because his car had a racist flag on it. I'm a little show promoter and I wear a bonnet.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:48.000\nIt was my mom's idea, she made me a baby. I want to fuck her or kill her or maybe.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:57.000\nHarmontown is now in session. Please welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harlin.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:09.000\nCome, come, come there. Come, come, come all. Come, come, everywhere and bring your scarf and shawl.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:20.000\nThank you. Thank you. That song was created by a fellow named Michael Hartigan if you're out there. Michael, thank you very much for your beautiful service.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:26.000\nDan, you have an enormous thermos on stage right now. Please tell me that's not all vodka in there.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:48.000\nI have switched my cheat day to Sundays on my diet and this is a pina colada that Aaron made me. I think it's a gallon.\n\n01:48.000 --> 02:01.000\nShe's really been feeding me today. I'm kind of in a food coma. I may puke onto the microphone and onto Anatoly.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:07.000\nSo you just this week decided to switch to Sunday cheat day?\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:08.000\nYeah.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:15.000\nSo last week when you ate the cheeseburger out of the Bloody Mary on stage, that was just comedy sake, right? That was just entertainment.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:20.000\nOh, yeah. No, I was, I stayed on the, wait, what do you mean? Last week was the show was on Sunday.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:23.000\nAll right. So you switched it last week?\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nJesus Christ, who cares?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:30.000\nSo we're in the light of these people.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:35.000\nIs there a logo on that thermos? That thing is enormous.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:38.000\nYeah, I gotta remember to bring this back to Aaron.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:46.000\nAnd I enjoy a pina colada. A gallon seems a little over the top.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:51.000\nI don't want to waste my cheat day.\n\n02:51.000 --> 03:05.000\nBut I may puke all over everyone because I got up this morning at 6.45 a.m. and I used Postmates to order McDonald's breakfast.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:10.000\nDid you get up that early because you always wake up at that early or because it's a cheat day and you want to start eating it?\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:15.000\nYeah, it's because I've been, you may have noticed I've never lost any weight ever.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nSo you're probably wondering, is this diet work?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:25.000\nWell, it can if you stick to it. I've never stuck to it. I have like cheat days, turn into cheat weekends, turn into cheat weeks.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:29.000\nSo I just basically am the same fatness that I always am.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:36.000\nBut I've lasted like three weeks or so. I've been really committing to the diet.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:42.000\nSo then this last period was particularly hard on me.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:51.000\nThe idea of the cheat day being that you fool your body back into a glycemic thing and then you go off it.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:58.000\nYeah, I think you're just keeping your body off rhythm. I never read the book that Aaron read it.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:03.000\nI think it's basically like Atkins Without Dairy, you're allowed to eat beans.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:12.000\nSo it's beans, meat, and veggies all week and then one day a week so that your body, probably so your body doesn't go into ketosis or just adjust metabolically.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:19.000\nYou're supposed to spike your blood sugar and you're, you know, your blood sugar. You're supposed to spike your blood sugar.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:28.000\nAnd you're supposed to eat like a birthday cake and just rub Big Macs on your balls and just wear a pizza for a hat.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:33.000\nAnd I do. I really take it very seriously.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:41.000\nAnd so I got the McDonald's and I sat down and I played Witcher 3.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:51.000\nAnd then at some point Aaron came home with some Del Taco and I just didn't move.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:58.000\nAnd I just kept eating in the room slowly filled up with farts and so she would like slide stuff over to me.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:06.000\nAnd she made sliders and like mac and cheese with Doritos sprinkled on them and a big pina colada and a pineapple.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nAnd I said I should bring this to the show and she made me a big pina colada.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:17.000\nSo if you're on the fence about getting married, you know, you know, it's fine.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nI said, I said, Aaron, what's this? What is this straw? What's the straw from?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:29.000\nAnd she said, that is an unused, I said, stop, don't.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:37.000\nIf you have to say it's unused, you're not about to say amaze a straw from the party store.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nIt's probably an anti-freeze.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:49.000\nA licensed pre-owned bull catheter.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:58.000\nBut do you think the holes of bull's penises are bigger than...\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:03.000\nSome woman in the audience went, no.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:08.000\nWell, I heard a guy go, I'm like, no. Do we have two different people?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nI think they're probably a little bigger.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nI mean, they've got to be like a little... Why do I mean they've got to be?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:19.000\nI wonder if urethras are all the same diameter. Of course not.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nNo.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nOf course not. A goldfish doesn't have...\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:29.000\nA mouse's urethra is thinner than mine, I hope.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:33.000\nIt's like a party straw. Mine's like a party straw.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nMouse's is like a little baby party straw.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:44.000\nAnd then, so I'm sure like a whales, you could probably put a ping pong ball down it.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:47.000\nAnd it would probably have space around it.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nThe ping pong ball.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:59.000\nNumber three, probably not going to get any high marks on the feminist gamer report card.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:04.000\nI kind of got tit fatigue playing that game. There's a lot of titties in that game.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:09.000\nA lot of strong women, I guess, but they're strong and they have their tits are everywhere.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nI'm truly bored with tits right now.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nAre the guys semi-clad too or negative?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:21.000\nNo, it's the same old, I think, hypocritical thing.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:30.000\nThe protagonist is, I guess he's kind of a beefcake, but he's covered in scars and he's pale.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nAnd then everyone else is just a big fat guy, I think, or a dwarf.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:39.000\nI'm not saying dwarves can't be attractive. Sorry, fellas.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:45.000\nBut it's a lot of decups and a lot of acting.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:50.000\nIt's just normal for them to just be out.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:54.000\nI'm really enjoying it.\n\n07:54.000 --> 08:00.000\nIt's one of those games where it has relationship options.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:04.000\nThere's different characters and you're sort of like, while you're playing the game,\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:10.000\nyou have these multiple kind of romantic roads you can go down.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:19.000\nThere's this woman in the beginning of the game that you like and then she's treating you like garbage,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\neven though you clearly like her.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nBut then it's kind of clear like, oh, she must be the female lead kind of thing.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nI guess I'm supposed to have a will, they won't they with her?\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nAnd I guess I'll meet up with her later.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:35.000\nBut then in the meantime, there was this redhead and I was just like, will you marry me?\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:42.000\nSo now the rest of the game, I'm like, the regular one keeps on.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:47.000\nI don't know, the game kind of fucks you over because it definitely gives you the option\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:53.000\nof totally full-on monogamous commitment to this redheaded sorceress.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:58.000\nIf the first woman that treats you cruelly were a redhead, would you be more into her?\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nYes.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:05.000\nAnd that's not my fault because it's a video game, so it's like the hair especially.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nIt's like, what else is there?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:16.000\nLike I said, the first one, I don't like the strident type.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nI don't go for that business.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:23.000\nBut it doesn't make my little wiener jump up when somebody's like, you're a piece of shit.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nI'm not like, yeah.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:31.000\nYeah, I like a little equivalence.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nWasn't the redhead in the recent Jurassic Park kind of strident?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nWasn't she kind of a tough nut?\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:41.000\nWell, there's a difference between withdrawn and mean.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:45.000\nBecause the mean thing seems dishonest if you're going to end up actually, you know,\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\ncoupling with someone.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nThen you didn't mean it when you said I was a poopoo face, right?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:54.000\nBecause otherwise, you're a poopoo face fucker.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nSo now I'm a liar fucker and a poopoo face, but not a poopoo face.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nWe know people that like being called a poopoo face.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nThat's what turns them on.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nYeah, like Dino.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nDino likes being called a poopoo face.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nHe likes poopoo on his face.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nYeah, me not so much.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nI get mad when people humiliate me.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nEven in the video game realm?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nLike even as part of the program of that game?\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nYeah, well, especially, anyway, so that's the thing.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nSo this game really sets you up to...\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nI'm in the midst of this right now.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nI almost want to stop playing the game because I am kind of immersed in it.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nThe first girl, it wasn't working, I decided.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt was like, well, she decided.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:43.000\nShe said, you know, she's like cold-shouldering me.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:46.000\nFor the first couple levels, I'm like, hey, what do you think of me?\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nAnd she's like, oh, I'm British and I have black hair.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:54.000\nSo I'm like that archetype and I'm gone.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nAnd then this redhead sorceress and she's nurturing\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nand she cares about the other mages and I helped her do this whole\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nlike Harriet Tubman underground mage railroad story.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:08.000\nWe got the mages out of the city\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:12.000\nbefore the horrible anti-mage Hitler was going to kill them all.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nThat kind of, that turns me on.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nYeah, but that sounds to me like you're supposed to fall in love with her\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nand not the black-haired British lady from the beginning.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:21.000\nWait, sorry, what?\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nThat's something they're setting you up to love her.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nThey set me up.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:29.000\nYes, because it's obviously available in the program because I did.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nI was like, I kissed her.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nYou know, I could have not kissed her.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:38.000\nSo I chose to kiss her because she looks like my wife.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nAnd then I was like, yeah, I'm going to choose her\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nbecause I see this as one of these multiple choose-your-romance games.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nSo I'm definitely, this is good that they let me not choose this\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:55.000\nthis strident, you know, British cold, cold, cold, cold applesauce person.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.000\nIt's like, you know, I'm a raven-haired heartbreaker.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:03.000\nI'm going to, hmm, I'm so mean to you like your mommy.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nI'm not, thank you for not making me do that.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nI like this, I like this nurturing type.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nAre there other options?\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nIs there a third woman?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:15.000\nWell, I'm not, I feel like I'm in like a quarter through the game\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nand I'm already fucked because I, so I, like the redhead, I was like, you know,\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nI was like, well, don't, it was okay, we did the adventure.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nAnd then there was an option that said, please don't go.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nAnd I was like, please don't go.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nAnd then there was an option that said, I love you.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd I was like, I love you.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nAnd then, and then she's like, okay, I'll stay.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nAnd I'm like, okay, great.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:37.000\nAnd then, and then we had sex in a lighthouse.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:41.000\nAnd are you typing things in?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nNo, I'm not typing.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nThese options that come up on the screen.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nThese are like, these are like, these are like story options you're choosing\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nbased on like, you know, three dialogue decisions.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nSo now you're married to this redhead in the video.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nWell, I'm married here, but I might as well have.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nI like, yeah, I might make love in this.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:03.000\nWhat level of intimacy do they, do they show you while you're making?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nIt's really weird.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nDo they cut your train going into a tunnel?\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nWell, they don't.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nWell, they don't.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nThey show you both naked.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nThen they show like her naked butt.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nAnd then they show my hand slide over her butt.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nAnd then, but then they cut to it just a wall.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nAnd there was like, but there wasn't even like a shadow of humping or anything.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:23.000\nBut it was like, there's like, they already showed like boobs and butts.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nAnd like, it's clearly, it's not for kids this game.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nLike they say the C word in it.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nAnd the F word all the time.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nFuck is the F word.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:40.000\nAnyway, so, so, so I made love to Redhead.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nOn a lighthouse?\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nIn a lighthouse.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nIn a lighthouse.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nNot on a lighthouse.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nThat's dangerous.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nIn it.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nYeah.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nThey're kind of pointy on top.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nSo then, and then, and then she goes like, so I guess, and then we had the conversation\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nof like, oh, so I guess, I guess we're going to be together forever.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nYeah.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nBut I got a piece of, I got to finish this video game though.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nLike I was like, I got to finish like the next 85% of the game.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nWithout her.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nRight.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.000\nBecause it's not like the game is so sophisticated that now she's just hanging out.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:11.000\nLike going like, we're in love too.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:16.000\nSo you, so I just said, I love you to see her butt and then she leaves the game.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:20.000\nAnd now, I mean, the part of the game, well, now that I have to go be with the brunette\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nand the, but the game is making my character keep flirting with the brunette.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nIt's not a choice.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nHe keeps saying stuff like, oh, you smell good.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nAnd I'm like, no, I didn't say that.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nI'm from Wisconsin.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nI wouldn't pull this shit.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nThis is the kind of guy I hate.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nAnd they're making me, so I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nAm I supposed to, is the game supposed to.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nThere should be an option or maybe they shouldn't, but to go back to the redhead woman and say,\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.000\nlook, I know that there's probably 80% more video game out there.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:53.000\nBut I'd rather hit game over with you.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nIt's kind of where I'm at.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nYeah.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:00.000\nI wish I kind of, honestly, I would push the brunette off a cliff if it was an option.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nWell, because she won't, I mean, well, because I would say I'm sorry.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nIt's, I'm, you smell nice.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:13.000\nThe game, the game, the game keeps making me act like I want to fuck you, but I don't want to.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nSo I'm going to murder you.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nAnd she's like, you're mentally ill.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nBecause she doesn't know it's a video game.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:24.000\nSo she's, is there, can you come on too hard where she hates you?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:27.000\nLike, like a Jack Tripper or Threes Company episode?\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nI'm not, I'm not going to try that.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:33.000\nThere are options where it says like you can lay it on even thicker and I'm just choosing the neutral,\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\njust like all business, you know?\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nAnd I can't wait for her to ask what's going on.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.000\nI would be like, I am a married man.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nI made love in a lighthouse.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nAnd I just want the rest of the game to just be about killing werewolves.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nDo you think the game is designed for people to like,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nthe first girl I meet, I'm going to date her.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nShe's like the evil part of my mother.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nShe's hard to please.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nI'm going to date this British lady, like a school mom.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd then you realize, oh, she sucks.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nAnd then later on, you're supposed to meet the redhead.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nIt's definitely, it's laid out that way.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nIt's pretty ingenious.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:12.000\nLike it's kind of, it's very, for a video game, if it was a movie, you'd be like,\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:17.000\nwell, this isn't very smart, but for a video game, it's pretty sophisticated like stuff.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:24.000\nThe Game Dragon Age Origins had some stuff like that I thought was pretty fun.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nI'm old.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nI'm playing video games.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:32.000\nI like that some of them have like a more nuanced story component to them.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:39.000\nBut the danger of that is that now it's like the game is about anxiety.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nNow I can't escape life.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:46.000\nI'm like in a worse life.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nIt's like a terrible, I'm like living a lie in the video game.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:55.000\nIn the real life, I have a beautiful woman bringing me cheeseburgers.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nAnd I'm, there is no...\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:00.000\nYou're hanging that with a poopoo face later.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nTess, Triss, Marygold.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nThat's the red, that's the...\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nSorceress as well.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:10.000\nYou said that with such wistful, what's her name, Tess, Marygold?\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nTriss.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nTriss?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nYeah.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nShe's...\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nTriss.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nYou know, Triss.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nAll right, so anyways.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nOh, you forgot to bring Spencer up.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nOh, shit.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nYeah.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nI got mesmerized with the Ty Brickson song.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nSpencer Crittenden, everybody!\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nSorry, Spencer.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nI was remiss.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nI'm very sorry.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nDon't even trip.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nThis is a great song, man.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nIt's a lot better than me.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nNo, don't.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nNo, not like that.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nI mean, it's really that good of a song.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nI've been...\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:55.000\nI've literally just been driving around and I'll be like, I'm singing.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nI'm like, come, come over here.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nIt's so good.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nHey, guys.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:08.000\nHow far down that gallon of opaque jug of pina colada do you think you are?\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nOh, I can't tell.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nHey, lick off the whole straw and do like the dipstick test.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nThat is a bull catheter.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:23.000\nThat is some viscous shit.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nIt's really good.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nI have a perfect wife.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nI have the perfect wife.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nShe's not here tonight.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nWhat does she have to do?\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nShe's fatigued from cooking for you all day?\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nShe's got a lot of...\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nShe's got to make...\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nYou know, it's our friend Kimber's birthday tomorrow, I think.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nOh, yeah?\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:45.000\nSo she's making some stuff.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nI think I should switch DJ back to Saturday.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nThis is not good for performance.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nDoes it feel sluggish?\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd I'm also like the summer heat.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nSo I lose a little job of the hut.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nI should just go back.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nIs that a proper pina colada in terms of...?\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nThis is pretty standard.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nLike booze to mixer ratio?\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nOh, I don't know.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nI mean, it's boozy.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nIt's pretty boozy.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nDamn.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nThat's a lot of booze, Jackson.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nI'll try a sip.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nIt's so great.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nI got to try it.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:21.000\nI got a long way to go.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nWell, what's in a pina colada?\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nI'm not good at alcohol.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:31.000\nIt's rum, coconut, milk, pineapple, and something else.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nShit.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nYou like booze and milk?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nYeah.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nYeah.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nTry it, Spencer.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nCome on.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nTake a bite off of that sandwich, man.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nCome on.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nDo you guys remember the Darwin Awards?\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:46.000\nThere's a guy who won a Darwin Award for trying to make alcohol by mixing beer...\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nNo, if he started with beer, that'd be good.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:54.000\nNo, he was mixing milk with just car gasoline.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nBecause that's how booze is made.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nAnd he died from drinking it?\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nYeah.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nHe drank so much that he died.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nI mean, I don't know how much you'd have to drink, but yeah.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:10.000\nDo you remember, I mean, it might be apocryphal, but when I was in college, do you remember\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nthe story of the guy that died?\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:16.000\nHe was doing a headstand and he put a bottle of Jack Daniels up in his butt and he let\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:19.000\nthe booze drain into his butt and he just died.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nYeah, I don't think that was an urban legend.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nI think it really happened to a guy.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:27.000\nThat's some serious butt chugging.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nThat's what they call that.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nThat's not some Saturday morning brunch butt chugging.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:36.000\nThis isn't your grandmother's butt chugging.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nThat's not like a casual mimosa.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nMimosa butt chugging.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:47.000\nPour down your anal cavity at 45 degree angles by a group of well-meaning friends before\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:53.000\ngoing to see a Marvel movie.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:57.000\nThis is hardcore butt chugging.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nI would have butt chugged a little bit of that pina colada.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nThat was delicious.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.000\nThat would be cold.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nYou want cold though.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nYou wouldn't want hot.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.000\nHow come putting stuff in your butt makes it go into your blood faster than putting\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nit in your mouth?\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:15.000\nI think it's a more closer capillary network to the edge of the skin probably.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nBut that doesn't...\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nOh, okay.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nIt's not...\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:22.000\nYour skin is like protective tissue.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nIt's designed to prevent absorption, but you're like inner insides or not.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nSo I think that things can just pass into your blood easier.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nWhy wouldn't they save that apparatus for up here?\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.000\nIt's the answer because you don't want that much to get through up here.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nI think that's the answer.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:41.000\nBut then again, what's down there is poop.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nBut that's your intestines, right?\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:47.000\nI think the idea is throughout your entire digestive tract, your body is trying to reabsorb\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:51.000\nanything that's valuable all the way until the last drop.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:54.000\nYeah, so that's the last resort.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:58.000\nThat's the ultimate filter back there because that's the last shot you got, man.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:03.000\nYou know, elephants, you know how everybody goes to the zoo and they see an elephant eat\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\ngrass out of another elephant's asshole?\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nAnd they always think they saw the craziest thing in the world.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:12.000\nBut this elephant shit is basically just grass.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nYou could eat it.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nIt would be great.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:18.000\nBecause they just like animals that digest cellulose, which we cannot do.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:21.000\nIf we ate a handful of grass, our stomach would be like, why are you doing that?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:24.000\nThat might as well be just a house or something.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:27.000\nAnd I'm not a termite.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:35.000\nBut deer and rabbits and elephants, certain mammals have the enzymes so they can break\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:38.000\ndown cellulose so they can eat grass.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:43.000\nWhatever that is, basically, but they pass so much of it through.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:47.000\nIt's such an inefficient engine that their poop is practically edible.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nThey're the original butt sugars.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nThey're the opposite of butt sugars.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nThey're butt munchers.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:58.000\nThey're buffet butts.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:03.000\nThe elephant that's eating the poo out the first elephant, he's a butt muncher.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nHe's a butt muncher.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nYeah.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:08.000\nWe got that settled?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nAll right.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nWe're getting a lot done tonight.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nIt's a low energy show.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:18.000\nI got a lot of food in my stomach, but we're getting some stuff done.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nDorito, mac and cheese?\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nYeah.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nThat's just mac and cheese with Doritos sprinkling.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nYou make me puke.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nOh, another thing about Witcher 3.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nNot the gallon of pina colada.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nI'm going to make you puke.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nGo ahead.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:34.000\nWitcher 3 is like, I didn't mean to, I wasn't decrying it as a sexist game or anything.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:38.000\nI just think that in the last five years with the world changing under her feet, I don't,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nI don't have a horse in that race.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.000\nSo I'm just going like, ooh, those are neat tits.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:45.000\nBut like, and I think, I think that it's a very enjoyable game for everybody.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nI just think in that one particular area, it's sort of like, kind of like, it's just\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nsort of funny because it's like, takes place in this fantasy world.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nAnd it's just like, literally everybody, it's just like the equivalent of a receptionist\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nwill just come up and go, can I help you?\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nAnd her shirt will just be just unbuttoned to her kknave. for no reason.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nIt's just like, just boobs in your face.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nIs Trish Marigold putting it out there too?\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:07.000\nShe was one of the more tasteful ones, I would say.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:16.000\nShe wore pants and she, you know, you could see that she had boobs, but, but I don't think\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:20.000\nshe, I think it was an accident.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:27.000\nI was more taken with her magic and her politics.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:32.000\nAnyways, I just wanted to say one more thing about Witcher 3.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nThey have strumpets in the game.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nCan we bring the word strumpets back?\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nThat's adorable.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:42.000\nI mean, you can't ask men to not be sexist overnight, but we could, maybe if we brought\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nback a word like strumpets, at least we could make us a little more adorable while\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nwe're being misogynist.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:54.000\nYou know, the guy that invented the word strumpet in like a fit of misogyny, he must\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nhave been so bummed out when it came out of his mouth.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nHe's like, you fucking strumpet.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nAnd then the woman is like, I'll take it.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nThat's adorable.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:06.000\nHe's like, God damn it.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nStrumpet.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:14.000\nThis sounds like, well, it sounds like trumpet or and crumpet.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:24.000\nYou got no arguments from me on that one.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:31.000\nLet's do a new segment called Boring News.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:38.000\nIt's just so far we have not been doing that.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nYo.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nYo.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nYo.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nYo.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nYo.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nYo.\n\n25:44.000 -->

one.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nAlright.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nYou like this one?\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nYeah, yeah, yo, slow rapping.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nYo, yo, scary, scary neighborhood.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:12.000\nYo, yo, driving down a spooky street, yo.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:18.380\nHalloween, look at all the costumes, trick or treat.\n\n26:18.380 --> 26:19.380\nFuckin'.\n\n26:19.380 --> 26:20.380\nMotherfucker.\n\n26:20.380 --> 26:23.680\nThe girls dressed like a pumpkin.\n\n26:23.680 --> 26:27.180\nThat girl's dressed like a pumpkin.\n\n26:27.180 --> 26:29.980\nI hope she gets a lot of candy.\n\n26:29.980 --> 26:31.660\nRoll down the window.\n\n26:31.660 --> 26:33.660\nLook at my foot.\n\n26:33.660 --> 26:34.540\nOK, fuck that.\n\n26:34.540 --> 26:36.500\nFuck that.\n\n26:36.500 --> 26:37.540\nI think I'd work like this.\n\n26:37.540 --> 26:38.260\nI think, yeah.\n\n26:41.460 --> 26:45.460\nI only listen to the first eight bars of that one, Spencer.\n\n26:45.460 --> 26:46.580\nSorry, that's a corrupt final.\n\n26:46.580 --> 26:47.540\nYeah, is that a banff?\n\n26:47.540 --> 26:48.500\nSorry, man.\n\n26:48.500 --> 26:50.620\nThat was the one off of the YouTube.\n\n26:50.620 --> 26:52.740\nI clicked the link and downloaded right to the thing.\n\n26:52.740 --> 26:55.420\nI use that YouTube link all the time, so I don't know.\n\n26:55.420 --> 26:56.020\nI don't know.\n\n26:56.020 --> 26:56.700\nSorry, everybody.\n\n26:56.700 --> 26:58.140\nEverybody get your shit together.\n\n26:58.140 --> 27:00.100\nThis is not what the people pay us for.\n\n27:00.100 --> 27:03.820\nAll right, so this is, OK, one more time.\n\n27:03.820 --> 27:04.580\nThis is boring.\n\n27:04.580 --> 27:06.300\nI can play it off the YouTube that he sent me.\n\n27:06.300 --> 27:07.780\nBoring news segment.\n\n27:07.780 --> 27:08.580\nBoring news segment.\n\n27:08.580 --> 27:11.220\nBoring news segment.\n\n27:11.220 --> 27:13.140\nAre we going to do this theme again?\n\n27:13.140 --> 27:14.220\nYou want the same one?\n\n27:14.220 --> 27:14.940\nYeah.\n\n27:14.940 --> 27:16.140\nThe wonky one that we just did?\n\n27:16.140 --> 27:18.140\nYeah.\n\n27:18.140 --> 27:29.500\nYeah, yeah, what's happening ain't always entertaining.\n\n27:29.500 --> 27:32.980\nSometimes it's boring.\n\n27:32.980 --> 27:35.500\nNothing much happened.\n\n27:35.500 --> 27:37.260\nBoring news.\n\n27:37.260 --> 27:39.060\nBoring news.\n\n27:39.060 --> 27:39.560\nOK.\n\n27:42.860 --> 27:47.940\nWe got a new saltwater aquarium installed in our home.\n\n27:47.940 --> 27:53.580\nAnd go on.\n\n27:53.580 --> 27:57.740\nThese, in order, are my 10 picks for our fish.\n\n28:00.740 --> 28:02.100\nDan, I'm going to stop you there.\n\n28:02.100 --> 28:05.460\nThis is called boring news.\n\n28:05.460 --> 28:09.020\nMy top pick is the blue-spotted jawfish.\n\n28:09.020 --> 28:09.500\nLook it up.\n\n28:09.500 --> 28:11.460\nYou'll see why.\n\n28:11.460 --> 28:13.300\nTell me why, because I don't have the option.\n\n28:13.300 --> 28:14.660\nIt's like a little snake guy.\n\n28:14.660 --> 28:17.260\nAnd he can make a little hole in the sand\n\n28:17.260 --> 28:21.460\nlike act like a snake sometimes.\n\n28:21.460 --> 28:22.940\nHow large are these fish we're talking?\n\n28:22.940 --> 28:23.980\nHow big is the aquarium?\n\n28:23.980 --> 28:25.620\nIs it a giant one or a small one?\n\n28:25.620 --> 28:26.180\nI don't know.\n\n28:26.180 --> 28:27.900\nIt's an aquarium size.\n\n28:27.900 --> 28:29.980\nI don't know.\n\n28:29.980 --> 28:32.100\nSomewhere between 50 and 1,000 gallons.\n\n28:32.100 --> 28:33.820\nIt's a decent size one.\n\n28:33.820 --> 28:37.060\nYou wouldn't call it big, but it's certainly good sized.\n\n28:37.060 --> 28:39.780\nWe'll get extra little fish.\n\n28:39.780 --> 28:43.060\nNumber two, the yellow watchman Gobi.\n\n28:43.060 --> 28:44.140\nNothing really to say about him.\n\n28:44.140 --> 28:46.700\nI can't remember anything about him.\n\n28:46.700 --> 28:50.740\nNumber three, the court jester Gobi.\n\n28:50.740 --> 28:53.020\nWhy is he playing second fiddle to the other Gobi?\n\n28:53.020 --> 28:53.580\nI don't know.\n\n28:53.580 --> 28:55.500\nI can't remember.\n\n28:55.500 --> 28:58.860\nNumber four, the lawnmower Blenny.\n\n28:58.860 --> 28:59.620\nI think I remember him.\n\n28:59.620 --> 29:02.300\nHe scoots along the dirt.\n\n29:02.300 --> 29:05.700\nNumber five, Jeff, you're going to like this one.\n\n29:05.700 --> 29:08.260\nThe blue tang.\n\n29:08.260 --> 29:08.760\nYeah.\n\n29:08.760 --> 29:13.120\nYeah.\n\n29:13.120 --> 29:14.520\nSomewhere that Smurf pussy.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.680\nNumber six, the hellfreaky dartfish.\n\n29:20.680 --> 29:21.560\nThey're making these up.\n\n29:21.560 --> 29:22.120\nThis is not even.\n\n29:22.120 --> 29:22.880\nThese aren't real fish.\n\n29:22.880 --> 29:26.680\nThat one I got just because it reminded me of the Diantword\n\n29:26.680 --> 29:27.280\nsong.\n\n29:27.280 --> 29:30.760\nI think hellfreaky and I like you a lot.\n\n29:30.760 --> 29:33.520\nNumber seven, I can't remember the name,\n\n29:33.520 --> 29:39.280\nbut Aaron and I call it the pajama boushemi cardinal fish\n\n29:39.280 --> 29:42.160\nbecause it reminded us of Steve Boushemi.\n\n29:42.160 --> 29:47.080\nNumber eight, the royal grandma, I know, typical.\n\n29:47.080 --> 29:50.000\nNumber nine, the bang-guy cardinal.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.960\nNumber 10, the Bartlett anthias.\n\n29:54.680 --> 29:55.800\nI mean, that's one.\n\n29:55.800 --> 29:57.280\nThat one can go fuck its off.\n\n29:57.280 --> 29:57.880\nIt's number 10.\n\n29:57.880 --> 30:00.960\nDan, give me the 30 fish that didn't make the cut.\n\n30:00.960 --> 30:02.080\nI don't know.\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:05.320\nThere's a bunch of blendies and grammas that don't make it.\n\n30:05.320 --> 30:06.800\nAre you going to combine these fish?\n\n30:06.800 --> 30:08.640\nYou're going to pick one sort of fish?\n\n30:08.640 --> 30:13.160\nWell, we'll defer to our aquarium guy who, you know,\n\n30:13.160 --> 30:17.040\nhe'll go, oh, a blendie will eat a goby.\n\n30:17.040 --> 30:19.360\nYou've been with me, too, at Damon's and Glendale, right?\n\n30:19.360 --> 30:21.480\nThat Tiki place, the bar, with the head\n\n30:21.480 --> 30:22.320\nto make the chi-chis.\n\n30:22.320 --> 30:24.120\nYeah, they got some aquariums in there.\n\n30:24.120 --> 30:25.800\nYeah, they have a bunch of aquariums.\n\n30:25.800 --> 30:26.640\nI'm not a big aquarium.\n\n30:26.640 --> 30:27.760\nI grew up with fishing aquariums.\n\n30:27.760 --> 30:28.520\nI liked them as a kid.\n\n30:28.520 --> 30:30.600\nBut there was one fish that takes dirt and sucks it up\n\n30:30.600 --> 30:33.040\nin his mouth, and he goes and makes little towers over here.\n\n30:33.040 --> 30:35.520\nAnd he makes a little building of dirt over here, or gravel.\n\n30:35.520 --> 30:37.280\nThat's one of these guys, I can't remember.\n\n30:37.280 --> 30:38.800\nThat might be the blue snaky guy.\n\n30:38.800 --> 30:40.800\nAnd then they suck it up, and he gets bored with that shit\n\n30:40.800 --> 30:42.080\nand starts making one over there.\n\n30:42.080 --> 30:44.120\nAnd the other fish are just swimming around looking at you.\n\n30:44.120 --> 30:45.120\nThey're doing nothing.\n\n30:45.120 --> 30:48.640\nThis guy's working for 11.\n\n30:48.640 --> 30:50.440\nSalwater takes a very meticulous, you know,\n\n30:50.440 --> 30:51.400\nthey're hard to maintain.\n\n30:51.400 --> 30:54.960\nSo we got, you know, they're taking it step by step.\n\n30:54.960 --> 30:56.160\nThey got to put living rock in it.\n\n30:56.160 --> 30:59.000\nThen they put some coral in it later.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:02.240\nBut first, they brought in three starter fish.\n\n31:02.240 --> 31:06.320\nYeah, that's how you got to do it.\n\n31:06.320 --> 31:07.400\nThat sounds like a shitty gig.\n\n31:07.400 --> 31:08.720\nWhat do they have to do?\n\n31:08.720 --> 31:09.920\nThey start the water off?\n\n31:09.920 --> 31:11.920\nYeah, well, Dino and I spent like 45 minutes\n\n31:11.920 --> 31:14.160\nlike disagreeing on what the Pixar movie would be,\n\n31:14.160 --> 31:17.680\nlike about starter fish.\n\n31:17.680 --> 31:20.520\nBecause Dino was, I wish he was here to like defend his movie,\n\n31:20.520 --> 31:21.760\nbut I was like, you don't get it.\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:23.240\nYou just don't get it.\n\n31:23.240 --> 31:25.720\nBecause he was like, he was obsessed with this idea\n\n31:25.720 --> 31:29.520\nthat it would be the story of a starter fish's relationship\n\n31:29.520 --> 31:31.400\nwith the little girl who got the aquarium,\n\n31:31.400 --> 31:32.920\nbut her parents kept telling her,\n\n31:32.920 --> 31:34.000\ndon't get attached to him.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.120\nHe's just a starter fish.\n\n31:36.120 --> 31:37.360\nLike he's going to die.\n\n31:37.360 --> 31:39.640\nAnd I was like, dude, your narrative's all over the fucking\n\n31:39.640 --> 31:40.760\nplace.\n\n31:40.760 --> 31:42.360\nAnd he's like, you said the toy story.\n\n31:42.360 --> 31:43.840\nI said, yeah, exactly.\n\n31:43.840 --> 31:46.480\nAndy's a fucking meteorological phenomenon.\n\n31:46.480 --> 31:47.240\nHe's moving.\n\n31:47.240 --> 31:48.040\nHe likes this toy.\n\n31:48.040 --> 31:49.040\nHe doesn't like that toy.\n\n31:49.040 --> 31:51.680\nThe toys are the ones with the fucking complicated\n\n31:51.680 --> 31:52.960\nrelationships.\n\n31:52.960 --> 31:55.440\nYou can't bounce back and forth in and out of the tank.\n\n31:55.440 --> 31:58.120\nThere's grownups talking to a kid and going like,\n\n31:58.120 --> 31:59.120\ndon't get attached to her.\n\n31:59.120 --> 32:02.360\nWhat the fuck is he talking about?\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:03.280\nWhat's your opening?\n\n32:03.280 --> 32:04.200\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n32:06.760 --> 32:08.360\nObviously, I mean, I don't even know\n\n32:08.360 --> 32:09.760\nthat you have a choice in this matter.\n\n32:09.760 --> 32:12.120\nIf it's a movie called Starter Fish, it's like, hey,\n\n32:12.120 --> 32:12.920\nwe're starter fish.\n\n32:12.920 --> 32:14.720\nWe're like the blue collar fish.\n\n32:14.720 --> 32:18.080\nWe go into the tank and we can handle hardier water\n\n32:18.080 --> 32:19.880\nand we get things started.\n\n32:19.880 --> 32:24.120\nAnd we know that we do a good job when the big bright fish come\n\n32:24.120 --> 32:26.840\nin who are more sensitive and delicate\n\n32:26.840 --> 32:28.000\nand who cost more money.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:29.800\nAnd they're the reason that people get the tank.\n\n32:29.800 --> 32:31.400\nI'm sorry I spit all over you.\n\n32:31.400 --> 32:32.280\nHit pause for a second.\n\n32:32.280 --> 32:34.960\nSo the Starter Fish's job is to what?\n\n32:34.960 --> 32:36.280\nThey're just in there because they're cheap.\n\n32:36.280 --> 32:38.560\nAnd if they die, it's not as big a deal.\n\n32:38.560 --> 32:40.920\nYou're making sure you've got the levels of the thing.\n\n32:40.920 --> 32:43.280\nBut they actually set the levels themselves.\n\n32:43.280 --> 32:44.360\nIt's like they shit.\n\n32:44.360 --> 32:48.040\nAnd then bacteria and stuff can grow in the carbon\n\n32:48.040 --> 32:49.840\nand the living material they put out.\n\n32:49.840 --> 32:53.400\nAnd that actually puts bacteria in the water.\n\n32:53.400 --> 32:56.360\nThen that bacteria eats and puts air into the water.\n\n32:56.360 --> 32:57.280\nThey can breathe.\n\n32:57.280 --> 32:58.760\nThey jump start the biosphere.\n\n32:58.760 --> 33:02.120\nIt's called a murder fish.\n\n33:02.120 --> 33:04.440\nAnyways, my, obviously my story.\n\n33:04.440 --> 33:05.960\nThat's the name of your movie, Murder Fish.\n\n33:05.960 --> 33:07.880\nWell, I think someone could throw that out at one point.\n\n33:07.880 --> 33:09.840\nGo, why don't they call you Murder Fish?\n\n33:09.840 --> 33:10.320\nMaybe.\n\n33:10.320 --> 33:12.080\nThat could be like a thing in Act 1, I guess.\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:15.920\nIt's in the trailer for sure.\n\n33:15.920 --> 33:19.120\nMy movie's about the little starter fish that decides\n\n33:19.120 --> 33:21.400\nhe wants to be the center of attention.\n\n33:21.400 --> 33:22.600\nHe's not a starter fish.\n\n33:22.600 --> 33:25.800\nHe's going to be the most important fish in the tank.\n\n33:25.800 --> 33:27.800\nAnd then everyone's like, look at that fish.\n\n33:27.800 --> 33:31.960\nAnd then all the, you know, you don't set the story\n\n33:31.960 --> 33:32.880\noutside the aquarium.\n\n33:32.880 --> 33:33.720\nYou have all the other fish.\n\n33:33.720 --> 33:36.000\nYou're like, what the fuck are you doing, starter fish?\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.880\nThe other fish is saying, look, don't get too big\n\n33:37.880 --> 33:38.400\nfor your boots.\n\n33:38.400 --> 33:39.640\nYou know where we're going.\n\n33:39.640 --> 33:41.840\nWe're going right down the toilet.\n\n33:41.840 --> 33:45.000\nSee, you and Dina were obsessed with this lifespan thing.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:45.640\nThat's the thing.\n\n33:45.640 --> 33:46.640\nI don't want to get to that.\n\n33:46.640 --> 33:47.120\nIt's not.\n\n33:47.120 --> 33:49.360\nWell, wouldn't it be Threshold Guardian starter fish?\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:51.360\nOr they would all go get them.\n\n33:51.360 --> 33:52.400\nNo, no, I think yes.\n\n33:52.400 --> 33:54.720\nOf course, he would have his family would be like,\n\n33:54.720 --> 33:55.840\ndon't, don't, Mickey.\n\n33:55.840 --> 33:59.320\nDon't, like, don't, you're a starter fish.\n\n33:59.320 --> 34:00.520\nNow, I don't know why.\n\n34:00.520 --> 34:02.280\nI got to finish writing the movie.\n\n34:02.280 --> 34:07.400\nBut I don't know what's at stake for anybody.\n\n34:07.400 --> 34:08.240\nThey're in a tank.\n\n34:08.240 --> 34:10.120\nSo I don't know.\n\n34:10.120 --> 34:12.480\nMaybe there's a fish contest at the end of the movie.\n\n34:12.480 --> 34:13.600\nI don't know.\n\n34:13.600 --> 34:15.760\nI'll work on it later.\n\n34:15.760 --> 34:18.080\nYeah, how does he go from being a starter fish to making\n\n34:18.080 --> 34:21.240\nthe cut for these flashier pajamas,\n\n34:21.240 --> 34:23.520\nbushammies, and stuff like that when they come in?\n\n34:23.520 --> 34:24.560\nWell, I don't know.\n\n34:24.560 --> 34:26.440\nOK, I'm just riffing this, OK?\n\n34:26.440 --> 34:27.480\nBad pitch.\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:30.360\nOK, Tommy, the starter fish, comes in and they go,\n\n34:30.360 --> 34:31.640\nlike, kid, you're a starter fish.\n\n34:31.640 --> 34:33.160\nDo you know the code of starter fish?\n\n34:33.160 --> 34:33.680\nNo, I don't.\n\n34:33.680 --> 34:34.440\nTell me.\n\n34:34.440 --> 34:35.560\nReally, you're telling the audience.\n\n34:35.560 --> 34:37.160\nYou tell them, huh?\n\n34:37.160 --> 34:37.880\nIt's a starter fish.\n\n34:37.880 --> 34:38.840\nThis is our code of ethics.\n\n34:38.840 --> 34:40.240\nOK, a starter fish.\n\n34:40.240 --> 34:41.760\nOK, here come all the fucked up fish.\n\n34:41.760 --> 34:43.920\nSo they're the non-fucked up fish.\n\n34:43.920 --> 34:45.920\nAnd then, OK, so it's a love story.\n\n34:45.920 --> 34:49.520\nHe falls for a girl.\n\n34:49.520 --> 34:49.880\nYou know what?\n\n34:49.880 --> 34:52.480\nMaybe it needs to take place in the aquarium store\n\n34:52.480 --> 34:54.200\nin order for it to work, because then there's\n\n34:54.200 --> 34:55.880\nthat whole adoption thing.\n\n34:55.880 --> 34:56.960\nWhere are you going to go?\n\n34:56.960 --> 34:58.440\nThat's what it has to be.\n\n34:58.440 --> 35:03.800\nIt's like, oh, he falls in love with a tetra or a blue tang,\n\n35:03.800 --> 35:04.300\nprobably.\n\n35:10.800 --> 35:11.800\nOr just wants to be friends.\n\n35:11.800 --> 35:13.280\nIt doesn't have to be falls in love,\n\n35:13.280 --> 35:15.400\nbecause some people might go, they can't reproduce.\n\n35:15.400 --> 35:17.120\nAre they going to, why do you want\n\n35:17.120 --> 35:20.520\nto think about these fish fucking?\n\n35:20.520 --> 35:23.560\nAnd then, but then he's like, I want to go with her,\n\n35:23.560 --> 35:24.440\nso I'm going to go.\n\n35:24.440 --> 35:26.360\nSo he's just in a tank full of starter fish,\n\n35:26.360 --> 35:31.360\nso then what do you do when you're just a kid born off\n\n35:31.360 --> 35:33.480\nBroadway, but you've got big dreams?\n\n35:39.760 --> 35:42.160\nSo he starts flashing around.\n\n35:42.160 --> 35:44.400\nIt's like a subtle, if you do it right,\n\n35:44.400 --> 35:51.960\nit could be like a subtle commentary for drag queens.\n\n35:51.960 --> 35:55.120\nHe decides, I want to be flashy.\n\n35:55.120 --> 35:56.640\nAnd the people are like, you're weird.\n\n35:56.640 --> 35:57.280\nStop it.\n\n35:57.280 --> 35:58.360\nThat's not in your nature.\n\n35:58.360 --> 35:59.320\nYou're a starter fish.\n\n35:59.320 --> 36:01.800\nAnd he's like, so what?\n\n36:01.800 --> 36:03.240\nThat's what I was born.\n\n36:03.240 --> 36:04.360\nI don't care.\n\n36:04.360 --> 36:05.800\nI want to be a different kind of fish\n\n36:05.800 --> 36:07.840\nand get scooped out of here.\n\n36:07.840 --> 36:13.080\nAnd I'm going to go be on the metaphor for whatever RuPaul\n\n36:13.080 --> 36:17.160\nshow, which is going into some little girl's\n\n36:17.160 --> 36:18.040\ntank in her bedroom.\n\n36:23.160 --> 36:26.480\nWhat's the bottoming out of that?\n\n36:26.480 --> 36:28.480\nWhat's the Randy Newman theme song?\n\n36:28.480 --> 36:30.320\nOh, that's that.\n\n36:30.320 --> 36:31.200\nI guess so.\n\n36:31.200 --> 36:34.680\nBecause I got a thing for you.\n\n36:34.680 --> 36:36.840\nNo, no, no.\n\n36:36.840 --> 36:40.280\nThat's his terrible size where he's just talking.\n\n36:40.280 --> 36:42.120\nOh, swimming water.\n\n36:42.120 --> 36:46.040\nWater, swimming, friend.\n\n36:46.040 --> 36:47.520\nIt's not a song, just because there's\n\n36:47.520 --> 36:48.760\na piano in the background.\n\n36:51.680 --> 36:55.200\nAll right, so next week, we're not here,\n\n36:55.200 --> 36:58.000\nbecause we're doing the Rick and Morty Premier Party.\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.200\nIt's the premieres on Sunday.\n\n36:59.200 --> 37:08.720\nSo apparently, I've been asked to host a streaming of the thing.\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:11.160\nYeah, you're helping us out there at the party.\n\n37:11.160 --> 37:13.080\nI should probably get to see the episode\n\n37:13.080 --> 37:15.560\nbefore that happens, so I know what the hell I'm talking about.\n\n37:15.560 --> 37:23.320\nYeah, it could be a disaster, because you'd be like,\n\n37:23.320 --> 37:25.000\nwhat are you going to see?\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:26.760\nI don't even know what you're going to be doing.\n\n37:26.760 --> 37:28.480\nMe neither.\n\n37:28.480 --> 37:30.760\nThen the week after that, it gets more confusing.\n\n37:30.760 --> 37:32.840\nWe're going to be in New York.\n\n37:32.840 --> 37:33.320\nRight?\n\n37:33.320 --> 37:34.440\nIs that right?\n\n37:34.440 --> 37:36.160\nWe are, but I guess.\n\n37:36.160 --> 37:37.800\nThat show's already sold out, because it's\n\n37:37.800 --> 37:38.800\nin a teeny little theater.\n\n37:38.800 --> 37:41.080\nNot that you guys were going to fly to New York to see us,\n\n37:41.080 --> 37:45.000\nfor those of you listening to New York.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:49.280\nAnd then we're back here, and we're rolling like James Brolin.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:56.840\nDo you think I?\n\n37:56.840 --> 37:59.000\nDo you?\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nAre you?\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.720\nIs there anybody here that's lactose intolerant?\n\n38:02.720 --> 38:04.200\nThere's got to be.\n\n38:04.200 --> 38:05.680\nOK.\n\n38:05.680 --> 38:09.840\nSo I'm going to ask you a couple yes or no questions.\n\n38:09.840 --> 38:11.520\nDo you fart a lot when you?\n\n38:11.520 --> 38:12.020\nOK.\n\n38:15.640 --> 38:17.760\nDoes it hurt?\n\n38:17.760 --> 38:18.520\nOK.\n\n38:18.520 --> 38:24.560\nSo it's just like, so if you just had a cheeseburger.\n\n38:30.240 --> 38:34.280\nSo is it possible that I could have been lactose intolerant\n\n38:34.280 --> 38:37.200\nmy whole life, and I'm just now noticing,\n\n38:37.200 --> 38:39.520\nbecause I fart so much?\n\n38:39.520 --> 38:40.440\nWhat did you say?\n\n38:40.440 --> 38:42.080\nYou shart yourself a lot.\n\n38:42.080 --> 38:43.440\nShart yourself?\n\n38:43.440 --> 38:44.720\nWhat are you, what are you, British?\n\n38:48.280 --> 38:49.680\nYou do poop your pants a lot.\n\n38:49.680 --> 38:53.160\nWell, yeah, but that's alcoholism.\n\n38:53.160 --> 38:55.160\nThat's.\n\n38:55.160 --> 38:56.600\nI'm a drunk, too.\n\n38:56.600 --> 38:57.560\nI don't poop my pants ever.\n\n38:57.560 --> 38:58.840\nWell, it could be a combination.\n\n38:58.840 --> 39:01.040\nIf I'm drunk and eating a lot of dairy,\n\n39:01.040 --> 39:03.840\nthen I'm farting so much that I'm\n\n39:03.840 --> 39:05.720\nmy inhibitions and judgment are lowered,\n\n39:05.720 --> 39:08.400\nso then I'm like, here comes a great fart.\n\n39:08.400 --> 39:10.480\nI'm like, I don't realize.\n\n39:10.480 --> 39:12.240\nNow, have you ever pooped your pants sober?\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:13.360\nLet's figure this out.\n\n39:13.360 --> 39:14.240\nWell, I don't know.\n\n39:14.240 --> 39:18.280\nYeah, I have, because I remember in comedy sports,\n\n39:18.280 --> 39:21.880\nI remember at the Marriott Hotel.\n\n39:21.880 --> 39:23.240\nI went up to.\n\n39:23.240 --> 39:24.840\nYeah, I remember very distinctly,\n\n39:24.840 --> 39:27.440\nbecause Dick Chudnow, the founder of comedy sports,\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:29.560\nwas setting up the stage.\n\n39:29.560 --> 39:32.520\nAnd he said something like, I wonder\n\n39:32.520 --> 39:35.440\nif we should play this game or that game tonight, or whatever.\n\n39:35.440 --> 39:37.840\nAnd I said, well, you know, Dick, I\n\n39:37.840 --> 39:39.400\nfelt like a fart coming.\n\n39:39.400 --> 39:44.960\nAnd I said, well, you know, a real crowd pleaser is if we.\n\n39:44.960 --> 39:48.720\nAnd I just shit in my pants.\n\n39:48.720 --> 39:49.680\nThere was no sound.\n\n39:58.400 --> 40:01.840\nAnd I just walked away and had to throw my pants\n\n40:01.840 --> 40:03.320\nand my underwear in the garbage.\n\n40:03.320 --> 40:05.720\nI was like, I had no pants.\n\n40:05.720 --> 40:07.240\nI had to borrow someone else's pants.\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:08.240\nAnd they knew.\n\n40:08.240 --> 40:09.480\nIt's not like I took a shower.\n\n40:09.480 --> 40:10.920\nIt's like, so they knew that they'd then\n\n40:10.920 --> 40:13.600\nhave to throw their pants away, too.\n\n40:13.600 --> 40:15.120\nDid they know what happened?\n\n40:15.120 --> 40:15.800\nEveryone knew.\n\n40:15.800 --> 40:20.360\nThere was no way I was going to let that be a secret.\n\n40:20.360 --> 40:22.720\nAnd that's just more humiliation.\n\n40:22.720 --> 40:26.680\nAs soon as that shit starts, I'm going to ground zero,\n\n40:26.680 --> 40:29.480\nwait, a Def Con, whatever.\n\n40:29.480 --> 40:31.200\nI'm not going to let somebody go.\n\n40:31.200 --> 40:33.520\nDamn shit, his pants.\n\n40:33.520 --> 40:36.160\nI was on stage in LA with a guy, one of the dudes\n\n40:36.160 --> 40:38.200\nin our show, who was the referee.\n\n40:38.200 --> 40:39.840\nRight before, a good set of intermission\n\n40:39.840 --> 40:40.960\nis called halftime.\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:43.040\nAnd all of a sudden, it smelled like somebody\n\n40:43.040 --> 40:43.800\nshit their pants.\n\n40:43.800 --> 40:47.160\nAnd certainly enough, our referee had just completely\n\n40:47.160 --> 40:49.360\nfilled his pants.\n\n40:49.360 --> 40:53.680\nAnd so he came back out at halftime for the second act.\n\n40:53.680 --> 40:56.200\nAnd instead of having black trousers on,\n\n40:56.200 --> 40:59.000\nlike he'd had to start the thing, now he had like navy blue\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:00.680\nor royal blue sweatpants.\n\n41:00.680 --> 41:02.480\nBut no underwear, so you could see a little wiener\n\n41:02.480 --> 41:04.160\nin the clothing.\n\n41:04.160 --> 41:05.960\nAnd it was mesmerizing.\n\n41:05.960 --> 41:07.320\nHe'd talk over here and a wiener over here.\n\n41:07.320 --> 41:11.320\nAnd he'd talk over there and wiener over there.\n\n41:11.320 --> 41:13.400\nI know who that guy is, because he's totally like that.\n\n41:13.400 --> 41:14.720\nI wanted to mention his name so bad.\n\n41:14.720 --> 41:18.080\nThere was this kid named Noah in my grade school, Noah.\n\n41:18.080 --> 41:21.800\nI can't remember his last name or boy, I'd tell you.\n\n41:21.800 --> 41:23.160\nBut I remember his first name was Noah.\n\n41:23.160 --> 41:26.600\nAnd by his own account, he was allergic to cheese.\n\n41:26.600 --> 41:29.560\nSo I think we just didn't know it was called lactose intolerance\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:30.320\nback then.\n\n41:30.320 --> 41:32.200\nBut he said, I'm allergic to cheese.\n\n41:32.200 --> 41:33.520\nAnd we go, what do you mean?\n\n41:33.520 --> 41:35.080\nLike you sneeze when you eat it?\n\n41:35.080 --> 41:36.640\nAnd he's like, no, I shit my pants.\n\n41:39.640 --> 41:43.200\nBut then it was the 80s, and it was a public school.\n\n41:43.200 --> 41:47.400\nSo he would take a dollar to eat cheese.\n\n41:47.400 --> 41:48.640\nPeople would give him a dollar.\n\n41:48.640 --> 41:49.600\nAnd he'd go like, really?\n\n41:49.600 --> 41:50.600\nA dollar?\n\n41:50.600 --> 41:53.600\nI was like, just moose.\n\n41:53.600 --> 41:57.320\nAnd he had some witticism like, poops temporary.\n\n41:57.320 --> 41:58.440\nMoney's forever anyway.\n\n42:02.160 --> 42:03.400\nI wish that were true, Dan.\n\n42:03.400 --> 42:05.600\nLike, my pants will be cleaned tomorrow.\n\n42:05.600 --> 42:08.280\nLike, yeah, but it's going to cost a dollar to wash them.\n\n42:08.280 --> 42:10.280\nYes, tomorrow my pants will be cleaned.\n\n42:10.280 --> 42:13.480\nBut I shall be rich.\n\n42:13.480 --> 42:18.680\nAnd I remember one time he shit his pants in the cafeteria.\n\n42:18.680 --> 42:19.680\nWhat age are we talking?\n\n42:19.680 --> 42:20.180\nI'm sorry.\n\n42:20.180 --> 42:21.040\nNo, it wasn't him.\n\n42:21.040 --> 42:23.040\nI mean, Noah would shit his pants all the time.\n\n42:23.040 --> 42:26.600\nBut he did it on purpose, and then I\n\n42:26.600 --> 42:27.640\nthink he'd just go home.\n\n42:27.640 --> 42:29.440\nAnd I think he would just whistle the theme\n\n42:29.440 --> 42:30.560\nfrom the ending of the show.\n\n42:30.560 --> 42:36.160\nAnd it's like, I guess he was the kid that was nailing it,\n\n42:36.160 --> 42:36.660\nright?\n\n42:36.660 --> 42:39.880\nIt's like, I shit my pants when I eat cheese.\n\n42:39.880 --> 42:42.200\nI'll give you a dollar to do that.\n\n42:42.200 --> 42:43.120\nOK.\n\n42:43.120 --> 42:44.160\nGoodbye, school.\n\n42:46.720 --> 42:48.400\nHello, dollar.\n\n42:48.400 --> 42:50.520\nI have to go do two things.\n\n42:50.520 --> 42:52.320\nI have to go do some laundry and go to the bank.\n\n42:57.320 --> 42:59.680\nSo, but there was this kid.\n\n42:59.680 --> 43:01.960\nI can't remember his name, but.\n\n43:01.960 --> 43:04.720\nI wish you could because the names of your friends from school\n\n43:04.720 --> 43:06.360\nare hilarious.\n\n43:06.360 --> 43:10.800\nOK, I want to say his, I do remember his name.\n\n43:10.800 --> 43:11.920\nAnd I remember his full name.\n\n43:11.920 --> 43:12.960\nHis first name was Henry.\n\n43:12.960 --> 43:14.880\nI want to say his last name because it's adorable,\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:16.960\nbut it's alliterative.\n\n43:16.960 --> 43:22.080\nBut he was an adorable, very quiet kid, and he shit his pants.\n\n43:22.080 --> 43:27.040\nAnd for some reason, this is what's really weird.\n\n43:27.040 --> 43:31.560\nThis is what would have been first grade, not kindergarten.\n\n43:31.560 --> 43:35.880\nBecause in kindergarten, I told you the story of how I,\n\n43:35.880 --> 43:37.800\nin kindergarten, you don't even know where you're going.\n\n43:37.800 --> 43:39.840\nThey used to take me to that special room when I was in\n\n43:39.840 --> 43:41.400\nkindergarten because I knew how to read.\n\n43:41.400 --> 43:43.440\nAnd they would like, they left me in this room.\n\n43:43.440 --> 43:45.640\nAnd I didn't know how to read the clocks.\n\n43:45.640 --> 43:46.680\nHas he told the story before?\n\n43:46.680 --> 43:47.680\nI had to.\n\n43:47.680 --> 43:48.160\nYeah.\n\n43:48.160 --> 43:49.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n43:49.360 --> 43:50.640\nI was like, I know when the bell rings,\n\n43:50.640 --> 43:51.880\nI get to go to the bathroom.\n\n43:51.880 --> 43:53.080\nBut I don't know what time it is.\n\n43:53.080 --> 43:54.720\nAnd I don't know when the bell's going to ring.\n\n43:54.720 --> 43:55.320\nAnd I had to pee.\n\n43:55.320 --> 43:58.040\nAnd I just peed in the chair.\n\n43:58.040 --> 44:00.480\nI just was in the middle of this walking closet surrounded\n\n44:00.480 --> 44:01.280\nby textbooks.\n\n44:01.280 --> 44:04.560\nAnd I just went, pssh.\n\n44:04.560 --> 44:08.520\nAnd right in the middle of it, it was like, prrrrring the bell.\n\n44:08.520 --> 44:11.160\nAnd I was just like, psh.\n\n44:11.160 --> 44:12.520\nAnd it just kept going.\n\n44:12.520 --> 44:16.520\nAnd then I just got up and took a look back.\n\n44:16.520 --> 44:18.040\nAnd there's this big ocean of pee.\n\n44:18.040 --> 44:19.040\nAnd I just hit the lights.\n\n44:19.040 --> 44:23.520\nAnd while I left it, I just piss all the way past.\n\n44:23.520 --> 44:25.920\nAnd went and got in the lunch line thinking, oh, yeah,\n\n44:25.920 --> 44:26.680\nno one will notice.\n\n44:26.680 --> 44:32.200\nI was like, you look like you were riding a painted horse\n\n44:32.200 --> 44:33.160\nthat hadn't dried yet.\n\n44:33.160 --> 44:34.640\nOf course, people are going to notice.\n\n44:34.640 --> 44:36.120\nAnd the guy who really pointed it out,\n\n44:36.120 --> 44:37.920\nmy brother, who was in sixth grade at the time,\n\n44:37.920 --> 44:39.960\nwas like, did you piss your pants in the whole school?\n\n44:39.960 --> 44:41.240\nI was like, you pissed your pants.\n\n44:41.240 --> 44:44.280\nAnyways, when I was in first grade,\n\n44:44.280 --> 44:44.880\nDid you cry?\n\n44:44.880 --> 44:46.760\nLike, was that horrible?\n\n44:46.760 --> 44:47.360\nI don't think.\n\n44:47.360 --> 44:51.360\nI think that was so weird that I don't think I cried.\n\n44:51.360 --> 44:52.720\nI think I've cried it.\n\n44:52.720 --> 44:54.440\nI've cried it less.\n\n44:54.440 --> 44:55.960\nDid you realize you could have been making money on this\n\n44:55.960 --> 44:57.560\nthe whole time?\n\n44:57.560 --> 45:00.760\nYou could have peed in your pants for $1 a pop.\n\n45:00.760 --> 45:06.600\nSo this kid, Henry, Miss Piana comes up to me at lunch,\n\n45:06.600 --> 45:07.400\nfirst grade.\n\n45:07.400 --> 45:10.520\nAnd she goes, she's got Henry.\n\n45:10.520 --> 45:12.560\nShe's holding his hand.\n\n45:12.560 --> 45:16.160\nAnd she goes, Daniel, will you take Henry to the bathroom?\n\n45:16.160 --> 45:18.600\nHe had an accident.\n\n45:18.600 --> 45:20.960\nNow, I never shit my pants in school as far as I know.\n\n45:20.960 --> 45:22.240\nSo I don't know why I'm an expert.\n\n45:22.240 --> 45:23.280\nLike, send him with Noah.\n\n45:23.280 --> 45:27.520\nYou know, like, Noah, I'll show him the ropes.\n\n45:27.520 --> 45:31.120\nMaybe that's what she was worried about.\n\n45:31.120 --> 45:34.560\nWe don't need another poop tycoon in our school.\n\n45:34.560 --> 45:36.560\nI think it was like, because I was smart.\n\n45:36.560 --> 45:37.680\nI was the smart kid.\n\n45:37.680 --> 45:39.160\nI was supposed to handle it.\n\n45:39.160 --> 45:40.480\nIt was like, I could be like an expert.\n\n45:40.480 --> 45:42.200\nOr that you dealt with the trauma of peeing yourself\n\n45:42.200 --> 45:45.040\nso well that you thought, I can take it.\n\n45:45.040 --> 45:47.040\nYeah.\n\n45:47.040 --> 45:50.000\nYeah, I remember going into the coat room where the bathrooms\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.440\nwere, and he just went into a stall.\n\n45:51.440 --> 45:53.360\nAnd I was just kind of like, I have\n\n45:53.360 --> 45:54.680\nsuch a clear memory of that.\n\n45:54.680 --> 45:57.040\nLike, I was just hanging out by the winter coats,\n\n45:57.040 --> 45:59.520\njust kind of trying to talk him through it,\n\n45:59.520 --> 46:03.040\nlike an old war buddy or something.\n\n46:03.040 --> 46:07.080\nI pooped my pants all the time, uh-huh, OK.\n\n46:07.080 --> 46:08.360\nOh, man, it's everywhere.\n\n46:08.360 --> 46:08.920\nIt's all right.\n\n46:08.920 --> 46:09.600\nIt's OK, man.\n\n46:09.600 --> 46:11.680\nJust clean it up.\n\n46:11.680 --> 46:17.080\nI don't know what I was supposed to do.\n\n46:17.080 --> 46:17.920\nThat's so weird.\n\n46:17.920 --> 46:19.800\nYeah.\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:21.360\nIt's a positive memory for me, though,\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:22.680\nbecause I felt like I did it right.\n\n46:22.680 --> 46:24.200\nBut I'm sure I didn't.\n\n46:24.200 --> 46:24.760\nI don't know.\n\n46:24.760 --> 46:26.880\nI'm sure I wasn't supposed to help him.\n\n46:26.880 --> 46:30.880\nThat would be crazy if the teacher wanted me to help.\n\n46:30.880 --> 46:31.960\nShe couldn't have wanted that.\n\n46:31.960 --> 46:36.680\nYeah, how would she have judged the success of that task?\n\n46:36.680 --> 46:38.400\nLike, what was she hoping would happen?\n\n46:38.400 --> 46:40.840\nI mean, usually you go to the nurse,\n\n46:40.840 --> 46:42.400\nor they call a parent or something, right?\n\n46:42.400 --> 46:44.120\nI guess this was in the past.\n\n46:44.120 --> 46:47.320\nYeah, this was in dinosaur times.\n\n46:47.320 --> 46:51.400\nThere weren't, there were probably just as many pedophiles\n\n46:51.400 --> 46:53.760\nand kidnappings, but there was no internet yet.\n\n46:53.760 --> 46:55.280\nSo it was just sort of like, well,\n\n46:55.280 --> 46:58.240\nas long as he's with someone, we can't just\n\n46:58.240 --> 47:00.320\nsend him off into the world.\n\n47:00.320 --> 47:02.200\nWe'll send him with two kids, so they'll\n\n47:02.200 --> 47:03.160\nbe harder to kidnap.\n\n47:03.160 --> 47:05.880\nWe had beatings in my elementary school.\n\n47:05.880 --> 47:07.440\nLike, you got corporal punishment.\n\n47:07.440 --> 47:10.840\nLike, there were hard spankings at our school.\n\n47:10.840 --> 47:12.160\nI don't think we ever, we would get,\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:12.960\nThat's hilarious.\n\n47:12.960 --> 47:16.080\nFor our birthdays there were.\n\n47:16.080 --> 47:18.960\nWe got, we got paddled for our birthdays.\n\n47:18.960 --> 47:20.040\nYou could hear kids getting spanked\n\n47:20.040 --> 47:20.880\nor someone did something bad.\n\n47:20.880 --> 47:22.280\nI feel like I've told the story before,\n\n47:22.280 --> 47:24.200\nbut there was a ping-pong paddle supposedly,\n\n47:24.200 --> 47:26.320\nand they really whacked the crap out of you.\n\n47:26.320 --> 47:30.000\nNot quite, but you could hear it from outside the building.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nAnd so you'd be in there like, it was like,\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.800\nlike a scene from some World War II, like prisoner movie,\n\n47:34.800 --> 47:36.840\nand you could hear the kids screaming, you'll wham!\n\n47:36.840 --> 47:40.040\nAh, this is the fucking worst.\n\n47:40.040 --> 47:42.560\nAnd then what, supposedly the legend was there was one kid\n\n47:42.560 --> 47:45.080\nthat was so badass, he clenched up his butt cheeks\n\n47:45.080 --> 47:46.640\nand broke the ping-pong paddle.\n\n47:46.640 --> 47:52.280\nLike, he was famous whether or not that ever happened,\n\n47:52.280 --> 47:53.680\nbut he was like, he was Paul Bunyan.\n\n47:53.680 --> 47:57.240\nHis ass is so muscular.\n\n47:57.240 --> 47:59.040\nHe just fought it so hard,\n\n47:59.040 --> 48:03.080\nhe's like, it's fucking, he destroyed a ping-pong paddle.\n\n48:03.080 --> 48:05.080\nWell, my mom would hit us with a wooden spoon,\n\n48:05.080 --> 48:06.800\nand every once in a while, the wooden spoon would break.\n\n48:06.800 --> 48:08.600\nOh yeah, I'm sure that there was stress crack,\n\n48:08.600 --> 48:09.600\nthere was fatigue in that wood.\n\n48:09.600 --> 48:12.320\nI hate that that kid got credit for,\n\n48:12.320 --> 48:13.600\nbecause it's like, if you just hit a rock\n\n48:13.600 --> 48:15.600\nwith a ping-pong paddle, it's not going to break.\n\n48:15.600 --> 48:17.400\nIt's not like because it's so hard.\n\n48:17.400 --> 48:18.280\nYeah.\n\n48:18.280 --> 48:23.400\nLike, he just, someone else's ass wore that thing out for him.\n\n48:23.400 --> 48:24.440\nYeah, where's their credit?\n\n48:24.440 --> 48:26.600\nYeah.\n\n48:26.600 --> 48:29.320\nNo, I don't think anybody got...\n\n48:29.320 --> 48:31.000\nThey call those starter butts.\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:47.000\nLike...\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:50.120\nI'm trying to remember, even like maybe before,\n\n48:50.120 --> 48:51.640\nbecause my brother was five years ahead of me,\n\n48:51.640 --> 48:53.400\nso like, any stories about,\n\n48:53.400 --> 48:55.720\nI hear stories about teachers throwing erasers\n\n48:55.720 --> 48:58.760\nand throwing chalk and throwing tantrums and stuff.\n\n48:58.760 --> 49:01.560\nLike, yeah, there were teachers who would have\n\n49:01.560 --> 49:03.320\nlike, nervous breakdowns, but then they would get,\n\n49:03.320 --> 49:04.760\nlike, they would disappear, you know,\n\n49:04.760 --> 49:06.120\nbecause they did something physical.\n\n49:06.120 --> 49:06.960\nWe had a crazy teacher that locked, like,\n\n49:06.960 --> 49:08.920\nif you made her mad, she was kind of like,\n\n49:08.920 --> 49:12.280\non and off medication, and if she was off her medication,\n\n49:12.280 --> 49:15.360\nshe would just lock kids in a cabinet.\n\n49:15.360 --> 49:16.400\nAnd like, that was the punished man.\n\n49:16.400 --> 49:18.440\nAnd then people, she got fired for that, of course.\n\n49:18.440 --> 49:19.600\nWe found out about that.\n\n49:19.600 --> 49:21.240\nBut suddenly, she would go like,\n\n49:21.240 --> 49:22.880\nMr. Davis, get out of here.\n\n49:22.880 --> 49:25.560\nLike, yeah, you've disrupted the class too many times.\n\n49:25.560 --> 49:28.400\nYou go run around the school.\n\n49:28.400 --> 49:29.880\nNow, our school was enormous.\n\n49:29.880 --> 49:31.640\nLike, it would take you the rest of the day,\n\n49:31.640 --> 49:34.520\nso I just went to my car and went home.\n\n49:34.520 --> 49:36.520\nThen we found that out, so we would just try to piss her off,\n\n49:36.520 --> 49:38.040\nand she would go take a lap,\n\n49:38.040 --> 49:39.240\nand then we would just go to like,\n\n49:39.240 --> 49:40.080\nDerewienerschnitzel.\n\n49:43.080 --> 49:45.560\nI almost died at Derewienerschnitzel at lunch, by the way.\n\n49:45.560 --> 49:46.960\nThe guy was taking a bite of a corn dog,\n\n49:46.960 --> 49:49.840\nand my friend John, while I was taking a bite of his corn dog,\n\n49:49.840 --> 49:52.040\nhe just thought it'd be funny if he gave me more than I wanted,\n\n49:52.040 --> 49:54.480\nand he'd shoved the entire corn dog down my mouth.\n\n49:54.480 --> 49:55.640\nBut before I knew it was happening,\n\n49:55.640 --> 49:57.600\nI had bitten the corn dog off.\n\n49:57.600 --> 50:00.600\nNow I've got an entire corn dog in my throat,\n\n50:00.600 --> 50:02.000\nand it's not gonna come back out.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.400\nThere's no way to get a handle on the corn dog\n\n50:04.400 --> 50:07.240\nwith your mouth, and I'm just going, I'm dying here.\n\n50:07.240 --> 50:08.960\nAnd then everybody looked at me and realized\n\n50:08.960 --> 50:11.400\nthat I was dying, and everybody froze.\n\n50:11.400 --> 50:14.360\nAnd so then, one big strong friend of mine,\n\n50:14.360 --> 50:16.960\nwe called Bam Bam, he just came up and picked me upside down,\n\n50:16.960 --> 50:18.320\nshook me by my ankle.\n\n50:18.320 --> 50:19.160\nOh, man.\n\n50:19.160 --> 50:22.640\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n50:22.640 --> 50:23.640\nBut I digress.\n\n50:24.840 --> 50:27.480\nI do remember thinking in that moment of crisis\n\n50:27.480 --> 50:28.680\nwhen I thought, okay, I can't breathe.\n\n50:28.680 --> 50:29.880\nIt's been a while now.\n\n50:29.880 --> 50:31.120\nI need to start breathing soon.\n\n50:31.120 --> 50:32.800\nThere's nothing I can do to help this thing out.\n\n50:32.800 --> 50:33.680\nIt will not go down.\n\n50:33.680 --> 50:35.160\nIt's not gonna come out.\n\n50:35.160 --> 50:37.360\nAnd I remember thinking, not like this.\n\n50:37.360 --> 50:39.320\nOh, man.\n\n50:39.320 --> 50:42.280\nWell, did you notice, like, so everybody in this room\n\n50:42.280 --> 50:43.960\nprobably has had, like, a choking incident\n\n50:43.960 --> 50:45.880\nwhere you actually, like, you kind of, like,\n\n50:45.880 --> 50:48.880\nit triggers this very specific response in your brain.\n\n50:48.880 --> 50:52.360\nLike, you feel like this could be it.\n\n50:52.360 --> 50:56.160\nLike, and it takes very little for that to get triggered\n\n50:56.160 --> 50:59.240\nbecause you're like, oh, my God, I didn't realize\n\n50:59.240 --> 51:01.840\nhow accustomed I am to breathing whenever I want.\n\n51:01.840 --> 51:05.520\nAnd it's weird how, number one,\n\n51:05.520 --> 51:07.080\nhow everyone around you kind of freezes.\n\n51:07.080 --> 51:08.000\nAnd I've been that guy.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:11.160\nDino and I were eating at Little Dom's\n\n51:11.160 --> 51:15.080\nwith our newly hired CFO at the time.\n\n51:15.080 --> 51:17.360\nHe was just having dinner with him to talk about\n\n51:17.360 --> 51:19.680\nhow excited we were for him to be turning the company\n\n51:19.680 --> 51:21.880\naround to our animation studio.\n\n51:21.880 --> 51:23.640\nAnd he's like, yeah, and it's gonna be great.\n\n51:23.640 --> 51:26.240\nAnd he's eating this, you know, the hanger steak.\n\n51:26.240 --> 51:27.880\nAnd he's just like, yeah, I'm really excited about it.\n\n51:27.880 --> 51:29.520\nAnd I can't wait to get some health plans\n\n51:29.520 --> 51:31.320\nfor the staffers.\n\n51:31.320 --> 51:33.040\nAnd I'm like, yeah, morale could be higher over\n\n51:33.040 --> 51:34.920\nif the animation thing, we could kind of fix\n\n51:34.920 --> 51:35.760\nthat air conditioning.\n\n51:35.760 --> 51:36.600\nAnd he's like, yeah.\n\n51:36.600 --> 51:41.200\nAnd I really want to, and Dino and I were kind of like,\n\n51:41.200 --> 51:45.440\nlike, it's weird.\n\n51:45.440 --> 51:49.720\nLike, I don't know, like, and he, he, he, he, he, he.\n\n51:49.720 --> 51:52.280\nYou're supposed to overreact to possible choking.\n\n51:52.280 --> 51:56.640\nAnd the bartender did, like, he, he was coming around\n\n51:56.640 --> 52:00.400\nsoon enough that before Dino and I started to do\n\n52:00.400 --> 52:02.720\nthe right thing, he was already over there.\n\n52:02.720 --> 52:05.440\nPlus on top of it, by the time anybody got close to him,\n\n52:05.440 --> 52:10.440\nhe, he just came out onto the floor and he picked it up\n\n52:12.040 --> 52:13.720\nwith a napkin and continued the conversation.\n\n52:13.720 --> 52:16.840\nBut, but we were sort of like, oh, we can never\n\n52:16.840 --> 52:17.920\nunlive that experience.\n\n52:17.920 --> 52:21.760\nLike, like, I just might have just watched a guy die,\n\n52:21.760 --> 52:22.600\nI guess.\n\n52:22.600 --> 52:23.840\nLike, I don't know what, what I would have done\n\n52:23.840 --> 52:24.800\nand when I would have done it.\n\n52:24.800 --> 52:26.800\nAnd the other, the other weird thing is that\n\n52:26.800 --> 52:30.680\non the choking side, the instinct very often is to like,\n\n52:30.680 --> 52:33.760\nhide, like people die because they start to choke\n\n52:33.760 --> 52:35.360\nand then they like go to the bathroom\n\n52:35.360 --> 52:36.760\nbecause they're embarrassed.\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:39.360\nI, and I, I've, I've, I've been in that situation.\n\n52:39.360 --> 52:42.000\nAnd it is weird how much shame gets triggered.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.280\nCause you, you're, you're choking.\n\n52:43.280 --> 52:46.760\nAnd I guess cause you, maybe you feel like a pig\n\n52:46.760 --> 52:47.600\nor something.\n\n52:47.600 --> 52:50.560\nLike you just feel, you feel like, well, what's inside\n\n52:50.560 --> 52:52.720\nyour body shouldn't be anyone's business or something.\n\n52:52.720 --> 52:55.080\nAnd so you're just like, you kind of want to go hide\n\n52:55.080 --> 52:58.160\nsomewhere until it's over, which could kill you.\n\n52:58.160 --> 52:59.960\nFor me, I, I thought I'll handle this.\n\n52:59.960 --> 53:02.120\nLike, like, let me get this corn dog out of my mouth.\n\n53:02.120 --> 53:04.080\nAnd at some point, like I'm dying and I need somebody's\n\n53:04.080 --> 53:05.080\nelse's help here.\n\n53:05.080 --> 53:07.240\nBy that time, I kept waving everybody off, I think.\n\n53:07.240 --> 53:10.160\nSo everybody was like in stasis the whole time.\n\n53:10.160 --> 53:11.000\nYeah.\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:11.840\nThat's good.\n\n53:11.840 --> 53:13.120\nI mean, in the seventies, they had that whole Heimlich\n\n53:13.120 --> 53:15.080\nawareness campaign.\n\n53:15.080 --> 53:16.720\nI guess there must have just, it must have just been\n\n53:16.720 --> 53:20.800\nterrible like to, it must have happened all the time.\n\n53:20.800 --> 53:22.800\nPeople just like eating in a restaurant and they just\n\n53:22.800 --> 53:25.520\nlike turned blue and everyone's just going, oh no,\n\n53:25.520 --> 53:26.360\nHarold.\n\n53:26.360 --> 53:29.240\nAnd they just watch them die.\n\n53:29.240 --> 53:31.080\nI always thought that that would be like, if I, I don't\n\n53:31.080 --> 53:34.520\nhave tattoos and I don't want any, but like CPR diagram\n\n53:34.520 --> 53:36.240\nand Heimlich maneuver diagram.\n\n53:36.240 --> 53:39.000\nSo, oh, if you're choking, just rip open your shirtling.\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:43.680\nYou know, there's a trick for the CPR cause you know, you\n\n53:43.680 --> 53:44.960\ndo chest compressions, right?\n\n53:44.960 --> 53:47.480\nBut you got to do it like a special rhythm.\n\n53:47.480 --> 53:51.040\nThe rhythm is the beat of the song, Stayin' Alive.\n\n53:51.040 --> 53:53.040\nThe disco song, you know?\n\n53:53.040 --> 53:54.200\nWhen you compress, you go pump.\n\n53:54.200 --> 53:58.360\nYou go, ha, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' Alive, Stayin' Alive.\n\n53:58.360 --> 53:59.840\nOh, oh, you don't stop for the thing.\n\n53:59.840 --> 54:03.520\nNo, to the beat, you know, ha, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' Alive.\n\n54:03.520 --> 54:04.360\nYou just keep pumpin'.\n\n54:04.360 --> 54:06.440\nBut couldn't that also be, I want to fuck you\n\n54:06.440 --> 54:09.080\nlike an animal?\n\n54:09.080 --> 54:10.400\nI want to.\n\n54:10.400 --> 54:14.160\nJust hear those sleigh bells going around.\n\n54:14.160 --> 54:15.880\nI guess that the picture of this is Stayin' Alive.\n\n54:15.880 --> 54:19.360\nIt's also a morale booster.\n\n54:19.360 --> 54:23.080\nI think it makes people excited to know something.\n\n54:23.080 --> 54:25.760\nIt made me excited.\n\n54:25.760 --> 54:28.720\nWe are the world.\n\n54:28.720 --> 54:31.560\nWe are the children.\n\n54:31.560 --> 54:34.480\nI mean, just pump their chest.\n\n54:34.480 --> 54:36.360\nIf it helps, pretend it's a song.\n\n54:36.360 --> 54:40.920\nFuck the police.\n\n54:40.920 --> 54:41.760\nFuck the police.\n\n54:41.760 --> 54:43.520\nCome on down for the men and women.\n\n54:50.640 --> 54:54.040\nWill you know my name?\n\n54:54.040 --> 54:55.640\nIf I see you in heaven.\n\n54:57.840 --> 54:59.240\nOh, no.\n\n54:59.240 --> 55:02.040\nNo, not the air-exlecting.\n\n55:02.040 --> 55:03.800\nIt's also too slow a tempo.\n\n55:03.800 --> 55:06.560\nIt's too slow.\n\n55:06.560 --> 55:09.960\nAll right, well, back to this farting thing.\n\n55:09.960 --> 55:12.120\nSo I'm lactose intolerant, for sure, I think.\n\n55:12.120 --> 55:15.000\nBecause it's like, when I'm eating beans and stuff,\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:16.960\nI fart like regular people that eat beans.\n\n55:16.960 --> 55:20.040\nLike, it's a musical fruit, as you know.\n\n55:20.040 --> 55:22.560\nBut it's like predictable amount of bean farting.\n\n55:22.560 --> 55:27.080\nBut then, if I have like a pint of ice cream or, you know,\n\n55:27.080 --> 55:32.200\ndairy, like, I'm capable of generating so much.\n\n55:32.200 --> 55:34.320\nThere must just be some incredible thing happening.\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:35.720\nHave you tried cutting out all dairy\n\n55:35.720 --> 55:36.840\njust to see if that goes away?\n\n55:36.840 --> 55:39.000\nWell, I effectively have with this.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:40.520\nYes, that's what I'm telling you.\n\n55:40.520 --> 55:45.480\nI finally, it took me 42 years to accidentally\n\n55:45.480 --> 55:46.880\nhave that experiment.\n\n55:46.880 --> 55:48.680\nI never tried it.\n\n55:48.680 --> 55:50.480\nBut today you had a load of dairy, right?\n\n55:50.480 --> 55:51.240\nLike, are you?\n\n55:51.240 --> 55:55.360\nYeah, I'm saying, today you're farting because of that.\n\n55:55.360 --> 55:57.160\nBut when you cut it out, that stops.\n\n55:57.160 --> 55:58.920\nYes, for the rest of the week, it's not there.\n\n55:58.920 --> 56:00.040\nBut then it's like, oh, and then I\n\n56:00.040 --> 56:02.720\nhave like some ice cream or a pina colada or something.\n\n56:02.720 --> 56:05.120\nAnd then it's like, holy gemoli.\n\n56:05.120 --> 56:08.320\nLike, I feel like I could fill a hot air balloon.\n\n56:08.320 --> 56:13.640\nAnd there might be a way to tap it for global energy.\n\n56:13.640 --> 56:15.920\nIt just seems like an amazing thing\n\n56:15.920 --> 56:17.560\nthat a human being can generate so much.\n\n56:17.560 --> 56:19.440\nWe can at least have our own hot air balloon.\n\n56:19.440 --> 56:21.600\nYeah.\n\n56:21.600 --> 56:23.280\nMy friend Sam, he was my neighbor.\n\n56:23.280 --> 56:24.280\nHe had this lovely family.\n\n56:24.280 --> 56:26.600\nThey were a very cohesive nuclear family.\n\n56:26.600 --> 56:30.920\nAnd they all had, the family joke was cherries made them\n\n56:30.920 --> 56:32.320\nall fart like mad.\n\n56:32.320 --> 56:34.160\nSo they would all, you go to their house,\n\n56:34.160 --> 56:35.560\nand they would put out a bowl of cherries,\n\n56:35.560 --> 56:36.960\nand they'd all start laughing.\n\n56:36.960 --> 56:39.560\nSo I was eating cherries, and they're laughing.\n\n56:39.560 --> 56:41.960\nMom, dad, like old people, young people,\n\n56:41.960 --> 56:44.440\neveryone's just farting.\n\n56:44.440 --> 56:45.040\nCherries.\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:48.400\nI don't like that story.\n\n56:48.400 --> 56:49.160\nSo yeah.\n\n56:49.160 --> 56:49.800\nI don't know why.\n\n56:49.800 --> 56:50.400\nI don't know why.\n\n56:50.400 --> 56:53.720\nTheir past time is to invite guests over and just fart\n\n56:53.720 --> 56:54.640\nall over the place.\n\n56:54.640 --> 56:56.000\nI guess because it's a family, I guess\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:57.120\nthat's what I don't like about it.\n\n56:57.120 --> 56:57.880\nYeah.\n\n56:57.880 --> 56:58.600\nI don't like that it's a family.\n\n56:58.600 --> 57:01.080\nYou resent that the family bonded over anything?\n\n57:01.080 --> 57:02.920\nIt's like the hills have eyes, kind of.\n\n57:02.920 --> 57:05.480\nYeah.\n\n57:05.480 --> 57:05.960\nYeah.\n\n57:05.960 --> 57:06.920\nExcept they don't.\n\n57:06.920 --> 57:09.240\nBecause if the hills had eyes, some of those eyes\n\n57:09.240 --> 57:14.200\nwould lend to self-awareness.\n\n57:14.200 --> 57:16.200\nIf the hills had enough eyes, the hills\n\n57:16.200 --> 57:18.360\ncould see themselves for what they were.\n\n57:18.360 --> 57:19.440\nAnd that family can't.\n\n57:19.440 --> 57:21.040\nSo you are not upset about family farting.\n\n57:21.040 --> 57:27.560\nYou just that resonated for you of a close, cohesive family.\n\n57:27.560 --> 57:31.320\nI don't think I'm jealous of the cherry farted family.\n\n57:31.320 --> 57:33.520\nI don't like them.\n\n57:33.520 --> 57:36.160\nI think they're too close.\n\n57:36.160 --> 57:37.760\nI don't like that.\n\n57:37.760 --> 57:39.320\nWhere are they doing that together?\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:45.160\nWell, tell me more about them.\n\n57:45.160 --> 57:51.720\nWhat did they do with bananas?\n\n57:51.720 --> 57:54.000\nDid they shower together?\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.240\nThey were the Smotherman family.\n\n57:56.240 --> 57:57.280\nAnd I went to high school.\n\n57:57.280 --> 57:58.400\nThe Smotherman family?\n\n57:58.400 --> 58:00.160\nSmotherman.\n\n58:00.160 --> 58:04.680\nWhen I moved back from when I was on the play on Broadway\n\n58:04.680 --> 58:06.640\nwhen I was 10, 11, and then I came back to L.A.\n\n58:06.640 --> 58:06.880\nIt's 9, 11.\n\n58:06.880 --> 58:08.720\nFor the first time, 9, 11.\n\n58:08.720 --> 58:09.220\nOK.\n\n58:09.220 --> 58:09.720\nAll right.\n\n58:09.720 --> 58:10.520\nWoo-hoo!\n\n58:14.520 --> 58:15.000\nGood.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:15.520\nGood.\n\n58:15.520 --> 58:16.840\nThat was good.\n\n58:16.840 --> 58:20.320\nThat's a healthier response to 9, 11.\n\n58:20.320 --> 58:22.840\nMy first day back, I moved back to Whittier,\n\n58:22.840 --> 58:25.520\nwhich I'd never lived in, but my grandmother lived there.\n\n58:25.520 --> 58:27.520\nWhen I was a little kid, we had like a big house\n\n58:27.520 --> 58:28.520\nwith horses and stuff.\n\n58:28.520 --> 58:30.560\nAnd then gradually, my family lost all of our money.\n\n58:30.560 --> 58:32.520\nAnd then I went on the road with my mom.\n\n58:32.520 --> 58:34.440\nAnd then my dad was back home.\n\n58:34.440 --> 58:35.720\nI think they would have gotten divorced.\n\n58:35.720 --> 58:38.240\nWe came back, and we lived in this really small house\n\n58:38.240 --> 58:40.120\nwith this shitty car.\n\n58:40.120 --> 58:41.520\nI didn't know anybody would move in this kind of.\n\n58:41.520 --> 58:43.240\nIt's not a great neighborhood.\n\n58:43.240 --> 58:45.960\nIt wasn't like living in a horrible Detroit\n\n58:45.960 --> 58:49.200\nor some terrible gunfire going off all night long.\n\n58:49.200 --> 58:52.600\nBut it was like I lived in a really nice, hilly, beautiful\n\n58:52.600 --> 58:53.240\nchildhood.\n\n58:53.240 --> 58:55.520\nNow I didn't know anybody.\n\n58:55.520 --> 58:57.800\nAnd I remember laying on my parents' bed\n\n58:57.800 --> 58:59.040\nin this new little house.\n\n58:59.040 --> 59:01.600\nAnd all I could hear was a plane going overhead.\n\n59:01.600 --> 59:04.280\nAnd when you fly into L.A.X., if you're coming back into L.A.\n\n59:04.280 --> 59:06.040\nand when you hear the flaps go down,\n\n59:06.040 --> 59:08.080\nif you look at the window, you can see my high school.\n\n59:08.080 --> 59:09.880\nThat's the sound of, you can hear it from the ground.\n\n59:09.880 --> 59:13.240\nThat whew of the planes decelerating.\n\n59:13.240 --> 59:16.680\nAnd I started crying, because it was the only noise I heard.\n\n59:16.680 --> 59:18.720\nAnd I just lived in New York for about a year,\n\n59:18.720 --> 59:21.360\nwhere it's just all this input and action and stuff.\n\n59:21.360 --> 59:22.680\nSo I was really depressed.\n\n59:22.680 --> 59:24.280\nAnd this kid went by on a skateboard.\n\n59:24.280 --> 59:25.240\nAnd that was Sam Smotherman.\n\n59:25.240 --> 59:26.400\nAnd he lived just down the block.\n\n59:26.400 --> 59:28.640\nAnd their family was so cool.\n\n59:28.640 --> 59:30.800\nAnd their dad, they were all really Christian,\n\n59:30.800 --> 59:33.880\nbut the most adorable, wonderful version of that.\n\n59:33.880 --> 59:35.400\nAnd if everybody were like that, you\n\n59:35.400 --> 59:39.080\nwouldn't have any negative attachments to that.\n\n59:39.080 --> 59:40.160\nThey would sit around.\n\n59:40.160 --> 59:42.600\nSam got really sick as a kid, like some disease.\n\n59:42.600 --> 59:44.560\nAnd then he got really wounded in a car accident.\n\n59:44.560 --> 59:47.480\nAnd all this, they went through a lot of family crises.\n\n59:47.480 --> 59:49.200\nAnd they would sit down as a unit.\n\n59:49.200 --> 59:50.400\nAnd they would just talk it out.\n\n59:50.400 --> 59:53.120\nAnd they would, like, if it came down to it,\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:54.480\nthe father would just say, well, you know,\n\n59:54.480 --> 59:56.240\nit says in the book of James or whatever.\n\n59:56.240 --> 59:58.960\nAnd they were not like in a pedantic or pedagogical\n\n59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.800\nor a preachery way.\n\n01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.240\nI just sat there watching it.\n\n01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.280\nAnd it was just like, this is marvelous.\n\n01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.160\nAnd then the cherries would come to the table.\n\n01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.840\nWell, I hung out there so often.\n\n01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.520\nI still have dreams where I'm knocking on Sam's motherman's\n\n01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.240\ndoor from when I was 13 or 12.\n\n01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.200\nBut that kitchen, and that one day, I hung out there so much,\n\n01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.520\nthere was a bowl of cherries out there.\n\n01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.600\nAnd I took one, and they all started snickering.\n\n01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.320\nAnd I was like, what's the joke?\n\n01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.160\nAnd they're like, it makes the smotherman's part.\n\n01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.560\nIt makes the smotherman's part.\n\n01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.160\nNow do you like them?\n\n01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.040\nYeah, the smotherman's are fine now.\n\n01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.640\nI was pictured on more like white trash,\n\n01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.120\nlike they drank antifreeze.\n\n01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:45.760\nAnd one of them like huffed himself to death in the basement.\n\n01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.960\nBut he was still kind of half alive in the hospital.\n\n01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.920\nAnd they would like in order to make their cars go faster,\n\n01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.440\nthey would spit into the air scoop.\n\n01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.120\nSpencer, are you OK?\n\n01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.720\nHow did they reach the air scoop from there?\n\n01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.200\nThey climb out into the hood.\n\n01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.840\nThis is assuming someone else is driving.\n\n01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.680\nYeah, of course.\n\n01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.800\nAnd you're trying to catch somebody\n\n01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.400\nto keep them from taking all the petrol or the.\n\n01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.320\nIs that actually a thing?\n\n01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.480\nAre there car people here?\n\n01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.040\nDid we know that that works, spitting fuel\n\n01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.280\ninto the air scoop, you think?\n\n01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:22.760\nWait, what?\n\n01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.400\nDo we know that that actually works, like Mad Max?\n\n01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.960\nAnybody here?\n\n01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.280\nWe're not a car crowd.\n\n01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:27.800\nYeah.\n\n01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.040\nI mean, what are you even asking?\n\n01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.480\nAnd Mad Max, when they go out in the thing\n\n01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.640\nand they're spitting the second fuel out of a hose,\n\n01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.840\nand they're spitting it into the intake valves\n\n01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.560\non the hoods of the car, and the car gets super boosted\n\n01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.480\nand goes really fast.\n\n01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.240\nI'm not.\n\n01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:42.960\nAnybody?\n\n01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.760\nI'm sure that works perfectly.\n\n01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.440\nIt's not.\n\n01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.760\nThat doesn't work?\n\n01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.200\nNo, it would flood the engine.\n\n01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.040\nIt would flood the engine.\n\n01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.520\nWhat if it was like crazy Mad Max cars, though?\n\n01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.120\nOK.\n\n01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.200\nI mean, you mean it would flood the engine eventually.\n\n01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.000\nDamn.\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.040\nLike, that's why they didn't design the cars to just\n\n01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.800\nhave a guy spitting tape to the front of the car,\n\n01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.080\nbecause that would have been impractical.\n\n01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.200\nBut they're like, this is life or death.\n\n01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.520\nThey could have just invented a little hose\n\n01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.600\nwhen he's like a little squirt model,\n\n01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.160\nlike a just like fire.\n\n01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.120\nBut then they'd overuse it.\n\n01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.160\nYou know, those guys are nuts.\n\n01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.200\nThose little, they're anemic guys covered in tumors.\n\n01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.480\nThey're spray painting their war boys.\n\n01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.080\nWar boys.\n\n01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.960\nThose guys are crazy.\n\n01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.640\nThey have no impulse control.\n\n01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.480\nYou can't give them a hose and say,\n\n01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.000\nonly do this when you really need it.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.440\nYour whole society is founded on their feral ferocity.\n\n01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.000\nYou can't then just ask them to do something in moderation.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:42.760\nHow dare you?\n\n01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.400\nSo after like 70 years in the making,\n\n01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.880\nlike we finally close the deal, we're going to actually start\n\n01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.880\nshooting Harmon Quest.\n\n01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.880\nWoo-hoo!\n\n01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880\nWoo-hoo!\n\n01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.240\nAre we going to do new characters, same characters?\n\n01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.640\nI think we're going to kind of restart from the ground up.\n\n01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.480\nYeah, I think it'll basically be the same.\n\n01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.720\nMaybe a few tweaks here or there.\n\n01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.400\nBecause it's actually going to be a fancier version of it\n\n01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.880\nthan we originally planned, because people got excited about it.\n\n01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.840\nNow we're going to tape 10 episodes,\n\n01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.280\nand it's going to be on some tiny or experimental,\n\n01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.480\nI don't know how much I'm allowed to say and not allowed to say,\n\n01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:34.880\nbut it'll be out on some platform that you'll be able to find or something.\n\n01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.760\nIt may or may not play in Canada.\n\n01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.600\nI have no idea how that shit's going to work, but it's not Yahoo.\n\n01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.440\nIt's something else.\n\n01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.000\nBut we're going to do 10 episodes, so certainly they'll exist.\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:48.840\nThat's so awesome.\n\n01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.360\nI can't wait.\n\n01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.240\nAnd we'll have tapings and stuff, and we'll\n\n01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.760\nmake sure you guys know where to go.\n\n01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.000\nThat'll be in September, so you can come and watch us.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nWe'll get the old celebrity guests to come and play with us,\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.440\nand then we're going to animate.\n\n01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.480\nHave you picked your dream team yet?\n\n01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.160\nThat's probably too soon to talk about that.\n\n01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.400\nI think it's just going to do five episodes with Vince Vaughn,\n\n01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.520\nand then three with Colin Farrell.\n\n01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.480\nDid you notice that you know our little dog Nigel?\n\n01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.080\nDo you think he looks like Colin Farrell?\n\n01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.640\nHe looks a lot like Colin Farrell.\n\n01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.320\nHe does.\n\n01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.320\nI don't know if Aaron's like Instagrammed it yet,\n\n01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.720\nlike with a split screen, but he looks.\n\n01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.800\nI think I see where you're going.\n\n01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.320\nYeah, I can imagine that.\n\n01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.080\nYeah, all right.\n\n01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.840\nWell, I like Nigel more than Colin Farrell, though.\n\n01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.760\nI think the show's been like a five, five and a half out of 20.\n\n01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.880\nI call it a solid five and a half.\n\n01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880\nSolid five?\n\n01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.080\nThat's no good.\n\n01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.160\nWhat do we got to do to make it memorable and extreme?\n\n01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160\nExtreme?\n\n01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.000\nWell, maybe not.\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.960\nI mean, not like racist extreme.\n\n01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.000\nI got two words.\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.600\nButt chug him.\n\n01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.640\nWe could be the first podcast of Butt Chug,\n\n01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.360\ntwo live stream of Pina Colada Butt Chug.\n\n01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.840\nSomebody did come up and was like, I'll butt chug,\n\n01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.640\nand then they died.\n\n01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.200\nAnd that was just it.\n\n01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.520\nEverything in your whole life was leading up to that.\n\n01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.880\nCan we generate some sort of waiver\n\n01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.200\nthat they signed their life away?\n\n01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.200\nIt still wouldn't matter.\n\n01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.800\nIt'd still be the podcast that killed a guy\n\n01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.160\nby pouring Jack Daniels in his butt.\n\n01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.640\nOr girl.\n\n01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.120\nWhy don't we start off with butt chugging something\n\n01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.800\nnutritive, like just a big, like, we'll\n\n01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.720\nfill a bottle of Jack Daniels with, like, pediolite,\n\n01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.240\nor something like that that won't kill you.\n\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.200\nThere's still butt chugging, right?\n\n01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.440\nWhat if we brought up a guy stood him on his hands,\n\n01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.560\npoured pediolite down his butt, and he became, like,\n\n01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.240\na senator, or, like, an astronaut or something.\n\n01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.160\nLike, he became, like, we found out\n\n01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.360\nthat that's what you have to do.\n\n01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.360\nI think there's only one way to find out.\n\n01:05:59.360 --> 01:05:59.840\nWho here?\n\n01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.680\nI mean, there's people that volunteered to go to Mars\n\n01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.400\nand never come back.\n\n01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.840\nI think somebody is willing to take that chance.\n\n01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.120\nI mean, we'd need a funnel.\n\n01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.760\nWe'd need pediolite.\n\n01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.040\nYeah.\n\n01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.080\nOK, we can't afford that.\n\n01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.600\nYeah.\n\n01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.280\nWell, I mean, the overhead's too extreme.\n\n01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.000\nI don't know if you're seriously thinking about it right now.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.200\nI'm just, like, honestly, like,\n\n01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.840\nI like that you're getting logistical about this.\n\n01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.200\nIt means you're actually going to.\n\n01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.920\nI do know that there would be someone in the audience\n\n01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.680\nthat would be willing to.\n\n01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.560\nWould there be, like, should we build, like, a little stand?\n\n01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.680\nOr, like, like, like, like, gravity boots\n\n01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.760\nwith their heels clipped?\n\n01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.720\nYeah.\n\n01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.240\nWide in the mouth.\n\n01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.280\nWhat would you wear?\n\n01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:31.800\nThat's another thing.\n\n01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.720\nWhat do you have somebody wear?\n\n01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.880\nJust nothing?\n\n01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.440\nOr do you make them a little, like, a chaff, I guess, right?\n\n01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.760\nChaff, but, like, on the side, it's just sponsored\n\n01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.680\nby Nike and Reebok or something like that.\n\n01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.080\nWell, wouldn't it just be regular pants\n\n01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.880\nbut just a little hole for the butthole?\n\n01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.480\nThe women were unanimous on chaps on that one.\n\n01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.800\nThat's their, that's women's solution to everything.\n\n01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.680\nThey just like chaps.\n\n01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.880\nBut if we're, I mean, either, I would just, I would say,\n\n01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.200\nI need to understand the context.\n\n01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.120\nDo you mean if we're doing this six weeks from now,\n\n01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.680\nwhat kind of equipment would we have NASA build for us?\n\n01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.640\nDo we just hold the guys' legs in the air and do it, like,\n\n01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.360\nreally, like?\n\n01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.480\nI mean, that's what, that's what the cavemen did.\n\n01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.880\nI'm saying, we're putting, you spend a lot of money\n\n01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.240\non this, on this live streaming.\n\n01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.440\nI say we give, like, we put on a little David Copperfield\n\n01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.200\nkind of show, like, a white tiger comes out.\n\n01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.960\nDan, you already have an inversion table, right?\n\n01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.280\nSo, we just get, you turn them stomach down on it\n\n01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.960\nand then you invert them and you're ready to go.\n\n01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.120\nCan you start it off like the guy that gets chained\n\n01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.040\ninto the thing in Temple of Doom and he's like,\n\n01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:34.880\nI'm gonna show you back.\n\n01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.560\nYeah, that's exactly what the inversion table is.\n\n01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.400\nI'm gonna show you back.\n\n01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.240\nI'm gonna show you back.\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.080\nI'm gonna show you back.\n\n01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.240\nThat's what the inversion table is.\n\n01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.080\nAnd there's gravity boots.\n\n01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.560\nThey hook up with, yeah, we can just bring that in.\n\n01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.400\nOkay, and then.\n\n01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.680\nYou do something like muller ram\n\n01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.520\nwhen we do the whole thing.\n\n01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.360\nYeah, oh yeah.\n\n01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.440\nAnd then you have the PD light thing\n\n01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.560\nand it's like a beating heart or Shankara stone\n\n01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.400\nor whatever.\n\n01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.240\nYeah, that's great.\n\n01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.240\nYeah, never tell.\n\n01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.440\nAnd we gotta have, like, lawyers, like,\n\n01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.720\nclear the paperwork and stuff.\n\n01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.560\nThat's the easy part, Dan.\n\n01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.880\nThe person could, like, die or become a senator.\n\n01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.160\nSo, and the inversion table can be dedicated to that\n\n01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.320\nbecause I'm going to the chiropractor\n\n01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.440\nthree times a week now.\n\n01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.520\nThat was the only last thing that's new for me.\n\n01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.160\nSo that thing's just going to waste.\n\n01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.600\nYeah, I don't, yeah.\n\n01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.920\nMy back's all fucked up, Jeff.\n\n01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.760\nOkay.\n\n01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.280\nAre you in pain currently, like, as we speak?\n\n01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.160\nI'm all right right now, right at the moment.\n\n01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.000\nBut if I sit for more than 20 minutes\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.040\nand then I get up, it's like, ow.\n\n01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.320\nSitting's the new smoking, I gotta say.\n\n01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.960\nSitting's the new smoking, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.040\nBut as the guy is, like, adjusting my back,\n\n01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.600\nI think I'm having like a Kundalini awakening or something.\n\n01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.200\nLike, I think my, he was talking to all this,\n\n01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.240\nyou know, chiropractors are like,\n\n01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.520\nthat's my chiropractor.\n\n01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.280\nSee, you know, they're kind of knuckleheads.\n\n01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.000\nThey're not real doctors and they always have to like,\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.840\nthey kind of have to like, they feel compelled\n\n01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.720\nto like add extra stuff to the chiropractic stuff\n\n01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:54.720\nbecause it makes them feel more than a backcracker.\n\n01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.440\nLike, you know, they have to be like,\n\n01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.200\nalso, you know, this helps cure the cold\n\n01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.520\nand you should bring your baby in.\n\n01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.760\nAnd it's like, nah, come on, quit being a crazy person.\n\n01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.840\nLike, just crack my back.\n\n01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.320\nBut so I'm going to the one of these guys\n\n01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.240\nbut now I'm like, at this point,\n\n01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.000\nthe only thing I can do from here is back surgery,\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.920\nwhich I don't want to do.\n\n01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.680\nSo I'm just, for the next year,\n\n01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.600\nI'm just going to commit to whatever this guy says\n\n01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.960\nand he's like, don't sit for more than a half hour at a time.\n\n01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.200\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.320\nAnd he's like, he's got a little jackhammer device\n\n01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.120\nthat he's using to hammer my vertebrae\n\n01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.920\nand I'm going in there three times a week.\n\n01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.960\nBut then I'll be like, walking around my house\n\n01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.280\nand then I'll start crying for no reason.\n\n01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.720\nSo I think maybe some of the stuff he's like saying\n\n01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.160\nis like, not total bullshit.\n\n01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.640\nI thought it was because it's like,\n\n01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.520\nso you know, like a chiropractor, you go in and they go,\n\n01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.080\nthey go, where does it hurt?\n\n01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.520\nAnd you go, right here.\n\n01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.000\nAnd they go, okay, look at the chart.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.560\nThis is, I don't know why I say this happened to me\n\n01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.480\nseveral times, but this is what the guy did recently.\n\n01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.560\nThis is exactly what happened.\n\n01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.120\nLike Monday I go in, where does it hurt?\n\n01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:00.960\nRight here.\n\n01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.760\nSo he holds up this cartoon of a back\n\n01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.320\nand then there's like next to each vertebrae,\n\n01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.760\nthere's like this list of shit.\n\n01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.040\nAnd they're kind of like horoscopes.\n\n01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.320\nIt's like, it says like L one vertebrae.\n\n01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.920\nYou're outgoing, but a little withdrawn.\n\n01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.400\nYou know, except instead of that,\n\n01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.480\nit says like organ function, kidney function,\n\n01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.080\nkidney with a little bit of organ.\n\n01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.880\nYou know, and it's like kind of like not that scientific.\n\n01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.760\nBut so, so he's like, look at this.\n\n01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.760\nIt says like, yeah, it says erectile dysfunction,\n\n01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.920\nbowel, do you have any problems with your bowels?\n\n01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.240\nAnd I said, well, I mean, I don't,\n\n01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.760\nI don't like taking shits.\n\n01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.080\nI mean, I don't look forward to them.\n\n01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.000\nThey don't, they're not like,\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.480\nI don't like high five myself after I shit.\n\n01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.480\nIt's not really a problem with your bowel function though.\n\n01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.320\nRight.\n\n01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.560\nAnd he goes, uh-huh.\n\n01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.160\nAnd then I go, and, and hey,\n\n01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.760\nwho doesn't want more hard ons?\n\n01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.160\nAnd he goes, mm-hmm.\n\n01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.800\nSo, so, so anyways, and then crack my back.\n\n01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.640\nOkay.\n\n01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.280\nSo then the next time I go in, he goes like,\n\n01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.960\nso I put together a full report\n\n01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.480\nand he's like showing me all this stuff.\n\n01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.320\nAnd then he's going,\n\n01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.040\nso remember those bowel problems\n\n01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.000\nand erectile dysfunctions that you talked about?\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.240\nWell, guess what vertebrae that correlates to?\n\n01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.320\nAnd look where your pain is.\n\n01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.920\nI'm like, dude, I told you all that, what?\n\n01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.000\nYou can't.\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.840\nCorn ball.\n\n01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.680\nThe mentalist.\n\n01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.520\nYeah, it's like a carnival trick or something.\n\n01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.960\nBut I don't think it's intentional.\n\n01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.600\nHe's not, he's not, he's just, he's just not a doctor.\n\n01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.040\nLike he, like he, I took off my shirt and he's like,\n\n01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.680\nah, you have open sores all over your back.\n\n01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.920\nI'm like, it's acne.\n\n01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.120\nLike I have acne on my back.\n\n01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.480\nHe's like, yeah, but they're, that's not acne.\n\n01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.400\nI'm like, yeah, it is.\n\n01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.400\nIt's gross acne.\n\n01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.320\nLike, like, have you ever had acne in your back?\n\n01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.160\nNo.\n\n01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.560\nWell, quit bullying me.\n\n01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.480\nLike, I don't have, I don't have open sores on my back.\n\n01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.160\nHe's like, oh, are you, did you scratch?\n\n01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.520\nI was like, yeah, look at my back.\n\n01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.560\nIt's covered in fucking Ron Jeremy hair.\n\n01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.600\nLike, yes, I'm scratching my back.\n\n01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.200\nOh, you're, but then he was talking about like,\n\n01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.280\nyeah, and there's like, I think that,\n\n01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.680\nI think that, you know, that sarcoidosis thing\n\n01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.200\nyou told me about, you know, that and those open sores\n\n01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.440\nand stuff, and I'm like, what does sarcoidosis have to do\n\n01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.640\nwith open, what do you, stop calling them open sores.\n\n01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.480\nThey're zits.\n\n01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.600\nLike you're making me feel really bad.\n\n01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.520\nAnd he's like, he's like, well, you know,\n\n01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.520\nbut you know, there's sores, you know,\n\n01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.840\nand

he wants me to not die next.\n\n01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:55.400\nSo, and he thinks that it's as simple as telling me not to,\n\n01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.560\nwhich it wouldn't be.\n\n01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.680\nLike, I'm not going to take a poll before I die.\n\n01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.760\nWho doesn't want me to die?\n\n01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.440\nOkay, got it.\n\n01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.560\nJust checking.\n\n01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.480\nLike, I thought everyone wanted me to die.\n\n01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.320\nBut like, but also like, it's like, I can't tell,\n\n01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.680\nare you saying I'm fat?\n\n01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.880\nAre you saying I should work out?\n\n01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:17.920\nOr are you saying like, you're worried about me mentally?\n\n01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.040\nBut in either case, can't you just,\n\n01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.920\ncan't you just be nice to me?\n\n01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.040\nWhy do you have to, that makes me,\n\n01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.520\ndoesn't it, wouldn't that make you feel bad\n\n01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.000\nif people were like, hey man, you okay?\n\n01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.080\nYou'd be like, well, what's wrong with me?\n\n01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.480\nWhy are you looking at me like that?\n\n01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.320\nYou know?\n\n01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.160\nI get it.\n\n01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.000\nI get it.\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:35.840\nIt's weird.\n\n01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.320\nDoes he never, does he not reach out like personally\n\n01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:41.880\nand like have, but also, I mean,\n\n01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.720\nI don't know what it with the impulses there,\n\n01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.680\nbut to come and throw my arms around you\n\n01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.680\nand hug you and tell you I love you,\n\n01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.200\nwould make you very uncomfortable,\n\n01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.880\nwhich might make people less inclined\n\n01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.200\nto come at you in that direct way.\n\n01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.280\nAnd maybe you have to start making heart gifs and stuff.\n\n01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.960\nMaybe, I mean, there's probably\n\n01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.880\na happy medium somewhere in between.\n\n01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.160\nDid you know the correct pronunciation is jiff?\n\n01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:06.840\nYeah.\n\n01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.160\nI don't know, okay.\n\n01:22:08.160 -->

01:22:17.600\nwhen people say that's not my forte,\n\n01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.120\nit's supposed to be fort?\n\n01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:19.960\nYeah.\n\n01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.040\nDid you know it's not chomping at the bit?\n\n01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.000\nIt's supposed to be chomping at the bit?\n\n01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.680\nHa ha ha ha!\n\n01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:28.520\nOh!\n\n01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.960\nNo, he...\n\n01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.320\nBut here's the thing.\n\n01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.360\nHe just took that guy's concept and reiterated it.\n\n01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.880\nIt's not original or daring, really.\n\n01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.920\nYou're saying he recycled the heckle from behind him?\n\n01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:45.000\nYes, I mean, essentially.\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:45.840\nOkay.\n\n01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.800\nYou didn't hear it.\n\n01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.160\nI didn't really take it as a slam.\n\n01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.000\nI thought it was funny.\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.600\nI thought he was like, man, this shit's getting exciting.\n\n01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.000\nWait.\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.640\nThis isn't still boring news, is it?\n\n01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.440\nI think he knew it would be funny to say\n\n01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.200\nthis is still boring, because, yeah,\n\n01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.040\nwe really went down the road.\n\n01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.920\nBecause the last guy demonstrated it worked.\n\n01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.000\nYeah, and I'm not a hypocrite.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.800\nI'm not gonna stand up here and shit the bed,\n\n01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.040\nand then get

and talk about it.\n\n01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.640\nDoes anybody feel strongly enough?\n\n01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.640\nIs that Dave Kline?\n\n01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.560\nOh, we should have added

01:25:39.080\nBut that's the truth of it.\n\n01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.520\nAnd I've seen it happen too often,\n\n01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.880\nand when you said your boy sends you the thing with the jiff,\n\n01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.600\nand then he says something really prescient,\n\n01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.840\nlike maybe they couldn't address you really clearly.\n\n01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.560\nWe've talked about this on the show.\n\n01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.560\nI'll cut it right to this.\n\n01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.120\nWhy are we all here?\n\n01:25:53.120 -->

we're not sure,\n\n01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.280\nand the show isn't ripping it on 700 levels that\n\n01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.720\nwe're used to it ripping on?\n\n01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.760\nLike when they were at fucking San Diego.\n\n01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.320\nWhen they were ripping it, squatchy.\n\n01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.800\nWhen they were ripping it on 700 different levels.\n\n01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.840\nAnd we have a down night.\n\n01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.520\nWe're like, wait, what's going on tonight?\n\n01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.040\nIt's that there's 200

01:27:58.720\nNo, no, really.\n\n01:27:58.720 --> 01:27:59.600\nAnd I love you all.\n\n01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.640\nThat's right, me and Jeanne.\n\n01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.000\nAnd then I'm going to break his little neck.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:04.680\nI love everyone.\n\n01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.560\nAnd there's a strange thing, even like looking at it,\n\n01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.640\nand like you don't see that there's\n\n01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.360\nlike some interesting paper, whatever.\n\n01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.440\nThere's a crew here that's so beautiful\n\n01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.960\nand is like so inspiring that on like the LOL shows\n\n01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.720\nthat we call them or like whatever.\n\n01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.680\nYo, you know what, man?\n\n01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.360\nThose are my favorite ones because it's,\n\n01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.240\nI'll quote Tarantino.\n\n01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.960\nHe says, there's a genre of movie called a hangout movie.\n\n01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.840\nI just saw on Magic Mike XXL, everybody see it.\n\n01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.920\nLike instantly.\n\n01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.360\nIt was like an ultimate mandate with my bro friend.\n\n01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.160\nAnd God, I loved it.\n\n01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:39.960\nBut this podcast is on the level of like Rio Grande,\n\n01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.280\nMagic Mike XXL.\n\n01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.240\nAnd Land Before Time.\n\n01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.720\nAnd it's like the hangout thing that like the why we come here\n\n01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.200\nand even on the LOL shows, even when\n\n01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.000\nyou're in a hypoglycemic pseudo coma\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.920\nand you're popping on that gorgeous thing\n\n01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.040\nlike you are from that beautiful woman you married\n\n01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.440\nand swindled into loving you forever.\n\n01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.920\nWe're here because we love you.\n\n01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.880\nAnd maybe I'm just here to just say,\n\n01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.840\nfucking never give up.\n\n01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.760\nFucking never stop doing this.\n\n01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.200\nAnd my name is Dave fucking Klein.\n\n01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.200\nI'm dropping the mic.\n\n01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.200\nDave Kline.\n\n01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.680\nLet's bring out DeMorge Brown.\n\n01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.680\nDeMorge, are you here?\n\n01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:29.760\nYou know, Dave, what I love about you are the things\n\n01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.480\nare manifold.\n\n01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.120\nBut I love that you know how to make an entrance\n\n01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.840\nand how to make an exit.\n\n01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.920\nBecause that's always a valuable currency.\n\n01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.200\nYeah, any equity that was withdrawn or deposited at all\n\n01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.520\nin the end, none of it matters.\n\n01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.200\nBecause he just evaporates.\n\n01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.640\nLike a scot-miss.\n\n01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.800\nHe's actually the little train that\n\n01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.320\ncomes through Mr. Rogers' living room.\n\n01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:57.640\nHe's like a winger's speech personified.\n\n01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:02.440\nI kind of feel like I'm a visual thinker.\n\n01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:07.560\nLike my image of him, the image of him\n\n01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.680\nis the little fire extinguisher inside the glass\n\n01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.080\nthat says break in case of emergency.\n\n01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.960\nAnd then on the fire extinguisher, it says, yep.\n\n01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.880\nHe's a very positive guy.\n\n01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.200\nYeah, well, I was actually thinking\n\n01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.720\nthat it was kind of a disservice to him\n\n01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.200\nthat it was a low energy show.\n\n01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.600\nAnd then he would come up.\n\n01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:34.200\nBecause it might have been better to have somebody just\n\n01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.640\ncome up and go like, I'm going to get a divorce.\n\n01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.040\nAnd we'd be like, why?\n\n01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.480\nAnd she's like, because of 9-11.\n\n01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.640\nAnd then we'd be like, holy shit, she started crying.\n\n01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.440\nAnd I don't know why I made it a woman.\n\n01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.280\nSo it could be emotional.\n\n01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.760\nAnd then we would have won a castee.\n\n01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.040\nThe prestigious podcast award?\n\n01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.920\nWhich is what?\n\n01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.520\nIt's a podcasting award.\n\n01:30:59.520 --> 01:30:59.920\nAh, gotcha.\n\n01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:01.480\nI made it up.\n\n01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.760\nThere we go.\n\n01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.160\nWhat's up, DeMorge?\n\n01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.200\nYou know, same old table.\n\n01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.680\nI can't follow that.\n\n01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.040\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.080\nI feel like femurs.\n\n01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:16.920\nDamn, there's a full dose of this.\n\n01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.920\nRrrrrrr.\n\n01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.920\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.080\nThat's a Fuji to scale five.\n\n01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.680\nHere's my pitch, Dan.\n\n01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.760\nBefore we say don't do cheat day on Sundays\n\n01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.720\nbecause you're overly fed or whatever and sluggish,\n\n01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.200\nwhy don't we try different, like all Indian food?\n\n01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.640\nAll Indian food, you're going to do.\n\n01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.640\nWell, I was going to say maybe I could double my Adderall\n\n01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.880\ndosage on Sundays.\n\n01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.080\nRob Schrab's going to double his GIF dosage on you.\n\n01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:51.820\nWell.\n\n01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.200\nWhat's left in the tank?\n\n01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.360\nYou got to try that, DeMorge.\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.320\nOh, jeez, then.\n\n01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.720\nOh, god.\n\n01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.360\nDon't look at it.\n\n01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.360\nJust try it.\n\n01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:08.120\nOh, do you want to try something?\n\n01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.520\nSpencer, did you try?\n\n01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.480\nOh, no, no.\n\n01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:13.240\nSpencer's not a real alcohol guy.\n\n01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.600\nNo, it makes me sick.\n\n01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.800\nI get my joints start to ache.\n\n01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.320\nDeMorge, butt-chug it.\n\n01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.520\nButt-chug it.\n\n01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.920\nCareful, there's a spill on here.\n\n01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.600\nOh, wow.\n\n01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:26.680\nAll right.\n\n01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.040\nThe suspense is killing us.\n\n01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:40.000\nIt's the coldest thing in a room.\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.600\nIt's delicious.\n\n01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.040\nThat's great.\n\n01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:41.920\nThat's fantastic.\n\n01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.400\nYou're not a video game guy, are you?\n\n01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:49.600\nIf it's sports video games and fighters and stuff.\n\n01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.240\nPeople are disappointed.\n\n01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.680\nIt just kept my damn mouth shut.\n\n01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.200\nIf my mind was sharper, I could come up\n\n01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:58.440\nwith a great analogy for sports video games is like.\n\n01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.640\nAnd in the punchline, I have to throw it to a room, though.\n\n01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.800\nWell, let's say it was a video game guy, what were you?\n\n01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.520\nOh, I don't know.\n\n01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.560\nI was going to ask if you've been playing Witcher 3.\n\n01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.080\nOh, yes.\n\n01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.800\nAbsolutely, I have been.\n\n01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.760\nI just got through the thorn level.\n\n01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.800\nNo, I haven't.\n\n01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.280\nThey're tricky.\n\n01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.800\nAre there any female gamers here that\n\n01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.120\ndon't play sports video games?\n\n01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.400\nAre you playing Witcher 3?\n\n01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.440\nAre they going to hear who do?\n\n01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.600\nAny women playing Witcher 3 in the audience, young ladies?\n\n01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.560\nWhat game are you playing?\n\n01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.400\nBeyond Yourself.\n\n01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.000\nOh, I played that.\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.800\nThat's kind of fun.\n\n01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.320\nThat's the one with Juno and Ellen Page.\n\n01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.840\nEllen Page is in a game.\n\n01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.000\nJuno.\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.920\nYeah, did you play?\n\n01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.640\nWell, do you want to come up?\n\n01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.720\nAnd so we can talk to you about video games for a second.\n\n01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.120\nAnd then you can play Shadowrun with us.\n\n01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.600\nWoo-hoo!\n\n01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:09.080\nOh, it's so bright up here.\n\n01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.200\nYeah, and it's hot.\n\n01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.360\nLike, it'll make you feel in a second you'll be sweating.\n\n01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.280\nAnd you'll be like, what kind of horrible monster am I?\n\n01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:15.680\nYou're not.\n\n01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.760\nYou're just a French fry.\n\n01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.600\nIt's not you.\n\n01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.160\nIt's the lights and it's the heat.\n\n01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.080\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:22.560\nEmily.\n\n01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.120\nHello, Emily.\n\n01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.480\nHello.\n\n01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.480\nWelcome to Harmonton.\n\n01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.560\nYeah.\n\n01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:26.120\nYeah.\n\n01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.920\nOK, so did you play Heavy Rain?\n\n01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:29.400\nOh.\n\n01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.640\nHard Rain or Heavy Rain?\n\n01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.080\nHeavy Rain.\n\n01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:31.440\nHeavy Rain.\n\n01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.040\nYes, with the origami killer.\n\n01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.840\nBut that compared to those are the same people that made it?\n\n01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:36.440\nI agree.\n\n01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.360\nNo, Heavy Rain was much better.\n\n01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.000\nLike, they figured out how to, they\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.960\nmade loops and bounds with that video game style.\n\n01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:44.520\nYes.\n\n01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.160\nAnd I think that's why Quantic Dream is so good,\n\n01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.760\nis because it's like an interactive movie.\n\n01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.920\nAnd but Beyond Two Souls is like,\n\n01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.720\nI was not expecting it to be so scary.\n\n01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.200\nYeah.\n\n01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.120\nLike, holy shit.\n\n01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.040\nIt's basically, if nobody knows what this game is about,\n\n01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.920\nit's basically Ellen Page is recreated as Jody.\n\n01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:08.040\nAnd she is this character who has this entity that\n\n01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.600\nis attached to her.\n\n01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.640\nAnd basically, it's the whole time,\n\n01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.640\nlike all these people are trying to control her\n\n01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.280\nand make her do all these things that she doesn't want to do\n\n01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:16.960\nand blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.440\nAnyways, it ends up being like.\n\n01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.120\nNo, I don't have a company.\n\n01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:19.600\nYeah.\n\n01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.200\nThis is what you're going to spoil it.\n\n01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.560\nThe French, this French company made this, right?\n\n01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.400\nIs this the game?\n\n01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.160\nFrench company?\n\n01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.400\nI hung out with her for a while and she was in town\n\n01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.600\nand she was making a game.\n\n01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.400\nShe was in France, though, I think.\n\n01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.880\nYeah, it's Willem Dafoe was in it.\n\n01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.920\nYeah, that's what she was making for all that time.\n\n01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.800\nOK.\n\n01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.600\nAnd it's weird how Willem Dafoe looks as a CG person.\n\n01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.720\nYeah, I thought he looked like a cartoon in person.\n\n01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.680\nAnd then it was like, wow, he actually\n\n01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.520\nlooks better as a cartoon.\n\n01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:50.040\nYeah, it's a weird effect, yeah.\n\n01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:50.440\nYeah.\n\n01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.480\nAnyways, yeah.\n\n01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.120\nYeah, video games are getting more immersive, Jeff.\n\n01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:00.480\nCan you guys handle that with your soccer?\n\n01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.480\nSoccer?\n\n01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.960\nYeah, you got to be careful with the margin.\n\n01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.080\nIf you and I share our love of anything right now, Dan,\n\n01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:08.560\nI did.\n\n01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.640\nI did an hour and a half podcasts before this.\n\n01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.680\nDan, you're in a very vulnerable, jealous, kind\n\n01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.120\nof emotionally precarious place right now.\n\n01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.040\nBecause I've been, for the last 30 minutes,\n\n01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.760\nI've been holding in farts.\n\n01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.400\nAnd now, as of my last sip of pina colada,\n\n01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.800\nnow I'm also holding down vomit.\n\n01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:27.480\nNo, it's so funny, because I actually.\n\n01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.320\nSo I'm like a Chinese finger trap?\n\n01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.160\nNo.\n\n01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.400\nLook at me.\n\n01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.920\nI'm the opposite of a Chinese.\n\n01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:40.040\nI'm like a water balloon that's untied on two ends.\n\n01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.440\nNo.\n\n01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.240\nI'm like a toothpaste tube in a vice grip with a cap on each end?\n\n01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.040\nYou're like a pipe bomb.\n\n01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.400\nNo, without the bit on the end to hold the stuff in.\n\n01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.320\nIt's just all going to go out both sides.\n\n01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.520\nI'm like, maybe we should get Ryan's styles in here.\n\n01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.440\nYou should probably don't up.\n\n01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.080\nI'm sure he could come up with.\n\n01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:06.480\nOh, he would.\n\n01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.680\nHe'd come up with 20.\n\n01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.080\nYou know why?\n\n01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.120\nBecause he's a gifted.\n\n01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.520\nHe wouldn't let the show fucking sink\n\n01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.640\nlike this fucking going down right now.\n\n01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.480\nBecause he's a hard worker, and he gets up here,\n\n01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.360\nand if he has to skin and knee or chip a tooth to make these\n\n01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.040\npeople laugh, he fucking does it.\n\n01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.160\nWe should bring cherries out.\n\n01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.720\nNo, the smothermans aren't here.\n\n01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.160\nTo us, they're just regular fruits.\n\n01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.520\nTo the smothermans, they're treasure trod.\n\n01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.440\nI hate cherries.\n\n01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.320\nYou hate cherries?\n\n01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.760\nI do not like cherries.\n\n01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.560\nYou do hate them.\n\n01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.760\nI don't like the fear when I have a cherry.\n\n01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.280\nI'm like, fuck, I'm going to break a tooth this time,\n\n01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.880\nbecause you bite it, and then the seed is so hard.\n\n01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.600\nI hate pits.\n\n01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.120\nI hate it.\n\n01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.960\nI love olives, like marinated olives.\n\n01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.640\nAnd then sometimes you get them.\n\n01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.240\nAnd then you're like, this better not have a pit in it.\n\n01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.160\nI swear to God.\n\n01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.920\nAnd then it has a pit in it.\n\n01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.160\nAnd you're like, what am I supposed to do with this fucking\n\n01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.080\nrock in my mouth?\n\n01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:07.240\nAnd then you spit it into a napkin like an animal.\n\n01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.120\nWhat are you supposed to do?\n\n01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.440\nWhy do they have those things?\n\n01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.920\nI swallow cherry pits.\n\n01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.640\nWhat?\n\n01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:15.160\nAnd then I swallow them all.\n\n01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.040\nAnd then when I poop them, there's people in New\n\n01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.160\nYork that make very expensive coffee out of them.\n\n01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.640\nYou can't even afford it, it's so expensive.\n\n01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.040\nIt's called Jeff Davis Cherry Poop Coffee.\n\n01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.480\nI swallow.\n\n01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.120\nI don't know if this is an urban legend or not,\n\n01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:35.480\nbut they say that.\n\n01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.480\nI think this is an urban legend, because it started from\n\n01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.040\nurban living in the 50s.\n\n01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.760\nAnd then it became a big thing in the 70s.\n\n01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.600\nThe idea that kids were eating cherry pits,\n\n01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.160\nand they were pooping, and that in the sewers, there's a\n\n01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.560\nwhole population of little George Washington's.\n\n01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.800\nNot cherry trees.\n\n01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.200\nWell, there are cherry trees, yeah, obviously, little\n\n01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:00.680\ncherry trees.\n\n01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.200\nBut then there's these little tiny George Washington's.\n\n01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.840\nYeah, chopping down the, yeah.\n\n01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.480\nAre they also telling lies?\n\n01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.400\nWell, that's the ironic thing, is that I think the whole\n\n01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.840\nstory is a lie, but in the story, no, none of them are\n\n01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.840\nlying about chopping down the trees.\n\n01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.920\nWhy in this day and age where our political culture is so\n\n01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.520\nbereft of intellect and leadership, aren't we\n\n01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.800\ncultivating this sewer full of George Washington's?\n\n01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.200\nWell, because he wasn't really a leader.\n\n01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:34.680\nHe was a warrior, and he's the leader our nation needed at\n\n01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.480\nthat time in history.\n\n01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.120\nBut the truth is, if you brought George Washington out\n\n01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.680\nnow, first of all, he'd be tiny and covered in poop and\n\n01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.240\nteeth or wood, weird.\n\n01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.960\nSecond of all, he's just, by all accounts, he was sort of a,\n\n01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.400\nyou know, he was sort of a dumb dumb and just sort of\n\n01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.400\ninspiring because he was courageous and a good general.\n\n01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.600\nCould he do any worse?\n\n01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.000\nCould he do any worse?\n\n01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.800\nCould we do any worse, you're asking.\n\n01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.120\nOh, no, no, he couldn't, yeah.\n\n01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.640\nHe might be like legit, like better than.\n\n01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.960\nOh, yeah, I'm sure anybody from, if you went back in time\n\n01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.920\nand pulled anybody from back yonder, I'm sure there would be\n\n01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.440\na couple scandalous remarks that would be like, no, that's\n\n01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.520\nnow called anti-semitism, like they would be like, oh, no,\n\n01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:23.400\nI'm sorry, I'm from 1921, but as far as their attitude about\n\n01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.280\nthe role of government, I bet we'd be like, holy shit,\n\n01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.680\nthis guy's like amazing.\n\n01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.560\nWay back then, the office of the presidency was not a\n\n01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.800\nreally prestigious job.\n\n01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.520\nYeah, so they'd be like, you know, they'd have that\n\n01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:41.720\nRoss Perot, Bernie Sanders, charm, no, no, they'd be the\n\n01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.040\nthird party candidate that wasn't allowed in the debates\n\n01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.880\nbecause they'd be like, I don't understand why we're talking\n\n01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:46.880\nabout this.\n\n01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.640\nAnd we'd be like, boo.\n\n01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.960\nDid you just fart right now?\n\n01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.040\nNo, that was my mouth.\n\n01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:54.680\nAre you asking, was he covering a fart?\n\n01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.040\nWas that a substitute?\n\n01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.920\nI sometimes do that, like I'll make a laugh really loud\n\n01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.120\nand then I'll fart at the same time.\n\n01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:04.640\nAnd it's like, I didn't know.\n\n01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.040\nTruth be told, Emily's been farting ever since she sat\n\n01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.440\ndown up here, you guys.\n\n01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.760\nIt's a maelstrom.\n\n01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.120\nWell, we don't have much time.\n\n01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.160\nI wanted to actually, I actually might have been\n\n01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.800\nfruitful to ask Emily as an ambassador of a female gamer,\n\n01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.760\nlike what, if a game's really cool, but there's like, as\n\n01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.080\nwith Witcher 3, where it's just like, wow, this is really\n\n01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.040\ncool, but it's like this fantasy game, and it's just like\n\n01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.560\nall of these sorceresses with the cleavage and the kind of\n\n01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.040\nlike very like mythic gender roles, like does that throw\n\n01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.240\nthe modern, I guess the answer is, you know, speak for all\n\n01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.440\nwomen, like some women are probably totally thrown by\n\n01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:40.960\nthat.\n\n01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.040\nI feel like, yes, some women are thrown by that, and that's\n\n01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.720\nfine and whatever, but I'm just like, I love tits.\n\n01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.560\nLike I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.\n\n01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.040\nLike I feel like it's a very bold stance.\n\n01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:56.080\nNo, it should be a thing that women, we're giving boobs.\n\n01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.240\nWe should be happy and, you know what I mean?\n\n01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.440\nLike that's something we should use to our, you know, and\n\n01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.360\nmakes cosplaying fun and like all that kind of thing.\n\n01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.520\nI think that, you know, if we're gonna get all offended\n\n01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.120\nabout it, I don't know, that's just me.\n\n01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.200\nI like, I've always wanted to love and love my boobs, and\n\n01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.360\nI think every woman should.\n\n01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.000\nWell, I think the counterpoint to that would be, yeah.\n\n01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.400\nIf a woman's gonna be offended by it, then that's okay.\n\n01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.440\nYou can be entitled to your own opinion, but me, I'm like,\n\n01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.320\ngirl, rock the titties, love them.\n\n01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.720\nWell, I don't think the offense is coming from the\n\n01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.640\nexposure of them as if it's like people who are like\n\n01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.480\npuritanical.\n\n01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.840\nI think it's, I think it's, it's that there's a fine line,\n\n01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:32.240\nbut it's like people that are like, well, there's an\n\n01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.800\nobjectification happening when they're on display.\n\n01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.360\nSo it's, if it reduces the person's role to a\n\n01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.560\ndehumanized role, so that they're simply a tray of dessert.\n\n01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.320\nAnd if they're not also saying equals MC squared.\n\n01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.000\nBut I'm mansplaining.\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:49.840\nYeah.\n\n01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.520\nAnd, and, and white knighting and, and, and Chubbocker.\n\n01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.760\nNo, that's actually very, it's, it's in tearing me.\n\n01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:56.480\nWimbledon and.\n\n01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:02.440\nI just want to, I just thought come back as it's like,\n\n01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.400\nit's kind of a straw dog argument that it's like,\n\n01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.720\nlike everybody likes boobs.\n\n01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.840\nI mean, nobody, I don't think any women are like,\n\n01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.920\nget these things off me.\n\n01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:10.160\nThey're terrible.\n\n01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.360\nAnd no one, they're terrible, evil things.\n\n01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.200\nAnd we should never see them.\n\n01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.960\nI think, I think any, any, any person who's, who's coming\n\n01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.520\ndown on the other side is, is more, it's, it's, it's\n\n01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.880\ncoming more of the angle of like, uh, uh, what, uh,\n\n01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.360\nthoughts that we're putting in people's head about the\n\n01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.640\nrole of. No, no, no, no.\n\n01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.000\nI totally get where you're coming from.\n\n01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.720\nAnd, and I do think that there is something that is\n\n01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:33.520\nendearing about making a woman be sexy without\n\n01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.400\nshowing the tits.\n\n01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.240\nOf course.\n\n01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.920\nLike her, her, her ability to be a badass.\n\n01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.480\nLike, you know, uh, what's an example of someone.\n\n01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:43.760\nThere's, see, whenever I think of games, there's just\n\n01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.960\nlike so many girls with big boobs.\n\n01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.800\nHarriet Tubman.\n\n01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.640\nLike everywhere.\n\n01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:52.000\nShe just farted again.\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.320\nUh, yeah, well, yeah.\n\n01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.200\nNobody, nobody's, nobody's disagreeing up here.\n\n01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.480\nI mean, I, I, I think that, but it's not my job to\n\n01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.320\nagree or disagree.\n\n01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.640\nI just sit there and fart and play the game.\n\n01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.840\nThe girl, she does have that big of boobs and I think\n\n01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.680\nshe's hot.\n\n01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.200\nWell, that's the thing that I always find myself\n\n01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.760\nwondering as a guy when I, when I, I always wonder on\n\n01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.360\nbehalf of men, I always wonder why do we even have to\n\n01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.440\nlike, cause I always say like, well, I used to say\n\n01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.720\nbefore things got so, you know, I'm like, I used to\n\n01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.920\njoke to women, everything that you need to know about\n\n01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.560\nmen you can learn from a men's prison.\n\n01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:38.560\nLike the, like the, like, like, how is, how is that a\n\n01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.600\ncontroversial statement at all?\n\n01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.680\nLike when you, when you lock men in a building together\n\n01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.880\nand take away all of their wealth and all of their\n\n01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.680\nhegemony over society.\n\n01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.120\nThey, it turns out that we don't have a lot of like\n\n01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:59.720\nsuper nuanced needs in order to get an erection or\n\n01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:04.640\nbecome violent or like we are drones and we turn on\n\n01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.280\neach other and ourselves as quickly as we turn on\n\n01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.360\nanyone we're allowed to on the outside.\n\n01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.240\nSo you take away the necktie and you take away the\n\n01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.480\nbank and you take away the skyscraper and you take\n\n01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.280\naway the history and the momentum and you see what,\n\n01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:23.720\nwhat, what, how little men really need to objectify.\n\n01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.920\nLike, like, like we, you could, you could give a\n\n01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.960\nfemale voice to a banana and the, the men, the men\n\n01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.440\nwould be like, I want to fuck that banana because\n\n01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.880\nthey'll say it eventually about their cellmate.\n\n01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.040\nLike, like, like they, they, because we're just like\n\n01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.400\nbiologically we're just kind of drones.\n\n01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.600\nLike we're not, so, so I always, I always wonder in\n\n01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:46.720\nmy own head I'm like, well, you know, if the cleavage\n\n01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.080\nweren't there, like if that's really the issue, like,\n\n01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.760\nor, but it, but it, but it isn't, you know, it's like,\n\n01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.720\nif Mary Curie was like a character in a video game,\n\n01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:59.520\nyou know, it's, it's, you, even more so the whole rule\n\n01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.920\n34 thing would start applying, I don't know if I'm\n\n01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.800\nmaking sense, but I was like, when there's like a\n\n01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:10.280\nstrumpet on parade and it's like, she's all dolled up\n\n01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.800\nand she's like the cleavage is boo-boo-boo-boom-booming\n\n01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.680\nand the thing and it's just like, she just looks like\n\n01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.040\nshe's designed for these thoughts to be thought\n\n01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.880\nabout her.\n\n01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.720\nI just, I'm always amused by the idea that it's like-\n\n01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:23.520\nIs that the argument that that overwhelmingly that's\n\n01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:26.320\nalmost all of what you see in, in, in character\n\n01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.440\nor female, like game and character?\n\n01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.240\nYeah, I guess my thought about it is it's like-\n\n01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.760\nThey're starting to go away from it though.\n\n01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.720\nThey're starting to make it where like girls aren't,\n\n01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.560\nyou know, like the Hunger Games and things like that.\n\n01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.600\nLike girls becoming badasses and yeah, they're hot,\n\n01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.640\nbut like, you know, it's, it's more like, no, she's smart\n\n01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.920\nand she's got, she acts like she, she's the one saving\n\n01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.960\nthe dude cause the dude's a dumbass.\n\n01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:47.800\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:48.640\nRight.\n\n01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.560\nLike it's, it's not all about, oh, and she's got a huge rack\n\n01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.960\nand she's like, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo the whole time.\n\n01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.440\nRight, and actually because those thoughts are like a lot,\n\n01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.440\nthat like I draw an analogy between clothing and,\n\n01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.000\nbetween clothing and gender roles and language and,\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.960\nand race issues.\n\n01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.680\nAnd like the language is certainly a reflection.\n\n01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:14.880\nLike if all the video games are of women like looking like\n\n01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.840\nthey're ready to go and they're, and they're,\n\n01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:20.080\nand they're not saying anything of value on top of that.\n\n01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.840\nLike they have no agency and all that stuff.\n\n01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.200\nThey're, that's the, the, the clothing is a reflection,\n\n01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:30.280\nbut just as you can make genuine racist people use\n\n01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:33.440\nthe most polite language in the world and they might be\n\n01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:36.440\neven more racist than ever, you could totally like\n\n01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:39.840\ncount on men to like be like, the clothing, the clothing is\n\n01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:44.000\nnot, it's a, it's the, it's the snot of the cold.\n\n01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.320\nLike you can wipe it all you want.\n\n01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:49.160\nLike, like the virus is more dealt with when you,\n\n01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.400\nwhen you're talking about characters that have agency\n\n01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.280\nand the bec, bec, bec del test and stuff like that.\n\n01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:55.960\nLike that stuff that actually gets to the heart of the matter\n\n01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.440\nlike is the character.\n\n01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:01.760\nAre people watching characters that happen to share\n\n01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.800\nphysical characteristics with themselves?\n\n01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:06.720\nAre they getting trained to think that they hold a certain\n\n01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.440\nrole in a dynamic?\n\n01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:12.280\nLike, like the, the, the clothing is like so secondary\n\n01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:15.400\nto all of that and whatever, there's no point to it.\n\n01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:17.000\nI'm not proposing that anything change.\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.080\nI just kind of amused by the idea that men would, men would,\n\n01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.360\nmen would hump a concrete wall.\n\n01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.200\nLike, like, like, like we would not, we, we just don't,\n\n01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.480\nit's not, it's not like, that's not where the war is being\n\n01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.320\nfought, you know?\n\n01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:34.120\nYeah, there's a lot of armpit fucking imprisoned.\n\n01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.440\nWait, for real?\n\n01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.920\nA lot of consensual armpit sex.\n\n01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.120\nThat's just good old fashioned human ingenuity.\n\n01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.080\nYeah, that's, that's an invasive.\n\n01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.400\nThe inventions I made when I was 12 years old.\n\n01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.800\nWe've, we've talked about that.\n\n01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.400\nBoy, boy, oh boy.\n\n01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.080\nSo glad those days are over.\n\n01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.720\nNow you can use like real inventions, like buy online,\n\n01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:01.640\nthings like that.\n\n01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:02.480\nYeah.\n\n01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.440\nI kind of want to make sure my back stays somewhat out of whack\n\n01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:09.160\nbecause I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a.\n\n01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.360\nNow that I'm regaining my memory and bursting into tears,\n\n01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.760\nI'm worried that I might, that you might adjust something\n\n01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.120\nand then I'll be like, oh, I.\n\n01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.520\nYeah.\n\n01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.960\nWow.\n\n01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.080\nI almost said cliffhanger at the end of the show man.\n\n01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.440\nI just remember being 12 years old and like not being able\n\n01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.560\nto get through an episode of inspector gadget.\n\n01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:35.240\nLike, like, like, just let alone more commending,\n\n01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.320\nlet alone anything.\n\n01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:41.120\nLike I just like, like everything was like on fire.\n\n01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:44.720\nAnd it was like not a place to get a lot of work done.\n\n01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.440\nGirls were like that too.\n\n01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.480\nLike, well, I was at least, I was like crazy.\n\n01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.360\nLike my whole family was like that.\n\n01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.680\nLike as soon as we went into puberty, I was like,\n\n01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.680\nwhat is happening?\n\n01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.760\nLike, oh my gosh, boobs and craziness and all that stuff.\n\n01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.440\nBut it's just girls don't, yeah.\n\n01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.800\nLike you said, girls don't like to talk about it as much.\n\n01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.320\nBut we definitely are the same way.\n\n01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.080\nI know a lot of women that I've had friends of mine\n\n01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.040\nthat I grew up with and friends I met later that like,\n\n01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.040\nstarted masturbating a hundred years before I did.\n\n01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:10.880\nLike, before I did.\n\n01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:11.720\nYeah.\n\n01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:12.560\nI did like second grade.\n\n01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.400\nBut is it, is it?\n\n01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:14.240\nI know.\n\n01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.080\nInsane, right?\n\n01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:16.120\nSecond grade?\n\n01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:16.960\nYeah, dude.\n\n01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:18.480\nIt happens earlier for girls.\n\n01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.320\nYeah.\n\n01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.880\nIt's weird because we mature faster.\n\n01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.560\nThere's also a lot of accidental masturbating.\n\n01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.600\nYou don't need like.\n\n01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.240\nNo, okay.\n\n01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.080\nSecond grade.\n\n01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.480\nFirst thing is accidental masturbation.\n\n01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.840\nLet me tell you, Jeff.\n\n01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.520\nI'm gonna fuck your armpit so hard\n\n01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.280\nthat I'm just doing it right now.\n\n01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.480\nAlso, girls do that.\n\n01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:42.680\nUh-oh, here we go.\n\n01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.080\nHey, we started talking about this.\n\n01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.760\nThis next sentence brought to you by a pina colada.\n\n01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:55.880\nWell, I'm, is that a politically correct thing to say\n\n01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.800\nthat girls do this or do that, but I've had a lot of girlfriends.\n\n01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:01.600\nI've had a lot of conversations like,\n\n01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.560\nand I've noticed that girls have a lot of early memories\n\n01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.720\nof they practice with each other.\n\n01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.040\nThey go, they.\n\n01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:10.920\nLike, like, like, not, not.\n\n01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.600\nI see you guys.\n\n01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.160\nSorry, Emily Fartin again.\n\n01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:23.760\nThey play, they practice kissing and stuff.\n\n01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.600\nOh yeah, no, no, no.\n\n01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.440\nYes, of course.\n\n01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.760\nGuys, don't do that much.\n\n01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:29.200\nBut I famously told that story of me being like,\n\n01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.880\nlike eight years old next to my buddy Ramstack,\n\n01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.040\nlike humping a couch pillow,\n\n01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.200\nwe're high-fiving each other.\n\n01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.200\nWe're like, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're.\n\n01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.040\nYeah, girls do it too.\n\n01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.000\nYeah, like pillow, like this feels good.\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.560\nDave Ramstack.\n\n01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.400\nThat's the great, that's the,\n\n01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.840\nif you're gonna make out with your first guy,\n\n01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:43.680\nthat's the guy.\n\n01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.520\nIt was Dan Ramstack.\n\n01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.520\nI don't know what his lawyer's name is, but.\n\n01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:51.520\nBut he's probably watching, but uh.\n\n01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.240\nThat's why I used the wrong name.\n\n01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.880\nHe was a, he was a, he was a great dry-humper.\n\n01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.440\nHe really let that pillow have it.\n\n01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.480\nYeah, but I mean, yeah, I mean,\n\n01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.600\nobviously the most important thing that,\n\n01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.160\nthat people are always so shocked to learn is that,\n\n01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.960\nif everybody's a little snowflake\n\n01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:12.520\nand it's all so incredibly different.\n\n01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.920\nIt makes us, it makes us comfortable to make observations.\n\n01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:18.320\nLike, girls do this and guys do this by age 11\n\n01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.800\nand by age 13 and girls do that.\n\n01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.360\nIt was like, but like every conversation you have,\n\n01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.880\nit's like a second grade.\n\n01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:26.880\nAnd then someone goes, but Jeff lost his virginity\n\n01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.160\nat like 32 or whatever, like, you're a late bloomer.\n\n01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.000\n24.\n\n01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:32.840\nAnd uh.\n\n01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.200\nI was too, I was 22.\n\n01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:37.200\nYeah, I mean, I, like, that's, but that's the,\n\n01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:40.720\nlike the masturbating and the coming and the.\n\n01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.560\nAs we're talking about this, I never really thought about\n\n01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.320\nthis, like, you know, like when I came to your house\n\n01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.120\nand you had that consolidated folder of redheads\n\n01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.200\nfrom Playboy magazines to save space.\n\n01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.000\nAnd I was like, wow, you sure like your redheads,\n\n01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.720\nyou're like, oh shit, I never really thought about that.\n\n01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.680\nAnd they go, oh my, yes, I do.\n\n01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:57.120\nI'm looking back, like, I don't know about like\n\n01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.640\nfor young girls, certainly not in second grade.\n\n01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.320\nLike for little boys, we find the Sears catalog\n\n01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:04.120\nor the, or the anything that has a picture of a woman,\n\n01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:07.800\nlike with any measure of clothing on a nun or whatever,\n\n01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.160\nor a face, like it's a visual thing for me anyway.\n\n01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.640\nAnd I remember the most potent visual image that I,\n\n01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.520\nand I saved this picture.\n\n01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:21.280\nIt was Nadia Komenich, the gymnast, like the gold medalist.\n\n01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.120\nAnd I told her, was she Russian?\n\n01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.640\nIt was Nadia Komenich from Romania.\n\n01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.800\nRomania.\n\n01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:25.880\nI don't know why she out of the house.\n\n01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.520\nAnd it's only like, what the fuck do you always,\n\n01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:32.880\nagain with this fucking shit.\n\n01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.200\nI don't even know, fuck you, you guys, the fucking.\n\n01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.560\nBut she had all of her clothes on, but she had short hair.\n\n01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:42.600\nAnd like, so like then later on it's like,\n\n01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.360\nlike Sid Cherise, Audrey Hepburnia Farrow,\n\n01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.520\nlike I don't know what it was,\n\n01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:50.160\nbut it was like my first moments of having like sexual\n\n01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.160\nvisual like turn-ons was always like thin,\n\n01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:58.280\nnever va-va-vom, never like super curvy,\n\n01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:01.720\nlike a little wafy like girls with short hair.\n\n01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.440\nAnd like, why is that?\n\n01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.280\nIt's so strange.\n\n01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.200\nWell, why do men like long hair traditionally?\n\n01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.680\nI know you've all heard the joke,\n\n01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:12.640\nor maybe not joke explanation of like, yeah,\n\n01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:15.480\nit's like cavemen like want to handle or something.\n\n01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.520\nIt's like, looks like you're more controllable.\n\n01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.560\nBut I think it's like, I think it's like,\n\n01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:24.160\nthe way cats like, like focus on things that move,\n\n01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.800\nlike, like, like, like, like women wear earrings and stuff,\n\n01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.200\nlike, like, like think shit's moving around.\n\n01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:34.000\nLike, I think, I think, I think, I think over time,\n\n01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000\nmaybe that's like a thing that triggers men to like,\n\n01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:36.840\nbe fascinated.\n\n01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.440\nLike they're like, just dogs or cats,\n\n01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:41.960\nthey're just like, you're shaking your head.\n\n01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.680\nI don't think that's what, I think it's just,\n\n01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:46.560\neverything that's attractive is a show of youth and health.\n\n01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.640\nAnd so when you get older, your hair's thinner.\n\n01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:49.520\nAh, got it.\n\n01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.760\nAnd it makes to have long hair.\n\n01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.360\nYou have to be like, young and fit.\n\n01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.200\nIf you can't hear in the back,\n\n01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.080\nbecause I'm sure that's absolutely true,\n\n01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:56.920\nbecause I just realized,\n\n01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.200\nbecause we talked about makeup on the show,\n\n01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.960\nand it's like makeup is like,\n\n01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.520\nshe said, she said, because it's young,\n\n01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:04.720\nit's young girls have longer hair,\n\n01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.720\nand as women get older,\n\n01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:09.560\ntheir hair gets more brittle and unmanageable,\n\n01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.360\nand they tend to go with the shorter stuff.\n\n01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.600\nAnd so, yeah, everything is sort of,\n\n01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.040\nall of our standards for female beauty\n\n01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.600\nare somehow rooted in puberty,\n\n01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.560\nare somehow rooted, like rouge is just flushed cheeks,\n\n01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.840\nand lipstick is flushed lips,\n\n01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.040\nand it's all basically you spend your life\n\n01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:28.680\nchasing this image of a,\n\n01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.240\nof the most inappropriate thing in the world,\n\n01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:34.320\nwhich is a cussing biological female specimen.\n\n01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.440\nAll right, Spencer, I'm gonna ask you the impossible right now.\n\n01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:37.280\nOkay.\n\n01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:38.440\nBut I know that you're up to the task,\n\n01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.320\nbecause you are a genius and a showman.\n\n01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.480\nOkay.\n\n01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:46.040\nLet's do the world's only one liner\n\n01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.400\nshadow run, where we set it up.\n\n01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.520\nWell, I don't wanna know but that,\n\n01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.520\nbut I was pretty content once we could have skipped shadow run.\n\n01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.360\nOh, yeah?\n\n01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:58.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.000\nOh, I figured once I got to be 10.05, I was like, oh.\n\n01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.520\nKind of pants, yeah.\n\n01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.360\nOkay.\n\n01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.200\nBut I was like, we're on a roll,\n\n01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.560\nwe're talking about icky stuff.\n\n01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:06.960\nAll right.\n\n01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.080\nIcky stuff.\n\n01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:09.400\nYeah.\n\n01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.560\nSex is icky.\n\n01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.000\nIt doesn't have to be, man.\n\n01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.760\nHow many ounces?\n\n01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:18.280\nDeMorge, what, how old were you when you,\n\n01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.120\nwhen you had your first experience with your,\n\n01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:24.680\nI was five and I was, I went to the school on the bus.\n\n01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:27.960\nSee, see, it's done, Charlie, it's done, that's weird.\n\n01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:30.200\nThere was a kid on a bus who was older,\n\n01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.280\nhe had just had, I went to this amazing school\n\n01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:36.400\nwhen I was a kid and his birth, for his birthday,\n\n01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.760\nI think he was 10 or 11, 12 maybe?\n\n01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.280\nThey had given him, his parents had given him\n\n01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.800\na subscription to Playboy for his birthday.\n\n01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.120\nSo this kid, so I had never seen this before\n\n01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.000\nand the kid had a thing, he wasn't bringing it\n\n01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.560\nfor show and tell, but it was just,\n\n01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.320\nhe had it and he was bringing it to the school\n\n01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:54.760\nand it was wrapped in paper and he took it out\n\n01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.040\nand he showed it to us and I was like,\n\n01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.400\nwhat the hell is that?\n\n01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.000\nAnd we just went through it and he explained\n\n01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.120\nthe whole concept to me and that's sort of what it was.\n\n01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.720\nAnd then later that week, I think,\n\n01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.280\nat dinner my parents asked me about school\n\n01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.440\nand then they asked me about my every day at dinner\n\n01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:13.080\nand they asked me, your birthday's coming up,\n\n01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:13.920\nwhat do you want?\n\n01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.400\nAnd I asked for a subscription to Playboy.\n\n01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:20.400\nAnd my parents is very measured fashion,\n\n01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.880\nwe're like, A, a what?\n\n01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.320\nAnd I said, there's a new Playboy\n\n01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.680\nand they said, do you even know what that is?\n\n01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.680\nAnd I went through it so clearly I knew.\n\n01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:33.880\nAnd they said, how did you,\n\n01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.480\nand so I told them the story, I just told you\n\n01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:39.640\nand they said, all right, well, we'll see what we can do.\n\n01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:43.440\nAnd then in my head, I think, I mean, just being my age now\n\n01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:45.720\nand imagining that them being their age at that time,\n\n01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.560\nthey, for whatever reason, had to wait until I left the room\n\n01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.760\nand just high five each other.\n\n01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:53.320\nAnd then they got kids all right.\n\n01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:55.600\nJust to save a couple, a little bit of money,\n\n01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.760\nthey gave you a subscription to Muff Diver.\n\n01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:02.760\nA sherry or a sherry, I don't know, some knockoff.\n\n01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:05.720\nThey're like, we can't afford that.\n\n01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:07.040\nMorgan Fairchild's on the cover every day.\n\n01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:09.280\nErin texted me because she must be watching\n\n01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.600\nas we're talking in this area.\n\n01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:13.400\nBecause remember the episode where we did Labyrinth\n\n01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.280\nand she was talking about Labyrinth, but we were,\n\n01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:18.840\nI mean, she's really like, that movie was like her,\n\n01:58:18.840 -->

01:58:46.440\nYou go to the nether and there's like,\n\n01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.560\nbut she, I mean, that was like,\n\n01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:52.640\nshe can remember the actual like moment of like,\n\n01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:54.280\noh my God, my body.\n\n01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:56.600\nAnd it does like literally happen overnight,\n\n01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.320\nlike literally overnight, like puberty happened.\n\n01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:01.720\nA friend of mine, Samantha, she was like 11 or 12\n\n01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:03.560\nwent to a Prince concert and she told me,\n\n01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:05.080\nshe was like, I was standing there watching Prince\n\n01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.920\non stage and she goes, and I had an orgasm.\n\n01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.960\nI wasn't touching myself, I just stood there\n\n01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:10.400\nand she's like, I didn't know what was happening,\n\n01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.280\nbut later on I would come to understand,\n\n01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:14.560\nit's like, what, that was the first time I came,\n\n01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.600\nbut just by standing there watching this dude.\n\n01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:18.520\nI definitely know I was watching work in Mindy.\n\n01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:19.600\nI was like, I was like,\n\n01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:24.120\nI was watching Pam Dabber and I was like,\n\n01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:26.440\nbut I was like, I think I could have been watching anything\n\n01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.240\nbecause it was really more about like,\n\n01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.560\nI was like laying, I would lay supine,\n\n01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.400\nis that what it's called?\n\n01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:32.240\nIt's on your stomach.\n\n01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.720\nAnd I was like laying after school alone\n\n01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.440\nin my mom's apartment and like,\n\n01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.760\nso I was just like watching work in Mindy\n\n01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.920\nand it was just going like this.\n\n01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:44.240\nAnd I was like, and then I was just like, kept doing it.\n\n01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:47.360\nAnd I was like, what the, oh, oh my God.\n\n01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:50.680\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,\n\n01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:51.520\nand nothing.\n\n01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.760\nGet your GIFs ready everybody,\n\n01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:54.800\nget those GIFs ready.\n\n01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:57.440\nAnd nothing, nothing, you know,\n\n01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:01.320\nI looked to see if anything had,\n\n02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.840\nbecause I was like, is that what I think that was?\n\n02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:06.200\nAnd nothing had happened,\n\n02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:11.200\nbut it felt like something that you would want to do forever.\n\n02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:16.560\nSo, and then from that moment until around 39,\n\n02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.480\nI pretty much was just like dedicated\n\n02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:25.520\nto making that feeling happen over and over again.\n\n02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:27.560\nCause I remember like that very week,\n\n02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.960\nor like like within a few days it was like,\n\n02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.920\nlike I'm just going to keep doing this over and over again.\n\n02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:33.120\nAnd I remember being really excited\n\n02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.720\nthat nothing, I'm getting really graphic,\n\n02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.920\nbut like, oh, let's stay safe and stop now.\n\n02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:43.600\nThe, I just, I remember being really stoked\n\n02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:45.960\nthat nothing was coming out,\n\n02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.000\nbecause I thought I was like cheating the system\n\n02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.360\nbecause I was like, I wasn't touching myself,\n\n02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:53.840\nwhich I already had like shame loaded into my mind about,\n\n02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:56.040\nlike that one day I was going to start touching myself\n\n02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:58.200\nand that that was, my mom would say like,\n\n02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.280\nit's going to be a natural thing.\n\n02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:02.000\nIt was like, I don't want to think about my mom\n\n02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.080\ngiving me permission to touch myself.\n\n02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.200\nAnd so I was like, I'm not, I didn't touch myself.\n\n02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.200\nI just humped a pillow and thought about Pam Dabber.\n\n02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.200\nAnd then I had this amazing feeling.\n\n02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:13.120\nI'm like, I'm the king of the world.\n\n02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.040\nLike, and I would just like run home from school\n\n02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:16.200\nas fast as I could.\n\n02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.360\nAll my friends would be like,\n\n02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.960\ndon't you want to stay and talk about LL Cool J?\n\n02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.960\nNo, I gotta go.\n\n02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:22.480\nI gotta go.\n\n02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:24.840\nMan, he's so dedicated to his schoolwork now.\n\n02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:27.000\nAnd I was just like, slam, lock the door.\n\n02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.560\nAnd I was like, and then slowly, but surely,\n\n02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:34.560\nI was just like starting with like one little drop coming out.\n\n02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.640\nI just remember like every, every successive like little\n\n02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:41.720\ntonight on a very special part.\n\n02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.800\nJust a tip.\n\n02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:46.240\nBut I'm telling you, for those 11 year olds listening,\n\n02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.480\nit's all downhill from there.\n\n02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:54.480\nJust keep doing that and like don't involve other people.\n\n02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:57.480\nWe have 8 billion too many.\n\n02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.480\nJust keep doing that.\n\n02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:05.480\nJust eat cookies and watch more communities.\n\n02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.480\nAll right.\n\n02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.480\nWell, we got to the bottom of some stuff, I think.\n\n02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.480\nTypically stuff that we've already gotten to the bottom of,\n\n02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.480\nI guess.\n\n02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.480\nBut it's worth going there again sometimes.\n\n02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.480\nI think it was a nice introspective.\n\n02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.480\nThere's no losers in it.\n\n02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:26.480\nWe got to meet Emily, who's fantastic.\n\n02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.480\nThank you.\n\n02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:32.480\nWe got a...\n\n02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:36.480\nWe got a good shot of Vitamin D from Dave Kline, man.\n\n02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.480\nHe's always been.\n\n02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:44.480\nBut you know, I've always had, it's a problem with me.\n\n02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.480\nIt's like, I always like, when I was a kid on the playground\n\n02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.480\nand people would pick up me, I would never cry.\n\n02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:51.480\nAnd then when the guy would come over and say,\n\n02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.480\nstop picking on him, I'd start bawling.\n\n02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:57.480\nBecause I feel so ashamed of myself for needing to be stuck up for.\n\n02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.480\nAnd so, when Dave came up and was like,\n\n02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.480\ncome on, Hulkamaniac, it's not that bad a show.\n\n02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:05.480\nI almost started crying.\n\n02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:08.480\nI was like, it's terrible, it's that bad a show.\n\n02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:11.480\nI said we end the show playing the Ty Braxton theme song\n\n02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.480\nwhile you body surf and fart all over the entire audience.\n\n02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.480\nBody surf and fart.\n\n02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:18.480\nBody surf and fart.\n\n02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.480\nDon't set me up for failure.\n\n02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.480\nYou know that my back is hamburger.\n\n02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.480\nBut that's...\n\n02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:26.480\nWould that be therapeutic to be rolled gently through human hands?\n\n02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:30.480\nYou've obviously never had actual back problems in your life.\n\n02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:34.480\nHow about some good old fashioned butt chugging?\n\n02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:36.480\nI mean...\n\n02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.480\nIt can't hurt, man.\n\n02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.480\nGreat weight in the show.\n\n02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:40.480\nWho's going to butt chug?\n\n02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:41.480\nYou.\n\n02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:42.480\nHow?\n\n02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.480\nHow is that possible?\n\n02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:47.480\nRight, that's too complicated.\n\n02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:49.480\nThat's what butt chugging really is.\n\n02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:50.480\nEveryone does that.\n\n02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:51.480\nI did that before the show.\n\n02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.480\nEveryone does that.\n\n02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:53.480\nI'm doing it right now.\n\n02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.480\nEmily's on her second tank time.\n\n02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.480\nI'm like, keep them coming.\n\n02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:02.480\nErin's like, end the show.\n\n02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.480\nYeah.\n\n02:04:04.480

everybody.\n\n02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.480\nPlease welcome her.\n\n02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:19.480\nI love you, Erin.\n\n02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:20.480\nHi, Erin.\n\n02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.480\nHi,

Davis.\n\n02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.480\nYour mayor.\n\n02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.480\nEverybody at one, go up and hug him and tell him you love him\n\n02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:35.480\nand make him all sad.\n\n02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.480\nDan Harmon.\n\n02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:52.480\nDoes it look a little sad, baby?\n\n02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.480\nEmily, go.\n\n02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:54.480\nGood, Hannah.\n\n02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.480\nGive that to her.\n\n02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:56.480\nOr maybe...\n\n02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.480\nDid you get any of that?\n\n02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:27.480\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[207556]}
