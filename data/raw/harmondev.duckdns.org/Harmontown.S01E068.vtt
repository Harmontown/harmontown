Hello, everybody. Welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, the Meltdown Theater

00:12.000 --> 00:17.200
Harmontown is now in session. Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmon

00:17.200 --> 00:38.760
Town. Fun times at Harmontown. I'm overcompensating. I'm a little exhausted. I'm bone sober and

00:38.760 --> 00:43.560
a little wiped out. We're back on the thick of it over at community and I'm very excited

00:43.560 --> 00:52.680
about the work we're doing. It's very thorough work. A lot of young writers being baptized

00:52.680 --> 00:58.320
by fire over there at Paramount right now. Where are you going, boss? I'll be right back.

00:58.320 --> 01:05.320
I'm going to get you some ice cream. We're working hard. We start shooting the first

01:05.320 --> 01:15.680
episode of the fifth season tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. And then at lunchtime, we table

01:15.680 --> 01:21.920
read the second episode which we're supposed to be finished with by now. That's why we're

01:21.920 --> 01:25.960
hard at work back at the Kiebler Tree. Do you have to go back to work right after the

01:25.960 --> 01:29.640
show? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're going back into Paramount or from home? I'm going to go

01:29.640 --> 01:34.640
back to Paramount, yeah. I'll probably sleep on my couch there in my little office. Chris

01:34.640 --> 01:38.160
McKenna's got it worse. He said he was up at four this morning. I didn't ask him why,

01:38.160 --> 01:42.200
but he's got to get some sleep or something. That's crazy. He's got a kid too. That's

01:42.200 --> 01:46.160
probably why. That's probably the four a.m. thing. I don't know. I didn't ask him. I

01:46.160 --> 01:50.240
had to run out the door. But anyways, I'm excited about what's going on over there and

01:50.240 --> 01:56.320
I'm just doing my best to make all you little rapscallions happy. But I am a little wiped

01:56.320 --> 02:02.120
out so I don't know what generates my entertainment on the nights when I'm really entertaining.

02:02.120 --> 02:13.240
Is it my boundless energy? Or liquor? Or fear or anxiety? I don't know. You could draw

02:13.240 --> 02:16.440
off the energy. I'm not just saying this in an ass kissy. You're the greatest audience

02:16.440 --> 02:20.120
in the world. But it's not a huge audience, but you've got twice the energy of a full

02:20.120 --> 02:30.040
house. It's good. It's really good. Yeah, I feel like I'm kind of betraying it. I feel

02:30.040 --> 02:40.400
like we should do something to earn their energy. Let's spin the Wheel of Strangers.

02:40.400 --> 02:50.640
There's no wheel for you listening. Who's in deep emotional pain in the audience? All

02:50.640 --> 02:59.840
right, a hand went up. There he is. It's Levi. Levi to the stage. I know this guy. Grab

02:59.840 --> 03:05.080
that, Mike. Hello, Levi. I feel like I owe it to the home listener to state that you

03:05.080 --> 03:12.720
are, you've long, blonde, kind of carry Elvis from Princess Bride Hair. You also have his

03:12.720 --> 03:17.880
mustache from Glory, which is nice. It's my three musketeers' mustache. It's very nice.

03:17.880 --> 03:24.440
You've got a nice wide-baneed corduroy maroon coat and your barefoot. Yes, this is fucking

03:24.440 --> 03:28.920
describing me. This is awesome. Yeah, barefoot to the show. Fuck shoes. Did you walk down

03:28.920 --> 03:35.360
Hollywood sidewalks? Yeah, actually, I washed my shoes before I came here out of courtesy.

03:35.360 --> 03:39.640
You washed your shoes? Oh, wait, fucking shoes. I'm really fucked up. I'm sorry. I washed

03:39.640 --> 03:43.160
my feet before I came here. I say, I think you washed your shoes and you left them in

03:43.160 --> 03:48.520
the dryer. They're still hanging back on the line. Hurry up and get back there. So, Levi,

03:48.520 --> 03:57.800
we met in Madison. And you were driven up there during the Harmontown Tour from Idaho?

03:57.800 --> 04:04.640
Same thing. I owe whatever. And where you live on the banks of the Mississippi? Yes.

04:04.640 --> 04:10.120
And your big, big old Dan Harmon fan? Yeah, I have my girlfriend, I think, for that, but

04:10.120 --> 04:15.840
you are... I'm not a fan, really. You're kind of... I've never had a hero, so I don't know

04:15.840 --> 04:22.120
how to put that in terms, but, like, whatever that word is in comparison to you. What do

04:22.120 --> 04:27.320
you find heroic? As a person, what do you find heroic about that? He's fucking getting

04:27.320 --> 04:31.760
up here and, like, this is scary shit, and I'm an actor, I do theater and stuff, but

04:31.760 --> 04:37.000
you guys are fucking freaking me out right now. But not only that, but he gets up here

04:37.000 --> 04:42.800
and he doesn't do a bit, he doesn't put on shtick, he's just Dan Harmon up here. And

04:42.800 --> 04:50.000
all of us love him for that, don't we? That's the fucking reason I came here. Can I sit

04:50.000 --> 04:58.600
down? I'm like... Yeah, yeah, please, sit down. Put your feet up. Apologies, Jeff. Can

04:58.600 --> 05:02.800
you show the crowd the bottom of your feet? I just got a glimpse of this. Holy, what in

05:02.800 --> 05:11.400
the Bangladesh? Yeah, jeez. Yeah, um, sooty. Yeah, that's your city, guys. Let's call

05:11.400 --> 05:17.160
your feet sooty. Were you cleaning a chimney before you came over here? Just riding in

05:17.160 --> 05:21.680
a car, Jeff. Alright. Well, that's what the bottom of shoes probably are like. And that's

05:21.680 --> 05:25.600
why I don't wear them. It's the same thing. Well, yeah, what about why not shoes? Well,

05:25.600 --> 05:29.840
besides not shoes, and actually it's just more comfortable for me. You guys are personally

05:29.840 --> 05:33.880
the weird ones. Every, all of you guys with shoes, I don't know how you can do it. Like,

05:33.880 --> 05:43.000
it's so there. Yeah, that's it. You fucking weirdos. You're all awful people. You shewers.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.440
But unlike, unlike something like if they all had pink bows on their heads, like shoes

05:47.440 --> 05:54.720
have this like deeply practical purpose. No, they, they shield the human foot from broken

05:54.720 --> 06:02.440
crack pipes and, and, and bees like like half dead bees on the beach. I did. In all honesty,

06:02.440 --> 06:06.200
actually, I said that don't wear shoes. I did wear it over a pile of dead cows just

06:06.200 --> 06:10.200
a couple of weeks ago. You wore you were you wear shoes when you have to walk over dead

06:10.200 --> 06:16.360
cows. Yeah, I'm not an idiot. Fucking shit growing in there. Can we can we learn a little

06:16.360 --> 06:21.920
bit more about walking on dead cows? What do you want to know? I want to know why you're

06:21.920 --> 06:28.400
walking on dead cows. What do you mean? What do I want to know? Did you have a hand in

06:28.400 --> 06:33.480
their death? Were they dead before you did? They wouldn't be in a pile like they are like

06:33.480 --> 06:39.840
that's inhumane. But as an iron in California, I can't technically tell you why I was walking

06:39.840 --> 06:46.080
on that dead pile. Besides the fact that it's a rich rich in nitrogen, and which is a good

06:46.080 --> 06:54.760
fertilizer for plants. Oh, for the podcast listeners, I was not winking. That was a

06:54.760 --> 07:02.600
twit. I don't know. Are you supposed to use entire dead cows for fertilizer? You can use

07:02.600 --> 07:09.320
live cows poop. I'm just making the best of a situation. I rent a property and I live

07:09.320 --> 07:14.720
on a farm, obviously. And the landlord is a terrible person. I really hope someone listens

07:14.720 --> 07:20.800
to this. My address, I'll tell you later. I love you too. I'm sorry. But my landlord

07:20.800 --> 07:27.040
just treats the cows poorly and then when they die, he says it's awful. It just piles

07:27.040 --> 07:33.040
them all on top of each other and then just lets them sit there. And then you go walking

07:33.040 --> 07:48.400
on them. You go out to harvest their nitrogen. This is the whole show now. We haven't scratched

07:48.400 --> 07:55.480
the surface, I believe. I have a lot of deep emotional pain. Are we allowed to scratch

07:55.480 --> 08:02.440
the surface? Can we talk about anything? You can talk about me every which way. I can

08:02.440 --> 08:06.360
take it. You're not bullying me. I'm an open bully. I just want to know what you're comfortable

08:06.360 --> 08:11.600
talking about. When we talked in Madison, at the end of our conversation, which I thought

08:11.600 --> 08:21.160
was nice, I wouldn't be shocking you to say you have weird mannerisms. That would be

08:21.160 --> 08:29.480
the truth. But then I would also, I would say that you, I'm more comfortable talking

08:29.480 --> 08:35.480
to you than lots of other people who you would assume were not. Like there's some kind of

08:35.480 --> 08:41.320
like... You're breaking my heart. In a good way. I don't know what that factor is, but

08:41.320 --> 08:46.520
it's like, I mean, you have yet to, I mean, you don't wear shoes. You've got the weird

08:46.520 --> 08:54.760
mustache. You've got a manic energy and you identified yourself as a transgender in Madison.

08:54.760 --> 09:01.680
You identify as a female, you said. But then sexually I wouldn't want to fucking do. Actually,

09:01.680 --> 09:07.920
a weird story about that. I had a friend of mine where a couple, I think a couple months

09:07.920 --> 09:14.200
ago and we had just done some hallucinogens and we were walking around. It was just me

09:14.200 --> 09:20.440
and him. This was a dude and this is a very lonely guy and like he used to have this girlfriend

09:20.440 --> 09:25.400
and only one girlfriend and he's been broken up and so he really needs companionship and

09:25.400 --> 09:32.320
there was one point during the night where he was like, do you use one fuck? And I like,

09:32.320 --> 09:41.160
we were sitting on a bench and I'm just like, no. I felt really, really bad because he told

09:41.160 --> 09:45.520
me that he had been getting mixed signals off me. Like I'm a very flamboyant, flirty

09:45.520 --> 09:52.160
person and I apparently had been doing that to him and he's like, I even made up a joke

09:52.160 --> 09:55.520
and I'm like, oh, you want me to go Jolly Roger you in the bushes?

09:55.520 --> 10:04.400
What's a Jolly Roger? That's what he asked. I want to know. Leave my show. I need to bend

10:04.400 --> 10:10.280
over. It's a podcast show, just have to tell me. We could describe it and their laughter

10:10.280 --> 10:17.640
would reinforce it. It's not like a Jolly Rancher. It's a lot bigger than that. More

10:17.640 --> 10:25.040
sucking involved. What is it? Come on. Well, Roger Ring is fucking and Jolly is a happy

10:25.040 --> 10:30.440
version of that I can't see. That's it? Jolly Roger Ring is fucking? You get a Jolly Roger

10:30.440 --> 10:33.520
ring, yeah. It's in your window, Dan, it can mean whatever.

10:33.520 --> 10:40.600
I thought it was a new thing or a secret thing or a specific thing. You take a 2x4 and a

10:40.600 --> 10:47.040
dead cow and you flip it. It's not a good joke because cows they lived and they died

10:47.040 --> 10:56.360
and they're sad now. I don't know where to begin. I don't know where to middle and I

10:56.360 --> 11:01.160
don't know where to end. My girlfriend doesn't know where to begin. You made a video that's

11:01.160 --> 11:06.160
online. Maybe you can tell people how to get it to it on YouTube. It's like a Harmontown

11:06.160 --> 11:14.240
fan video, which, again, on paper, if someone were to be afraid of someone, like this video

11:14.240 --> 11:22.840
has all the earmarks. And yet I don't fear you. But the facts on paper about this video,

11:22.840 --> 11:28.840
which are that you made it by yourself, you play me, Jeff, and Aaron, and yourself, and

11:28.840 --> 11:34.440
Spencer. And in the beginning of the video, realizing

11:34.440 --> 11:39.080
that Harmontown is canceled that week, you basically, not to put too fine a point on

11:39.080 --> 11:43.480
it, you take rope and other implements and you abduct each of us. I didn't abduct you

11:43.480 --> 11:50.120
and I didn't abduct Spencer. You came willing. I lured you with a bong and something else.

11:50.120 --> 11:56.600
And then it's you by yourself in this apartment playing all of us doing a Harmontown show

11:56.600 --> 12:02.040
for you yourself. Wearing different wigs and beards and things.

12:02.040 --> 12:07.200
But around behind you, it's like, I'm assuming this is not set dressing. This is where you

12:07.200 --> 12:13.440
actually live. There is just dead cows everywhere. Except for the corner pocket. I saw that

12:13.440 --> 12:17.000
and I was like, oh, that's next to Jeff and that's in between Aaron. That's got to be

12:17.000 --> 12:23.560
a weird joke there about putting pockets in things. Never mind. I haven't seen it. I'm

12:23.560 --> 12:30.400
very intrigued. On the walls behind him, there's writing on the walls. Maybe like, oh no, you're

12:30.400 --> 12:41.640
talking about my room. That is the crazy person's room. If I was set designing for a seer hand

12:41.640 --> 12:47.680
seer hand biopic, there's like swirls and then there's other writing. There's writing

12:47.680 --> 12:56.200
and drawing. What is written on the wall? Is it just random thoughts?

12:56.200 --> 13:02.160
Played community references, Doctor Who quotes, some shit I make up on my own. Actually, I

13:02.160 --> 13:05.280
really like it because I have to do it all the time by myself. I really like it when

13:05.280 --> 13:09.440
my friends come over. I have a big box of markers and I'm like, go ahead, write whatever the

13:09.440 --> 13:13.920
fuck you want to. As long as you don't write over anything. As long as you respect me.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.320
Lila, I have a question for you. You identify yourself as a woman, but you still have the

13:17.320 --> 13:26.000
male facial hair. Is that a conflict? That's acceptance. It goes back to the fucking thing.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.680
I really want to be able to have the womb on the inside of me and have kids. That's not

13:30.680 --> 13:36.080
the only reason to be a woman, but that's the reason why I wouldn't go into a surgery

13:36.080 --> 13:43.880
right now. You can't get that. You'd have to drink a magic potion for that to happen.

13:43.880 --> 13:53.400
Did I answer that question right? No. It was an answer to three other questions I had.

13:53.400 --> 13:59.640
Well, there's transgender where you just identify or you just express as another gender, and

13:59.640 --> 14:04.800
then there's transgender as a subset of that. People who go, okay, not only am I expressing

14:04.800 --> 14:10.360
as another gender, I'm going to take physical steps. You're saying, well, the brass ring

14:10.360 --> 14:14.040
is having a uterus, and that's not achievable through medical science, so why not have a

14:14.040 --> 14:22.200
mustache? Pretty narcissistic, but to the point. That's basically it. I want to be

14:22.200 --> 14:27.080
able to fuck whoever I want to and have all their kids and rule the world. But you have

14:27.080 --> 14:32.760
a girlfriend with which you have a technically, medically heterosexual relationship because

14:32.760 --> 14:38.440
medically you have a wiener. Do you have a sexual relationship with your girlfriend?

14:38.440 --> 14:48.040
And so when you guys do it, it's a wiener going into a wee wee. I like that. I hate

14:48.040 --> 14:57.600
to sound like a fifth grader, but so is that lesbian sex? Is that, I mean, is it? I don't

14:57.600 --> 15:08.640
know. Since I know that I can't have what I want and to try and force anything other

15:08.640 --> 15:13.960
than that as sort of childish, then it's like, you know, except what something gave you and

15:13.960 --> 15:17.240
like, live with it like I can't. What am I going to do about it?

15:17.240 --> 15:24.600
If I gave you a uterus right now with a magic wand, and I cannot, no matter how much you

15:24.600 --> 15:32.000
know, no begging. But if you had a uterus right now, would you continue to have a relationship

15:32.000 --> 15:37.680
with a woman and over? Actually, I would own it with her. It's so much

15:37.680 --> 15:41.800
love. Actually, it's yours and Erin's love. Like, listen to the podcast. It's just listening

15:41.800 --> 15:47.280
to us almost sometimes. Like, not only you guys fighting, but just you're like, you know,

15:47.280 --> 15:53.360
little jokes you play. Couples fight, people. Come on. But just you're like, you're little

15:53.360 --> 15:59.000
in-jokes with each other. And I was listening on the way here. You're talking about, Erin

15:59.000 --> 16:02.800
was listening to Game of Thrones, and you kept doing like this voice or whatever. Or

16:02.800 --> 16:06.600
no, not downtown Abbey. And she would like, she'd take off her headphones, she'd be like,

16:06.600 --> 16:10.800
what the fuck was that? Erin, nothing is happening. But shut up. You're all right.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.120
And then she'd put her headphones back on and just like continue and you'd still like,

16:14.120 --> 16:16.520
fuck with her. Oh yeah, I was doing like closed mouth British

16:16.520 --> 16:20.640
accents. I couldn't remember what. I just listened to it an hour ago. I can't fucking

16:20.640 --> 16:25.520
remember. All right. Well, so I said who's in deep emotional

16:25.520 --> 16:31.000
pain and you raised your hand just by default. But do you have any actual short term things

16:31.000 --> 16:35.520
that we can help you with? I want to live out here, man. This place

16:35.520 --> 16:41.320
is like, I don't want to go back to the hellhole that I, and it's not a hellhole. I really,

16:41.320 --> 16:46.920
the town's okay. It's hard. I don't want to enable anything, but I will say you will fit

16:46.920 --> 16:52.680
in more here than. Honestly, quite possibly. I was like, God,

16:52.680 --> 16:56.720
the people out here are just fucking awesome. Like I want to live and breathe out here.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.320
And people don't, you know, you know, like, like, you know, people out here, they come

16:59.320 --> 17:03.440
out here because they're chasing their own thing. And then, and then some people are

17:03.440 --> 17:07.360
successful at building their own thing, which means if you're in a room with a bunch of people

17:07.360 --> 17:11.880
and one guy's got a weird mustache, another guy's got a shark fin on his hat, like you

17:11.880 --> 17:16.800
can never quite dismiss anybody because somebody might be a millionaire or about to become

17:16.800 --> 17:26.880
one or, there's this whole culture of like, you know, it's very hard for bigotry and prejudice

17:26.880 --> 17:31.760
or other synonyms to gain a foothold here because it's not incentivized financially

17:31.760 --> 17:34.160
or socially. Do you guys have an accent? Because I haven't

17:34.160 --> 17:39.320
heard one yet. Like, do Los Angeles people, do you have an accent?

17:39.320 --> 17:42.080
It's kind of a, it's kind of a- I'm trying to tie into that. Like, you don't have like-

17:42.080 --> 17:49.200
The Valley has a pretty strong one. Yeah. We have a lack of accent that is technically

17:49.200 --> 17:51.080
an accent. Say what?

17:51.080 --> 17:54.480
We have a lack of accent that's technically an accent. Like, we sound like what movies

17:54.480 --> 17:58.360
are, so, like, I mean, we sound different than other people, so we have an accent.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.720
Yeah. I mean, I can tell if I'm, if I'm, if I'm

18:00.720 --> 18:03.720
talking to somebody, I can tell that they're born and raised in Los Angeles. I can detect

18:03.720 --> 18:08.120
the L.A. speech, but it's just, yeah, to me it sounds like a lack of an accent, but I

18:08.120 --> 18:11.440
think everybody thinks that they don't have an accent, right?

18:11.440 --> 18:17.560
All right. Well, we can't help you live out here, but, but, uh, but, uh-

18:17.560 --> 18:19.560
Uh, deep emotional pain.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.560
Any, any, any, any guidance?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.560
Any guidance.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.560
Yeah. Do you need, do you need advice?

18:24.560 --> 18:30.480
Uh, no, I don't need it. I think I could make it quite on my own, but, uh-

18:30.480 --> 18:33.640
I guess if you, if you were open to advice, like, the first thing that would happen is

18:33.640 --> 18:43.280
you'd be covered in shoes. Like, you're clearly, I, I believe you when, when a man with, that

18:43.280 --> 18:46.680
is that committed to not wearing shoes says, I don't, I'm, I'm not in the market for advice.

18:46.680 --> 18:51.160
Like, I would truly believe you because you're like, I, I, I sometimes don't tie my shoes,

18:51.160 --> 18:54.600
uh, and I'm like belligerent about it. Like, don't tell me to tie my shoes. And I bought

18:54.600 --> 18:58.800
lace-less shoes. And like, you're looking at you, if you're just from the neck up or

18:58.800 --> 19:01.840
even from the waist up, you've got the coat on, the jacket, and you have this neatly

19:01.840 --> 19:06.720
trimmed, you know, kind of, well, what could be considered fancy facial hair? Uh, that's

19:06.720 --> 19:12.560
kind of fastidious. You, I would expect like spats and some, like some, some, some razzle

19:12.560 --> 19:13.560
dazzle, like spectators.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.960
So for when you have the facial hair, but you're kind of like, you're very, you're very,

19:17.960 --> 19:22.160
you're kind of walking contradictions, which is great. It makes you a, I fuck it. That's

19:22.160 --> 19:23.160
awesome.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.960
Do you think that your feet are like hobbit feet? Like, are they like more equipped? They

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
must be.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.360
They don't have hair on the top, but no, but I mean, like, are they like, they're like,

19:31.360 --> 19:34.800
they're like shoe feet. They're like, developing calluses.

19:34.800 --> 19:39.760
I know it's developed. It's about like a half inch callus on the bottom of my foot.

19:39.760 --> 19:45.920
So you're, are you, are you maybe like the shoewear equivalent of a nudist in that, like,

19:45.920 --> 19:48.320
you're thinking like, maybe we should all not wear shoes?

19:48.320 --> 19:51.960
No, no, no. I, I, when I said that thing about you guys are weird for not wearing shoes,

19:51.960 --> 19:57.240
like, go ahead, do whatever the fuck you want to. Like, just don't make me wear shoes, Link.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.560
But where, is there a route to that? Is there anything more to that?

19:59.560 --> 20:03.080
We know you don't have to. No one's going to make you, but did you, did you wear them

20:03.080 --> 20:05.120
in Madison when we met? Cause it was snowing out there.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.400
No, he would. Yeah. I got frostbite first.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.400
You came barefoot in the snow?

20:08.400 --> 20:09.400
Yeah.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.400
It was bloody cold out there.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.400
Yeah, got frostbite in there.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.920
I was doing a blizzard and he didn't wear shoes the whole time.

20:13.920 --> 20:14.920
Damn.

20:14.920 --> 20:15.920
Yeah.

20:15.920 --> 20:21.040
Spam, Spel Spencer doesn't wear pants anytime. Like, he's always in shorts. I bet people

20:21.040 --> 20:24.160
give him shit for that all the time.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.920
We're not going to, but there wasn't some formative experience. There's not some route, like, kind

20:27.920 --> 20:28.920
of.

20:28.920 --> 20:36.280
We're going to get into shoes, actually. Like, many, many of us were. We're kind of, we get

20:36.280 --> 20:41.320
trained not to touch hot stoves, not to walk in a traffic. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not

20:41.320 --> 20:45.960
picking on you. I'm just like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm engaging in the dialectic here. So like,

20:45.960 --> 20:50.120
cause I want to find out, like, cause you're different in that you do, you are committed

20:50.120 --> 20:55.520
to not wearing shoes. And I'm curious, like, if there was a expound on that, you were forced

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
to wear shoes. I'm sorry.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.760
Okay. What are you looking for? Like, the moment I turn?

20:58.760 --> 21:05.200
Yeah, like, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your parents were killed by a

21:05.200 --> 21:07.000
shoe outside of an opera house.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.480
Shoe man, the Levi story.

21:14.480 --> 21:21.080
Uh, is it like a tick maybe? Is it like a, like, it's something that helps you feel

21:21.080 --> 21:26.080
sweaty, man. They're just like gross and kind of sweaty sometime. Like, uh, so you think

21:26.080 --> 21:31.560
what do you mean, my chicken? So shoes are, shoes are extra uncomfortable for you, maybe.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.760
I can't even wear a pair of sandals. Like they're just, you guys, even if I was wearing

21:35.760 --> 21:38.760
the sandals now, like the people in the back would be able to smell my feet.

21:38.760 --> 21:43.400
Oh, but you did don some shoes to walk through the cow carcass field.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
Safety first, Jeff.

21:44.400 --> 21:50.720
Okay. All right. What about frostbite in Madison?

21:50.720 --> 21:51.720
That was me being cocky.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.160
Don't take that tone with me, Levi.

21:54.160 --> 21:57.920
All right. Well, uh, let's have a hand for Levi for joining us.

21:57.920 --> 21:58.920
Thank you.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.920
I'm not going to tell you stuff.

22:02.920 --> 22:03.920
Okay.

22:03.920 --> 22:10.920
Enjoy your stay in Harmontown.

22:10.920 --> 22:18.240
So we gave the audience a little treat because they're such a good audience. We, we brought

22:18.240 --> 22:19.240
Levi.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.360
That was more exciting than I had expected. That was very nice.

22:21.360 --> 22:26.840
Yeah. That's a fascinating guest to bring up.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
What else? What else?

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
What else?

22:28.840 --> 22:30.840
You did a good job. I'd say too. You did a good interview there. You were actually,

22:30.840 --> 22:37.960
uh, you, what do you think that's about? Why do you think you're?

22:37.960 --> 22:40.800
Well, I think it's the same thing. Like, I, you know, I meet a lot of people after the

22:40.800 --> 22:45.720
shows and stuff. And I, uh, you know, and this is, this is nothing on, on the people.

22:45.720 --> 22:49.400
Everybody, all Harmonians are fantastic. And many of them are exactly like me. And that's

22:49.400 --> 22:54.400
probably a, a, a problem, a breakdown in our, like, like a lot of very little eye contact

22:54.400 --> 22:58.480
and a lot of like, people get like, I'm very flattered by this, but there are, I have now

22:58.480 --> 23:03.120
met a lot of people that are very nervous to be, uh, meeting me. And I, and I don't

23:03.120 --> 23:07.360
suffer the illusion that it's because there's very much special about me. I think it's,

23:07.360 --> 23:11.840
it's, it's because I know how they feel. Like if I, when I moved to LA and like, oh my God,

23:11.840 --> 23:16.680
Bob, I'm Kirk standing over by the fucking salad dressing. Um, and, and just like doing

23:16.680 --> 23:21.080
really, really weird shit and, and, and saying a lot of weird shit and feeling like really

23:21.080 --> 23:24.480
conflicted and weird about like having like face-to-face encounters with people, just

23:24.480 --> 23:28.840
because, you know, I had a one-way relationship with them for a long time and had built up

23:28.840 --> 23:33.200
in my head that there was, there was, there were, they were a symbol. So I, my point being,

23:33.200 --> 23:41.560
I meet a lot of people who are, uh, uh, nervous to meet me. And I, even meeting the mailman

23:41.560 --> 23:47.600
and am nervous to meet the mailman. Like I don't make, I don't, I get very uncomfortable.

23:47.600 --> 23:51.720
Text messaging saved my life because I could never talk even on the phone to people. I'm

23:51.720 --> 23:56.400
like, okay, okay. And everyone thinks I'm a dick and I can't look at people and, and

23:56.400 --> 24:00.800
all this stuff. And, uh, I don't know. I think, maybe it's just, I, I, did you use the crassest

24:00.800 --> 24:05.080
language possible to be very efficient about, about communicating it? And I think he can

24:05.080 --> 24:11.200
take it. I think Levi's so crazy, uh, like, but so honest about it. He's just like, there's

24:11.200 --> 24:15.600
nothing, I don't know. There's like, uh, there's nothing's going to happen, you know?

24:15.600 --> 24:19.280
That's like, like, like, like, like, oh, you just like ask him questions and you're just

24:19.280 --> 24:23.640
going to get answers. Whereas somebody else, their head might explode or something. I don't

24:23.640 --> 24:29.640
know what it is. No, God, no. I'm saying, I'm saying you're special, my friend. And,

24:29.640 --> 24:36.960
uh, yeah. No, you, you, you did it just right. Uh, uh, but, but now that I know I have that

24:36.960 --> 24:43.520
power over you that you could scream at. Yeah. It's a roller coaster with me. Uh, but it's

24:43.520 --> 24:47.320
okay. Uh, let's, uh, let's keep, let's, let's keep the show special. What do you, what do

24:47.320 --> 24:51.320
you, what do you, before we move on our good friend, uh, I don't know your last name. So

24:51.320 --> 24:54.320
I'm going to, I'm going to refer to you as the audience knows you. Be fungus bill. Uh,

24:54.320 --> 25:02.320
what is your last name, Bill? Moretson. Moretson. Moretson. Moretson. Be fungus bill has brought

25:02.320 --> 25:09.480
us. Uh, he's, he's, uh, famously, famously has, uh, has brought us, uh, tainted meats

25:09.480 --> 25:15.280
and, uh, a bag of, uh, rocks, which are lovely. Tonight he has brought, um, little kind of

25:15.280 --> 25:18.840
lovely wooden shingles with quotes from our show on it. And, uh, he's given me a handful

25:18.840 --> 25:22.640
and I think he's, he's got a ton to dispense to the crowd. If you guys got to have, all

25:22.640 --> 25:31.840
right. It's like, it's like Christmas here. You found a middle ground, but it was a, you

25:31.840 --> 25:37.160
brought the food and then we made fun of you because the food had, had mold on it. And

25:37.160 --> 25:42.120
then the following week, in my opinion, what was the passive aggressive move you brought,

25:42.120 --> 25:49.960
you brought inert rocks as if to say fine rocks then, but this is like, well, now this

25:49.960 --> 26:01.840
is wood. Right. I brought you stones, but it, but it has like a script on it. Uh, but

26:01.840 --> 26:09.880
the weird thing is that the sticks have words on them. Right. Yeah. Uh, the, I ate the country

26:09.880 --> 26:14.200
like Pac-Man. That's a quote from me. I don't even know what this one is, but I, I, I, I,

26:14.200 --> 26:19.440
I'm quoted as saying, you fuck Batman. We fuck you. I don't, I don't recall the context

26:19.440 --> 26:25.240
of that, but it sounds like something I would say. No, what, when, when did I say this season

26:25.240 --> 26:32.960
three of community was written on anus? It was, it was, it was posted somewhere. Thank

26:32.960 --> 26:42.160
you. Levi knows the city. Adderall. Yeah. Did I mean to say Adderall? And I said anus.

26:42.160 --> 26:47.680
I like this one where I, I take a bold stance and say, I take adorable shits. They're like

26:47.680 --> 26:54.480
unicorn tears. If that one's not correct, I want to take it back. Cause like, all right,

26:54.480 --> 26:59.920
I, I, in order to get through all of these and there's, there's like 62 of them. Uh,

26:59.920 --> 27:05.600
I had to like sort of plumb the depths of the web to, to wrangle enough of these to,

27:05.600 --> 27:09.040
so there's, there's almost no duplicates. How many, how many did you bring us tonight?

27:09.040 --> 27:13.040
62. 62. Yeah. I would, I had planned on a hundred, but I got tired.

27:13.040 --> 27:17.920
Uh, we, we're about, we're probably a little over there, right? I don't know. I can't

27:17.920 --> 27:22.960
be better at that. I am going to be a millionaire and I'm going to smell like a butt. That's

27:22.960 --> 27:30.960
my, that's me being defined. That's the Dan Harmon guarantee. Oh, your money back.

27:30.960 --> 27:36.720
Uh, you're not giving me a, you can do whatever you, I want to make sure everybody gets whatever

27:36.720 --> 27:40.720
is close as possible. Do whatever you wish with them. Uh, but I would like to point out

27:40.720 --> 27:45.120
some things about this. Like the, the shiny ones, those are curly maple. The yellow ones

27:45.120 --> 27:50.720
are yellow heart. The ones that don't have much grain are basswood and then the dark ones are cherry.

27:54.320 --> 28:00.400
This crowd loves fine wood. I wonder if there's a type of wood that would have been booed.

28:02.240 --> 28:08.640
Wingay boo. Too exotic. Well, I, I would like to donate these to make sure everybody gets at

28:08.640 --> 28:12.800
least one. Yeah. I've got about seven or eight. So if you guys, if someone gets shorted and wants

28:12.800 --> 28:16.400
one, they can come up and grab one for me. I'm keeping, I'm eating the lead paint of my own ego.

28:17.760 --> 28:21.040
I was, I was actually hoping you'd keep that one. I like that. It's very appropriate. That's

28:21.040 --> 28:24.320
one of my favorite quotes. All right. Thank you, Bill. You're going to hand them out now.

28:24.320 --> 28:31.680
Sure. All right. Wow.

28:34.240 --> 28:40.000
It's a special night. I don't know if it's first time visitor accessible for a special night.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.360
You know, what do you mean? Well, I don't know. It's not like there's no cats jumping

28:43.360 --> 28:48.480
through hula hoops or anything. I'm not telling stories about, about, about jerking off. I,

28:48.480 --> 28:51.920
I came into the green room and you looked like you were half asleep in that. You looked really

28:51.920 --> 28:58.720
I'm just mentally exhausted. I, I, I just, you know, I, I, I've, I've blogged about this fact,

28:58.720 --> 29:05.920
just writing is a, it's, it's, it's a, it's so hard. It's, it's, you know, it's like you, you,

29:05.920 --> 29:11.920
you really like, before your body gets physically tired, before your eyes get sleepy, before,

29:11.920 --> 29:17.040
before you get frustrated, like your brain actually just like, you just, which wears out.

29:17.040 --> 29:21.920
Cause you're just like, you're, you're running it like a motor cause you're like looking at this

29:21.920 --> 29:27.760
fucking blackboard and going like, uh, okay. So why, what, what does Annie want again? And it's

29:27.760 --> 29:31.840
just like, and then one person goes like, well, I think she wants, she wants to feel loved. And

29:31.840 --> 29:36.400
then someone else goes, but if she wants to feel loved, why, why, how come she's being so mean to

29:36.400 --> 29:46.880
Leonard? All right. All right. What if it was like Tron and everyone goes, unless that solves

29:46.880 --> 29:53.440
everything. But, uh, yeah, it's just, it's just, you know, problem solving, pushing your brain

29:53.440 --> 29:58.720
up against the boundary between it and the shit that you need to know for the whole time.

29:58.720 --> 30:03.040
Are the other writers like, have they gotten on board and are they, are they still intimidated

30:03.040 --> 30:07.040
to talk or does everyone, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're coming out and they're,

30:07.040 --> 30:11.200
they're great because now by, we've had to break up into smaller groups. There's just so many of

30:11.200 --> 30:17.600
them and they're so like, all of the circumstances are so strange. Um, but, but I think once we,

30:17.600 --> 30:20.800
you know, just takes a while and then we broke up into small groups and now they're,

30:21.600 --> 30:26.720
it's, I don't think, I don't exactly have my ear to the ground, like in terms of gossip and stuff,

30:26.720 --> 30:31.360
but it seems like they're all, uh, they all really like each other too, which is kind of a feat with

30:31.360 --> 30:36.640
14 writers. Like they, uh, there's usually one person that's like, oh, here comes Stanley.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.440
Boy, what a mistake.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.440
What's your feeling about the, uh, about the episodes? Like, can you compare this to

30:45.440 --> 30:52.080
how you felt going into previous seasons? I feel better about 501 than I felt going into previous

30:52.080 --> 30:58.320
seasons, but I don't, I wouldn't, I can't bet my life because it's just so, I don't know. I'm so

30:58.320 --> 31:04.480
close to it. I can't, I, I, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know. Are there any like nods or winks to

31:04.480 --> 31:09.120
the fact that you're back? Is there like, like, like the fact that, like, is there any kind of

31:09.120 --> 31:13.120
dealing with that? Or are you just kind of just picking up where last season left off?

31:13.120 --> 31:18.320
It, I mean, the, the, the circumstances of, of coming back and having to do a fifth season,

31:18.320 --> 31:23.600
like, like they're automatically going to generate as a context of nothing and winking. Like, I don't

31:23.600 --> 31:28.080
know how to explain it. Like, or, you know, we're getting, we're getting back to basics. And so

31:29.040 --> 31:33.920
that feeling is in the air. And so I'm not, I'm not, I'm not doing a bunch of inside jokes and

31:33.920 --> 31:43.280
going like, well, what happened last year, boy? I had a bad taco. Do you have a bad taco? Or we all

31:43.280 --> 31:52.880
had bad tacos. Now it's all gone. Turn on the fan. Every time, every time there's a reference to

31:52.880 --> 32:02.080
something that happened last season, it's Foghorn. I mean, that's not entertaining, you know, to do

32:02.080 --> 32:06.400
that. It would be pretty entertaining, I think. I think, I think you get mileage out of that for

32:06.400 --> 32:18.800
an act or two. Let's do, let's do, let's do Q&A. I don't know why I spun a wheel. Anybody have

32:18.800 --> 32:28.880
any questions? Jesus Christ. Like, camera over here as a documentary guy. Neil Berkeley, everybody,

32:28.880 --> 32:37.760
the maker of our documentary. If your question is how's the documentary going, clearly it's not

32:37.760 --> 32:50.400
finished. Still some shots to pick up. And that's how I learned about America. Now get the fuck out

32:50.400 --> 33:03.120
of here. What was your question? If Dan could be a were version of any animal during a full moon,

33:03.120 --> 33:10.640
which animal would that be? Were version of any animal. I would, I would, I would, you can be a

33:10.640 --> 33:16.240
were cat. I guess you could. You can be aware whatever you want. Right. So yeah, where does not,

33:16.240 --> 33:23.200
it's not wolf specific. You could be aware whale. I didn't, you didn't ask me, but I'm going with

33:23.200 --> 33:35.040
where whale. No control over this, right? So every full moon. All right. Well, I just, I just want to,

33:35.040 --> 33:42.320
I have to think practically because I don't keep track of time very well. And I just want to make

33:42.320 --> 33:47.280
sure that like I'm not like in a plate, like if it was a tiger, then there's places where that's

33:47.280 --> 33:53.920
not going to be cool. So, so I feel like it's a boring answer, but I feel like I just go regular

33:53.920 --> 34:03.520
house cat so that, so that I maximize my, my ability to like hide, but also blend in and get

34:03.520 --> 34:07.760
away. And if anything should go wrong, I'm kind of wasting the power by just being scared of it,

34:07.760 --> 34:14.560
I guess, sort of dealing with it like a disease. Like, like I have where diabetes. I guess I'd

34:14.560 --> 34:20.080
stack some Snickers bars and so you're a human, but I would turn into a part human part whale.

34:20.080 --> 34:25.120
That's probably a bad idea. Would I be able to, oh, oh, oh, it's a way, I'm a were cat. Like,

34:25.120 --> 34:30.960
like I'm not just turning into a cat. So where whale wouldn't work because I'd have to, I just,

34:30.960 --> 34:36.000
I would turn it, the moon would come out and I would be a whale sitting here at this podium

34:36.000 --> 34:40.720
when I would tie. Yeah. Okay. I would have to be near a body of water at all times. Well,

34:40.720 --> 34:44.160
then maybe like a were chimp so that people could barely tell the difference. Like,

34:45.360 --> 34:51.360
like you just, you just feel like, uh, but, uh, yeah, I don't know. I'm tear, I don't want to be

34:51.360 --> 35:00.800
aware. Okay. Well, fuck it then. I just go for, uh, I would be aware, uh, aware, like, uh, otter.

35:00.800 --> 35:06.960
What about like a were bear? That's kind of cute. You're kind of a bear

35:08.560 --> 35:12.560
in the gay way. All right. I'll be a, I'll be a were bear.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.720
Because I wear, I was thinking otter because again, I was thinking like I would like to be an otter

35:18.720 --> 35:23.280
because they like swim on their back and they, they crack up, crack open clams on their tummy.

35:24.560 --> 35:28.880
Where, where otter is awesome. But if you are a were otter, you'd be like a six foot

35:28.880 --> 35:34.880
guy eating clams on his tummy. You could do that as a were bear. It wouldn't matter.

35:36.800 --> 35:42.080
But the otter would have to rampage. What would that, where, where otters, uh, enemies be clams and

35:42.080 --> 35:47.520
like mollusks and stuff. I think you're just, are you confusing it because, uh, wolves rampage

35:47.520 --> 35:51.200
and where wolves therefore have to rampage. I think if you were a were fish, you know, he,

35:51.200 --> 35:59.520
he, he had the caveat that you would have to rampage. Oh, okay. So you'd have to rampage. All

35:59.520 --> 36:04.080
right. A were bear. I'm just going to, yeah, that's got it. All right. Two more questions.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.280
All right. No. All right.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.480
Are you worried about, uh, what's your colonize? It's perfect moon colony.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.200
Moon colony. All right. The question is, thank you for getting us back on track. What's your name?

36:19.200 --> 36:23.200
Greg. Kind of an ordinary name.

36:25.360 --> 36:32.400
I just, we had Levi. What was your name? Chud. Chud? What? Not really. Chud.

36:33.280 --> 36:37.520
Like cannibalistic humanoid underground dweller. Chud. Is it really chud?

36:38.160 --> 36:43.680
Oh, that's what I've gone by. Oh, you're not, you weren't born chud. That would be fucking awesome.

36:43.680 --> 36:52.960
All right. How did your name chud generate? It's kind of boring. In fifth grade, I figured I was

36:52.960 --> 37:02.720
an adult so I can name myself. And a judge taught you a lesson. He said he named himself because

37:02.720 --> 37:07.760
he became an adult. He thought he could name himself. I decided when I was a kid, when I turned

37:07.760 --> 37:15.920
like 13, like coming into my own, like having identity things, I decided that my, as a writer,

37:15.920 --> 37:22.480
my name was D.R. Harmon. Even though my middle name is James, but I was at D.R. Harmon and I,

37:22.480 --> 37:25.120
when people would say, what's the R stand for? I'd say rutabaga.

37:28.800 --> 37:37.040
Yeah. I didn't, I'm not proud of it. I appreciate my candor. I didn't come here to win a popularity

37:37.040 --> 37:40.800
contest. Did we ever talk about in the show, we must have talked about that you, your nickname was

37:40.800 --> 37:46.080
Pac-Man for a while? Yeah, yeah. Do we talk about that in the show? Yeah, I wanted to, yeah,

37:46.080 --> 37:49.600
kids, they want to know who they are, what's their deal. I didn't really have anything,

37:49.600 --> 37:55.920
so I just jumped on Pac-Man. Just called myself Pac-Man. I made a windbreaker that had like a

37:55.920 --> 38:01.600
little felt Pac-Man on it. I didn't make the windbreaker. I made the felt Pac-Man. And I would

38:01.600 --> 38:08.560
just like, as everything was Pac-Man, in Wisconsin, people appreciate knowing what to get you for

38:08.560 --> 38:15.600
Christmas. Everyone has a totem. If the mom's a mouse and get dad a belt buckle, and everybody's

38:15.600 --> 38:23.440
got a gimmick. That's a terrible gift to get if you're a child abuser. Get dad more belt buckles.

38:23.440 --> 38:36.480
What do you have a nice heavy sharp one? Yeah, the shit was okay. The question was am I worried

38:36.480 --> 38:42.080
that when we colonize the moon I won't have anything to rant about. You know, that's the goal. I

38:42.080 --> 38:57.680
don't enjoy ranting. I'm just sitting here looking adorable. I'm not doing anything. I do it because

38:57.680 --> 39:04.960
I have to. It's like does a car enjoy producing carbon dioxide? Oh, it's good. It's combusting.

39:04.960 --> 39:09.600
It's got shit in it, and it's like it has to get the certain work done. Living on earth

39:09.600 --> 39:16.560
produces a byproduct called rants. I think you'd find stuff to rant about. Well, at first,

39:16.560 --> 39:20.080
I'd be like, but it would mostly be me. I'd be like, why didn't I bring a bottle opener?

39:20.080 --> 39:25.120
Yeah. I'm such a dick. I'm such a dumb dick. And I'd be like, you know. You could rant at my

39:25.120 --> 39:32.640
little fancy VIP moon. Phoenixville orbits you. It's going to orbit four times a day too, so you

39:32.640 --> 39:38.000
see more of me. We're all going to go buy. We're all going to be at the Mexican restaurant,

39:38.000 --> 39:42.560
moaning you. There were a couple of people I went into the Harmontown subreddit, and there were

39:42.560 --> 39:47.440
a couple of people that were really taking me to task or taking my idea to task, as if I had

39:47.440 --> 39:55.200
somehow implied that they should go to the moon with me, which I did not. And they're like,

39:55.200 --> 39:58.960
it seems a little hypocritical. If you hate capitalism so much, why doesn't he give up his

39:58.960 --> 40:12.560
big house? Like you were instigating that bullshit that you started. I do want to address that

40:12.560 --> 40:19.600
point, and I did in the subreddit as well with a little typey rant, but it's okay to have a big

40:19.600 --> 40:24.720
house and to know that capitalism is a flawed system. Like the idea that you could respond to

40:24.720 --> 40:30.000
somebody questioning the world that you're in by telling them that you don't give them any credit

40:30.000 --> 40:36.800
because they haven't yet reduced themselves to a criminal level of poverty is exactly the same as

40:36.800 --> 40:42.800
saying go fuck yourself. There's no difference between that. We are all within capitalism,

40:42.800 --> 40:47.520
and we all survive within capitalism by buying and selling things. I don't think it matters.

40:47.520 --> 40:54.800
Like my big house is me going, this is what I deserve. I'm going to work this hard, and so I

40:54.800 --> 40:58.720
can have this much space to move in. I can walk around that space and go, Jesus Christ, what a

40:58.720 --> 41:06.240
fucked up system that made me work that hard for this much space. And want to go to the moon and

41:06.240 --> 41:12.720
live in a little cubicle where there is no such thing as property and hierarchy. We'll go up there

41:12.720 --> 41:17.120
and we're going to have a good time, but it's not going to be any of these people that question

41:17.120 --> 41:27.040
me on Reddit. It's going to be a special detector that zaps those people. So it gets more autocratic

41:27.040 --> 41:31.600
every time you talk about it. Only at the gateway, man. It's like that's the other thing. You and

41:31.600 --> 41:36.720
Camille were caught. Gateways are gateways, man. Yeah, but you got to affect the change. You got

41:36.720 --> 41:41.760
seven billion people on earth. They got a system. You're allowed to say, okay, we got to take the

41:41.760 --> 41:45.520
right people. We got to engage in some elitism because we're not going to take seven billion

41:45.520 --> 41:50.000
people to the moon. And even if we could, that would just be like, well, then keep them on

41:50.000 --> 41:56.480
earth and fix the earth. The idea is that, okay, systems too big. Most of the people down here

41:56.480 --> 42:00.480
feel like they're nailing it. Even the people who don't are like, well, I don't want to go to the

42:00.480 --> 42:05.440
moon. Some people would be willing to go, but you got to pick the right ones to take your best shot

42:05.440 --> 42:11.360
at starting over in a right way. So yes, you're engaging in de facto hierarchy and elitism because

42:11.360 --> 42:18.320
somebody's got to actually start the thing. But the goal is to get up there and, you know, hand

42:18.320 --> 42:22.880
over the reins to the collective. I promise I will. Did we decide that there was going to be a

42:22.880 --> 42:26.800
dome situation or we're going to terraform it? How are we going to live up there? Well, I don't know

42:26.800 --> 42:32.800
how to terraform. I kind of feel like I... We should take somebody who knows how to do it.

42:32.800 --> 42:42.320
Yeah. I'm looking at it this way. I don't think... I'm not going to give myself credit for knowing

42:42.320 --> 42:50.000
how to grow stuff on the moon, like make an atmosphere. But I've gone swimming with goggles

42:50.000 --> 42:59.600
and stuff, so I understand the basic principles of sealing things off. So I figure... And we have

42:59.600 --> 43:06.000
yet... We have yet to terraform. I think you're a little cocky on that. I'm just saying... You have

43:06.000 --> 43:11.200
a lot more credit scientifically than maybe... I think it's fair to say that if you could figure

43:11.200 --> 43:14.880
out how to live underwater, you can figure out how to live on the moon. Yeah, that's how they train

43:14.880 --> 43:20.640
the astronauts. Yeah. So because both places are... I have the identical problem. They need to be air

43:20.640 --> 43:25.280
tight, right? Yeah. So we've accomplished both of those things. We have not terraformed anything

43:25.280 --> 43:32.160
yet. So I'm just saying, okay, we've gotten to the moon and we've hung out up there. So I'm saying,

43:32.160 --> 43:38.560
can I please get up there and hang out there so that people leave me alone? Okay. There will have

43:38.560 --> 43:50.240
to be hydroponic, like, basil gardens so I can garnish. We'll get Levi on that. Levi's special

43:50.240 --> 43:57.120
carcass fertilizer. All right. One more question. That'll end this segment. All right, sir. Are you

43:57.120 --> 44:03.120
there? What's the worst insult anybody's ever said to your face? Worst insult anyone's ever said to

44:03.120 --> 44:16.400
my face. That's a good question. I don't want to get it wrong. I remember being really hurt

44:16.400 --> 44:28.240
when I was in my 20s and I was helping this band load into this bar. It'll take too long

44:28.240 --> 44:38.080
to explain why. And then they were having trouble with this bouncer or something. I just made some

44:38.080 --> 44:42.880
comment, but I was actually trying to ease the tension between them. The leader of the band was

44:42.880 --> 44:46.640
having trouble with the bouncer. There was some misunderstanding about if they were going to

44:46.640 --> 44:51.680
get paid or if they were taking the door or something. I just tried to make a funny joke.

44:51.680 --> 44:57.680
I was carrying somebody's bass chords or something. I was like, yeah, come on, guys. Don't fight.

44:57.680 --> 45:05.920
And then the bouncer was like, now you want to start something Chewbacca? This is going to really

45:05.920 --> 45:14.160
hurt my... I think it's about intent. I think I really felt his complete disdain. It's okay

45:14.160 --> 45:21.440
to be called Chewbacca. But I think at the time it was like a weird... I probably had an image in

45:21.440 --> 45:30.640
my head like, I look like John Kuzak. And he was like, no, when I look at you with my tiny bouncer

45:30.640 --> 45:38.080
brain and improv skills, I immediately say Chewbacca. And I'm not a Star Wars fan. I'm a bouncer.

45:38.080 --> 45:48.000
So it's profound. You are Chewbacca. Either it means you're gross. I just see hair and animal.

45:49.520 --> 45:54.480
So I felt... I remember that sticks out in my head. When I was in college, my friend wrote an

45:54.480 --> 46:00.000
article in some magazine, his theory being that Chewbacca was the only Latino in the Star Wars

46:00.000 --> 46:06.400
movies. Yeah, yeah. Because his name is Chewie, which is short for like Jesus. He's a mechanic.

46:06.400 --> 46:12.960
And these were his. These were his. And he's Mexican. This is my friend Andre Soto. He said

46:12.960 --> 46:20.720
he's Mexican and he never fights alone. And he does kind of have like a little mustache. He does

46:20.720 --> 46:27.200
have like a kind of... But also, no joke, if you watch the first one, A New Hope, when the first

46:27.200 --> 46:31.520
time they get into the Millennium Falcon, they sit down. No shit. There are gold dice or silver

46:31.520 --> 46:36.640
dice. There are, like there are dashboard dice. And you never see them again. He bumps his head

46:36.640 --> 46:42.000
on them when he gets in the first time. That's the only time. Yeah, it's that. I mean, we saw the

46:42.000 --> 46:47.440
George Lucas unchecked in the Phantom Menace and the fucking like ethnic aliens started rolling out.

46:47.440 --> 47:00.720
Like every planet you went to, I was like, oh, hello. Welcome to a China idiot. Oh, this is so

47:00.720 --> 47:06.320
expensive. Yeah, could you know where we can get our car fixed? I don't know what's in it for me.

47:06.320 --> 47:18.800
I mean, we all saw it. That movie. That's a great proof because he was in it. He got a P user

47:18.800 --> 47:25.040
to quote Jar Jar. But there's got to be something better. Like somebody must have called me

47:25.040 --> 47:32.080
something way worse than that. Like any like, not to name him, but like any like angry studio heads

47:32.080 --> 47:37.920
or co workers and things like that. I mean, they don't, you know, they don't do that stuff. They

47:37.920 --> 47:44.320
just, they just call human resources. If you could conjure up what would be the most painful thing

47:44.320 --> 47:50.880
for someone to say to you. It would center around like, like I have a big soft spot or a hot or

47:50.880 --> 47:56.240
sensitive button about pretentiousness. Like who do you think you are that area? Because I'm from

47:56.240 --> 48:02.480
Wisconsin and I grew up with like a brother that was like five years older than me and was constantly

48:02.480 --> 48:07.840
like, he would, he would go like, like, what the fuck doesn't Daniel have to do his laundry? And my

48:07.840 --> 48:15.200
mom would say to my brother, Daniel's special. And my brother go, no, he's not. And I'd be like,

48:15.200 --> 48:21.040
I'm in the room and so uncomfortable. Dr. Harmon is right here. Yeah.

48:21.040 --> 48:29.920
And so I just like, like, I don't, I don't like, I don't like, I had to learn to take compliments

48:29.920 --> 48:34.560
over time. Like a one of my 80 therapists told me at one point, like you should, when you deflect

48:34.560 --> 48:38.720
a compliment that actually insults the person that's giving it to you, I figured that out after a while

48:38.720 --> 48:44.720
that people, how to say thank you when someone said you did a good job. But, but I did the thing

48:44.720 --> 48:49.040
that still terrifies me. Like that's why I can't go to the AV club or anything. Like they, they,

48:49.040 --> 48:56.800
they, if I, if I, if I like, like, you know, Dan Harmon's Iron Man costume from Comic Con's for

48:56.800 --> 49:01.520
sale, AV club headline, I know, like not to click on that, because I know that the reason they're

49:01.520 --> 49:05.920
putting that up there is simply so that like everyone will come there and like leave comments

49:05.920 --> 49:14.400
and go, uh, who gives a fuck about this fucking fat asshole, shit, fuck asshole. And I, and it'll

49:14.400 --> 49:19.040
really, it like, I'm still sensitive about that stuff, because all my identity is caught up in

49:19.040 --> 49:24.240
people's perception of me. So, so like, like, like, it's okay for people to think I'm crazy.

49:24.240 --> 49:29.200
It's okay for people to think I'm stupid. It's okay for people to think like all kinds of like,

49:29.200 --> 49:32.400
like, like that I'm abusive, that I'm like, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't want them to think

49:32.400 --> 49:45.040
that I'm a bad person. But, but, but when it gets into like, like, people thinking that I am less

49:45.040 --> 49:51.760
blank than I think I am, like, it kind of really, it really threatens me because it implies that I'm

49:51.760 --> 49:56.560
some kind of, it's sort of like, it's sort of like, like, just like opens the Schrodinger box of my

49:56.560 --> 50:02.000
entire identity and goes like this, it's empty, like, because the first implication is that, oh,

50:02.000 --> 50:07.360
I'm a construct of myself. Like, and the second implication is that that construct is like emperor's

50:07.360 --> 50:13.760
robes, like it's not there anymore. Like, it really kind of terrifies me. Because I guess I must

50:13.760 --> 50:18.720
believe that's true. I'd not want it to be. So, so like, it's not, it's not like the Chewbacca's

50:18.720 --> 50:23.440
or the hate fatties. There was a guy outside the magic castle that really, he really like,

50:23.440 --> 50:32.560
I guess I accidentally, it was on me, like, he was, it was this, this young guy was like opening

50:32.560 --> 50:39.520
the door for all of his, all of his family, like his, like, grandma walked through and his mom

50:39.520 --> 50:44.240
walked through and I kind of like darted through the door, like, like, thanks. And, and, and then,

50:44.880 --> 50:53.280
like, he said something like, like, real classy or, I guess I'm opening the door for everybody,

50:53.280 --> 50:58.480
I think that was it. And I, and I just kind of like defensively because I, I felt, I went like,

50:58.480 --> 51:04.560
you're gonna be okay, you'll be fine. And then because I said that, he was like, he just like,

51:04.560 --> 51:12.560
fucking, he, he, he, he, he, I can't really, he was like, oh, thanks, fatty. At the, at the time,

51:12.560 --> 51:16.080
I was not really like thinking of myself as a fat person. So again, like the Chewbacca thing,

51:16.080 --> 51:19.920
I was like, what a fat, that's the first thing. And then I went and looked in the mirror and I

51:19.920 --> 51:25.680
was like, yeah, this giant fucking face, like, dripping over my, my, my tux collar. I was wearing

51:25.680 --> 51:31.040
a tux because it was the magic castle. There was some wedding or something, but I was like, yeah,

51:31.040 --> 51:36.880
I was like, oh, shit, God, that guy really got married at the magic castle. There was some formal

51:36.880 --> 51:41.120
event and then, and then there, and then a thing at the magic castle. Yeah, if you haven't been, don't.

51:42.960 --> 51:47.840
You'll get, you'll get insulted. It's less magical than you think. So it's a hurt thing,

51:47.840 --> 51:54.000
should call it the hurtful castle. But he was right. I, well, I mean, he was right to, I was,

51:54.000 --> 52:01.360
I didn't have my fucking Emily post simulator on. My friends were five people ahead and had

52:01.360 --> 52:05.360
already gone through the door. So I was just trying to catch up to them. But in his world,

52:05.360 --> 52:11.680
it was like, oh, geez, what am I, the door opening for you guy? And then, and then I was

52:11.680 --> 52:20.720
condescending. I should have just said, I am so sorry. Fuck that guy. But remember that guy

52:21.600 --> 52:26.880
at Tamo Shanter? Yeah, yeah. That guy really, really got me. Well, we were talking too loud,

52:26.880 --> 52:30.080
or you're using salty language or something like that. I don't like being told, shut up,

52:30.080 --> 52:33.680
like, like, like, like, like, like, I mean, sometimes that'll just make me angry. But,

52:33.680 --> 52:38.240
but like also just the idea that I talk too much that I'm a loud mouth. What was the exchange?

52:38.240 --> 52:43.440
She came of a representative from his table came over, right? Or the nose him. He sat there the

52:43.440 --> 52:47.200
whole time. We, Jeff and I were having a good time. I think we told this story on this podcast,

52:47.200 --> 52:51.520
but what haven't we told? We said we're sitting there in this restaurant and kind of having a

52:51.520 --> 52:56.560
couple beers, a summer, summer day, like just out with some friends and like, like, just kind of

52:56.560 --> 53:01.840
live in the, live in the summer life, like, like in this quasi fancy restaurant in Los Files. And,

53:01.840 --> 53:08.400
and, and there was this table with this guy and these two elderly women and he kept, he, he, like,

53:08.400 --> 53:12.800
like, one of them, one of them looked over, I think at one point, which is why I made sure

53:12.800 --> 53:17.600
that we weren't really being that obnoxious at a certain point. But I guess we were, I guess we

53:17.600 --> 53:22.800
use profanity sometimes when we, when we communicate. I was telling like a loud story that might have

53:22.800 --> 53:28.720
gotten a little. And the guy waited the whole lunch, instead of just like, like, going like,

53:28.720 --> 53:34.000
if this is your demand, like, hey, we have demands over here, like, you're, you're encroaching on

53:34.000 --> 53:41.840
our ability to eat our toad in the hole or whatever. He waited the whole thing, settled the whole bill,

53:41.840 --> 53:46.640
and then, and then stopped on the way out and went to the three of us, said, hey, if you guys

53:46.640 --> 53:51.120
are going to talk like you're in a truck stop, why don't you go eat one? And, and then, and then

53:51.120 --> 53:56.560
kept walking. And then, and then I, I blurted out because I got so flustered. This is me at my,

53:56.560 --> 54:01.920
at my wittiest when I'm actually under the gun. I went, whoa, whoa, whoa, if you're going to tell

54:01.920 --> 54:13.360
people what to do, why don't you go back to Germany? To which he replied, you go fuck yourself.

54:14.160 --> 54:19.360
Yeah. And I was like, what a truck stop! You're back! Truck stop. He just, he just, he was mad,

54:19.360 --> 54:24.080
he couldn't talk like a truck stop. Yeah. Yeah. Because he's clearly like under the thumb of his

54:24.080 --> 54:29.520
like mom's inheritance or something. Like, who eats with two old ladies? If I recall the next

54:29.520 --> 54:35.360
two hours to maybe three days was sped with the esprit d'escalier, like coming up with the

54:35.360 --> 54:42.800
perfect retort for that guy. People in restaurants, like, oh, like, like, I can't, you know, in LA

54:42.800 --> 54:47.520
when you go to these restaurants and they, can we get a table for two? And they, and they're like,

54:47.520 --> 54:52.960
yeah, of course we can. When the answer is no, they can't because their restaurant is five feet

54:52.960 --> 54:58.000
wide. They should just say, no, we can't seat you. And you know what? We have too many tables in here.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.120
We should get rid of a couple. So it's a comfortable place. Instead, they fucking jam these goddamn

55:03.120 --> 55:13.200
Logan's run fucking tables together as if, as if it is human at all to eat closer to a stranger

55:13.200 --> 55:17.840
than the person that you came to dinner with. The insanity of these places, like, like, like,

55:17.840 --> 55:23.040
you go, and the thing that's even more insane than that is when they sit you in these places,

55:23.040 --> 55:32.240
and the, like, the thing that blows my fucking mind is when the people next to you who are in

55:32.240 --> 55:39.040
the same horrible situation can't have the fucking, like, human righteousness to go, well, I guess

55:39.040 --> 55:45.440
we're all just prisoners of war in this shitty place. Let's all rise above it by ignoring each

55:45.440 --> 55:50.400
other. When the people next to you, like, you're talking to your friend, you're having an intimate

55:50.400 --> 55:57.040
conversation, I'm a hyperbolic guy. I might, I might compare seasons of TV shows to unsavory

55:57.040 --> 56:08.400
things. I'll grab my God-given word power to make my point. I won't do it loudly, but I'll do it

56:08.400 --> 56:12.960
effectively. And then there's like a certain combination of words, and then every fucking time

56:12.960 --> 56:16.640
I eat in one of these places where you're close to someone, somebody always looks over and goes,

56:16.640 --> 56:22.640
like, uh, that's actually really, not really offensive, but like, they'll just go, like,

56:22.640 --> 56:30.160
excuse me, I did improv for years. I was in UC Bay, like, what was I, what, you said you said

56:30.160 --> 56:34.560
improv was, you know, bullshit, I said, I said I was in a bullshit improv troupe when I was like,

56:34.560 --> 56:47.440
what the fuck am I talking to you for? Are you out of your mind? Oh, I'm sorry, sir, was I rude

56:47.440 --> 56:58.400
to you? What are you doing? I'm eating and talking to my friend. You're, what are you doing? I was

56:58.400 --> 57:04.960
at a date with a girl at a fancy restaurant, and we were, it was like a first or second date,

57:04.960 --> 57:09.120
and we were exchanging like philosophies, we were getting to know each other philosophically,

57:09.680 --> 57:15.360
spiritually, you know, she was an atheist, it turned out, and I was like, I was like, well,

57:15.360 --> 57:21.040
I did, you know, I'm not, I would never bother to commit to that club, and I, but I understand,

57:21.040 --> 57:26.320
and she's like, yeah, I understand, people need, people need religion sometimes to, you know,

57:26.320 --> 57:30.640
it gives the meaning in that whole thing, and I'm like, well, there is that, that kind of

57:31.440 --> 57:37.440
aspect of it, I think that religion connects people with the unknown, and that's the primary

57:37.440 --> 57:44.480
thing, but it has come to be a sort of a crutch for some people, because to put it very basically,

57:44.480 --> 57:52.720
like, you know, this sort of background notion in our heads that if you get cancer, it's your fault,

57:52.720 --> 57:57.200
or something like that, and I just like, and I kept talking, and then this fucking woman over

57:57.200 --> 58:01.920
here was like, like, I saw her head cocked, so now I, now I'm, now I'm, and then she starts

58:01.920 --> 58:06.880
leaning into her friend, so these two elderly women, and then I keep talking to my date, now,

58:06.880 --> 58:12.400
now I have to put 20% of my attention on the lady next to me, because she leans over to her

58:12.400 --> 58:20.320
friend, she goes, did you hear what he said? And the other woman, and my date is, has no idea

58:20.320 --> 58:25.680
that I'm now listening to them, and I'm just going, uh-huh, uh-huh, and listening to them,

58:25.680 --> 58:32.000
and then the other woman goes, no, what did he say? So anyways, I, when I got my master's degree,

58:32.000 --> 58:37.280
I just decided I wanted to focus on, he said, if you get cancer, it's your fault.

58:40.960 --> 58:46.160
So, so I'm hearing this, I'm horrified that I'm hearing this, and I, and I, and so I'm the date,

58:46.160 --> 58:50.640
and the person is expressing himself, and getting to, getting to know me, and I, and I go, uh,

58:50.640 --> 58:54.640
yeah, I was like, excuse me for a second, I, I, I, I'm sorry, that's not what I said.

58:56.560 --> 59:02.240
And the look on the woman's face, the, at this, at this barbaric

59:03.440 --> 59:09.840
act, action of, on my part, that I actually, I, that I was, she was like, I beg your pardon?

59:09.840 --> 59:20.000
I said, Chewbacca? I said, I, I, I, I overheard, I can hear you talking about what I was talking

59:20.000 --> 59:26.400
about, and you're, you quoted me out of context, and, uh, little did I know that would be the

59:26.400 --> 59:32.080
story of my life, but I, I, I, I, I, I just, I, I, I, you, you, you, I didn't, I didn't,

59:32.080 --> 59:37.040
I was talking about religion with my friend, I was using, uh, hyperbolic, uh, metaphors and

59:37.040 --> 59:41.280
things, and you, you, you, you, you, I didn't, I didn't, I don't think it's people's fault

59:41.280 --> 59:46.640
when they get cancer, and she's like, oh, well, I, I, I, I didn't, uh, I didn't know that you

59:46.640 --> 59:51.760
could hear me, and I was like, well, uh, you know, it's a, I didn't, I didn't want you to hear me,

59:51.760 --> 59:56.800
it's a, it's a very small restaurant, they seat people very close, I guess there's a financial

59:56.800 --> 01:00:04.320
reason behind that, uh, uh, but we are both the victims, and, uh, well, I, I, I, I survived

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.680
cancer, and, uh, well, again, okay, so, I mean, this is very inconvenient for all of us, like I,

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:17.360
I, I, I'm on a, I'm on a date, that's not surviving cancer, but it's also, like, uh,

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.560
it's also a thing that I want to be hooked into, you know, and like, like, like, like,

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.800
have you guys met, uh, uh, like, like, want to just shove the tables together, and it says,

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.960
it was a fucking nightmare, it happens every time I go out to eat, if, unless I do the thing that

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.840
I've learned to do, which makes me a curmudgeon, and, and, and, and, and not as fun to go out to eat

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.200
with, I walk into a restaurant, if that is the situation, I go, no, we're not eating here,

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.320
and that, that, that, now my problems are over, but I, uh, I don't know why I'm telling you this.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.200
I was at a restaurant years ago, um, at a Italian restaurant, I was sitting at a little

01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.400
outdoor sidewalk area, having dinner by myself, which I like to do, and, uh, I was sitting there,

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.920
there's a couple on a first day, or not a first day, but there were a young couple dating,

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.480
and they were talking, I, you know, you were very close together, I could hear every word

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.440
they're saying, because like, I have ears on that side of my head, and, and, uh, I have multiple ears,

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.560
and, uh, and they were talking, just regular, you know, just chit chat, and then another couple

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:23.120
walks into the restaurant that they know, and the, the woman, the young girl goes, the young lady

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.520
goes, um, oh my god, like, so-and-so, like, oh my god, what are you doing, I, I know, I, I, I never

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:39.520
come here, it's so ironic that you're here, I got coincidence, and, uh, actually, I think that it was,

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.000
it was close enough that I actually kind of did the, the incredibly me thing of the hand on their

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.920
table, coincidence, like, I think I actually had, like, a fork in my mouth, like, and the guy goes,

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.640
whoa, whoa, whoa, the guy that was the date, it's just like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I go, I go,

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:03.360
it's not, it's not ironic, like, bro, that's not cool, it's like, I'm sitting right here, man,

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.200
like, like, like, if you've got problems about that, like, get your fucking ducks in a row, man,

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.520
like, fucking, and then the other couple came, like, like, they thought we knew each other,

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.680
because it seemed like we were old pals, and I was like, I'm not gonna fucking be bashful about

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:22.080
that at all, like, and I completely sunk their dates, it was the best. Well, I know that makes

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.600
me an asshole, but fucking, I think I said this before, like, if you are watching sports, or if

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.000
you're watching news, whether improvising, like, there's a high-speed chase, whether going off

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.160
prompter, and they're having to riff, if you hear the word, you know, it's ironic, 100% chance

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.960
there's gonna be no irony in the pursuant sentences, and it drives me fucking mad.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.920
All right, well, I mean, I'm a victim in my restaurant stories.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:49.840
I know.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.200
I'm more of a victim, as I have to sit around you people.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.120
All right, well, let's, uh...

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.160
Are you shoe wearers?

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.360
Let's, why don't we bring up Erin McGathy, uh, so that we can...

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:05.840
Aaron?

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.480
Oh, she's probably peeing herself.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.120
Uh, she's...

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.560
If I know her, we're both cleansing. She's probably in the bathroom.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.400
Let's bring up Spencer Crittenden instead.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.040
Spencer Crittenden!

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.240
Aaron's taking a poo.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.200
She's out in the toilet doing what ladies sometimes have to do.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.720
Hello! Sorry.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.720
Uh, cleanse. I need to pee constantly.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:43.840
Yeah.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.040
I'm not drinking a lot of water on this cleanse.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:49.920
Oh, you should.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.720
Well, when I do, I have to pee every seven minutes.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.120
Yeah.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.440
And it's, it really is actually getting in the way of work.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.440
I'm not kidding.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.800
Like, I, so I actually just go, okay, I'll just be a little more dehydrated

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.440
and just have the liquid kale thing.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.600
Right. Well, that's, it's mostly water.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.760
So I think you're okay health-wise.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.800
It's exciting to talk to you.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.400
I haven't seen you, really.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.800
So I feel very, like, just butterfly and I feel nervous.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.280
It's like a date.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.000
Uh, I, I hope no one overhears our conversation.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.840
Uh, Coincidence?

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.000
Spencer, how, how, how are you?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:28.560
I'm good.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.880
And I'm also getting adequate hydration.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.840
How do you, how are you liking being my assistant?

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.280
It's good. I, I, I feel like I'm doing a terrible job,

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.640
but I think I'm doing okay.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.080
How, how would you grade his performance thus far, Dan?

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.120
Uh, a plus, I guess.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:47.840
Really?

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.080
Yeah.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.280
What, I mean, anything lower would be to imply that I needed something

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.080
that I wasn't getting.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.720
And if I needed something, I'd, I'd ask you for it

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.320
because you paid to get it for me.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.400
Sometimes you could use a, like a, a piss boy

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.480
so I could wrangle your pee for you.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.080
Oh yeah.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.600
We could figure it out.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.320
I got zip ties.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.640
If you want to, if, if you, if you want to do something

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.920
the, the, the, to make yourself feel like a, a better assistant.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.320
Uh-huh.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:18.880
Here we go.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:25.680
Well, no, this is something that I, I feel bad asking an assistant to do.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.600
But now that it's, it's, it's disguised as entertainment.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:37.120
But, uh, like I, I can't because I, I, I just, like my car is, uh,

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.080
like the inside of it, the passenger side floor is just, it's just garbage.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.120
It's just a garbage can.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.000
So it can all go?

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.840
Well, I mean, I think there might be a couple

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.640
of whole Dungeons and Dragons books down there or something.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.160
Save the books.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:52.480
Yeah.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:53.840
All right.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.640
You know, like the clothes too probably, right?

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.440
Save the clothes.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:57.840
Okay.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.720
Um, uh, uh, what, what, should we play a hefty, uh,

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.400
hearty, uh, uh, uh, round of Dungeons and Dragons?

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.400
Let's do it.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.560
Uh, I listened to last week's show.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:18.400
And, uh, I was, I was right.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.480
I was playing it, um, in, in a room and like picking things up.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.400
And I, I jaw-draft at the, at the show to the extent that I walked,

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.240
I walked over to the mirror to like witness my own expression on my face.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.560
Uh, I was, it was a great show.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.200
Yeah.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.760
See how fun, see how fun it is?

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.560
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm glad we got it.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.760
I'm glad we got it out of our system.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.800
We had, we had our show.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.040
I mean, I was, I was gushing about it earlier.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:47.520
I loved it.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.240
It was so, it was really, it was really fun to listen to with the,

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.640
I love the skeletons and the, and I love it.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.040
It was great.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:54.720
You guys did great.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.880
Anatoly sounded very sad to be playing my character.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:00.240
Yeah.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.000
Anatoly, what was up that last week?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.600
Were you a little, you were a little out of it.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:10.640
I was a little sleepy because like, I, I, I'm going to Rocky Horror Show.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.520
To Rocky Horror Show, like every week.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.560
It's on Sunday night.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.080
You're going to a, a recorder show?

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.040
A Rocky Horror Show.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.680
A Rocky Horror Show.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.640
Whoa.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.600
So like, I'm back at home like at four.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.160
Are you in, are you in the Rocky Horror Show?

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.680
No, I know, I just, I just go.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.000
You just go?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.240
You go to the Rocky Horror Picture Show every week.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:28.800
Yep, yep.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.280
It's a, it's a, it's a.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.520
And people get up and, people get up and do all the crazy stuff.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.400
Yep.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.200
It was fun.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.880
Did you have that in Russia?

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.280
Nope.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.040
No, just, I, I, I, I like this movie.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.640
Like, I, I was on, in, in France, in, in London, at least I, in stuff like that.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.240
So like, I really love it.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:53.840
So I like, yeah, I, I, I come like at four a.m.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.440
So, right as, as like last Sunday, like I was up at eight a.m.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:05.920
and I decided that I want to go to the farmers market, to Santa Monica, again, like, to house on

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:13.680
bus and to house back. So, like, I went there and then I come home, so it was around, I don't like,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:23.120
two or three p.m. so I just fell asleep and come to Harmontown. That's why I was not...

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:31.680
Now I'm drowsy. Alright. I'm airing her mic back for God's sake. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.400
Renatoly. But thank you for, thank you for playing, you did a, you did a bully job. Yes, thank you.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.720
I discovered Rocky Horror when I was in high school. That was a big turning point for me,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.680
getting out of the little suburban house, going downtown Milwaukee on Saturday night,

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:58.400
getting my curfew extended, seeing people like be gay and stuff. What character did you want to play?

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.720
I never, I was terrified at the prospect. If you had to, like, was there one that you're like,

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.800
I could, that guy? Well, I would have been, I would have been anybody that wasn't like as flamboyant

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:15.440
or cross-dressy because I probably was like suppressing, like, like this, like, my friend

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.080
in high school, like, he ended up joining the show and I was always like, how the fuck, like,

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.280
like, like, that's insane. I mean, I was just like, like, like, I was, I was, you know, 16, 17 years

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.920
old and I would, like, I'd never, I don't even think I had like smoked pot or anything by that

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.520
time. It's like maybe, you know, drank, drank beers and stuff in basements, but these, these were

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:42.640
grown-ups and like crazy people and it was downtown and God knows what they would get up to at their

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.080
apartments or backstage. I just remember looking at them as if they were like these crazy, they

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.440
might as well have been Prince or Boy George or like, like, David Copperfield. I had a really,

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.800
I only went to it once. I had a really bad experience with it. I was with Matt Gorley and

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.720
some friends in Santa Barbara or something. We were like, oh, let's go see that movie. We didn't

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.680
know that there was a big, you know, to-do and people put on the show and there's all this

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.320
interaction and stuff. But when we found out, oh, this is cool, this is weird. And, but there was

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.840
a thing when they asked like, there was a, there was a couple of really dodgy, not to be mean, but

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:22.800
just to describe them, some really creepy frail, syphilitic old queens that were running it. And

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.120
they're like, are there any virgins out there? And I was like, yeah, it's like, like, a lot of people

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.160
hadn't, hadn't, they were virgins to Rocky Horror, but they didn't raise their hands. I did. And I

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.040
was taken up on stage, like, like Fei Rui and King Kong and they, and all of, all of the men,

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.880
and they're a little, like, they're little Speedos and they're a little, like, dingy, sweaty,

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.960
like, like, not been washed ever, like, spandex and, and, and, and like, lingerie and like, like,

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.680
hairy legs with garters and stockings on. They all stood with their legs apart, like, in a line,

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.800
and I had to lay down, like, I was laid down on the stage and my arms out and my feet, obviously

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.560
out. And they all straddled me, like, three or four or five of these guys. And then two other

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.800
guys picked, picked me up by the hands and feet and just like, rammed me up into their dicks and

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:15.600
balls. Just like, kind of, just like, kaboom, kaboom, just like, just, just, just old, syphilitic,

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.760
cocking balls and ass and garters. That's not an origin story.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.480
That's how, that's how he got his psychic powers. He went home and there was a suit hanging in his

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.440
closet mysteriously. I think there's a way to do that and make it fun for the guy that's getting

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:39.600
it done. That was, that was, that really was like, it was a big threshold, though, because it was,

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.160
I mean, there was, there was a lot of that going on. I think every company that does Rocky Horror,

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.160
that's like part of their function ceremonially, you know, there's the guy that plays

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.880
Frank and Furter, you know, is, is, is, you know, is going to be this big flamboyant,

01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.800
like, like, covered in makeup, fishnets, like, like, like, outgoing, like, dude who's, like,

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.920
challenging your sexuality while you're in line and then, like, dragging people up and the whole

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.760
company is like, man, I'm on the fringe and this is like the east side, the fucking art town, like,

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.960
like, like, I, and the terror, like, like, and, and then the most important thing, like,

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:23.120
going through those moments and, and, and being afraid of, like, what might happen and then

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.800
realizing, like, any haunted house or anything that physical contact with people that don't do

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.360
the same things you do or dress the same way you do doesn't actually, there's nothing, you know,

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.000
it doesn't, you wake up the next morning and now you're just cooler, you're not, nothing happened,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.600
you're not, you're not gay or you're not, unless you want to be, you're not, you're not, you're,

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.320
you're, you're in full control of everything the whole time, like, nobody has needles in their

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:54.640
hands, nobody, these guys are pretty scary, it was touching go, a lot, a lot of touch,

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.800
heavy on the touch, but I was, I remember walking down the halls of my high school,

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:04.400
you know, the following Mondays, I could just feeling like I had graduated something, and I

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.720
was, I was, it was, I bet my posture changed a little bit, somehow it changed back in the interim,

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:16.560
but it was a valuable service provided at the local downtown, independent movie theaters in

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.720
our little small towns, there's little kids like me, where are you gonna go to see a Tarantino

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:32.560
movie back before Tarantino was an Oscar winner and stuff, but thank God. Did you add, were you

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:41.280
called up as a, as a virgin, did you do that in Italy? I didn't, no. Every answer to every

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:51.600
question is so sleepy and sad. Oh, no. Yeah, all right, it's, it's, it's also a weird tune

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.560
how to think that, like, you can get, probably get on YouTube and just watch Rocky Horror Picture

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.320
Show, I'm sure you can certainly get on DVD, back then it was like the big, the first question

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.760
that people would have, because they're like, you go in and you yell out stuff on cue, it was always

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.520
like the idea that there was such a thing as a script for the movie or, or a copy of it that

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.560
you could watch in practice or something, that was unheard of, it was such a, it was such a

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.040
mystical thing, you had to go to this theater to see this movie. Yeah, I probably have the same

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.560
experience that a lot of people do when they go to see Rocky Horror, I thought that like,

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.160
the people that I was seeing it with for the first time had come up with all those

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.800
things and thought they were also cool and I'm sure afterwards, because I do this,

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.920
if I watched a performance that I really like, I was probably like, that was really clever,

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.160
those callbacks were really, really good, good, but they've been around for years and years.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.000
Me and my friends, we were trying to start new stuff, it was kind of a sad

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.520
and it's just random stuff, like we would pick a spot in the movie where we just yell out,

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:52.560
Charlie Brown! And see if it took off. Did you get any? I think we got a couple of nibbles,

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.800
but probably just new people who came the previous week and heard Charlie Brown and

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.960
somehow, you know, nothing ever took off. Dumb experiment, 17 years old. All right.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.960
All right, Spencer, shall we get this underway? Uh, yeah.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.600
New sheets.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.880
Last time on Harmontown, after bargaining for the life of Sharpie Butzelot,

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:28.240
from the Fornheim, the frozen city, more specifically the Jarl of Fornheim,

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.560
you left the city and put on a show in the blizzard.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.800
All right, kill the music. That's it? That's all that happened.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.760
Spencer, everybody, certain sweet.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:51.200
Thank you. Well, a lot's going to happen tonight, my friends. Well, yeah.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:58.720
So you guys are in an icy, icy canyon. You walked in there because it was the only way through.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.600
A mole rain cast resist elements. Yeah, so we're good to go.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.200
Yep. All right, so let's press on and keep going through this canyon and see what, see what goes.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.480
Do we need someone to play Chris de Burgher? Should we go without? Huh? Whatever you guys want.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.520
Dan's making poopy face. No, you pick somebody. I just can't bear to be the picker. Huh?

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.160
First hand that shot up. Okay. I forgot. Tyler's going to help us out.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.480
Hello. Hello. I was tempted. I saw Levi's hand go up, too. That might have been a good way to

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.160
go, too. Either way. Yeah. Hello, Tyler. Welcome. Hi. How are we going? All right. So we walked down

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:46.160
the canyon. Yeah, you do. What a show. You were kind of light in it. You didn't really... I would

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.040
have thought when we started that show that you would have really dove in, but you just, you

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.960
didn't really do anything. She was a wrapped audience member the entire time. I don't know.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.600
Yeah, I got really overwhelmed. I was so excited. I got in my head. I had so many things that I

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:05.040
wanted to do, and then I just got really sleepy. But it was... Well, I sang my first new song since

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.040
Lady in Red. I don't even remember. It was a great beautiful song. I remember it was... What was it

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.640
called again? What was the title? Geez, I don't even remember what the song was. It was... It slipped

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.840
my mind. It was a moment of beauty that just passed and it's gone. Make it up. Make up a title.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.520
The Daughter of Blue. The Daughter of Blue. It was a good song. It was a good song. All right.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.280
Let's press on. You hear footsteps behind you crunching in the snow. Say, you guys...

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:36.560
It's not. That's behind all of us. I'm behind you, and I heard it from behind me, and I'm the last

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.240
one. Is he in the rear? Yeah, I'm in the rear, and that's my... I turn all the way around.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:50.880
Turning all the way around. You see among the ice and snow a familiar gnoll named Yerch. Yerch.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:18:00.240
He's like, hey guys. I kind of disappeared around that Forzan city thing, but I'm back. We're going

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:09.920
north, right? Hell yeah. Who could forget Yerch? Who could forget Yerch? He's the P one, right?

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:17.120
The one that smells like pee all the time? Oh yeah. Okay. All right. What species is he?

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:24.480
He's a gnoll. A gnoll, right? Oh, gnoll. Yeah, P, P, P, gnoll. Okay. Yerch.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.240
I'm just saying, you know, I was scouting. You guys are going the wrong way, by the way.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.600
All right. Were we not supposed to talk to the giants? No, I mean, just in this canyon,

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.560
you must have got turned around, but I just came back from scouting ahead. They have this big black

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:46.400
gate. It's crazy. It's full of demons and shit. So we shouldn't be going towards the black gate?

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.520
Well, I mean, we should, right? We got to kill them. Yeah. Let's go to that gate. So we got to be

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:59.760
careful. Okay. All right. You guys go ahead. You're not coming? I mean, I'll stay in the back.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:07.600
Okay. I'll be careful. All right. You all right, Yerch? I mean, yeah, it's just another day.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:15.360
I wonder, where have you been? We haven't seen you. I know that you were assigned to follow us,

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.440
and I just haven't seen you in so long. You know, frost giants can stomp on you.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.160
I haven't heard. We had no experience with that. Well, yeah, I mean, I would have known that you

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:33.120
got stomped on personally, but I'm sure that's true. I want to take a sidebar with my friends.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:34.800
I'll be over here.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:43.360
To the extent that I ever knew Yerch, like I just don't think that this is Yerch.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:49.200
Yerch is acting really weird. Are you saying you think all Knowles look the same?

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.760
No. Who has good perception? Not me.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.080
Or some kind of no, don't want you guys have like no intention or whatever,

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.760
detect intention. Sense motive, thank you. I have zero points in sense motive.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.960
Oh, I have nine points in it, but zero. I mean, I think I'm a sensitive person.

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.480
All right, Spencer, I have nine points in sense motive. I can try to see if he's up to anything

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:27.840
fancy. He doesn't seem to be up to anything. Would you roll? I rolled a four.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.640
All right, can I? This seems like he's on the level. I don't know. I'm going to cast detect

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:43.120
thoughts on him. You detect his thoughts. What's he thinking? These guys sure are looking at me,

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:59.600
strange. What'd you get, Sharpie? I just, it's Yerch. Okay. Yerch, how many demons are at this big

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:09.440
black gate? Like seven. And that's on the far side of that is going to be Admiral Darkstar,

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:16.720
we're hoping, right? Behind the gate lies the black keep. All right, guys, we didn't come this far

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.320
to turn around now. I'm feeling pretty energized in that show. Absolutely. I think I think I think

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:28.480
Group Morale is at an all time high. It's an all time high. Let's let's go. That's a nice skeleton

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:34.720
army you got, by the way. Oh, I forget. Oh, yeah, we got Tuskets too. We're good. We're good. Thank

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.480
you, Yerch. But at what cost? Yeah, what cost? That's true. Do you think that maybe there's a

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:47.200
demand for this show as a run? Yeah, I think it was a one off. Wasn't our only audience those

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.480
flying things that were coming from the sky? There were some mosquitoes or some gnats that

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:58.480
watched it. Yeah. All right, let's let's to the gate. Yeah, I mean, do I have cocoa? Yeah, I get on cocoa.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.600
Do you think that Mully, what the hell is your name? We're playing three different D&D games.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.000
I'm so confused. I'm quirk. Quirk, do you think you could, would you, do you think you could scout

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.840
ahead maybe and okay, I'm gonna send a venture up. Do you maybe want someone who has stealth to go

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.480
first and check it out? Yeah, he's, he's, he's stealthier than me. He's a rogue. Yeah, yeah.

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.920
First, I'm going to send a venture. A venture. Fly up. I just want to get a distance. I don't

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:33.520
want to talk to Yerch about it. Like it's, I think he's high. And so I'm going to send a venture to

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.240
see how far the black gates are. You send a venture up into the sky. But after a moment or two, he

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.920
returns. He gives you a look that says it's snowing. It's too hard to see from up here. I'm not used to

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:58.320
this kind of climate. It's cold. It's a very subtle look. Richly nuanced. I almost thought it was

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.400
going to be a wrap. Well, a lot of cadence to that. All right. Well, what do I want you to, what

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.920
do you, do you stealth types scout ahead? I don't know. I'll go with you. All right.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.920
Just stay a little bit behind. Christopher and I walk ahead and I have my, my, my, my sword out,

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:20.400
you know, at the ready. The two of you go ahead down this icy canyon and you round an icy bend

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.720
and you see it. The black gate, it extends maybe 100 feet tall and you can see about four levels

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:36.800
of catwalks that are kind of strung together by these metal stairs. Standing on the catwalks,

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.720
kind of patrolling around our black armored dudes as well as these beardy demons and devils that you

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:49.040
kind of saw and fought with at a yellow camp. How many of them are there? There's seven demons and

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:56.160
you count one, two, four human guys, whole armored guys. And then three of the bearded demon types?

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:02.560
No, there's seven demons and then four guys. Okay. All right. Is there a, Chris, any reason

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.120
why we were sent ahead to go do this and the whole crew couldn't come? So they don't see everybody.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.680
I mean, they're patrolling in places. Okay. Well, I go back and I report to you guys that I give them

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:19.120
the info, the recon. Catwalks, you say. Catwalks. Stairs? Yeah. It's kind of like, it's kind of like

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.680
a stage, a stage production of West Side Story. You know, it's like, it's like, it's like, or like,

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.640
or like rent. It's like a big fire escapey kind of thing. So they've got the high ground. I wonder

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:33.280
if there's any way we could get up there. So we're not walking under them. We can pick them off,

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.080
pick off a couple of them before we fully engage. Or maybe destroy the stairs and make the catwalks

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.360
fall or something. We should probably go before our, you know, sizable skeleton army goes forward,

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.440
maybe pick a couple of them off and then, you know, so they don't have enough time to escape.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:54.000
Then we call the cavalry. Gentlemen, maybe I can use my tree token. I have a tree token.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:02.880
What? Tree token. I have a tree token. What does that do? Tree token. I, if I, if I throw it on

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:09.680
the ground, a tree, a tree will grow. Okay. Are we going to tree token hide behind the tree? We

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:15.600
could climb the tree or I sheepishly take my tree token and put it back in my pocket.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.960
I appreciate the effort. What's on the sides of the gate? What's flanking this gate? Well,

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.600
it's just like wedged into the ice. Oh, into the canyon. There's no way to climb the walls of the

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.800
canyon. None unless you have climbing spikes. I think that's what they're called, right? Sure.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:39.440
Would it be a lame waste of the skeletons to just do the old saunter out there go, hey,

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:46.880
fuck you guys and run back and stand behind the skeletons? I mean, all right. Wouldn't they call

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.720
reinforcements though? If they see a couple of us go, hey, we're here. Yeah, they might, they might

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.560
open the gate and bring out a bunch of fun. Uh, there's, we should send more people. No, but he's,

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.000
he's saying like, like wave and like, like we'll moon them and we'll show them our ass and then

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.640
they'll all come, those guys at the gate will just think it's a couple of people and they'll

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.480
come running and they'll come over there and they'll be the, the cast of Ben Hur will be there.

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.160
Right. Well, and we could instruct our skeletons to lie on the ground like it's a, like they're

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.600
fallen soldiers. Maybe someone who has bluff could be like, there's only a couple of us. We'll just

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.840
hang out, have a good time. Yeah, it's just an act. We don't have an army of skeletons over here.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.520
I said we just, I said we just advance. I said, I said we just come in there and kick these guys's

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.960
ass. Fireball? Fireball? Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's give them everything we got. Let's just

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:36.080
come in and just fucking, I am that exhausted. Yeah. I've been solving problems all day. I think

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:44.160
we'll just, let's just blunt force it. All right. So, uh, so who's taking lead then? I'll, I'll go

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:50.480
forward first. I'm on my horse before the skeletons or it's a very least like why don't we just,

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.800
just, just one preliminary. I mean, let me, let me just do this. I've always wanted to do this.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:01.440
I'll just walk. I'm just going to walk around the bend and then you go like, Hey, you guys got

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:16.720
changed for a dollar? My wife and I, we, uh, need change for a dollar. Also look at this tree.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.160
All the guys on the wall kind of like turn towards you and they're looking at you and the bearded

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.440
devils kind of hold out their arms and they start to be wreathed with flames.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:37.200
All right. See you. I'll be over here. Bye. And then I retreat like a coward. Okay. And I walk to

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:46.240
behind the skeleton army and I read a book. You hear the crunching of footfalls and then the four

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.280
armored men are upon you. They've managed to scramble down this gate and chase you guys down

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.640
to where you guys are. I general the skeletons into kind of a thermopoly, you know, Spartan kind

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:04.320
of thing. Close off the pass. Okay. They seal off the pass, but these guys are approaching.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:11.440
Right. They're going to let them clash. Yeah. That makes sense. Do the demons see the 40 skeletons

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.520
and it's like, fuck it. We're going to keep going. Yeah. You know, okay. They don't give a fuck.

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:21.440
They're very confident. They're just demons. What does my power bracelet do? It just gives you

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:30.800
plus two strength included on your stat block. Fun rules. All right. You see your skeleton army

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:37.040
kind of engage with the enemy. These these human guys in armor kind of clash and the skeletons

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:42.800
are actually really well trained and magical and cool and stuff. But two of them managed to just

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.280
slice the two of the guys in half. Yeah. And the other three don't manage to do as well. And they

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.560
just kind of poke at at these armored guys, but only five can get in right now. But then the

01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:00.400
rest kind of have them surrounded. And armored guys see that they're they're going to lose,

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.720
but the skeletons aren't aren't going for the final blow right now. They're just surrounding them.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:11.040
All right. I jump in with my flaming sword and attack the nearest armored guy.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.600
With your flaming sword, you jump into the fray, but you trip over a femur of one of the skeleton

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:29.280
swords. So these guys are alive and are kind of like at the at the sword points of our skeleton

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:37.120
emissaries. The skeletons are kind of waiting. Gentlemen, looks like you're in a skeleton

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:51.840
situation. We can't we can't use bone voyage again. Tell us how where's the back door?

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.000
What? Is there another entrance to the temple? I mean,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.520
what? You're asking is that gate? It's not a temple. The gate. The fuck you guys.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:14.800
Harmon quest ended. Well, we're going to Admiral Darkstar's fortress. Yep.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.880
Is there another way in? Oh, the only way is through this gate. Or if you have climbing

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:26.880
equipment, you could climb up the canyon and then go around this gate. Or you could wait for this

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:38.160
gate to open. What is it open for? You know, large traffic. We're large traffic. What, like a bus?

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.120
Maybe. Bus. Let's keep, let's keep killing these guys. We're standing around talking. Yeah.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.400
I thought maybe they haven't gotten any useful information out of them. They said no, go through

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:59.440
the gate. Large traffic. That's arguably useful. All right. Skeletons forward. Are you going to

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:03.920
kill the guys? Large traffic. Often can we like wait and like hitch a ride, like behind a wagon

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.640
and like sneak our way in. I don't think we can sneak an army. You know who waits? Cowards. Fine.

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:14.400
Fools. Whatever. I shoot an arrow at a skeleton. Let's kick some ass. You do sarcastically shoot

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:20.880
an arrow at a skeleton. Whatever. The skeletons dispatch the remaining guys and you continue on

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:29.120
towards the gate. Yeah. Good. Good job, skeletons. As you approach the gate, you hear loud sounds.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.520
They sound kind of like what sirens would sound like if you knew what sirens were.

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:40.800
Get out of the way. This is definitely magical in nature. But at the same time, you see the gate

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:46.880
that grows. It doesn't grow. A split kind of develops in its middle and it swings open like a

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.720
giant door and standing in that giant door is one of the largest ogres you've ever seen,

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:59.520
almost 40 feet tall, with a small metal platform on his back. And you see kind of dudes standing

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:07.520
on this platform on this back holding crossbows. His ogre starts lumbering through the gate.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:16.080
He's got a sniper perch on his back. Let's throw some magic at this guy right off the bat.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:23.600
Yeah. When I get to go, I'll shoot a fireball at him. You get to go. Fireball.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.800
Same with a little more gusto, man. Fireball.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:36.720
All right. Where do you aim it? Like at the guy or at the platform?

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:41.520
I'm aiming it at the... Well, would I be able to hit the guys on the platform?

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:46.160
Yeah, if you aimed towards it, but it would be like away from his center of mass, I guess.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.640
Yeah, well, I'll aim for the platform. Yeah, okay. That's what I assumed, by the way,

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:59.600
for all you podcast listeners. Yeah, so you do that. You throw your fireball in it,

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:05.520
arcs up over the guy's shoulder, right onto the metal platform where these snipers are stationed,

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.920
and it explodes, and you see, you know, two corpses just fly off. Yeah.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.920
The rest of the guys take seven fire damage. Fuckin' yeah. It's nice. I mean, yeah.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.560
Yeah. How many of them are up on that platform?

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.120
You don't know, because it's such a large platform. I don't have any ranged weapons.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.280
I can't really throw... I can't really get them from a distance.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.840
You have a tree. I have a shortbow. I can finish them all.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.800
Is it my turn?

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.400
No, it's not. It's the tree.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.360
I want to see a tree, too, you guys.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.960
Adam Goldberg suggested this. I'm going to throw it out there. He said,

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.080
plant the tree under the ogre's nuts and have a tree grow up into it.

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.440
A tree grow up into the butt.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.880
And the old tree dick maneuver.

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.960
That's called the Jolly Roger, isn't it?

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.080
God, I wish it were 15 minutes later. That would have been at the end of the show.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.040
Well, I... Hmm. All right. Well, how close can I get to the ogre?

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.560
You'd be able to get to where it was standing if you ram.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.320
Okay.

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.360
But not if you walked.

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:30.640
Well, I'm on Coco. I gallop over to the ogre. I look over at Sharpie. I give him a wink.

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.240
Something's about to happen.

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.640
I gallop up to the ogre right between his legs.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:46.880
I reach for my quiver for a second and then I'm like, no, no, no, just do this.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:55.600
I take my token and I throw it at the ground between his legs and I say, who's the sap now?

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:08.960
I'd like to see dur you die. Maple tree. So I do that.

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:16.080
You thrust the tree token into the soft snow and then before your varied eye, very eyes.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.360
My various eyes.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.760
Before your various sensory organs.

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.920
A tree springs into being. It grows in girth as well as length.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:33.680
As it reaches its final height, which is somewhere between this ogre's midsection.

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.720
It smashes him right through the pelvis.

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.520
Well done. And he takes 20 damage.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:53.440
I think the very clever little witty back braced angel on my shoulder.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.960
At the moment, he can't move. His legs are kind of too far from the ground to move at the moment.

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.280
Awesome.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.560
So he's like a popsicle right now?

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.360
Like a popsicle.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.680
All right. Who's up?

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.720
Throw it to Tyler.

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.960
All right. Let's see. So I want to get the rest of these snipers out of the way.

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:19.920
So we don't have to worry about them.

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.600
As you can swear by this big slow ogre.

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.120
Amulet of autumn can become invisible for five rounds twice a day.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.400
I want to use that to get behind them so I can pick the rest of the guys off.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.000
Activating your amulet of autumn, you gain invisibility.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:32.400
All right.

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.000
And then what was it?

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.080
You wanted to get behind them?

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.160
I want to see if I can get kind of behind where the ogre came out of the gate, right?

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.040
You can do that.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.960
Okay. I'm going to get behind them.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.680
You do that.

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.000
All right.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.600
And I'm going to take a shot with my sharp bow at one of the remaining guys up there.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:04.400
Yeah. You strike the guy directly in the, not directly in the shoulder, indirectly in the shoulder.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.840
He takes seven damage.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.400
Nice.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.600
Did you have the 1d10?

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:11.760
Four.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.200
It says I get 1d10 damage.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.680
Oh yeah. No. Thanks for reminding me.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.440
Hey man. I don't have to learn all the rules.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.400
I'm helping.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.600
I'm just telling everyone.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.520
That's why it's literally written on the sheets.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.400
So I don't have to memorize everything.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.040
Anyway, that's an extra seven damage.

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.360
So I said seven, 14 damage.

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:35.680
Yeah.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.680
What's the damage to the player-dungeon master relationship?

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.760
I mean, the relationship?

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:46.800
It's dead.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.600
It's purely dead.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.640
That's what he really puts on it.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:50.960
Anyway.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.600
Who's up?

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.360
Not the ogre. It's your turn.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.760
I take a flaming far sword and swipe at the chest of the ogre.

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.760
Is the far sword long enough to do that?

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.680
Okay. It's far.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.040
Flaming far sword, swipe.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.480
Swinging your flaming sword.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.000
You unleash a crackling arc, arc, arc, whatever,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.760
of windy flaming energy.

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.760
And it strikes him, does it?

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.880
Yeah, it strikes him.

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.360
Directly in the chest.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:18.400
Yeah.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.680
Yeah, the chestal regions.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.280
Dealing.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.480
That's 1d10 plus 1d6 plus four.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.280
Plus four?

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:25.840
Yeah.

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:26.880
10 damage.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.280
Yeah.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:33.120
Yeah. You're right to applaud that.

01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:35.920
He seems a little worse for wear.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:39.280
And then, you know, you see a couple of the snipers remaining

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.360
take their positions at the edge of his thing,

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.080
and they fire down on you with crossbow bolts.

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:49.280
Yeah.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.680
So Sharpie, you get hit with one of these bolts.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.960
And as it strikes you, you feel caustic burn

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.360
as acid seeps into your skin.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.160
You take five burning damage.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.040
You made him make a poopy face.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.760
Acid will do that to you.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.240
The other arrow misses.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.280
But then the ogre starts striding towards you.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.560
He's off the tree?

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.840
Uh, yeah.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.120
Like, he's kind of...

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.840
Starts striding towards you, like that.

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.480
All right.

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.120
Yeah.

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.600
But I mean, it took all that effort to get off.

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.400
So that's it.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.040
That's it for me.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:31.840
That's his turn, huh?

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.480
I love it.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.000
Did the tree go up his butt?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.600
No, it just kind of...

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:37.920
You want to be technical.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.560
It caught him right in the taint.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.040
Right.

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.080
There is a bit of like wooden penetration,

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.440
just not like that.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.040
Like, like, you know, you're not going to get hit.

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.240
A thorn getting rammed up to your taint

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:55.760
might pierce break the skin.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.520
It was like that.

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.160
Taint the butt.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.880
He's, he's since...

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:02.960
He's moved past it.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.440
But that's like his prostate muscle, right?

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:08.640
Yeah.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.080
No, he's coming loads.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.760
Oh!

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.960
You guys, that's not snow.

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.320
We just made an ogre come.

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.720
By wrapping a magical tree into his taint.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.080
I put that on my resume.

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.120
Does he get sleepy?

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:33.360
No.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.920
Does he want to take a little nap?

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.160
No.

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.560
Does he want nothing to do with us now?

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.320
Should we just leave?

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.200
We should just leave, right?

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.920
I mean, he's pissed.

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.040
I asked him about his feelings.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.240
Is it Sharpie's turn?

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:00.000
Yeah.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.560
That's whose turn it is.

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.840
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to,

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:15.040
I'm going to, I'm just going to cast fireball on this ogre again.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.480
Okay.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.880
Actually, I'm going to, I'm going to cast on that platform.

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.720
I don't want to get shot with any more arrows.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.560
There's still two left up there, right?

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.040
Yeah.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:23.280
Okay.

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.120
You throw your fireball again.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.200
It whizzes right over the ogre's shoulder

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.920
before impacting and exploding on the thing.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.040
I think it was a platform.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.880
You see flaming corpses fall off the side.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.520
Two of them.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:44.720
All right.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:46.320
Hell yeah.

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:51.600
Clear platform.

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.600
Roger.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.000
All right.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.600
I wipe off my face with a rag that's in my, in my pocket.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.640
And I, I was standing there.

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.360
He came on you?

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.720
I was standing there.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.680
I only assumed.

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.400
He was wearing pants in my mind.

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:10.880
Okay.

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.200
Just come out of a raging boner.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.360
I mean, why would he come?

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360
Just because his prostate got pierced.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.720
It's, you don't know ogre anatomy, man.

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.240
Well, I want to know more about this ogre's pants.

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.080
What is a smart ogre wearing these days?

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.920
Well, this is no smart ogre.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.960
But I mean, just, just, just standard burlap kind of.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.200
Okay.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.400
Just now filled with cum.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:43.760
Yeah.

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:46.240
You can see it kind of, you know, burlap's not.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:47.440
All right.

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.880
Well, I, I, it's messy.

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.240
It's a porous material.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:50.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:53.280
I only wipe off my face because it's, it's covered in

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.520
perspiration because I've been riding my horse.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.520
I'm going to, uh, I take out my, um, my speedy long bow.

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:03.680
Yeah.

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.080
I whip it around in front of me or whatever you call the

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.920
action of, uh, putting it in the position of, uh, shooting it.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:12.960
Knock an arrow.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.080
Sorry.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.280
You knocked the arrow.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.000
I knocked the arrow.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.960
I'm going to knock a fiery arrow at the ogre's face.

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:23.840
And so I do that.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.240
You launch a fiery arrow right in the ogre's face.

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.040
And it strikes right there.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.400
Dealing six fire damage.

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:39.280
Nice.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:39.760
Nice.

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.200
Go get him to Berg.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.480
All right.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.280
Uh, so this tree that kind of grew up into him, he hopped off it,

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.280
but like the tree is still mostly in shape.

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:47.920
Oh yeah.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.200
Do you want, you want to jump on?

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.440
I kind of want to get on the tree and then leap onto him.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.640
Go for it.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.280
I want to do that.

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.000
Let's do that.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.360
You're, you're invisible right now, right?

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.200
I shot an arrow so I broke invisibility.

01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:57.360
Unfortunately.

01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:57.680
Yep.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.280
Ah, every time.

01:43:59.280 --> 01:43:59.680
Whatever.

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:02.160
He's, he's worried, he's worried about you.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.960
You shot a fiery arrow at his face and knocked his prostate.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.080
So he's, I'm off to you.

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:06.400
You know what?

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.440
He's not worried about me.

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.520
I, I follow, follow your heart.

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.240
I just, I do what I have to.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:14.160
You're more analytical this week than you are normally.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:15.360
Just go with it, go with it.

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.000
Strangely.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.840
Can we hear a couple of lines with the daughter of blue

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:18.640
before you go up there?

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.560
Her hands are so small.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.040
I don't know.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:26.880
That's good enough.

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:27.440
I just wanted to.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:28.800
I know.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.320
I want to hear the rest of this pot.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.400
And I want to know if we're learning about Tyler's sexuality.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:36.480
So small.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:44.080
Um, I'd like to climb the tree.

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.040
Who's that?

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:45.920
Can we do that?

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:46.400
Yeah.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.760
You climb the tree.

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.320
Okay.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.120
I'm assuming I'm not going to have any leftover thing

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.800
to do anything besides climb the tree this round.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.080
Well, yeah.

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:55.440
I always try to push it.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.680
You just take position up in this tree.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.200
Can I get ready?

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.440
Can I, you know, can I get into a fierce crouch

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.560
with my poison dagger out?

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.920
Like, what?

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:04.480
Assume.

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:05.280
Okay.

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:05.840
Okay.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.200
How many fierce crouch?

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:07.920
Yeah, you are.

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.160
Fiercely crouching in a tree.

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.840
You wait for your next turn.

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:16.640
We're good.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.840
I, uh, I run at him and do a power attack with my sword

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:22.240
at his, uh, at his like Achilles tendon.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:27.040
Hacking at his Achilles tendon with your flaming sword.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:27.840
You do so.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.480
Dealing 12 damage.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.200
Yeah.

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:33.760
Yeah.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.440
He kind of falls down to one leg.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.920
Oh, so I kind of, now he's just lower for him

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.320
in the tree.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.120
Is that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.240
I mean, I kind of like Jim on his back and crouch

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.440
his head and start stabbing him in the ears.

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:43.760
Awesome.

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:44.560
Yeah, I like it.

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:44.800
Yeah.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.320
Well, it's his turn.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.600
He reaches down and swats at you, Quark,

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.680
who's stabbing at his knees.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.440
Achilles tendon.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.120
Whatever.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.680
Those, isn't that where those are?

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.160
Below your calf.

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.360
I took classes.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.160
No, it's a, yeah, I know where that, it's in the taint.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.920
But he, yeah, no, he, he, he, he fumbles around.

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:20.640
He, he has a hard time, you know, grabbing at you

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.920
since you're so tiny.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:22.400
Yeah.

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.200
And he doesn't.

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.000
Sweet.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.760
He gropes about, but fails.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.960
He's got a big load in his drawers right now.

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.400
He's got a lot to deal with.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.680
He's got a big cut in his chest.

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.320
He's on fire.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.560
He's got a sliced heel.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.680
We're sending the most confusing signals right now.

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.200
Poor guy just had the biggest orgasm of his life

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.240
putting in a sharp Easter.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.880
Oh, uh, I, uh, I want to, I want to use my arm.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.240
No, I don't.

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.880
I don't want to use my armlet.

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.680
Can I, can I just cast fireball on his face again?

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.000
Oh, level are you?

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.480
No, you only have two level three spells, I think.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:02.880
All right.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.040
Sorry, buddy.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:05.680
It's all right.

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:06.640
Don't, don't be sorry.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.200
It's not you.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.120
I want to get out of here just as much as you do.

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.000
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to cast jump

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.480
and see if I can jump up onto the, uh, uh,

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:23.200
ogre, just to, just to make, uh, Christopher Mad.

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:26.240
Casting jump.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.640
You leap astride the ogre right in front of Christopher.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.080
That's my spot.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:34.800
I'm going to jump there.

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:37.920
Staying to your fierce crouch.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.120
Is that, is that my move?

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:42.880
Yeah.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.320
Okay.

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.880
Um, I, uh, I, I, I crouch fiercely, you son of a bitch.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.080
Do I, do I have more than one tree token?

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.040
No, that was it.

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.080
Yeah.

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:55.600
I know guys.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.240
I'm sorry too.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:57.680
Um,

01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.560
Oh, so you just, your turn.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:58.880
I'm sorry.

01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.200
Oh, sorry.

01:47:59.200 --> 01:47:59.600
Oh, it's okay.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:00.000
Oh, it's okay.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:00.800
We're going this way.

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:06.240
I am going to, I'm going to use my, my armlet of summer to

01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:07.840
heat up metal.

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:09.280
Okay.

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.400
I'm going to heat up the steel that I have in my

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:14.880
possession, throw it into my backpack.

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:16.560
What steel?

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.240
You just like have a plate of steel?

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:18.560
Yeah.

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:18.960
Yeah.

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:21.920
For, for striking out, for stoking, starting fires.

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:22.240
Okay.

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:22.800
Crouch.

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.080
I heat up the steel.

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.240
I throw it into my backpack.

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:31.120
I create like a, I cut a little part of it.

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.880
So, and I tie, I tie, it'll get there.

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:41.120
I tie my rope to like the strap of the backpack and I

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:47.840
create like a, a souped up, um, uh, who fought Goliath?

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.560
David.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.040
David.

01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.840
I, I, uh, like a soup.

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.040
Who fought Goliath?

01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.920
Peanut butter and, uh, what do you call it?

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.600
That's got fruit in it.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.840
I, I whip it around my head.

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:09.280
Sling.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.240
Yeah.

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:11.520
So like a slingshot, exactly.

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.040
But a souped up slingshot and when it's in the exact

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:19.280
right position, I hurl it at his, at his throat.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:23.040
So I don't hit Sharpie and the idea being that it's

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.800
like Schrab.el and that the metal, so you, so roll it.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:41.840
So, yeah, no, you, you do that, you whip it up as, as you

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:44.560
start whipping it around your head, the backpack starts

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:50.640
catching fire and Jesus Christ, you guys.

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.000
What am I a monster and you throw it and it hits him in

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.280
the throat?

01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.560
What were you expecting?

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.440
You're such a feisty mood tonight, Spencer.

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:01.840
I know.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.040
I'm all over the place.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:08.720
I don't get it.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.960
Dealing 11 damage.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.320
The ogre clutches at his burning throat.

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.160
I got to say, I didn't think that was going to work.

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:22.480
I had just time wise and she accomplishes so much in a

01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:28.000
turn, it's like a, watching a PBS show, she makes a rocking

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.920
chair and then sits in it, makes lemonade and then invites

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:38.640
the, the enemy to drink the lemonade, but then I guess I'm

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.600
jealous, I'm jealous.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:44.400
Yeah, he just claws at his throat as it's on fire.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:46.560
That happens.

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.360
Finish him to Burke.

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.640
All right, I want to, I'm already fiercely crouching.

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.400
I want to hop and I want to hop on this guy.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.680
Dan's right where I was going to go.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.840
So I try to go next to him.

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.200
I'd like to leap onto him.

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.040
You leap onto him.

01:50:59.040 --> 01:50:59.920
All right.

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:02.800
Is there any way I can get up to where his head is and throw

01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:04.880
rope down so we can get everyone up and everyone can just

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.840
beat on his head?

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:06.560
Yeah.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.280
Let's do that.

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:09.360
You do that.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:09.680
All right.

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:11.520
Charlie, come on, get up.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:18.400
I climb up the rope and, and I go down his pants.

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:21.040
No, no, don't go down there.

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.640
And I, and I, and I go, and I go up to his dick and balls and I,

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.840
and I, I use cleave.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.360
What's, what's your fortitude?

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.160
My fortitude?

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:37.760
My, my, my.

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.000
Do you realize how much ogre semen you're going to have to climb

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:40.800
through to get to this?

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.320
It wouldn't be my first time, Chris.

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:45.440
It would not be my first time.

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.560
Get into this semen slicked slacks.

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:57.680
You are overcome by the overcome smell.

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:02.240
Did you roll it?

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:03.760
And find yourself too nauseating.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:04.400
Oh no.

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:10.240
Do I, I just keep sliding down the pant leg until I come out.

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.520
And I come out and I do, I do one of those like,

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:16.240
like, uh, like Laurel and Hardy, one of those.

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:21.120
You need to, you need, you need to cut your way out of these pants.

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:22.240
He's on one knee.

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:24.160
You got to cut your way out of these burlap pants.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.560
No, I came down the other one.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:26.960
All right.

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:28.160
All right.

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:32.000
That was, that was, that did not go as planned, you guys.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.600
You should have stayed in his head, man.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:37.520
I, I didn't expect ogre come to be that, uh, that overwhelming.

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.240
Lesson learned.

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:39.840
Ogre come.

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:42.560
Ogre anything is putrid.

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:43.840
Egg, living learn.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:47.120
Yeah.

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:48.640
Well.

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.320
Well, indeed.

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.240
Sharpie, finish this guy.

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:52.880
Come on.

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:53.360
No.

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.880
First he bunches sharpie.

01:52:58.720 --> 01:52:59.680
Is it sharpie on him?

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.240
Is he like, Sharpie takes 12 damage.

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:06.000
Oh, whatever.

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.000
Uh, I have a thing called the rod of the serpent.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.040
What, what, yeah.

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.400
What does that do again?

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:15.920
It turns into a serpent.

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.880
There's a time and a place for that.

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.800
What did somebody yell out?

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.840
Throw it down his pants.

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.560
Oh, I'm not going to do anything clever.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:27.360
I mean, I'm on his head.

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:30.800
I just want to, I'm not a real bladed weapon kind of guy.

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.920
I'm just looking for a quick guy.

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.840
Did you climb up when you were on his head with us?

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.160
Yeah.

01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:39.600
I'm just going to do, can I do a scorching ray on his, on the back of his head.

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:42.880
Right where Ving Reim's bandaid would be.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:52.960
Casting your arms in a magical manner, you unleash a blazing, scorching ray directly into the,

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.440
what was that part of his head you mentioned?

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:58.160
This is where the, where the, the nape of his neck.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:53:59.520
Right, the nape of his neck.

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.360
And it burns.

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.520
And it burns.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.240
Dealing 16 damage.

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:06.720
Yeah.

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:13.920
You can kind of see through all this burn flesh and skin is exposed spinal column.

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:18.800
And he kind of, is he dead?

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.760
Yeah, we did.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.240
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.360
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.240
So I got the wrong thing.

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.040
I got the wrong thing.

01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:27.840
And keep grabbing.

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:30.560
Thank you for coming to Harmontown.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.040
I blew it.

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.280
Thank you so much, everybody.

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.400
Thank you, Tyler.

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.120
Thanks, guys.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.480
Thank you, Levi, for coming up.

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.840
Anatoly, Adam, for the great line.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:44.880
Everyone else we spoke to.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Erin McGathy, one more time for her, please.

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:52.400
Thanks so much, Spencer Crittenden.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.880
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.400
One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:57.680
Thanks, Bill.

01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.880
Thanks for the sticks, Bill.

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.880
And thanks, Seek, Seek Donnelly, for all of your free comic book stuff that was on your

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.480
seats when you came in here.

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:36.320
And God bless you, and we'll see you next week.
