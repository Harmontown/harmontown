{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.000\nHello, everybody. Welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, the Meltdown Theater\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:17.200\nHarmontown is now in session. Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmon\n\n00:17.200 --> 00:38.760\nTown. Fun times at Harmontown. I'm overcompensating. I'm a little exhausted. I'm bone sober and\n\n00:38.760 --> 00:43.560\na little wiped out. We're back on the thick of it over at community and I'm very excited\n\n00:43.560 --> 00:52.680\nabout the work we're doing. It's very thorough work. A lot of young writers being baptized\n\n00:52.680 --> 00:58.320\nby fire over there at Paramount right now. Where are you going, boss? I'll be right back.\n\n00:58.320 --> 01:05.320\nI'm going to get you some ice cream. We're working hard. We start shooting the first\n\n01:05.320 --> 01:15.680\nepisode of the fifth season tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. And then at lunchtime, we table\n\n01:15.680 --> 01:21.920\nread the second episode which we're supposed to be finished with by now. That's why we're\n\n01:21.920 --> 01:25.960\nhard at work back at the Kiebler Tree. Do you have to go back to work right after the\n\n01:25.960 --> 01:29.640\nshow? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're going back into Paramount or from home? I'm going to go\n\n01:29.640 --> 01:34.640\nback to Paramount, yeah. I'll probably sleep on my couch there in my little office. Chris\n\n01:34.640 --> 01:38.160\nMcKenna's got it worse. He said he was up at four this morning. I didn't ask him why,\n\n01:38.160 --> 01:42.200\nbut he's got to get some sleep or something. That's crazy. He's got a kid too. That's\n\n01:42.200 --> 01:46.160\nprobably why. That's probably the four a.m. thing. I don't know. I didn't ask him. I\n\n01:46.160 --> 01:50.240\nhad to run out the door. But anyways, I'm excited about what's going on over there and\n\n01:50.240 --> 01:56.320\nI'm just doing my best to make all you little rapscallions happy. But I am a little wiped\n\n01:56.320 --> 02:02.120\nout so I don't know what generates my entertainment on the nights when I'm really entertaining.\n\n02:02.120 --> 02:13.240\nIs it my boundless energy? Or liquor? Or fear or anxiety? I don't know. You could draw\n\n02:13.240 --> 02:16.440\noff the energy. I'm not just saying this in an ass kissy. You're the greatest audience\n\n02:16.440 --> 02:20.120\nin the world. But it's not a huge audience, but you've got twice the energy of a full\n\n02:20.120 --> 02:30.040\nhouse. It's good. It's really good. Yeah, I feel like I'm kind of betraying it. I feel\n\n02:30.040 --> 02:40.400\nlike we should do something to earn their energy. Let's spin the Wheel of Strangers.\n\n02:40.400 --> 02:50.640\nThere's no wheel for you listening. Who's in deep emotional pain in the audience? All\n\n02:50.640 --> 02:59.840\nright, a hand went up. There he is. It's Levi. Levi to the stage. I know this guy. Grab\n\n02:59.840 --> 03:05.080\nthat, Mike. Hello, Levi. I feel like I owe it to the home listener to state that you\n\n03:05.080 --> 03:12.720\nare, you've long, blonde, kind of carry Elvis from Princess Bride Hair. You also have his\n\n03:12.720 --> 03:17.880\nmustache from Glory, which is nice. It's my three musketeers' mustache. It's very nice.\n\n03:17.880 --> 03:24.440\nYou've got a nice wide-baneed corduroy maroon coat and your barefoot. Yes, this is fucking\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:28.920\ndescribing me. This is awesome. Yeah, barefoot to the show. Fuck shoes. Did you walk down\n\n03:28.920 --> 03:35.360\nHollywood sidewalks? Yeah, actually, I washed my shoes before I came here out of courtesy.\n\n03:35.360 --> 03:39.640\nYou washed your shoes? Oh, wait, fucking shoes. I'm really fucked up. I'm sorry. I washed\n\n03:39.640 --> 03:43.160\nmy feet before I came here. I say, I think you washed your shoes and you left them in\n\n03:43.160 --> 03:48.520\nthe dryer. They're still hanging back on the line. Hurry up and get back there. So, Levi,\n\n03:48.520 --> 03:57.800\nwe met in Madison. And you were driven up there during the Harmontown Tour from Idaho?\n\n03:57.800 --> 04:04.640\nSame thing. I owe whatever. And where you live on the banks of the Mississippi? Yes.\n\n04:04.640 --> 04:10.120\nAnd your big, big old Dan Harmon fan? Yeah, I have my girlfriend, I think, for that, but\n\n04:10.120 --> 04:15.840\nyou are... I'm not a fan, really. You're kind of... I've never had a hero, so I don't know\n\n04:15.840 --> 04:22.120\nhow to put that in terms, but, like, whatever that word is in comparison to you. What do\n\n04:22.120 --> 04:27.320\nyou find heroic? As a person, what do you find heroic about that? He's fucking getting\n\n04:27.320 --> 04:31.760\nup here and, like, this is scary shit, and I'm an actor, I do theater and stuff, but\n\n04:31.760 --> 04:37.000\nyou guys are fucking freaking me out right now. But not only that, but he gets up here\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:42.800\nand he doesn't do a bit, he doesn't put on shtick, he's just Dan Harmon up here. And\n\n04:42.800 --> 04:50.000\nall of us love him for that, don't we? That's the fucking reason I came here. Can I sit\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:58.600\ndown? I'm like... Yeah, yeah, please, sit down. Put your feet up. Apologies, Jeff. Can\n\n04:58.600 --> 05:02.800\nyou show the crowd the bottom of your feet? I just got a glimpse of this. Holy, what in\n\n05:02.800 --> 05:11.400\nthe Bangladesh? Yeah, jeez. Yeah, um, sooty. Yeah, that's your city, guys. Let's call\n\n05:11.400 --> 05:17.160\nyour feet sooty. Were you cleaning a chimney before you came over here? Just riding in\n\n05:17.160 --> 05:21.680\na car, Jeff. Alright. Well, that's what the bottom of shoes probably are like. And that's\n\n05:21.680 --> 05:25.600\nwhy I don't wear them. It's the same thing. Well, yeah, what about why not shoes? Well,\n\n05:25.600 --> 05:29.840\nbesides not shoes, and actually it's just more comfortable for me. You guys are personally\n\n05:29.840 --> 05:33.880\nthe weird ones. Every, all of you guys with shoes, I don't know how you can do it. Like,\n\n05:33.880 --> 05:43.000\nit's so there. Yeah, that's it. You fucking weirdos. You're all awful people. You shewers.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.440\nBut unlike, unlike something like if they all had pink bows on their heads, like shoes\n\n05:47.440 --> 05:54.720\nhave this like deeply practical purpose. No, they, they shield the human foot from broken\n\n05:54.720 --> 06:02.440\ncrack pipes and, and, and bees like like half dead bees on the beach. I did. In all honesty,\n\n06:02.440 --> 06:06.200\nactually, I said that don't wear shoes. I did wear it over a pile of dead cows just\n\n06:06.200 --> 06:10.200\na couple of weeks ago. You wore you were you wear shoes when you have to walk over dead\n\n06:10.200 --> 06:16.360\ncows. Yeah, I'm not an idiot. Fucking shit growing in there. Can we can we learn a little\n\n06:16.360 --> 06:21.920\nbit more about walking on dead cows? What do you want to know? I want to know why you're\n\n06:21.920 --> 06:28.400\nwalking on dead cows. What do you mean? What do I want to know? Did you have a hand in\n\n06:28.400 --> 06:33.480\ntheir death? Were they dead before you did? They wouldn't be in a pile like they are like\n\n06:33.480 --> 06:39.840\nthat's inhumane. But as an iron in California, I can't technically tell you why I was walking\n\n06:39.840 --> 06:46.080\non that dead pile. Besides the fact that it's a rich rich in nitrogen, and which is a good\n\n06:46.080 --> 06:54.760\nfertilizer for plants. Oh, for the podcast listeners, I was not winking. That was a\n\n06:54.760 --> 07:02.600\ntwit. I don't know. Are you supposed to use entire dead cows for fertilizer? You can use\n\n07:02.600 --> 07:09.320\nlive cows poop. I'm just making the best of a situation. I rent a property and I live\n\n07:09.320 --> 07:14.720\non a farm, obviously. And the landlord is a terrible person. I really hope someone listens\n\n07:14.720 --> 07:20.800\nto this. My address, I'll tell you later. I love you too. I'm sorry. But my landlord\n\n07:20.800 --> 07:27.040\njust treats the cows poorly and then when they die, he says it's awful. It just piles\n\n07:27.040 --> 07:33.040\nthem all on top of each other and then just lets them sit there. And then you go walking\n\n07:33.040 --> 07:48.400\non them. You go out to harvest their nitrogen. This is the whole show now. We haven't scratched\n\n07:48.400 --> 07:55.480\nthe surface, I believe. I have a lot of deep emotional pain. Are we allowed to scratch\n\n07:55.480 --> 08:02.440\nthe surface? Can we talk about anything? You can talk about me every which way. I can\n\n08:02.440 --> 08:06.360\ntake it. You're not bullying me. I'm an open bully. I just want to know what you're comfortable\n\n08:06.360 --> 08:11.600\ntalking about. When we talked in Madison, at the end of our conversation, which I thought\n\n08:11.600 --> 08:21.160\nwas nice, I wouldn't be shocking you to say you have weird mannerisms. That would be\n\n08:21.160 --> 08:29.480\nthe truth. But then I would also, I would say that you, I'm more comfortable talking\n\n08:29.480 --> 08:35.480\nto you than lots of other people who you would assume were not. Like there's some kind of\n\n08:35.480 --> 08:41.320\nlike... You're breaking my heart. In a good way. I don't know what that factor is, but\n\n08:41.320 --> 08:46.520\nit's like, I mean, you have yet to, I mean, you don't wear shoes. You've got the weird\n\n08:46.520 --> 08:54.760\nmustache. You've got a manic energy and you identified yourself as a transgender in Madison.\n\n08:54.760 --> 09:01.680\nYou identify as a female, you said. But then sexually I wouldn't want to fucking do. Actually,\n\n09:01.680 --> 09:07.920\na weird story about that. I had a friend of mine where a couple, I think a couple months\n\n09:07.920 --> 09:14.200\nago and we had just done some hallucinogens and we were walking around. It was just me\n\n09:14.200 --> 09:20.440\nand him. This was a dude and this is a very lonely guy and like he used to have this girlfriend\n\n09:20.440 --> 09:25.400\nand only one girlfriend and he's been broken up and so he really needs companionship and\n\n09:25.400 --> 09:32.320\nthere was one point during the night where he was like, do you use one fuck? And I like,\n\n09:32.320 --> 09:41.160\nwe were sitting on a bench and I'm just like, no. I felt really, really bad because he told\n\n09:41.160 --> 09:45.520\nme that he had been getting mixed signals off me. Like I'm a very flamboyant, flirty\n\n09:45.520 --> 09:52.160\nperson and I apparently had been doing that to him and he's like, I even made up a joke\n\n09:52.160 --> 09:55.520\nand I'm like, oh, you want me to go Jolly Roger you in the bushes?\n\n09:55.520 --> 10:04.400\nWhat's a Jolly Roger? That's what he asked. I want to know. Leave my show. I need to bend\n\n10:04.400 --> 10:10.280\nover. It's a podcast show, just have to tell me. We could describe it and their laughter\n\n10:10.280 --> 10:17.640\nwould reinforce it. It's not like a Jolly Rancher. It's a lot bigger than that. More\n\n10:17.640 --> 10:25.040\nsucking involved. What is it? Come on. Well, Roger Ring is fucking and Jolly is a happy\n\n10:25.040 --> 10:30.440\nversion of that I can't see. That's it? Jolly Roger Ring is fucking? You get a Jolly Roger\n\n10:30.440 --> 10:33.520\nring, yeah. It's in your window, Dan, it can mean whatever.\n\n10:33.520 --> 10:40.600\nI thought it was a new thing or a secret thing or a specific thing. You take a 2x4 and a\n\n10:40.600 --> 10:47.040\ndead cow and you flip it. It's not a good joke because cows they lived and they died\n\n10:47.040 --> 10:56.360\nand they're sad now. I don't know where to begin. I don't know where to middle and I\n\n10:56.360 --> 11:01.160\ndon't know where to end. My girlfriend doesn't know where to begin. You made a video that's\n\n11:01.160 --> 11:06.160\nonline. Maybe you can tell people how to get it to it on YouTube. It's like a Harmontown\n\n11:06.160 --> 11:14.240\nfan video, which, again, on paper, if someone were to be afraid of someone, like this video\n\n11:14.240 --> 11:22.840\nhas all the earmarks. And yet I don't fear you. But the facts on paper about this video,\n\n11:22.840 --> 11:28.840\nwhich are that you made it by yourself, you play me, Jeff, and Aaron, and yourself, and\n\n11:28.840 --> 11:34.440\nSpencer. And in the beginning of the video, realizing\n\n11:34.440 --> 11:39.080\nthat Harmontown is canceled that week, you basically, not to put too fine a point on\n\n11:39.080 --> 11:43.480\nit, you take rope and other implements and you abduct each of us. I didn't abduct you\n\n11:43.480 --> 11:50.120\nand I didn't abduct Spencer. You came willing. I lured you with a bong and something else.\n\n11:50.120 --> 11:56.600\nAnd then it's you by yourself in this apartment playing all of us doing a Harmontown show\n\n11:56.600 --> 12:02.040\nfor you yourself. Wearing different wigs and beards and things.\n\n12:02.040 --> 12:07.200\nBut around behind you, it's like, I'm assuming this is not set dressing. This is where you\n\n12:07.200 --> 12:13.440\nactually live. There is just dead cows everywhere. Except for the corner pocket. I saw that\n\n12:13.440 --> 12:17.000\nand I was like, oh, that's next to Jeff and that's in between Aaron. That's got to be\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:23.560\na weird joke there about putting pockets in things. Never mind. I haven't seen it. I'm\n\n12:23.560 --> 12:30.400\nvery intrigued. On the walls behind him, there's writing on the walls. Maybe like, oh no, you're\n\n12:30.400 --> 12:41.640\ntalking about my room. That is the crazy person's room. If I was set designing for a seer hand\n\n12:41.640 --> 12:47.680\nseer hand biopic, there's like swirls and then there's other writing. There's writing\n\n12:47.680 --> 12:56.200\nand drawing. What is written on the wall? Is it just random thoughts?\n\n12:56.200 --> 13:02.160\nPlayed community references, Doctor Who quotes, some shit I make up on my own. Actually, I\n\n13:02.160 --> 13:05.280\nreally like it because I have to do it all the time by myself. I really like it when\n\n13:05.280 --> 13:09.440\nmy friends come over. I have a big box of markers and I'm like, go ahead, write whatever the\n\n13:09.440 --> 13:13.920\nfuck you want to. As long as you don't write over anything. As long as you respect me.\n\n13:13.920 --> 13:17.320\nLila, I have a question for you. You identify yourself as a woman, but you still have the\n\n13:17.320 --> 13:26.000\nmale facial hair. Is that a conflict? That's acceptance. It goes back to the fucking thing.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.680\nI really want to be able to have the womb on the inside of me and have kids. That's not\n\n13:30.680 --> 13:36.080\nthe only reason to be a woman, but that's the reason why I wouldn't go into a surgery\n\n13:36.080 --> 13:43.880\nright now. You can't get that. You'd have to drink a magic potion for that to happen.\n\n13:43.880 --> 13:53.400\nDid I answer that question right? No. It was an answer to three other questions I had.\n\n13:53.400 --> 13:59.640\nWell, there's transgender where you just identify or you just express as another gender, and\n\n13:59.640 --> 14:04.800\nthen there's transgender as a subset of that. People who go, okay, not only am I expressing\n\n14:04.800 --> 14:10.360\nas another gender, I'm going to take physical steps. You're saying, well, the brass ring\n\n14:10.360 --> 14:14.040\nis having a uterus, and that's not achievable through medical science, so why not have a\n\n14:14.040 --> 14:22.200\nmustache? Pretty narcissistic, but to the point. That's basically it. I want to be\n\n14:22.200 --> 14:27.080\nable to fuck whoever I want to and have all their kids and rule the world. But you have\n\n14:27.080 --> 14:32.760\na girlfriend with which you have a technically, medically heterosexual relationship because\n\n14:32.760 --> 14:38.440\nmedically you have a wiener. Do you have a sexual relationship with your girlfriend?\n\n14:38.440 --> 14:48.040\nAnd so when you guys do it, it's a wiener going into a wee wee. I like that. I hate\n\n14:48.040 --> 14:57.600\nto sound like a fifth grader, but so is that lesbian sex? Is that, I mean, is it? I don't\n\n14:57.600 --> 15:08.640\nknow. Since I know that I can't have what I want and to try and force anything other\n\n15:08.640 --> 15:13.960\nthan that as sort of childish, then it's like, you know, except what something gave you and\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:17.240\nlike, live with it like I can't. What am I going to do about it?\n\n15:17.240 --> 15:24.600\nIf I gave you a uterus right now with a magic wand, and I cannot, no matter how much you\n\n15:24.600 --> 15:32.000\nknow, no begging. But if you had a uterus right now, would you continue to have a relationship\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:37.680\nwith a woman and over? Actually, I would own it with her. It's so much\n\n15:37.680 --> 15:41.800\nlove. Actually, it's yours and Erin's love. Like, listen to the podcast. It's just listening\n\n15:41.800 --> 15:47.280\nto us almost sometimes. Like, not only you guys fighting, but just you're like, you know,\n\n15:47.280 --> 15:53.360\nlittle jokes you play. Couples fight, people. Come on. But just you're like, you're little\n\n15:53.360 --> 15:59.000\nin-jokes with each other. And I was listening on the way here. You're talking about, Erin\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.800\nwas listening to Game of Thrones, and you kept doing like this voice or whatever. Or\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:06.600\nno, not downtown Abbey. And she would like, she'd take off her headphones, she'd be like,\n\n16:06.600 --> 16:10.800\nwhat the fuck was that? Erin, nothing is happening. But shut up. You're all right.\n\n16:10.800 --> 16:14.120\nAnd then she'd put her headphones back on and just like continue and you'd still like,\n\n16:14.120 --> 16:16.520\nfuck with her. Oh yeah, I was doing like closed mouth British\n\n16:16.520 --> 16:20.640\naccents. I couldn't remember what. I just listened to it an hour ago. I can't fucking\n\n16:20.640 --> 16:25.520\nremember. All right. Well, so I said who's in deep emotional\n\n16:25.520 --> 16:31.000\npain and you raised your hand just by default. But do you have any actual short term things\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.520\nthat we can help you with? I want to live out here, man. This place\n\n16:35.520 --> 16:41.320\nis like, I don't want to go back to the hellhole that I, and it's not a hellhole. I really,\n\n16:41.320 --> 16:46.920\nthe town's okay. It's hard. I don't want to enable anything, but I will say you will fit\n\n16:46.920 --> 16:52.680\nin more here than. Honestly, quite possibly. I was like, God,\n\n16:52.680 --> 16:56.720\nthe people out here are just fucking awesome. Like I want to live and breathe out here.\n\n16:56.720 --> 16:59.320\nAnd people don't, you know, you know, like, like, you know, people out here, they come\n\n16:59.320 --> 17:03.440\nout here because they're chasing their own thing. And then, and then some people are\n\n17:03.440 --> 17:07.360\nsuccessful at building their own thing, which means if you're in a room with a bunch of people\n\n17:07.360 --> 17:11.880\nand one guy's got a weird mustache, another guy's got a shark fin on his hat, like you\n\n17:11.880 --> 17:16.800\ncan never quite dismiss anybody because somebody might be a millionaire or about to become\n\n17:16.800 --> 17:26.880\none or, there's this whole culture of like, you know, it's very hard for bigotry and prejudice\n\n17:26.880 --> 17:31.760\nor other synonyms to gain a foothold here because it's not incentivized financially\n\n17:31.760 --> 17:34.160\nor socially. Do you guys have an accent? Because I haven't\n\n17:34.160 --> 17:39.320\nheard one yet. Like, do Los Angeles people, do you have an accent?\n\n17:39.320 --> 17:42.080\nIt's kind of a, it's kind of a- I'm trying to tie into that. Like, you don't have like-\n\n17:42.080 --> 17:49.200\nThe Valley has a pretty strong one. Yeah. We have a lack of accent that is technically\n\n17:49.200 --> 17:51.080\nan accent. Say what?\n\n17:51.080 --> 17:54.480\nWe have a lack of accent that's technically an accent. Like, we sound like what movies\n\n17:54.480 --> 17:58.360\nare, so, like, I mean, we sound different than other people, so we have an accent.\n\n17:58.360 --> 18:00.720\nYeah. I mean, I can tell if I'm, if I'm, if I'm\n\n18:00.720 --> 18:03.720\ntalking to somebody, I can tell that they're born and raised in Los Angeles. I can detect\n\n18:03.720 --> 18:08.120\nthe L.A. speech, but it's just, yeah, to me it sounds like a lack of an accent, but I\n\n18:08.120 --> 18:11.440\nthink everybody thinks that they don't have an accent, right?\n\n18:11.440 --> 18:17.560\nAll right. Well, we can't help you live out here, but, but, uh, but, uh-\n\n18:17.560 --> 18:19.560\nUh, deep emotional pain.\n\n18:19.560 --> 18:21.560\nAny, any, any, any guidance?\n\n18:21.560 --> 18:22.560\nAny guidance.\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:24.560\nYeah. Do you need, do you need advice?\n\n18:24.560 --> 18:30.480\nUh, no, I don't need it. I think I could make it quite on my own, but, uh-\n\n18:30.480 --> 18:33.640\nI guess if you, if you were open to advice, like, the first thing that would happen is\n\n18:33.640 --> 18:43.280\nyou'd be covered in shoes. Like, you're clearly, I, I believe you when, when a man with, that\n\n18:43.280 --> 18:46.680\nis that committed to not wearing shoes says, I don't, I'm, I'm not in the market for advice.\n\n18:46.680 --> 18:51.160\nLike, I would truly believe you because you're like, I, I, I sometimes don't tie my shoes,\n\n18:51.160 --> 18:54.600\nuh, and I'm like belligerent about it. Like, don't tell me to tie my shoes. And I bought\n\n18:54.600 --> 18:58.800\nlace-less shoes. And like, you're looking at you, if you're just from the neck up or\n\n18:58.800 --> 19:01.840\neven from the waist up, you've got the coat on, the jacket, and you have this neatly\n\n19:01.840 --> 19:06.720\ntrimmed, you know, kind of, well, what could be considered fancy facial hair? Uh, that's\n\n19:06.720 --> 19:12.560\nkind of fastidious. You, I would expect like spats and some, like some, some, some razzle\n\n19:12.560 --> 19:13.560\ndazzle, like spectators.\n\n19:13.560 --> 19:17.960\nSo for when you have the facial hair, but you're kind of like, you're very, you're very,\n\n19:17.960 --> 19:22.160\nyou're kind of walking contradictions, which is great. It makes you a, I fuck it. That's\n\n19:22.160 --> 19:23.160\nawesome.\n\n19:23.160 --> 19:26.960\nDo you think that your feet are like hobbit feet? Like, are they like more equipped? They\n\n19:26.960 --> 19:27.960\nmust be.\n\n19:27.960 --> 19:31.360\nThey don't have hair on the top, but no, but I mean, like, are they like, they're like,\n\n19:31.360 --> 19:34.800\nthey're like shoe feet. They're like, developing calluses.\n\n19:34.800 --> 19:39.760\nI know it's developed. It's about like a half inch callus on the bottom of my foot.\n\n19:39.760 --> 19:45.920\nSo you're, are you, are you maybe like the shoewear equivalent of a nudist in that, like,\n\n19:45.920 --> 19:48.320\nyou're thinking like, maybe we should all not wear shoes?\n\n19:48.320 --> 19:51.960\nNo, no, no. I, I, when I said that thing about you guys are weird for not wearing shoes,\n\n19:51.960 --> 19:57.240\nlike, go ahead, do whatever the fuck you want to. Like, just don't make me wear shoes, Link.\n\n19:57.240 --> 19:59.560\nBut where, is there a route to that? Is there anything more to that?\n\n19:59.560 --> 20:03.080\nWe know you don't have to. No one's going to make you, but did you, did you wear them\n\n20:03.080 --> 20:05.120\nin Madison when we met? Cause it was snowing out there.\n\n20:05.120 --> 20:07.400\nNo, he would. Yeah. I got frostbite first.\n\n20:07.400 --> 20:08.400\nYou came barefoot in the snow?\n\n20:08.400 --> 20:09.400\nYeah.\n\n20:09.400 --> 20:10.400\nIt was bloody cold out there.\n\n20:10.400 --> 20:11.400\nYeah, got frostbite in there.\n\n20:11.400 --> 20:13.920\nI was doing a blizzard and he didn't wear shoes the whole time.\n\n20:13.920 --> 20:14.920\nDamn.\n\n20:14.920 --> 20:15.920\nYeah.\n\n20:15.920 --> 20:21.040\nSpam, Spel Spencer doesn't wear pants anytime. Like, he's always in shorts. I bet people\n\n20:21.040 --> 20:24.160\ngive him shit for that all the time.\n\n20:24.160 --> 20:27.920\nWe're not going to, but there wasn't some formative experience. There's not some route, like, kind\n\n20:27.920 --> 20:28.920\nof.\n\n20:28.920 --> 20:36.280\nWe're going to get into shoes, actually. Like, many, many of us were. We're kind of, we get\n\n20:36.280 --> 20:41.320\ntrained not to touch hot stoves, not to walk in a traffic. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not\n\n20:41.320 --> 20:45.960\npicking on you. I'm just like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm engaging in the dialectic here. So like,\n\n20:45.960 --> 20:50.120\ncause I want to find out, like, cause you're different in that you do, you are committed\n\n20:50.120 --> 20:55.520\nto not wearing shoes. And I'm curious, like, if there was a expound on that, you were forced\n\n20:55.520 --> 20:56.520\nto wear shoes. I'm sorry.\n\n20:56.520 --> 20:58.760\nOkay. What are you looking for? Like, the moment I turn?\n\n20:58.760 --> 21:05.200\nYeah, like, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your parents were killed by a\n\n21:05.200 --> 21:07.000\nshoe outside of an opera house.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:14.480\nShoe man, the Levi story.\n\n21:14.480 --> 21:21.080\nUh, is it like a tick maybe? Is it like a, like, it's something that helps you feel\n\n21:21.080 --> 21:26.080\nsweaty, man. They're just like gross and kind of sweaty sometime. Like, uh, so you think\n\n21:26.080 --> 21:31.560\nwhat do you mean, my chicken? So shoes are, shoes are extra uncomfortable for you, maybe.\n\n21:31.560 --> 21:35.760\nI can't even wear a pair of sandals. Like they're just, you guys, even if I was wearing\n\n21:35.760 --> 21:38.760\nthe sandals now, like the people in the back would be able to smell my feet.\n\n21:38.760 --> 21:43.400\nOh, but you did don some shoes to walk through the cow carcass field.\n\n21:43.400 --> 21:44.400\nSafety first, Jeff.\n\n21:44.400 --> 21:50.720\nOkay. All right. What about frostbite in Madison?\n\n21:50.720 --> 21:51.720\nThat was me being cocky.\n\n21:51.720 --> 21:54.160\nDon't take that tone with me, Levi.\n\n21:54.160 --> 21:57.920\nAll right. Well, uh, let's have a hand for Levi for joining us.\n\n21:57.920 --> 21:58.920\nThank you.\n\n21:58.920 --> 22:02.920\nI'm not going to tell you stuff.\n\n22:02.920 --> 22:03.920\nOkay.\n\n22:03.920 --> 22:10.920\nEnjoy your stay in Harmontown.\n\n22:10.920 --> 22:18.240\nSo we gave the audience a little treat because they're such a good audience. We, we brought\n\n22:18.240 --> 22:19.240\nLevi.\n\n22:19.240 --> 22:21.360\nThat was more exciting than I had expected. That was very nice.\n\n22:21.360 --> 22:26.840\nYeah. That's a fascinating guest to bring up.\n\n22:26.840 --> 22:27.840\nWhat else? What else?\n\n22:27.840 --> 22:28.840\nWhat else?\n\n22:28.840 --> 22:30.840\nYou did a good job. I'd say too. You did a good interview there. You were actually,\n\n22:30.840 --> 22:37.960\nuh, you, what do you think that's about? Why do you think you're?\n\n22:37.960 --> 22:40.800\nWell, I think it's the same thing. Like, I, you know, I meet a lot of people after the\n\n22:40.800 --> 22:45.720\nshows and stuff. And I, uh, you know, and this is, this is nothing on, on the people.\n\n22:45.720 --> 22:49.400\nEverybody, all Harmonians are fantastic. And many of them are exactly like me. And that's\n\n22:49.400 --> 22:54.400\nprobably a, a, a problem, a breakdown in our, like, like a lot of very little eye contact\n\n22:54.400 --> 22:58.480\nand a lot of like, people get like, I'm very flattered by this, but there are, I have now\n\n22:58.480 --> 23:03.120\nmet a lot of people that are very nervous to be, uh, meeting me. And I, and I don't\n\n23:03.120 --> 23:07.360\nsuffer the illusion that it's because there's very much special about me. I think it's,\n\n23:07.360 --> 23:11.840\nit's, it's because I know how they feel. Like if I, when I moved to LA and like, oh my God,\n\n23:11.840 --> 23:16.680\nBob, I'm Kirk standing over by the fucking salad dressing. Um, and, and just like doing\n\n23:16.680 --> 23:21.080\nreally, really weird shit and, and, and saying a lot of weird shit and feeling like really\n\n23:21.080 --> 23:24.480\nconflicted and weird about like having like face-to-face encounters with people, just\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:28.840\nbecause, you know, I had a one-way relationship with them for a long time and had built up\n\n23:28.840 --> 23:33.200\nin my head that there was, there was, there were, they were a symbol. So I, my point being,\n\n23:33.200 --> 23:41.560\nI meet a lot of people who are, uh, uh, nervous to meet me. And I, even meeting the mailman\n\n23:41.560 --> 23:47.600\nand am nervous to meet the mailman. Like I don't make, I don't, I get very uncomfortable.\n\n23:47.600 --> 23:51.720\nText messaging saved my life because I could never talk even on the phone to people. I'm\n\n23:51.720 --> 23:56.400\nlike, okay, okay. And everyone thinks I'm a dick and I can't look at people and, and\n\n23:56.400 --> 24:00.800\nall this stuff. And, uh, I don't know. I think, maybe it's just, I, I, did you use the crassest\n\n24:00.800 --> 24:05.080\nlanguage possible to be very efficient about, about communicating it? And I think he can\n\n24:05.080 --> 24:11.200\ntake it. I think Levi's so crazy, uh, like, but so honest about it. He's just like, there's\n\n24:11.200 --> 24:15.600\nnothing, I don't know. There's like, uh, there's nothing's going to happen, you know?\n\n24:15.600 --> 24:19.280\nThat's like, like, like, like, like, oh, you just like ask him questions and you're just\n\n24:19.280 --> 24:23.640\ngoing to get answers. Whereas somebody else, their head might explode or something. I don't\n\n24:23.640 --> 24:29.640\nknow what it is. No, God, no. I'm saying, I'm saying you're special, my friend. And,\n\n24:29.640 --> 24:36.960\nuh, yeah. No, you, you, you did it just right. Uh, uh, but, but now that I know I have that\n\n24:36.960 --> 24:43.520\npower over you that you could scream at. Yeah. It's a roller coaster with me. Uh, but it's\n\n24:43.520 --> 24:47.320\nokay. Uh, let's, uh, let's keep, let's, let's keep the show special. What do you, what do\n\n24:47.320 --> 24:51.320\nyou, what do you, before we move on our good friend, uh, I don't know your last name. So\n\n24:51.320 --> 24:54.320\nI'm going to, I'm going to refer to you as the audience knows you. Be fungus bill. Uh,\n\n24:54.320 --> 25:02.320\nwhat is your last name, Bill? Moretson. Moretson. Moretson. Moretson. Be fungus bill has brought\n\n25:02.320 --> 25:09.480\nus. Uh, he's, he's, uh, famously, famously has, uh, has brought us, uh, tainted meats\n\n25:09.480 --> 25:15.280\nand, uh, a bag of, uh, rocks, which are lovely. Tonight he has brought, um, little kind of\n\n25:15.280 --> 25:18.840\nlovely wooden shingles with quotes from our show on it. And, uh, he's given me a handful\n\n25:18.840 --> 25:22.640\nand I think he's, he's got a ton to dispense to the crowd. If you guys got to have, all\n\n25:22.640 --> 25:31.840\nright. It's like, it's like Christmas here. You found a middle ground, but it was a, you\n\n25:31.840 --> 25:37.160\nbrought the food and then we made fun of you because the food had, had mold on it. And\n\n25:37.160 --> 25:42.120\nthen the following week, in my opinion, what was the passive aggressive move you brought,\n\n25:42.120 --> 25:49.960\nyou brought inert rocks as if to say fine rocks then, but this is like, well, now this\n\n25:49.960 --> 26:01.840\nis wood. Right. I brought you stones, but it, but it has like a script on it. Uh, but\n\n26:01.840 --> 26:09.880\nthe weird thing is that the sticks have words on them. Right. Yeah. Uh, the, I ate the country\n\n26:09.880 --> 26:14.200\nlike Pac-Man. That's a quote from me. I don't even know what this one is, but I, I, I, I,\n\n26:14.200 --> 26:19.440\nI'm quoted as saying, you fuck Batman. We fuck you. I don't, I don't recall the context\n\n26:19.440 --> 26:25.240\nof that, but it sounds like something I would say. No, what, when, when did I say this season\n\n26:25.240 --> 26:32.960\nthree of community was written on anus? It was, it was, it was posted somewhere. Thank\n\n26:32.960 --> 26:42.160\nyou. Levi knows the city. Adderall. Yeah. Did I mean to say Adderall? And I said anus.\n\n26:42.160 --> 26:47.680\nI like this one where I, I take a bold stance and say, I take adorable shits. They're like\n\n26:47.680 --> 26:54.480\nunicorn tears. If that one's not correct, I want to take it back. Cause like, all right,\n\n26:54.480 --> 26:59.920\nI, I, in order to get through all of these and there's, there's like 62 of them. Uh,\n\n26:59.920 --> 27:05.600\nI had to like sort of plumb the depths of the web to, to wrangle enough of these to,\n\n27:05.600 --> 27:09.040\nso there's, there's almost no duplicates. How many, how many did you bring us tonight?\n\n27:09.040 --> 27:13.040\n62. 62. Yeah. I would, I had planned on a hundred, but I got tired.\n\n27:13.040 --> 27:17.920\nUh, we, we're about, we're probably a little over there, right? I don't know. I can't\n\n27:17.920 --> 27:22.960\nbe better at that. I am going to be a millionaire and I'm going to smell like a butt. That's\n\n27:22.960 --> 27:30.960\nmy, that's me being defined. That's the Dan Harmon guarantee. Oh, your money back.\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:36.720\nUh, you're not giving me a, you can do whatever you, I want to make sure everybody gets whatever\n\n27:36.720 --> 27:40.720\nis close as possible. Do whatever you wish with them. Uh, but I would like to point out\n\n27:40.720 --> 27:45.120\nsome things about this. Like the, the shiny ones, those are curly maple. The yellow ones\n\n27:45.120 --> 27:50.720\nare yellow heart. The ones that don't have much grain are basswood and then the dark ones are cherry.\n\n27:54.320 --> 28:00.400\nThis crowd loves fine wood. I wonder if there's a type of wood that would have been booed.\n\n28:02.240 --> 28:08.640\nWingay boo. Too exotic. Well, I, I would like to donate these to make sure everybody gets at\n\n28:08.640 --> 28:12.800\nleast one. Yeah. I've got about seven or eight. So if you guys, if someone gets shorted and wants\n\n28:12.800 --> 28:16.400\none, they can come up and grab one for me. I'm keeping, I'm eating the lead paint of my own ego.\n\n28:17.760 --> 28:21.040\nI was, I was actually hoping you'd keep that one. I like that. It's very appropriate. That's\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:24.320\none of my favorite quotes. All right. Thank you, Bill. You're going to hand them out now.\n\n28:24.320 --> 28:31.680\nSure. All right. Wow.\n\n28:34.240 --> 28:40.000\nIt's a special night. I don't know if it's first time visitor accessible for a special night.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:43.360\nYou know, what do you mean? Well, I don't know. It's not like there's no cats jumping\n\n28:43.360 --> 28:48.480\nthrough hula hoops or anything. I'm not telling stories about, about, about jerking off. I,\n\n28:48.480 --> 28:51.920\nI came into the green room and you looked like you were half asleep in that. You looked really\n\n28:51.920 --> 28:58.720\nI'm just mentally exhausted. I, I, I just, you know, I, I, I've, I've blogged about this fact,\n\n28:58.720 --> 29:05.920\njust writing is a, it's, it's, it's a, it's so hard. It's, it's, you know, it's like you, you,\n\n29:05.920 --> 29:11.920\nyou really like, before your body gets physically tired, before your eyes get sleepy, before,\n\n29:11.920 --> 29:17.040\nbefore you get frustrated, like your brain actually just like, you just, which wears out.\n\n29:17.040 --> 29:21.920\nCause you're just like, you're, you're running it like a motor cause you're like looking at this\n\n29:21.920 --> 29:27.760\nfucking blackboard and going like, uh, okay. So why, what, what does Annie want again? And it's\n\n29:27.760 --> 29:31.840\njust like, and then one person goes like, well, I think she wants, she wants to feel loved. And\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:36.400\nthen someone else goes, but if she wants to feel loved, why, why, how come she's being so mean to\n\n29:36.400 --> 29:46.880\nLeonard? All right. All right. What if it was like Tron and everyone goes, unless that solves\n\n29:46.880 --> 29:53.440\neverything. But, uh, yeah, it's just, it's just, you know, problem solving, pushing your brain\n\n29:53.440 --> 29:58.720\nup against the boundary between it and the shit that you need to know for the whole time.\n\n29:58.720 --> 30:03.040\nAre the other writers like, have they gotten on board and are they, are they still intimidated\n\n30:03.040 --> 30:07.040\nto talk or does everyone, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're coming out and they're,\n\n30:07.040 --> 30:11.200\nthey're great because now by, we've had to break up into smaller groups. There's just so many of\n\n30:11.200 --> 30:17.600\nthem and they're so like, all of the circumstances are so strange. Um, but, but I think once we,\n\n30:17.600 --> 30:20.800\nyou know, just takes a while and then we broke up into small groups and now they're,\n\n30:21.600 --> 30:26.720\nit's, I don't think, I don't exactly have my ear to the ground, like in terms of gossip and stuff,\n\n30:26.720 --> 30:31.360\nbut it seems like they're all, uh, they all really like each other too, which is kind of a feat with\n\n30:31.360 --> 30:36.640\n14 writers. Like they, uh, there's usually one person that's like, oh, here comes Stanley.\n\n30:36.640 --> 30:39.440\nBoy, what a mistake.\n\n30:41.600 --> 30:45.440\nWhat's your feeling about the, uh, about the episodes? Like, can you compare this to\n\n30:45.440 --> 30:52.080\nhow you felt going into previous seasons? I feel better about 501 than I felt going into previous\n\n30:52.080 --> 30:58.320\nseasons, but I don't, I wouldn't, I can't bet my life because it's just so, I don't know. I'm so\n\n30:58.320 --> 31:04.480\nclose to it. I can't, I, I, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know. Are there any like nods or winks to\n\n31:04.480 --> 31:09.120\nthe fact that you're back? Is there like, like, like the fact that, like, is there any kind of\n\n31:09.120 --> 31:13.120\ndealing with that? Or are you just kind of just picking up where last season left off?\n\n31:13.120 --> 31:18.320\nIt, I mean, the, the, the circumstances of, of coming back and having to do a fifth season,\n\n31:18.320 --> 31:23.600\nlike, like they're automatically going to generate as a context of nothing and winking. Like, I don't\n\n31:23.600 --> 31:28.080\nknow how to explain it. Like, or, you know, we're getting, we're getting back to basics. And so\n\n31:29.040 --> 31:33.920\nthat feeling is in the air. And so I'm not, I'm not, I'm not doing a bunch of inside jokes and\n\n31:33.920 --> 31:43.280\ngoing like, well, what happened last year, boy? I had a bad taco. Do you have a bad taco? Or we all\n\n31:43.280 --> 31:52.880\nhad bad tacos. Now it's all gone. Turn on the fan. Every time, every time there's a reference to\n\n31:52.880 --> 32:02.080\nsomething that happened last season, it's Foghorn. I mean, that's not entertaining, you know, to do\n\n32:02.080 --> 32:06.400\nthat. It would be pretty entertaining, I think. I think, I think you get mileage out of that for\n\n32:06.400 --> 32:18.800\nan act or two. Let's do, let's do, let's do Q&A. I don't know why I spun a wheel. Anybody have\n\n32:18.800 --> 32:28.880\nany questions? Jesus Christ. Like, camera over here as a documentary guy. Neil Berkeley, everybody,\n\n32:28.880 --> 32:37.760\nthe maker of our documentary. If your question is how's the documentary going, clearly it's not\n\n32:37.760 --> 32:50.400\nfinished. Still some shots to pick up. And that's how I learned about America. Now get the fuck out\n\n32:50.400 --> 33:03.120\nof here. What was your question? If Dan could be a were version of any animal during a full moon,\n\n33:03.120 --> 33:10.640\nwhich animal would that be? Were version of any animal. I would, I would, I would, you can be a\n\n33:10.640 --> 33:16.240\nwere cat. I guess you could. You can be aware whatever you want. Right. So yeah, where does not,\n\n33:16.240 --> 33:23.200\nit's not wolf specific. You could be aware whale. I didn't, you didn't ask me, but I'm going with\n\n33:23.200 --> 33:35.040\nwhere whale. No control over this, right? So every full moon. All right. Well, I just, I just want to,\n\n33:35.040 --> 33:42.320\nI have to think practically because I don't keep track of time very well. And I just want to make\n\n33:42.320 --> 33:47.280\nsure that like I'm not like in a plate, like if it was a tiger, then there's places where that's\n\n33:47.280 --> 33:53.920\nnot going to be cool. So, so I feel like it's a boring answer, but I feel like I just go regular\n\n33:53.920 --> 34:03.520\nhouse cat so that, so that I maximize my, my ability to like hide, but also blend in and get\n\n34:03.520 --> 34:07.760\naway. And if anything should go wrong, I'm kind of wasting the power by just being scared of it,\n\n34:07.760 --> 34:14.560\nI guess, sort of dealing with it like a disease. Like, like I have where diabetes. I guess I'd\n\n34:14.560 --> 34:20.080\nstack some Snickers bars and so you're a human, but I would turn into a part human part whale.\n\n34:20.080 --> 34:25.120\nThat's probably a bad idea. Would I be able to, oh, oh, oh, it's a way, I'm a were cat. Like,\n\n34:25.120 --> 34:30.960\nlike I'm not just turning into a cat. So where whale wouldn't work because I'd have to, I just,\n\n34:30.960 --> 34:36.000\nI would turn it, the moon would come out and I would be a whale sitting here at this podium\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:40.720\nwhen I would tie. Yeah. Okay. I would have to be near a body of water at all times. Well,\n\n34:40.720 --> 34:44.160\nthen maybe like a were chimp so that people could barely tell the difference. Like,\n\n34:45.360 --> 34:51.360\nlike you just, you just feel like, uh, but, uh, yeah, I don't know. I'm tear, I don't want to be\n\n34:51.360 --> 35:00.800\naware. Okay. Well, fuck it then. I just go for, uh, I would be aware, uh, aware, like, uh, otter.\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:06.960\nWhat about like a were bear? That's kind of cute. You're kind of a bear\n\n35:08.560 --> 35:12.560\nin the gay way. All right. I'll be a, I'll be a were bear.\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:18.720\nBecause I wear, I was thinking otter because again, I was thinking like I would like to be an otter\n\n35:18.720 --> 35:23.280\nbecause they like swim on their back and they, they crack up, crack open clams on their tummy.\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:28.880\nWhere, where otter is awesome. But if you are a were otter, you'd be like a six foot\n\n35:28.880 --> 35:34.880\nguy eating clams on his tummy. You could do that as a were bear. It wouldn't matter.\n\n35:36.800 --> 35:42.080\nBut the otter would have to rampage. What would that, where, where otters, uh, enemies be clams and\n\n35:42.080 --> 35:47.520\nlike mollusks and stuff. I think you're just, are you confusing it because, uh, wolves rampage\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:51.200\nand where wolves therefore have to rampage. I think if you were a were fish, you know, he,\n\n35:51.200 --> 35:59.520\nhe, he had the caveat that you would have to rampage. Oh, okay. So you'd have to rampage. All\n\n35:59.520 --> 36:04.080\nright. A were bear. I'm just going to, yeah, that's got it. All right. Two more questions.\n\n36:06.080 --> 36:07.280\nAll right. No. All right.\n\n36:09.280 --> 36:12.480\nAre you worried about, uh, what's your colonize? It's perfect moon colony.\n\n36:15.360 --> 36:19.200\nMoon colony. All right. The question is, thank you for getting us back on track. What's your name?\n\n36:19.200 --> 36:23.200\nGreg. Kind of an ordinary name.\n\n36:25.360 --> 36:32.400\nI just, we had Levi. What was your name? Chud. Chud? What? Not really. Chud.\n\n36:33.280 --> 36:37.520\nLike cannibalistic humanoid underground dweller. Chud. Is it really chud?\n\n36:38.160 --> 36:43.680\nOh, that's what I've gone by. Oh, you're not, you weren't born chud. That would be fucking awesome.\n\n36:43.680 --> 36:52.960\nAll right. How did your name chud generate? It's kind of boring. In fifth grade, I figured I was\n\n36:52.960 --> 37:02.720\nan adult so I can name myself. And a judge taught you a lesson. He said he named himself because\n\n37:02.720 --> 37:07.760\nhe became an adult. He thought he could name himself. I decided when I was a kid, when I turned\n\n37:07.760 --> 37:15.920\nlike 13, like coming into my own, like having identity things, I decided that my, as a writer,\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:22.480\nmy name was D.R. Harmon. Even though my middle name is James, but I was at D.R. Harmon and I,\n\n37:22.480 --> 37:25.120\nwhen people would say, what's the R stand for? I'd say rutabaga.\n\n37:28.800 --> 37:37.040\nYeah. I didn't, I'm not proud of it. I appreciate my candor. I didn't come here to win a popularity\n\n37:37.040 --> 37:40.800\ncontest. Did we ever talk about in the show, we must have talked about that you, your nickname was\n\n37:40.800 --> 37:46.080\nPac-Man for a while? Yeah, yeah. Do we talk about that in the show? Yeah, I wanted to, yeah,\n\n37:46.080 --> 37:49.600\nkids, they want to know who they are, what's their deal. I didn't really have anything,\n\n37:49.600 --> 37:55.920\nso I just jumped on Pac-Man. Just called myself Pac-Man. I made a windbreaker that had like a\n\n37:55.920 --> 38:01.600\nlittle felt Pac-Man on it. I didn't make the windbreaker. I made the felt Pac-Man. And I would\n\n38:01.600 --> 38:08.560\njust like, as everything was Pac-Man, in Wisconsin, people appreciate knowing what to get you for\n\n38:08.560 --> 38:15.600\nChristmas. Everyone has a totem. If the mom's a mouse and get dad a belt buckle, and everybody's\n\n38:15.600 --> 38:23.440\ngot a gimmick. That's a terrible gift to get if you're a child abuser. Get dad more belt buckles.\n\n38:23.440 --> 38:36.480\nWhat do you have a nice heavy sharp one? Yeah, the shit was okay. The question was am I worried\n\n38:36.480 --> 38:42.080\nthat when we colonize the moon I won't have anything to rant about. You know, that's the goal. I\n\n38:42.080 --> 38:57.680\ndon't enjoy ranting. I'm just sitting here looking adorable. I'm not doing anything. I do it because\n\n38:57.680 --> 39:04.960\nI have to. It's like does a car enjoy producing carbon dioxide? Oh, it's good. It's combusting.\n\n39:04.960 --> 39:09.600\nIt's got shit in it, and it's like it has to get the certain work done. Living on earth\n\n39:09.600 --> 39:16.560\nproduces a byproduct called rants. I think you'd find stuff to rant about. Well, at first,\n\n39:16.560 --> 39:20.080\nI'd be like, but it would mostly be me. I'd be like, why didn't I bring a bottle opener?\n\n39:20.080 --> 39:25.120\nYeah. I'm such a dick. I'm such a dumb dick. And I'd be like, you know. You could rant at my\n\n39:25.120 --> 39:32.640\nlittle fancy VIP moon. Phoenixville orbits you. It's going to orbit four times a day too, so you\n\n39:32.640 --> 39:38.000\nsee more of me. We're all going to go buy. We're all going to be at the Mexican restaurant,\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:42.560\nmoaning you. There were a couple of people I went into the Harmontown subreddit, and there were\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:47.440\na couple of people that were really taking me to task or taking my idea to task, as if I had\n\n39:47.440 --> 39:55.200\nsomehow implied that they should go to the moon with me, which I did not. And they're like,\n\n39:55.200 --> 39:58.960\nit seems a little hypocritical. If you hate capitalism so much, why doesn't he give up his\n\n39:58.960 --> 40:12.560\nbig house? Like you were instigating that bullshit that you started. I do want to address that\n\n40:12.560 --> 40:19.600\npoint, and I did in the subreddit as well with a little typey rant, but it's okay to have a big\n\n40:19.600 --> 40:24.720\nhouse and to know that capitalism is a flawed system. Like the idea that you could respond to\n\n40:24.720 --> 40:30.000\nsomebody questioning the world that you're in by telling them that you don't give them any credit\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:36.800\nbecause they haven't yet reduced themselves to a criminal level of poverty is exactly the same as\n\n40:36.800 --> 40:42.800\nsaying go fuck yourself. There's no difference between that. We are all within capitalism,\n\n40:42.800 --> 40:47.520\nand we all survive within capitalism by buying and selling things. I don't think it matters.\n\n40:47.520 --> 40:54.800\nLike my big house is me going, this is what I deserve. I'm going to work this hard, and so I\n\n40:54.800 --> 40:58.720\ncan have this much space to move in. I can walk around that space and go, Jesus Christ, what a\n\n40:58.720 --> 41:06.240\nfucked up system that made me work that hard for this much space. And want to go to the moon and\n\n41:06.240 --> 41:12.720\nlive in a little cubicle where there is no such thing as property and hierarchy. We'll go up there\n\n41:12.720 --> 41:17.120\nand we're going to have a good time, but it's not going to be any of these people that question\n\n41:17.120 --> 41:27.040\nme on Reddit. It's going to be a special detector that zaps those people. So it gets more autocratic\n\n41:27.040 --> 41:31.600\nevery time you talk about it. Only at the gateway, man. It's like that's the other thing. You and\n\n41:31.600 --> 41:36.720\nCamille were caught. Gateways are gateways, man. Yeah, but you got to affect the change. You got\n\n41:36.720 --> 41:41.760\nseven billion people on earth. They got a system. You're allowed to say, okay, we got to take the\n\n41:41.760 --> 41:45.520\nright people. We got to engage in some elitism because we're not going to take seven billion\n\n41:45.520 --> 41:50.000\npeople to the moon. And even if we could, that would just be like, well, then keep them on\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:56.480\nearth and fix the earth. The idea is that, okay, systems too big. Most of the people down here\n\n41:56.480 --> 42:00.480\nfeel like they're nailing it. Even the people who don't are like, well, I don't want to go to the\n\n42:00.480 --> 42:05.440\nmoon. Some people would be willing to go, but you got to pick the right ones to take your best shot\n\n42:05.440 --> 42:11.360\nat starting over in a right way. So yes, you're engaging in de facto hierarchy and elitism because\n\n42:11.360 --> 42:18.320\nsomebody's got to actually start the thing. But the goal is to get up there and, you know, hand\n\n42:18.320 --> 42:22.880\nover the reins to the collective. I promise I will. Did we decide that there was going to be a\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:26.800\ndome situation or we're going to terraform it? How are we going to live up there? Well, I don't know\n\n42:26.800 --> 42:32.800\nhow to terraform. I kind of feel like I... We should take somebody who knows how to do it.\n\n42:32.800 --> 42:42.320\nYeah. I'm looking at it this way. I don't think... I'm not going to give myself credit for knowing\n\n42:42.320 --> 42:50.000\nhow to grow stuff on the moon, like make an atmosphere. But I've gone swimming with goggles\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:59.600\nand stuff, so I understand the basic principles of sealing things off. So I figure... And we have\n\n42:59.600 --> 43:06.000\nyet... We have yet to terraform. I think you're a little cocky on that. I'm just saying... You have\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:11.200\na lot more credit scientifically than maybe... I think it's fair to say that if you could figure\n\n43:11.200 --> 43:14.880\nout how to live underwater, you can figure out how to live on the moon. Yeah, that's how they train\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:20.640\nthe astronauts. Yeah. So because both places are... I have the identical problem. They need to be air\n\n43:20.640 --> 43:25.280\ntight, right? Yeah. So we've accomplished both of those things. We have not terraformed anything\n\n43:25.280 --> 43:32.160\nyet. So I'm just saying, okay, we've gotten to the moon and we've hung out up there. So I'm saying,\n\n43:32.160 --> 43:38.560\ncan I please get up there and hang out there so that people leave me alone? Okay. There will have\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:50.240\nto be hydroponic, like, basil gardens so I can garnish. We'll get Levi on that. Levi's special\n\n43:50.240 --> 43:57.120\ncarcass fertilizer. All right. One more question. That'll end this segment. All right, sir. Are you\n\n43:57.120 --> 44:03.120\nthere? What's the worst insult anybody's ever said to your face? Worst insult anyone's ever said to\n\n44:03.120 --> 44:16.400\nmy face. That's a good question. I don't want to get it wrong. I remember being really hurt\n\n44:16.400 --> 44:28.240\nwhen I was in my 20s and I was helping this band load into this bar. It'll take too long\n\n44:28.240 --> 44:38.080\nto explain why. And then they were having trouble with this bouncer or something. I just made some\n\n44:38.080 --> 44:42.880\ncomment, but I was actually trying to ease the tension between them. The leader of the band was\n\n44:42.880 --> 44:46.640\nhaving trouble with the bouncer. There was some misunderstanding about if they were going to\n\n44:46.640 --> 44:51.680\nget paid or if they were taking the door or something. I just tried to make a funny joke.\n\n44:51.680 --> 44:57.680\nI was carrying somebody's bass chords or something. I was like, yeah, come on, guys. Don't fight.\n\n44:57.680 --> 45:05.920\nAnd then the bouncer was like, now you want to start something Chewbacca? This is going to really\n\n45:05.920 --> 45:14.160\nhurt my... I think it's about intent. I think I really felt his complete disdain. It's okay\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:21.440\nto be called Chewbacca. But I think at the time it was like a weird... I probably had an image in\n\n45:21.440 --> 45:30.640\nmy head like, I look like John Kuzak. And he was like, no, when I look at you with my tiny bouncer\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:38.080\nbrain and improv skills, I immediately say Chewbacca. And I'm not a Star Wars fan. I'm a bouncer.\n\n45:38.080 --> 45:48.000\nSo it's profound. You are Chewbacca. Either it means you're gross. I just see hair and animal.\n\n45:49.520 --> 45:54.480\nSo I felt... I remember that sticks out in my head. When I was in college, my friend wrote an\n\n45:54.480 --> 46:00.000\narticle in some magazine, his theory being that Chewbacca was the only Latino in the Star Wars\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:06.400\nmovies. Yeah, yeah. Because his name is Chewie, which is short for like Jesus. He's a mechanic.\n\n46:06.400 --> 46:12.960\nAnd these were his. These were his. And he's Mexican. This is my friend Andre Soto. He said\n\n46:12.960 --> 46:20.720\nhe's Mexican and he never fights alone. And he does kind of have like a little mustache. He does\n\n46:20.720 --> 46:27.200\nhave like a kind of... But also, no joke, if you watch the first one, A New Hope, when the first\n\n46:27.200 --> 46:31.520\ntime they get into the Millennium Falcon, they sit down. No shit. There are gold dice or silver\n\n46:31.520 --> 46:36.640\ndice. There are, like there are dashboard dice. And you never see them again. He bumps his head\n\n46:36.640 --> 46:42.000\non them when he gets in the first time. That's the only time. Yeah, it's that. I mean, we saw the\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:47.440\nGeorge Lucas unchecked in the Phantom Menace and the fucking like ethnic aliens started rolling out.\n\n46:47.440 --> 47:00.720\nLike every planet you went to, I was like, oh, hello. Welcome to a China idiot. Oh, this is so\n\n47:00.720 --> 47:06.320\nexpensive. Yeah, could you know where we can get our car fixed? I don't know what's in it for me.\n\n47:06.320 --> 47:18.800\nI mean, we all saw it. That movie. That's a great proof because he was in it. He got a P user\n\n47:18.800 --> 47:25.040\nto quote Jar Jar. But there's got to be something better. Like somebody must have called me\n\n47:25.040 --> 47:32.080\nsomething way worse than that. Like any like, not to name him, but like any like angry studio heads\n\n47:32.080 --> 47:37.920\nor co workers and things like that. I mean, they don't, you know, they don't do that stuff. They\n\n47:37.920 --> 47:44.320\njust, they just call human resources. If you could conjure up what would be the most painful thing\n\n47:44.320 --> 47:50.880\nfor someone to say to you. It would center around like, like I have a big soft spot or a hot or\n\n47:50.880 --> 47:56.240\nsensitive button about pretentiousness. Like who do you think you are that area? Because I'm from\n\n47:56.240 --> 48:02.480\nWisconsin and I grew up with like a brother that was like five years older than me and was constantly\n\n48:02.480 --> 48:07.840\nlike, he would, he would go like, like, what the fuck doesn't Daniel have to do his laundry? And my\n\n48:07.840 --> 48:15.200\nmom would say to my brother, Daniel's special. And my brother go, no, he's not. And I'd be like,\n\n48:15.200 --> 48:21.040\nI'm in the room and so uncomfortable. Dr. Harmon is right here. Yeah.\n\n48:21.040 --> 48:29.920\nAnd so I just like, like, I don't, I don't like, I don't like, I had to learn to take compliments\n\n48:29.920 --> 48:34.560\nover time. Like a one of my 80 therapists told me at one point, like you should, when you deflect\n\n48:34.560 --> 48:38.720\na compliment that actually insults the person that's giving it to you, I figured that out after a while\n\n48:38.720 --> 48:44.720\nthat people, how to say thank you when someone said you did a good job. But, but I did the thing\n\n48:44.720 --> 48:49.040\nthat still terrifies me. Like that's why I can't go to the AV club or anything. Like they, they,\n\n48:49.040 --> 48:56.800\nthey, if I, if I, if I like, like, you know, Dan Harmon's Iron Man costume from Comic Con's for\n\n48:56.800 --> 49:01.520\nsale, AV club headline, I know, like not to click on that, because I know that the reason they're\n\n49:01.520 --> 49:05.920\nputting that up there is simply so that like everyone will come there and like leave comments\n\n49:05.920 --> 49:14.400\nand go, uh, who gives a fuck about this fucking fat asshole, shit, fuck asshole. And I, and it'll\n\n49:14.400 --> 49:19.040\nreally, it like, I'm still sensitive about that stuff, because all my identity is caught up in\n\n49:19.040 --> 49:24.240\npeople's perception of me. So, so like, like, like, it's okay for people to think I'm crazy.\n\n49:24.240 --> 49:29.200\nIt's okay for people to think I'm stupid. It's okay for people to think like all kinds of like,\n\n49:29.200 --> 49:32.400\nlike, like that I'm abusive, that I'm like, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't want them to think\n\n49:32.400 --> 49:45.040\nthat I'm a bad person. But, but, but when it gets into like, like, people thinking that I am less\n\n49:45.040 --> 49:51.760\nblank than I think I am, like, it kind of really, it really threatens me because it implies that I'm\n\n49:51.760 --> 49:56.560\nsome kind of, it's sort of like, it's sort of like, like, just like opens the Schrodinger box of my\n\n49:56.560 --> 50:02.000\nentire identity and goes like this, it's empty, like, because the first implication is that, oh,\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:07.360\nI'm a construct of myself. Like, and the second implication is that that construct is like emperor's\n\n50:07.360 --> 50:13.760\nrobes, like it's not there anymore. Like, it really kind of terrifies me. Because I guess I must\n\n50:13.760 --> 50:18.720\nbelieve that's true. I'd not want it to be. So, so like, it's not, it's not like the Chewbacca's\n\n50:18.720 --> 50:23.440\nor the hate fatties. There was a guy outside the magic castle that really, he really like,\n\n50:23.440 --> 50:32.560\nI guess I accidentally, it was on me, like, he was, it was this, this young guy was like opening\n\n50:32.560 --> 50:39.520\nthe door for all of his, all of his family, like his, like, grandma walked through and his mom\n\n50:39.520 --> 50:44.240\nwalked through and I kind of like darted through the door, like, like, thanks. And, and, and then,\n\n50:44.880 --> 50:53.280\nlike, he said something like, like, real classy or, I guess I'm opening the door for everybody,\n\n50:53.280 --> 50:58.480\nI think that was it. And I, and I just kind of like defensively because I, I felt, I went like,\n\n50:58.480 --> 51:04.560\nyou're gonna be okay, you'll be fine. And then because I said that, he was like, he just like,\n\n51:04.560 --> 51:12.560\nfucking, he, he, he, he, he, I can't really, he was like, oh, thanks, fatty. At the, at the time,\n\n51:12.560 --> 51:16.080\nI was not really like thinking of myself as a fat person. So again, like the Chewbacca thing,\n\n51:16.080 --> 51:19.920\nI was like, what a fat, that's the first thing. And then I went and looked in the mirror and I\n\n51:19.920 --> 51:25.680\nwas like, yeah, this giant fucking face, like, dripping over my, my, my tux collar. I was wearing\n\n51:25.680 --> 51:31.040\na tux because it was the magic castle. There was some wedding or something, but I was like, yeah,\n\n51:31.040 --> 51:36.880\nI was like, oh, shit, God, that guy really got married at the magic castle. There was some formal\n\n51:36.880 --> 51:41.120\nevent and then, and then there, and then a thing at the magic castle. Yeah, if you haven't been, don't.\n\n51:42.960 --> 51:47.840\nYou'll get, you'll get insulted. It's less magical than you think. So it's a hurt thing,\n\n51:47.840 --> 51:54.000\nshould call it the hurtful castle. But he was right. I, well, I mean, he was right to, I was,\n\n51:54.000 --> 52:01.360\nI didn't have my fucking Emily post simulator on. My friends were five people ahead and had\n\n52:01.360 --> 52:05.360\nalready gone through the door. So I was just trying to catch up to them. But in his world,\n\n52:05.360 --> 52:11.680\nit was like, oh, geez, what am I, the door opening for you guy? And then, and then I was\n\n52:11.680 --> 52:20.720\ncondescending. I should have just said, I am so sorry. Fuck that guy. But remember that guy\n\n52:21.600 --> 52:26.880\nat Tamo Shanter? Yeah, yeah. That guy really, really got me. Well, we were talking too loud,\n\n52:26.880 --> 52:30.080\nor you're using salty language or something like that. I don't like being told, shut up,\n\n52:30.080 --> 52:33.680\nlike, like, like, like, like, like, I mean, sometimes that'll just make me angry. But,\n\n52:33.680 --> 52:38.240\nbut like also just the idea that I talk too much that I'm a loud mouth. What was the exchange?\n\n52:38.240 --> 52:43.440\nShe came of a representative from his table came over, right? Or the nose him. He sat there the\n\n52:43.440 --> 52:47.200\nwhole time. We, Jeff and I were having a good time. I think we told this story on this podcast,\n\n52:47.200 --> 52:51.520\nbut what haven't we told? We said we're sitting there in this restaurant and kind of having a\n\n52:51.520 --> 52:56.560\ncouple beers, a summer, summer day, like just out with some friends and like, like, just kind of\n\n52:56.560 --> 53:01.840\nlive in the, live in the summer life, like, like in this quasi fancy restaurant in Los Files. And,\n\n53:01.840 --> 53:08.400\nand, and there was this table with this guy and these two elderly women and he kept, he, he, like,\n\n53:08.400 --> 53:12.800\nlike, one of them, one of them looked over, I think at one point, which is why I made sure\n\n53:12.800 --> 53:17.600\nthat we weren't really being that obnoxious at a certain point. But I guess we were, I guess we\n\n53:17.600 --> 53:22.800\nuse profanity sometimes when we, when we communicate. I was telling like a loud story that might have\n\n53:22.800 --> 53:28.720\ngotten a little. And the guy waited the whole lunch, instead of just like, like, going like,\n\n53:28.720 --> 53:34.000\nif this is your demand, like, hey, we have demands over here, like, you're, you're encroaching on\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:41.840\nour ability to eat our toad in the hole or whatever. He waited the whole thing, settled the whole bill,\n\n53:41.840 --> 53:46.640\nand then, and then stopped on the way out and went to the three of us, said, hey, if you guys\n\n53:46.640 --> 53:51.120\nare going to talk like you're in a truck stop, why don't you go eat one? And, and then, and then\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:56.560\nkept walking. And then, and then I, I blurted out because I got so flustered. This is me at my,\n\n53:56.560 --> 54:01.920\nat my wittiest when I'm actually under the gun. I went, whoa, whoa, whoa, if you're going to tell\n\n54:01.920 --> 54:13.360\npeople what to do, why don't you go back to Germany? To which he replied, you go fuck yourself.\n\n54:14.160 --> 54:19.360\nYeah. And I was like, what a truck stop! You're back! Truck stop. He just, he just, he was mad,\n\n54:19.360 --> 54:24.080\nhe couldn't talk like a truck stop. Yeah. Yeah. Because he's clearly like under the thumb of his\n\n54:24.080 --> 54:29.520\nlike mom's inheritance or something. Like, who eats with two old ladies? If I recall the next\n\n54:29.520 --> 54:35.360\ntwo hours to maybe three days was sped with the esprit d'escalier, like coming up with the\n\n54:35.360 --> 54:42.800\nperfect retort for that guy. People in restaurants, like, oh, like, like, I can't, you know, in LA\n\n54:42.800 --> 54:47.520\nwhen you go to these restaurants and they, can we get a table for two? And they, and they're like,\n\n54:47.520 --> 54:52.960\nyeah, of course we can. When the answer is no, they can't because their restaurant is five feet\n\n54:52.960 --> 54:58.000\nwide. They should just say, no, we can't seat you. And you know what? We have too many tables in here.\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:03.120\nWe should get rid of a couple. So it's a comfortable place. Instead, they fucking jam these goddamn\n\n55:03.120 --> 55:13.200\nLogan's run fucking tables together as if, as if it is human at all to eat closer to a stranger\n\n55:13.200 --> 55:17.840\nthan the person that you came to dinner with. The insanity of these places, like, like, like,\n\n55:17.840 --> 55:23.040\nyou go, and the thing that's even more insane than that is when they sit you in these places,\n\n55:23.040 --> 55:32.240\nand the, like, the thing that blows my fucking mind is when the people next to you who are in\n\n55:32.240 --> 55:39.040\nthe same horrible situation can't have the fucking, like, human righteousness to go, well, I guess\n\n55:39.040 --> 55:45.440\nwe're all just prisoners of war in this shitty place. Let's all rise above it by ignoring each\n\n55:45.440 --> 55:50.400\nother. When the people next to you, like, you're talking to your friend, you're having an intimate\n\n55:50.400 --> 55:57.040\nconversation, I'm a hyperbolic guy. I might, I might compare seasons of TV shows to unsavory\n\n55:57.040 --> 56:08.400\nthings. I'll grab my God-given word power to make my point. I won't do it loudly, but I'll do it\n\n56:08.400 --> 56:12.960\neffectively. And then there's like a certain combination of words, and then every fucking time\n\n56:12.960 --> 56:16.640\nI eat in one of these places where you're close to someone, somebody always looks over and goes,\n\n56:16.640 --> 56:22.640\nlike, uh, that's actually really, not really offensive, but like, they'll just go, like,\n\n56:22.640 --> 56:30.160\nexcuse me, I did improv for years. I was in UC Bay, like, what was I, what, you said you said\n\n56:30.160 --> 56:34.560\nimprov was, you know, bullshit, I said, I said I was in a bullshit improv troupe when I was like,\n\n56:34.560 --> 56:47.440\nwhat the fuck am I talking to you for? Are you out of your mind? Oh, I'm sorry, sir, was I rude\n\n56:47.440 --> 56:58.400\nto you? What are you doing? I'm eating and talking to my friend. You're, what are you doing? I was\n\n56:58.400 --> 57:04.960\nat a date with a girl at a fancy restaurant, and we were, it was like a first or second date,\n\n57:04.960 --> 57:09.120\nand we were exchanging like philosophies, we were getting to know each other philosophically,\n\n57:09.680 --> 57:15.360\nspiritually, you know, she was an atheist, it turned out, and I was like, I was like, well,\n\n57:15.360 --> 57:21.040\nI did, you know, I'm not, I would never bother to commit to that club, and I, but I understand,\n\n57:21.040 --> 57:26.320\nand she's like, yeah, I understand, people need, people need religion sometimes to, you know,\n\n57:26.320 --> 57:30.640\nit gives the meaning in that whole thing, and I'm like, well, there is that, that kind of\n\n57:31.440 --> 57:37.440\naspect of it, I think that religion connects people with the unknown, and that's the primary\n\n57:37.440 --> 57:44.480\nthing, but it has come to be a sort of a crutch for some people, because to put it very basically,\n\n57:44.480 --> 57:52.720\nlike, you know, this sort of background notion in our heads that if you get cancer, it's your fault,\n\n57:52.720 --> 57:57.200\nor something like that, and I just like, and I kept talking, and then this fucking woman over\n\n57:57.200 --> 58:01.920\nhere was like, like, I saw her head cocked, so now I, now I'm, now I'm, and then she starts\n\n58:01.920 --> 58:06.880\nleaning into her friend, so these two elderly women, and then I keep talking to my date, now,\n\n58:06.880 --> 58:12.400\nnow I have to put 20% of my attention on the lady next to me, because she leans over to her\n\n58:12.400 --> 58:20.320\nfriend, she goes, did you hear what he said?

If you had to, like, was there one that you're like,\n\n01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.800\nI could, that guy? Well, I would have been, I would have been anybody that wasn't like as flamboyant\n\n01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:15.440\nor cross-dressy because I probably was like suppressing, like, like this, like, my friend\n\n01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.080\nin high school, like, he ended up joining the show and I was always like, how the fuck, like,\n\n01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.280\nlike, like, that's insane. I mean, I was just like, like, like, I was, I was, you know, 16, 17 years\n\n01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.920\nold and I would, like, I'd never, I don't even think I had like smoked pot or anything by that\n\n01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.520\ntime. It's like maybe, you know, drank, drank beers and stuff in basements, but these, these were\n\n01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:42.640\ngrown-ups and like crazy people and it was downtown and God knows what they would get up to at their\n\n01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.080\napartments or backstage. I just remember looking at them as if they were like these crazy, they\n\n01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.440\nmight as well have been Prince or Boy George or like, like, David Copperfield. I had a really,\n\n01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.800\nI only went to it once. I had a really bad experience with it. I was with Matt Gorley and\n\n01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.720\nsome friends in Santa Barbara or something. We were like, oh, let's go see that movie. We didn't\n\n01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.680\nknow that there was a big, you know, to-do and people put on the show and there's all this\n\n01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.320\ninteraction and stuff. But when we found out, oh, this is cool, this is weird. And, but there was\n\n01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.840\na thing when they asked like, there was a, there was a couple of really dodgy, not to be mean, but\n\n01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:22.800\njust to describe them, some really creepy frail, syphilitic old queens that were running it. And\n\n01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.120\nthey're like, are there any virgins out there? And I was like, yeah, it's like, like, a lot of people\n\n01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.160\nhadn't, hadn't, they were virgins to Rocky Horror, but they didn't raise their hands. I did. And I\n\n01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.040\nwas taken up on stage, like, like Fei Rui and King Kong and they, and all of, all of the men,\n\n01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.880\nand they're a little, like, they're little Speedos and they're a little, like, dingy, sweaty,\n\n01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.960\nlike, like, not been washed ever, like, spandex and, and, and, and like, lingerie and like, like,\n\n01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.680\nhairy legs with garters and stockings on. They all stood with their legs apart, like, in a line,\n\n01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.800\nand I had to lay down, like, I was laid down on the stage and my arms out and my feet, obviously\n\n01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.560\nout. And they all straddled me, like, three or four or five of these guys. And then two other\n\n01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.800\nguys picked, picked me up by the hands and feet and just like, rammed me up into their dicks and\n\n01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:15.600\nballs. Just like, kind of, just like, kaboom, kaboom, just like, just, just, just old, syphilitic,\n\n01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.760\ncocking balls and ass and garters. That's not an origin story.\n\n01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.480\nThat's how, that's how he got his psychic powers. He went home and there was a suit hanging in his\n\n01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.440\ncloset mysteriously. I think there's a way to do that and make it fun for the guy that's getting\n\n01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:39.600\nit done. That was, that was, that really was like, it was a big threshold, though, because it was,\n\n01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.160\nI mean, there was, there was a lot of that going on. I think every company that does Rocky Horror,\n\n01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.160\nthat's like part of their function ceremonially, you know, there's the guy that plays\n\n01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.880\nFrank and Furter, you know, is, is, is, you know, is going to be this big flamboyant,\n\n01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.800\nlike, like, covered in makeup, fishnets, like, like, like, outgoing, like, dude who's, like,\n\n01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.920\nchallenging your sexuality while you're in line and then, like, dragging people up and the whole\n\n01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.760\ncompany is like, man, I'm on the fringe and this is like the east side, the fucking art town, like,\n\n01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.960\nlike, like, I, and the terror, like, like, and, and then the most important thing, like,\n\n01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:23.120\ngoing through those moments and, and, and being afraid of, like, what might happen and then\n\n01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.800\nrealizing, like, any haunted house or anything that physical contact with people that don't do\n\n01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.360\nthe same things you do or dress the same way you do doesn't actually, there's nothing, you know,\n\n01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.000\nit doesn't, you wake up the next morning and now you're just cooler, you're not, nothing happened,\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.600\nyou're not, you're not gay or you're not, unless you want to be, you're not, you're not, you're,\n\n01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.320\nyou're, you're in full control of everything the whole time, like, nobody has needles in their\n\n01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:54.640\nhands, nobody, these guys are pretty scary, it was touching go, a lot, a lot of touch,\n\n01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.800\nheavy on the touch, but I was, I remember walking down the halls of my high school,\n\n01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:04.400\nyou know, the following Mondays, I could just feeling like I had graduated something, and I\n\n01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.720\nwas, I was, it was, I bet my posture changed a little bit, somehow it changed back in the interim,\n\n01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:16.560\nbut it was a valuable service provided at the local downtown, independent movie theaters in\n\n01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.720\nour little small towns, there's little kids like me, where are you gonna go to see a Tarantino\n\n01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:32.560\nmovie back before Tarantino was an Oscar winner and stuff, but thank God. Did you add, were you\n\n01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:41.280\ncalled up as a, as a virgin, did you do that in Italy? I didn't, no. Every answer to every\n\n01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:51.600\nquestion is so sleepy and sad. Oh, no. Yeah, all right, it's, it's, it's also a weird tune\n\n01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.560\nhow to think that, like, you can get, probably get on YouTube and just watch Rocky Horror Picture\n\n01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.320\nShow, I'm sure you can certainly get on DVD, back then it was like the big, the first question\n\n01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.760\nthat people would have, because they're like, you go in and you yell out stuff on cue, it was always\n\n01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.520\nlike the idea that there was such a thing as a script for the movie or, or a copy of it that\n\n01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.560\nyou could watch in practice or something, that was unheard of, it was such a, it was such a\n\n01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.040\nmystical thing, you had to go to this theater to see this movie. Yeah, I probably have the same\n\n01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.560\nexperience that a lot of people do when they go to see Rocky Horror, I thought that like,\n\n01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.160\nthe people that I was seeing it with for the first time had come up with all those\n\n01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.800\nthings and thought they were also cool and I'm sure afterwards, because I do this,\n\n01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.920\nif I watched a performance that I really like, I was probably like, that was really clever,\n\n01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.160\nthose callbacks were really, really good, good, but they've been around for years and years.\n\n01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.000\nMe and my friends, we were trying to start new stuff, it was kind of a sad\n\n01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.520\nand it's just random stuff, like we would pick a spot in the movie where we just yell out,\n\n01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:52.560\nCharlie Brown! And see if it took off. Did you get any? I think we got a couple of nibbles,\n\n01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.800\nbut probably just new people who came the previous week and heard Charlie Brown and\n\n01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.960\nsomehow, you know, nothing ever took off. Dumb experiment, 17 years old. All right.\n\n01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.960\nAll right, Spencer, shall we get this underway? Uh, yeah.\n\n01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.600\nNew sheets.\n\n01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.880\nLast time on Harmontown, after bargaining for the life of Sharpie Butzelot,\n\n01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:28.240\nfrom the Fornheim, the frozen city, more specifically the Jarl of Fornheim,\n\n01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.560\nyou left the city and put on a show in the blizzard.\n\n01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.800\nAll right, kill the music. That's it? That's all that happened.\n\n01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.760\nSpencer, everybody, certain sweet.\n\n01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:51.200\nThank you. Well, a lot's going to happen tonight, my friends. Well, yeah.\n\n01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:58.720\nSo you guys are in an icy, icy canyon. You walked in there because it was the only way through.\n\n01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.600\nA mole rain cast resist elements. Yeah, so we're good to go.\n\n01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.200\nYep. All right, so let's press on and keep going through this canyon and see what, see what goes.\n\n01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.480\nDo we need someone to play Chris de Burgher? Should we go without? Huh? Whatever you guys want.\n\n01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.520\nDan's making poopy face. No, you pick somebody. I just can't bear to be the picker. Huh?\n\n01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.160\nFirst hand that shot up. Okay. I forgot. Tyler's going to help us out.\n\n01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.480\nHello. Hello. I was tempted. I saw Levi's hand go up, too. That might have been a good way to\n\n01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.160\ngo, too. Either way. Yeah. Hello, Tyler. Welcome. Hi. How are we going? All right. So we walked down\n\n01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:46.160\nthe canyon. Yeah, you do. What a show. You were kind of light in it. You didn't really... I would\n\n01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.040\nhave thought when we started that show that you would have really dove in, but you just, you\n\n01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.960\ndidn't really do anything. She was a wrapped audience member the entire time. I don't know.\n\n01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.600\nYeah, I got really overwhelmed. I was so excited. I got in my head. I had so many things that I\n\n01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:05.040\nwanted to do, and then I just got really sleepy. But it was... Well, I sang my first new song since\n\n01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.040\nLady in Red. I don't even remember. It was a great beautiful song. I remember it was... What was it\n\n01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.640\ncalled again? What was the title? Geez, I don't even remember what the song was. It was... It slipped\n\n01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.840\nmy mind. It was a moment of beauty that just passed and it's gone. Make it up. Make up a title.\n\n01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.520\nThe Daughter of Blue. The Daughter of Blue. It was a good song. It was a good song. All right.\n\n01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.280\nLet's press on. You hear footsteps behind you crunching in the snow. Say, you guys...\n\n01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:36.560\nIt's not. That's behind all of us. I'm behind you, and I heard it from behind me, and I'm the last\n\n01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.240\none. Is he in the rear? Yeah, I'm in the rear, and that's my... I turn all the way around.\n\n01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:50.880\nTurning all the way around. You see among the ice and snow a familiar gnoll named Yerch. Yerch.\n\n01:17:50.880 --> 01:18:00.240\nHe's like, hey guys. I kind of disappeared around that Forzan city thing, but I'm back. We're going\n\n01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:09.920\nnorth, right? Hell yeah. Who could forget Yerch? Who could forget Yerch? He's the P one, right?\n\n01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:17.120\nThe one that smells like pee all the time? Oh yeah. Okay. All right. What species is he?\n\n01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:24.480\nHe's a gnoll. A gnoll, right? Oh, gnoll. Yeah, P, P, P, gnoll. Okay. Yerch.\n\n01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.240\nI'm just saying, you know, I was scouting. You guys are going the wrong way, by the way.\n\n01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.600\nAll right. Were we not supposed to talk to the giants? No, I mean, just in this canyon,\n\n01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.560\nyou must have got turned around, but I just came back from scouting ahead. They have this big black\n\n01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:46.400\ngate. It's crazy. It's full of demons and shit. So we shouldn't be going towards the black gate?\n\n01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.520\nWell, I mean, we should, right? We got to kill them. Yeah. Let's go to that gate. So we got to be\n\n01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:59.760\ncareful. Okay. All right. You guys go ahead. You're not coming? I mean, I'll stay in the back.\n\n01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:07.600\nOkay. I'll be careful. All right. You all right, Yerch? I mean, yeah, it's just another day.\n\n01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:15.360\nI wonder, where have you been? We haven't seen you. I know that you were assigned to follow us,\n\n01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.440\nand I just haven't seen you in so long. You know, frost giants can stomp on you.\n\n01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.160\nI haven't heard. We had no experience with that. Well, yeah, I mean, I would have known that you\n\n01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:33.120\ngot stomped on personally, but I'm sure that's true. I want to take a sidebar with my friends.\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:34.800\nI'll be over here.\n\n01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:43.360\nTo the extent that I ever knew Yerch, like I just don't think that this is Yerch.\n\n01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:49.200\nYerch is acting really weird. Are you saying you think all Knowles look the same?\n\n01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.760\nNo. Who has good perception? Not me.\n\n01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.080\nOr some kind of no, don't want you guys have like no intention or whatever,\n\n01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.760\ndetect intention. Sense motive, thank you. I have zero points in sense motive.\n\n01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.960\nOh, I have nine points in it, but zero. I mean, I think I'm a sensitive person.\n\n01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.480\nAll right, Spencer, I have nine points in sense motive. I can try to see if he's up to anything\n\n01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:27.840\nfancy. He doesn't seem to be up to anything. Would you roll? I rolled a four.\n\n01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.640\nAll right, can I? This seems like he's on the level. I don't know. I'm going to cast detect\n\n01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:43.120\nthoughts on him. You detect his thoughts. What's he thinking? These guys sure are looking at me,\n\n01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:59.600\nstrange. What'd you get, Sharpie? I just, it's Yerch. Okay. Yerch, how many demons are at this big\n\n01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:09.440\nblack gate? Like seven. And that's on the far side of that is going to be Admiral Darkstar,\n\n01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:16.720\nwe're hoping, right? Behind the gate lies the black keep. All right, guys, we didn't come this far\n\n01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.320\nto turn around now. I'm feeling pretty energized in that show. Absolutely. I think I think I think\n\n01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:28.480\nGroup Morale is at an all time high. It's an all time high. Let's let's go. That's a nice skeleton\n\n01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:34.720\narmy you got, by the way. Oh, I forget. Oh, yeah, we got Tuskets too. We're good. We're good. Thank\n\n01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.480\nyou, Yerch. But at what cost? Yeah, what cost? That's true. Do you think that maybe there's a\n\n01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:47.200\ndemand for this show as a run? Yeah, I think it was a one off. Wasn't our only audience those\n\n01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.480\nflying things that were coming from the sky? There were some mosquitoes or some gnats that\n\n01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:58.480\nwatched it. Yeah. All right, let's let's to the gate. Yeah, I mean, do I have cocoa? Yeah, I get on cocoa.\n\n01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.600\nDo you think that Mully, what the hell is your name? We're playing three different D&D games.\n\n01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.000\nI'm so confused. I'm quirk. Quirk, do you think you could, would you, do you think you could scout\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.840\nahead maybe and okay, I'm gonna send a venture up. Do you maybe want someone who has stealth to go\n\n01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.480\nfirst and check it out? Yeah, he's, he's, he's stealthier than me. He's a rogue. Yeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.920\nFirst, I'm going to send a venture. A venture. Fly up. I just want to get a distance. I don't\n\n01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:33.520\nwant to talk to Yerch about it. Like it's, I think he's high. And so I'm going to send a venture to\n\n01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.240\nsee how far the black gates are. You send a venture up into the sky. But after a moment or two, he\n\n01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.920\nreturns. He gives you a look that says it's snowing. It's too hard to see from up here. I'm not used to\n\n01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:58.320\nthis kind of climate. It's cold. It's a very subtle look. Richly nuanced. I almost thought it was\n\n01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.400\ngoing to be a wrap. Well, a lot of cadence to that. All right. Well, what do I want you to, what\n\n01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.920\ndo you, do you stealth types scout ahead? I don't know. I'll go with you. All right.\n\n01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.920\nJust stay a little bit behind. Christopher and I walk ahead and I have my, my, my, my sword out,\n\n01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:20.400\nyou know, at the ready. The two of you go ahead down this icy canyon and you round an icy bend\n\n01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.720\nand you see it. The black gate, it extends maybe 100 feet tall and you can see about four levels\n\n01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:36.800\nof catwalks that are kind of strung together by these metal stairs. Standing on the catwalks,\n\n01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.720\nkind of patrolling around our black armored dudes as well as these beardy demons and devils that you\n\n01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:49.040\nkind of saw and fought with at a yellow camp. How many of them are there? There's seven demons and\n\n01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:56.160\nyou count one, two, four human guys, whole armored guys. And then three of the bearded demon types?\n\n01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:02.560\nNo, there's seven demons and then four guys. Okay. All right. Is there a, Chris, any reason\n\n01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.120\nwhy we were sent ahead to go do this and the whole crew couldn't come? So they don't see everybody.\n\n01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.680\nI mean, they're patrolling in places. Okay. Well, I go back and I report to you guys that I give them\n\n01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:19.120\nthe info, the recon. Catwalks, you say. Catwalks. Stairs? Yeah. It's kind of like, it's kind of like\n\n01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.680\na stage, a stage production of West Side Story. You know, it's like, it's like, it's like, or like,\n\n01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.640\nor like rent. It's like a big fire escapey kind of thing. So they've got the high ground. I wonder\n\n01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:33.280\nif there's any way we could get up there. So we're not walking under them. We can pick them off,\n\n01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.080\npick off a couple of them before we fully engage. Or maybe destroy the stairs and make the catwalks\n\n01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.360\nfall or something. We should probably go before our, you know, sizable skeleton army goes forward,\n\n01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.440\nmaybe pick a couple of them off and then, you know, so they don't have enough time to escape.\n\n01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:54.000\nThen we call the cavalry. Gentlemen, maybe I can use my tree token. I have a tree token.\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:02.880\nWhat? Tree token. I have a tree token. What does that do? Tree token. I, if I, if I throw it on\n\n01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:09.680\nthe ground, a tree, a tree will grow. Okay. Are we going to tree token hide behind the tree? We\n\n01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:15.600\ncould climb the tree or I sheepishly take my tree token and put it back in my pocket.\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.960\nI appreciate the effort. What's on the sides of the gate? What's flanking this gate? Well,\n\n01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.600\nit's just like wedged into the ice. Oh, into the canyon. There's no way to climb the walls of the\n\n01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.800\ncanyon. None unless you have climbing spikes. I think that's what they're called, right? Sure.\n\n01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:39.440\nWould it be a lame waste of the skeletons to just do the old saunter out there go, hey,\n\n01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:46.880\nfuck you guys and run back and stand behind the skeletons? I mean, all right. Wouldn't they call\n\n01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.720\nreinforcements though? If they see a couple of us go, hey, we're here. Yeah, they might, they might\n\n01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.560\nopen the gate and bring out a bunch of fun. Uh, there's, we should send more people. No, but he's,\n\n01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.000\nhe's saying like, like wave and like, like we'll moon them and we'll show them our ass and then\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.640\nthey'll all come, those guys at the gate will just think it's a couple of people and they'll\n\n01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.480\ncome running and they'll come over there and they'll be the, the cast of Ben Hur will be there.\n\n01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.160\nRight. Well, and we could instruct our skeletons to lie on the ground like it's a, like they're\n\n01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.600\nfallen soldiers. Maybe someone who has bluff could be like, there's only a couple of us. We'll just\n\n01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.840\nhang out, have a good time. Yeah, it's just an act. We don't have an army of skeletons over here.\n\n01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.520\nI said we just, I said we just advance. I said, I said we just come in there and kick these guys's\n\n01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.960\nass. Fireball? Fireball? Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's give them everything we got. Let's just\n\n01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:36.080\ncome in and just fucking, I am that exhausted. Yeah. I've been solving problems all day. I think\n\n01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:44.160\nwe'll just, let's just blunt force it. All right. So, uh, so who's taking lead then? I'll, I'll go\n\n01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:50.480\nforward first. I'm on my horse before the skeletons or it's a very least like why don't we just,\n\n01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.800\njust, just one preliminary. I mean, let me, let me just do this. I've always wanted to do this.\n\n01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:01.440\nI'll just walk. I'm just going to walk around the bend and then you go like, Hey, you guys got\n\n01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:16.720\nchanged for a dollar? My wife and I, we, uh, need change for a dollar. Also look at this tree.\n\n01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.160\nAll the guys on the wall kind of like turn towards you and they're looking at you and the bearded\n\n01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.440\ndevils kind of hold out their arms and they start to be wreathed with flames.\n\n01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:37.200\nAll right. See you. I'll be over here. Bye. And then I retreat like a coward. Okay. And I walk to\n\n01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:46.240\nbehind the skeleton army and I read a book. You hear the crunching of footfalls and then the four\n\n01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.280\narmored men are upon you. They've managed to scramble down this gate and chase you guys down\n\n01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.640\nto where you guys are. I general the skeletons into kind of a thermopoly, you know, Spartan kind\n\n01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:04.320\nof thing. Close off the pass. Okay. They seal off the pass, but these guys are approaching.\n\n01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:11.440\nRight. They're going to let them clash. Yeah. That makes sense. Do the demons see the 40 skeletons\n\n01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.520\nand it's like, fuck it. We're going to keep going. Yeah. You know, okay. They don't give a fuck.\n\n01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:21.440\nThey're very confident. They're just demons. What does my power bracelet do? It just gives you\n\n01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:30.800\nplus two strength included on your stat block. Fun rules. All right. You see your skeleton army\n\n01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:37.040\nkind of engage with the enemy. These these human guys in armor kind of clash and the skeletons\n\n01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:42.800\nare actually really well trained and magical and cool and stuff. But two of them managed to just\n\n01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.280\nslice the two of the guys in half. Yeah. And the other three don't manage to do as well. And they\n\n01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.560\njust kind of poke at at these armored guys, but only five can get in right now. But then the\n\n01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:00.400\nrest kind of have them surrounded. And armored guys see that they're they're going to lose,\n\n01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.720\nbut the skeletons aren't aren't going for the final blow right now. They're just surrounding them.\n\n01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:11.040\nAll right. I jump in with my flaming sword and attack the nearest armored guy.\n\n01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.600\nWith your flaming sword, you jump into the fray, but you trip over a femur of one of the skeleton\n\n01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:29.280\nswords. So these guys are alive and are kind of like at the at the sword points of our skeleton\n\n01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:37.120\nemissaries. The skeletons are kind of waiting. Gentlemen, looks like you're in a skeleton\n\n01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:51.840\nsituation. We can't we can't use bone voyage again. Tell us how where's the back door?\n\n01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.000\nWhat? Is there another entrance to the temple? I mean,\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.520\nwhat? You're asking is that gate? It's not a temple. The gate. The fuck you guys.\n\n01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:14.800\nHarmon quest ended. Well, we're going to Admiral Darkstar's fortress. Yep.\n\n01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.880\nIs there another way in? Oh, the only way is through this gate. Or if you have climbing\n\n01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:26.880\nequipment, you could climb up the canyon and then go around this gate. Or you could wait for this\n\n01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:38.160\ngate to open. What is it open for? You know, large traffic. We're large traffic. What, like a bus?\n\n01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.120\nMaybe. Bus. Let's keep, let's keep killing these guys. We're standing around talking. Yeah.\n\n01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.400\nI thought maybe they haven't gotten any useful information out of them. They said no, go through\n\n01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:59.440\nthe gate. Large traffic. That's arguably useful. All right. Skeletons forward. Are you going to\n\n01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:03.920\nkill the guys? Large traffic. Often can we like wait and like hitch a ride, like behind a wagon\n\n01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.640\nand like sneak our way in. I don't think we can sneak an army. You know who waits? Cowards. Fine.\n\n01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:14.400\nFools. Whatever. I shoot an arrow at a skeleton. Let's kick some ass. You do sarcastically shoot\n\n01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:20.880\nan arrow at a skeleton. Whatever. The skeletons dispatch the remaining guys and you continue on\n\n01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:29.120\ntowards the gate. Yeah. Good. Good job, skeletons. As you approach the gate, you hear loud sounds.\n\n01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.520\nThey sound kind of like what sirens would sound like if you knew what sirens were.\n\n01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:40.800\nGet out of the way. This is definitely magical in nature. But at the same time, you see the gate\n\n01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:46.880\nthat grows. It doesn't grow. A split kind of develops in its middle and it swings open like a\n\n01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.720\ngiant door and standing in that giant door is one of the largest ogres you've ever seen,\n\n01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:59.520\nalmost 40 feet tall, with a small metal platform on his back. And you see kind of dudes standing\n\n01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:07.520\non this platform on this back holding crossbows. His ogre starts lumbering through the gate.\n\n01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:16.080\nHe's got a sniper perch on his back. Let's throw some magic at this guy right off the bat.\n\n01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:23.600\nYeah. When I get to go, I'll shoot a fireball at him. You get to go. Fireball.\n\n01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.800\nSame with a little more gusto, man. Fireball.\n\n01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:36.720\nAll right. Where do you aim it? Like at the guy or at the platform?\n\n01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:41.520\nI'm aiming it at the... Well, would I be able to hit the guys on the platform?\n\n01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:46.160\nYeah, if you aimed towards it, but it would be like away from his center of mass, I guess.\n\n01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.640\nYeah, well, I'll aim for the platform. Yeah, okay. That's what I assumed, by the way,\n\n01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:59.600\nfor all you podcast listeners. Yeah, so you do that. You throw your fireball in it,\n\n01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:05.520\narcs up over the guy's shoulder, right onto the metal platform where these snipers are stationed,\n\n01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.920\nand it explodes, and you see, you know, two corpses just fly off. Yeah.\n\n01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.920\nThe rest of the guys take seven fire damage. Fuckin' yeah. It's nice. I mean, yeah.\n\n01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.560\nYeah. How many of them are up on that platform?\n\n01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.120\nYou don't know, because it's such a large platform. I don't have any ranged weapons.\n\n01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.280\nI can't really throw... I can't really get them from a distance.\n\n01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.840\nYou have a tree. I have a shortbow. I can finish them all.\n\n01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.800\nIs it my turn?\n\n01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.400\nNo, it's not. It's the tree.\n\n01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.360\nI want to see a tree, too, you guys.\n\n01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.960\nAdam Goldberg suggested this. I'm going to throw it out there. He said,\n\n01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.080\nplant the tree under the ogre's nuts and have a tree grow up into it.\n\n01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.440\nA tree grow up into the butt.\n\n01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.880\nAnd the old tree dick maneuver.\n\n01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.960\nThat's called the Jolly Roger, isn't it?\n\n01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.080\nGod, I wish it were 15 minutes later. That would have been at the end of the show.\n\n01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.040\nWell, I... Hmm. All right. Well, how close can I get to the ogre?\n\n01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.560\nYou'd be able to get to where it was standing if you ram.\n\n01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.320\nOkay.\n\n01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.360\nBut not if you walked.\n\n01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:30.640\nWell, I'm on Coco. I gallop over to the ogre. I look over at Sharpie. I give him a wink.\n\n01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.240\nSomething's about to happen.\n\n01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.640\nI gallop up to the ogre right between his legs.\n\n01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:46.880\nI reach for my quiver for a second and then I'm like, no, no, no, just do this.\n\n01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:55.600\nI take my token and I throw it at the ground between his legs and I say, who's the sap now?\n\n01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:08.960\nI'd like to see dur you die. Maple tree. So I do that.\n\n01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:16.080\nYou thrust the tree token into the soft snow and then before your varied eye, very eyes.\n\n01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.360\nMy various eyes.\n\n01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.760\nBefore your various sensory organs.\n\n01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.920\nA tree springs into being. It grows in girth as well as length.\n\n01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:33.680\nAs it reaches its final height, which is somewhere between this ogre's midsection.\n\n01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.720\nIt smashes him right through the pelvis.\n\n01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.520\nWell done. And he takes 20 damage.\n\n01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:53.440\nI think the very clever little witty back braced angel on my shoulder.\n\n01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.960\nAt the moment, he can't move. His legs are kind of too far from the ground to move at the moment.\n\n01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.280\nAwesome.\n\n01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.560\nSo he's like a popsicle right now?\n\n01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.360\nLike a popsicle.\n\n01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.680\nAll right. Who's up?\n\n01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.720\nThrow it to Tyler.\n\n01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.960\nAll right. Let's see. So I want to get the rest of these snipers out of the way.\n\n01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:19.920\nSo we don't have to worry about them.\n\n01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.600\nAs you can swear by this big slow ogre.\n\n01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.120\nAmulet of autumn can become invisible for five rounds twice a day.\n\n01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.400\nI want to use that to get behind them so I can pick the rest of the guys off.\n\n01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.000\nActivating your amulet of autumn, you gain invisibility.\n\n01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:32.400\nAll right.\n\n01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.000\nAnd then what was it?\n\n01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.080\nYou wanted to get behind them?\n\n01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.160\nI want to see if I can get kind of behind where the ogre came out of the gate, right?\n\n01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.040\nYou can do that.\n\n01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.960\nOkay.

It's your turn.\n\n01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.760\nI take a flaming far sword and swipe at the chest of the ogre.\n\n01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.760\nIs the far sword long enough to do that?\n\n01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.680\nOkay.

remaining\n\n01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.360\ntake their positions at the edge of his thing,\n\n01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.080\nand they fire down on you with crossbow bolts.\n\n01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:49.280\nYeah.\n\n01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.680\nSo Sharpie, you get hit with one of these bolts.\n\n01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.960\nAnd as it strikes you, you feel caustic burn\n\n01:38:56.960

01:39:07.760\nAcid will do that to you.\n\n01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.240\nThe other arrow misses.\n\n01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.280\nBut then the ogre starts striding towards you.\n\n01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.560\nHe's off the tree?\n\n01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.840\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.120\nLike, he's kind of...\n\n01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.840\nStarts striding towards you, like

come.\n\n01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.720\nBy wrapping a magical tree into his taint.\n\n01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.080\nI put that on my resume.\n\n01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.120\nDoes he get

thing.\n\n01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.040\nI think it was a platform.\n\n01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.880\nYou see flaming corpses fall off the side.\n\n01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.520\nTwo of

01:43:30.240\nYou launch a fiery arrow right in the ogre's face.\n\n01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.040\nAnd it strikes right there.\n\n01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.400\nDealing six fire
