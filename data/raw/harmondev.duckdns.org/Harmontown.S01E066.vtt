{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.000\nHello, what and all, welcome to Meltdown Comics and the world-famous Dirtmelt Theater, Harmontown,\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:23.000\nis once again in session.\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:33.000\nOh, yeah. Once you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:44.000\nYay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, I'm Harmontown! Yo!\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:49.000\nThank you, Jeff Davis, our Comptroller. Let's have a hand for his Comptroller.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:53.000\nWhat a fantastic person. And what a good group of people you are.\n\n00:53.000 --> 01:00.000\nAnd what a great country this is. God looking down on it, smiling and hoping it keeps moving forward.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:05.000\nI don't have anything to talk about tonight. I thought maybe I could stretch that into something.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:11.000\nJingoism would be like taffy. I could stretch it to a finish line, but I don't have that much.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:17.000\nYou got anything, Jeff? You got any burrs in your boots?\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:23.000\nI almost didn't make the show. I took a nap on my couch because we had brunch today that went straight to the drawing room.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:29.000\nWe just drank all day long, and I took a nap and just woke up and it was like 7.15, and I was like, geez, Louise.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:40.000\nI had to take a little nap today too, because we did brunch. This is my life. We did brunch and then I...\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:41.000\nWe really did it too.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:47.000\nAnd then during brunch, you know, it's like, let's go get a drink.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:52.000\nGod, I'm so dehydrated right now. My eyes are red, I'm puffy.\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:01.000\nBut I got a dog now, which I think is probably saving my life, because I got to go home every couple hours just to make sure the dog kind of...\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:08.000\nBut sometimes the dog is laying there and it's crate, and then I'll come home and go like, come on, I need to run you around the yard,\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:17.000\nand the dog will be like, what's happening? And I'll wake it up specifically and then trot it around the yard, and it'll just start getting energized,\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nand then I'll put it back in the crate.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nThere was a moment today.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nIt feels bad.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:27.000\nBecause we went and had brunch, and Dan had pancakes, and even shouted out the word pancakes after having eaten them.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nYeah, because it was like a Schrab.el, like, medic pancakes!\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:39.000\nAnd then we had a bunch of beers and funnets at Little Dom's, and then we went down to the drawing room, and I overheard Dan saying,\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nlike, I could get an Uber car, which is like, you know, like a kind of a car service.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:53.000\nAnd he was talking about getting an Uber car from the drawing room to his house, which is seven blocks, seven blocks, just so you could go walk your dog.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:59.000\nAnd such is our level of trust and friendship that I let you drive my car drunk. I gave you my car.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:04.000\nWhen you say drive my car drunk, it puts a really fine point on it.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nI start picturing that in the TMZs and the Aussiellos and the whatever.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nOkay, we'll edit that out then.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:25.000\nI drove Jeff's car drunk. I drove it up a tree, and there was a gypsy in it, and I ran her over, and I take that NBC.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:35.000\nBut I napped during Prometheus. I pressed play on Prometheus, which I had already seen in the theater, and I just fell asleep listening to it,\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nand I just had these, like, shitty prequel dreams.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:50.000\nLike, just dreams about people walking around going, one day there's going to be a dream here.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:58.000\nBut I got nothing. Let's do a little experiment, because I got nothing. Let's follow the I Got Nothing thread.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:04.000\nAnd let's bring up our friends. Let's bring up Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:22.000\nIt's a nice summer evening. It is a nice summer evening. And I got nothing.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:31.000\nMaybe sit on the porch with me, won't you, Kumail? And have a nice tall glass of Country Time Livin'.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:41.000\nJust rack back and forth in your chair, and look out in the starlit field, and worry about minorities moving in.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:48.000\nI'm sorry, you don't know this. That's what you do on a porch. You're not familiar with this tradition.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nThey're racist? The porches are racist?\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nYou can't have a porch and not be racist.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.000\nI feel like I felt that vibe when I walk onto a porch. I just kind of want to be like, you know...\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:03.000\nThat's what porches are for. They're racial outposts.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:10.000\nYeah. I'm like, ah, some of these people could work harder.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:16.000\nJust sort of sit out there and watch the people walk by and give them a subtle look.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.000\nDon't buy a place around here.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:28.000\nI can see you with one of those kind of plantation, big colonial columns out front, like a seersucker suit and a straw hat,\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:32.000\ndrinking some lemonade and just being racist.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:38.000\nThanks, Jeff. Why is it so much fun to be racist?\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:45.000\nIt simplifies life. The same reason it's fun to be into astrology. There's 12 kinds of people.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:51.000\nOh, yeah. I think there's 13 now. Didn't they find a new planet or something?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:56.000\nYeah. And then they found out that everything we knew was wrong. So, tourists are actually leos.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nAnd then we kind of read them. We were like, ah, let's ignore this. This is weird.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:05.000\nYeah. All these people are like, you told me if I was a Capricorn, I should expect to find romance in the workplace.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:10.000\nYeah. That wasn't right. I married a guy in the copy room.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:18.000\nNot a guy from the copy room. I married him in the copy room. I printed out the invitations in that room.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:25.000\nBut there is liberation too. I mean, primates have these dopamine things in their head. We look for patterns.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nIt's way simpler. That's why I would...\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nOkay, this is going to get weird.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:40.000\nBut I think at one point I was very, very religious. And it was actually kind of easier.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nJust to be like, oh, something... Order. Order.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:48.000\nYeah. All of this makes sense rather than, oh, this person got hit by a car for no reason.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:55.000\nEven before monotheism, even before we started to really order things, the people that we call pagans,\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:01.000\nthe people that we call prehistoric, they still had order. Otherwise, we wouldn't even know they existed.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:13.000\nBecause unlike the chimps and whatever that came before them, they were asked by God to think about shit\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:18.000\nwith their little tiny monkey brains. And they're like, this is a lot of shit to figure out.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nThe fact that this guy is dead and that guy is alive.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:26.000\nFirst of all, the sun makes... I'm supposed to eat this deer, but also the deer was alive.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nYeah. Plus the fucking sun makes no sense at all.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nNo, it picks and chooses when to come up and go down.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nSometimes it's there, sometimes it's not.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nYeah. And when it's not, it gets cold, but sometimes it's hot.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd then just when you think you got it figured out, you get hit by a lightning.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:47.000\nYeah. I feel like almost nothing makes sense. And then you're like, oh no, it does make sense.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd then someone goes, no, no. Black people.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nRight? That's something we can all get behind.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:59.000\nThey're bad people. And then as a caveman, you go like, ah, got it. I know one thing.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nI figured it out. I mean, it's anything, anything.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nOh, see that log over there? When you knock on it three times, it gives you a wish.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:11.000\nLike, try it. I wish for a sandwich. Okay, there's no sandwich. You know why?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nBecause you didn't knock hard enough. You didn't have faith.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nWe occupy our brains with these systems. That's a, you know, you go to Las Vegas\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:24.000\nand you see these fields of what? Awesome crap tables? No.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nBecause craps are actually, they're closer to chaos than order.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:33.000\nCraps are the best bet in the house. If you know how to play craps, that's actually the, you know,\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nthe best way to actually make money if you walk into Vegas with money.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nNot that there's any good way to make money, the house always wins.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nBut the worst way is slot machines. There's a fixed percentage you're going to lose,\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nbut it's the most appealing because you go up and you pull the lever\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:51.000\nand the Adams family guy says like, ooh, you win a jackpot.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:57.000\nTriple diamond. And then you go, ah, triple diamond.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nAnd the thing spits out and your girlfriend comes up and she goes,\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:04.000\nhey, we're going to the hard rock with the thing. I almost got this figured out though.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nI, you know, I push the two buttons and then the triple diamond comes up\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:13.000\nand I've lost so many times in a row. I know that I'm going to win now.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nDid I tell you?\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nAnd that is like racism.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:23.000\nIt is though. It is. It's a human, human, human slot machine.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nDid I mention this on the show before? I have a friend that used to work as a slots person.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nLike in Vegas she ran like the VIP slots and like she would take care of like high roller guests and stuff.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:37.000\nAnd we were going through the MGM and she saw a woman sitting at one of the more popular slot machines.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nThe MGM Lions. It's been there forever. It's like it makes all the money there.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nIt's one machine?\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:48.000\nIt's a bank of machines. It's a row of this certain like brand of slot machine.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nAnd there's a woman sitting at one of them and it was a progressive one.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nLike it was like a little tally of like money that comes up.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:58.000\nAnd she looked at the numbers and she goes, oh, God, I want to go tell that woman to move one to the left.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nShe goes, that one's going to pay off soon.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nI'm like, wait, what?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nShe knows which one.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nBecause it's numbers and probability and stuff?\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nShe's like, she's sitting at one that's not going to pay off today.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nThe one next to her will.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nThat's crazy that just with numbers and probability you can predict it.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nOh, and also they can tune them up.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nOh, they're cheating.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nOkay.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nAnd they don't give the old lady any money today.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:27.000\nAlso they put ones that pay off a little bit more often in walkways because they want those bells to ring more because it attracts more people in.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nThat's so smart.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nYeah, it's really...\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nYou get sucked in like the intestines of an animal.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:39.000\nAnd also in Las Vegas there's a thing where they don't allow you, if you walk through a casino, if you walk through the floor of any casino in Las Vegas,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:45.000\nyou are not allowed to take more than a certain amount of steps in a row without running into a place to put money in something.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:48.000\nYou cannot walk in a straight line for more than like 10 paces anywhere.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nYou have to...\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nWell, you have to like walk around and maybe...\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nYou constantly have to go, you have to be stopped by a thing that you could put money in.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nSex in the city.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nAdams family.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nTransformers.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nWhat is that?\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nI want to know how they base that shit.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nPeople love the Transformers slot machine.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nThey're going for everything.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:13.000\nLike sometimes you see like a 75 year old guy just cranking that Transformers machine.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nTransform and rule out.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nBing, bing, bing.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.000\nJust look at the guy like, you're not into Transformers.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nHe doesn't know about Megatron and Galvatron.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nBut then again, knowing that's not going to win you anywhere money.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nNo.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nIt's just kind of funny.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nI've never been to Vegas.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nIs it awesome?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nWhat?\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:30.000\nI've never been.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nOh.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:41.000\nThis episode, we're going to Vegas.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nWe're floating through space on a green screen effect.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nOh, here come those neon signs.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nVegas.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nTime to land.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nIs this a Vegas?\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nYeah.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:54.000\nWe're landing on the strip.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nLook around you.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:56.000\nThere's Circus Circus.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nThere's Crème Brûlée.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nYou guys ever fly to Las Vegas from like Burbank on a Friday morning?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nVery sad.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nWhat's known as the stripper express because it's you and 40 strippers.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:14.000\nThey're all fresh faced and they got their juicy suits on and they're looking good and\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nready to go.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nAnd then you fly back on a Sunday afternoon and it's just like the Cherokee trail of tears,\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nman.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nAnd it's just a bunch of people.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nBut they should be happy.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nThey're like, oh no, no.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nThey've been through hell.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nBut they just worked.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nThey're rich.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nThey're the richest creatures.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nBut man, they're just faded.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nFaded.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nThat's hard work.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:34.000\nYeah.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nIt's hard work.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nYou have to give up parts of yourself.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nNo, no.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nI don't doubt that at all.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nI was just confused.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.000\nLike I thought he meant like they didn't hit the mother load or something.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nI'd never been to.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nI went to a strip club for the first time earlier this year.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nAnd yeah, I was with Emily.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd I'd never been.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nWe were in Portland.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nYou went with your wife?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nYeah.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nIt was a bunch of us.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nIt was a music festival.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:00.000\nI wanted the names of the people I was with because so we went in and I sat down and they\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nhad food.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nThey had a full.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:08.000\nThe fucking, the strip club buffet is one of the oddest fucking.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nIt's all over the place.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nIt's Chinese, but also there's like Italian stuff.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nCan I get some more pubes in my coles laplies?\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:22.000\nI think it's weird to put that much mayonnaise near that much mayonnaise.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nYeah.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nGenitalia.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nI just, yeah, I do.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nBecause I was working, having worked in food service where there are no women like with\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\ntheir crotches above the food.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:40.000\nYou're still warned a lot about how, you know, how, you know, the air around us is filled\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\nwith all kinds of beasties just looking for a, for a perch.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nLooking for purchase.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nYeah.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:50.000\nAnd, and, and there's a, there's a zone, you know, you got to keep icing that, that colesla.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nYou got to ice that, that, that sauce.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nThey don't give a, they're not giving a shit about icing that colesla.\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:01.000\nDon't let these microbial organisms ever think for a second they have a shot at having children.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nIs this black people again?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nMaybe.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:11.000\nBut, but, but, but then to go in a strip club and like it's all dark and there's like a lady\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\ndancing and three feet from her crotch.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nThere's just crab legs and colesla.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nThat's weird to me.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:23.000\nAnd imagine me how, how hardcore do you have to be into her crotch to not grab something\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\non the way in?\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nYou know, like, like, like I got at McDonald's or something.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nOh yeah.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nTo be like, well you only have to, you have to, I want to eat and I want to look at naked women.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nI'll just eat at the strip club.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nYeah.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nI have time for one stop.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nOh, oh, I'll fill up there.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nYeah.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nIt's not bad.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:45.000\nThat's going to be a sad day when you're like, hey, the strip club food is not bad.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nBut we were there and I didn't know how it worked.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nSo they were like, my friend was like, all right, every time they do a song, you have\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nto go and give money.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nSo their eyes were not smiling.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nThey did not want to be there, these strippers.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:02.000\nAnd yeah, it was very sad.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nGo figure.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:09.000\nThe saddest, the saddest thing is they're on the pole and when the shift changes, the\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nother woman has to come and like, she has to, she has to sanitize the pole, but they're\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:16.000\nstill trying to make like a thing of it, like while she's cleaning.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nYeah.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nThat's the car wash.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nYeah.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nShe's like sprinting and kind of doing a little thing.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nPut your hands together for wipe down.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nHere she comes.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nGet your dollars ready.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nWipe down's coming out.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:31.000\nIf you've not been to Jembo's Clown Room, I recommend that you go.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nEverybody, Jembo's?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:36.000\nJembo's Clown Room is kind of the last stop.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nLike Courtney Love used to dance there.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nThey call it the gateway to rock bottom.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nAnd it's like, it's, it's, it's druggy in there.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nLike it's pretty, like there's a lot of heroin addicts on that stage.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nAnd what are the girls like?\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nIt ranges.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nIt used to be, they put it, they kind of put a paint job on Jembo's.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:54.000\nIt's a little tiny place.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nIt's very small.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nYou could buy a drink and tip the stage at the same time.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nIt's really like it's very little in there.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd don't touch anything at the Jembo's Clown Room.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nIt's unclean.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:08.000\nAnd there was a girl that used to dance there, this Latina lady who was a dude.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:12.000\nYeah, an ex, an ex gentleman.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nOkay, okay.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nUp there dancing around under, you know, a new, a new identity.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nDancing around under a new identity.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:24.000\nI think that's the name of her autobiography.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:28.000\nShe had a bull whip and she'd come out and she would frequently hurt somebody in the crowd.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nLike she's like, it's not big enough to swing a bull whip in there.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.000\nAnd she was constantly just like, like maiming somebody in the front row.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd she would do a thing and some frat boys would roll in because they'd read about it\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nand they'd heard that, you know, Courtney Leb before she started murdering husbands\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nused to work there and stuff.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:47.000\nHey, she murdered one husband.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nAll right, I'm sorry.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nI take that back.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nJust one.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nJust the one.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nAnd she would do this thing.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nIt was so good.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.000\nShe was kind of like a rock star.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:02.000\nShe would light a cigarette and then, you know, there's a little brass railing about a foot,\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:06.000\nyou know, like kind of six inches above the, like lining the edge of the stage.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nI guess keep her from going headlong into the crowd, you know.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:13.000\nBut it's a little brass railing and she would light a cigarette and put it on,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nbalance it on the rail with the lit end out.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nAnd then do a headstand.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nSo now picture her on her head with her ass facing the crowd,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nlike for her facing away, ass facing out.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:30.000\nAnd then she would do a back bend and pick up the cigarette with her ass cheeks,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nthen press back up into a headstand and do smoke rings out of her ass.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nShe would like, she would like.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nShe would like fart a little bit.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:41.000\nShe kind of, I think just the air pressure flexing her, like kind of like flexing her ass cheeks.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nI can't even picture it in my head.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:47.000\nShe would puff smoke out of her ass and then she would go down to a frat boy in the front row\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:51.000\nand put it in a guy's mouth and be like, yeah!\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nAnd the greatest thing in the world.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:54.000\nPeople died every week.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nThe greatest thing in the world is to be in the bathroom later on.\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:00.000\nYou go, you know that's a dude, right?\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:06.000\nBecause that's their deal breaker.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:11.000\nI thought I was, I thought I was, I thought I was Carrie Grant.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:17.000\nI thought, I thought I was ingesting the fecal matter of a female stripper.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nNo one, they used to be a male.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nWho's in pain tonight?\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:26.000\nThere's a big flock here.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nAll right.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nThere's a hand that's shut up.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nMa'am in the glasses.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nAre you willing to share your pain?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nAre you willing to share it up here?\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nOkay.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nWe don't bully people.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nYou want to come up and come up here?\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nI don't know why people laugh at that.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:46.000\nI guess sometimes we do.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nMy name is Miranda Harmon.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nMiranda Harmon?\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nYeah.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nH-A-R-M-O-N.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nAre you from the future?\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nI'm your daughter from the future.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nShe is exactly how I picture my daughter.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nBad news.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nI've come to warn you.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nI'm season eight of Commutina.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:07.000\nDon't eat mangoes.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nDo you think maybe we're related?\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nWell, actually no.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nMy family's last name used to be Hamburger.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nHamburger?\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nIn World War II, we changed it to Harmon.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nOh, like the comedian?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nDo you guys know Hamburger?\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nHamburger.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nWait, your family's last name was Hamburger?\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nYeah, actually my parents are.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:37.000\nOh, the hamburgers are here.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nAre you from Germany?\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nYeah.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nDid your family live in a hamlet?\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nIt's possible, yeah.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:49.000\nIt's funny, my grandparents on my mom's side are German.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:55.000\nTheir last name, my mom's maiden name is Riek, R-I-E-C-K.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nBut it used to be pronounced Reich.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:03.000\nAnd they made a strategic decision to alter the pronunciation.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nThat's a very common thing back then.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nThere's a place in Wisconsin called New Berlin.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nIt's just a town, a delightful little town.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:14.000\nGreat place to go, buy some antiques, some souvenirs.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nNew Berlin.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nBerlin, not Berlin.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nNo, not New Berlin.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nIt was New Berlin at one point.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nBut I grew up and was like, oh, let's go to New Berlin.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:27.000\nJust make that decision at some point.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nYou have to.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nOtherwise, you just start calling it something else.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nI like the Reich thing.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:37.000\nThat's a solid decision.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:41.000\nYou know a legacy is bad when you choose the word riek.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nIt was riek all along.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nHis name is Adolf.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nSo it's Maria, you said?\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nMiranda.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nMiranda.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:55.000\nYou nodded and said, Miranda, like I was right.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nClose enough.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nNot close enough.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nCall me on that.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nMiranda, what's your pain?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:06.000\nWell, so I don't know what I want to do.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:11.000\nI'm 21 years old and I feel like I went to the wrong school\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:15.000\nand I feel like I have no idea where,\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:19.000\nand I feel like the only thing I know how to do is make things\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nand be creative and I feel like that's the only way I know\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nreally how to connect to the world.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nAnd so I'm worried that I'm never going to be happy.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nWell, I mean, if you're never happy,\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nyou could actually make money creating things.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:35.000\nThank you so much for coming, Miranda.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nI guess that's probably actually a really harsh thing to say.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:41.000\nWe have a word for happy people in the creative sector.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nThey're called welders,\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nbecause they know exactly what to do and when to do it,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nand they sleep like babies at night.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:51.000\nEveryone else is just like,\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:54.000\nhorrible hack.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:57.000\nBut you're 21.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nBy the way, this isn't the first time someone's come up here\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nwith that particular pain.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:04.000\nWhite people problems.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nYou don't know what to do.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nYou're 21.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nI could hit you on the head with a bottle\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nand you could be unconscious for eight years.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nYou would wake up and you'd still be ahead of schedule.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nMaybe that's me being 40.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nBut it seems like you could waste a lot of time.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nYou do have time.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nLike they say, you know, 40 is the new 30.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:34.000\n21 is the new 11.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nDo whatever you want.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nIf you're here with your parents,\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nthat means you have a support system.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nSo unlike a lot of people,\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nyour job, if you want to be a creative,\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nis to kind of fuck around for a while.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nWhy do you say you went to the wrong school?\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nWell, I went to a liberal arts college and it's lovely,\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nbut then I decided,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:55.000\nwell, okay, so I always knew I wanted to be a cartoonist or an animator.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nYeah.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nBut in fact, that daffy duck is sitting there.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nKeep making us.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nAnd I thought that by going to a liberal arts college,\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nI would want to be something else.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nI would learn how to be like a doctor.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nOr a teacher.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nOr something different, I guess.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nI don't know why.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nBut then it's my senior year and it turns out\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nI still really want to do animation,\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nbut there's no animation program at my school.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:25.000\nAnd so now I'm kind of wondering what...\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nOops.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nYou're just feeling the embarrassment of like...\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nI don't know what to say.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nWhat sort of animation do you want to do?\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nWhat's your dream job?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nLike pie in the sky, don't embarrass yourself.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nAim way too big.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:43.000\nLike a storyboard artist on Adventure Time.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nSomething like that.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nOr a graphic novelist or something.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nSomething where I get to draw.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nThese things are within reach and they don't pay much more\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nthan what you're doing now.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nYeah.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nI mean, where are you from?\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nI'm from Orlando, Florida.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nAre you visiting here?\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:07.000\nNo, my family and I are kind of taking a trip up the west coast.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nReally?\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nSo you live in Orlando?\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nNo, I actually go to school in Baltimore.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nOkay, where?\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nIt's called Goucher College.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nGoucho?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nBut at least you get to be in Baltimore, right?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nOh, it's wonderful.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nIt's a perfect view of Hamster Dam.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nNo.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nI'm really lucky.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nI shouldn't say it.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nSo you're touring up the west coast because you kind of have a feeling,\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:37.000\nyou're feeling west coasty about your future?\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nYour college?\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nYeah, eventually, yeah.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nOr where I live.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nAnd your parents are cool enough that they're just indulging this pilgrimage and kind of...\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nMy parents are wonderful.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nI mean...\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nThat's awesome.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nWhat are their names?\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nWhat are your parents' names?\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nHamburgers, show yourself.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nYeah, they're right there.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:05.000\nWow, a guy that looks like prime sexy Sean Connery just stood up.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nLike perfect...\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nZardos.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nThat's Zardos Connery.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:15.000\nYeah, like super duper perfect Sean Connery.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nLike stood up in a denim shirt and flexed.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:21.000\nI mean, there's other bad news there too.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:25.000\nI'm just being an asshole when I say this, but having cool parents,\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:29.000\nanother nail in the coffin of creativity.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:33.000\nOh, yeah, no. Listen, my parents did everything right.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nYeah, that's the problem.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nIt's really good though.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nBut Lena Dunham had good parents, right?\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nAnd she's a great writer.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:48.000\nI'm always jaded and go like, I'm always making that joke.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nLike, oh, you have to hate your parents, you have to hate yourself,\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nyou have to be an alcoholic, you have to do other stuff.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nI'm just justifying myself.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:59.000\nThe hardest thing for me graduating college was up until this point,\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nthere are sections of your life have...\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nperiods of your life have already been sectioned off.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nLike you're going to be in this grade, this grade, this grade,\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nthen you're college for four years and after that,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:10.000\nyou sort of have to create your own periods.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:13.000\nYou know, like you don't want to be the person who's been doing the same thing\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:16.000\nfor ten years and you're like, shit, I'm still where I was after college.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:21.000\nBut, you know, I just sort of do what you want to do\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:24.000\nand you don't... I don't think you need to go to school.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nYou guys can thank me later.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nI don't think you need to go to a school.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:33.000\nYou could just... there's plenty of really talented people here\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nand you could go online and figure out how to do it\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:38.000\nand just start doing it, you know, and then see how it feels.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nThanks, man.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nShe just excused herself.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nYeah, no, that's great.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nThat bodes well for her future.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nThank you, Miranda.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:58.000\nI would say if you want to be a graphic novelist,\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nchange your name to Miranda Hamburger.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nI'd buy that.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nYeah, the war is over.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nI want to watch a cartoon and I want to see a title card\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:11.000\nthat says, created by Miranda Hamburger.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nAnd then I want to find out that that was actually her name.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:17.000\nYeah, I'm getting pretty tired of the word Harmon on stuff.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nMe too.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nYeah, garbage.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:26.000\nIt's like a low rent apatow.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:34.000\nSo, I just... because we did Harmon Quest last night.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nThat's not going to be the final title of what we did,\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:40.000\nthis D&D thing where Spencer DMs and we play,\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nand we're going to animate it.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nThe working title for Cine Family is Harmon Quest.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nAnd I suddenly realized, Jesus Christ, we can...\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nYou're like Batman.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nYeah, we're going to get my...\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nI said, I think we can beat that title,\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nand somebody was like, why?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:55.000\nThat's great.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:58.000\nAnd I was like, no, I think this thing could actually be good.\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nYeah.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:02.000\nI don't want somebody that could watch this thing\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nhaving to think that they have to drink the Kool-Aid\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nor some Kevin Smith-y guy.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nThere's more to it than that.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nThe thing we did last night is actually,\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:16.000\nI think is going to be really, really amazing.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nAnd I would hope that it would please a lot more people\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nthat are capable of liking me.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nWe should open it up to the...\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:25.000\nIf you guys think of a good name for our animated campaign\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nthat we're going to do, we're open to suggestions.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nWere any of you guys there last night?\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nIt was awesome.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:37.000\nAlright, let's bring out the lovely Erin McGathy.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nHi.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nHello.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nI was born...\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nThe new astrological sign is my new sign.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nWhat is it?\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nEfficius.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nEfficius?\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\nThat's Pisces.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nAm I pronouncing it wrong?\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nWhat is it?\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nAphiuchus?\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nI know, right?\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nAdam Glover to the rescue.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nIs it Aphiuchus?\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:15.000\nOkay, Aphiuchus, which is November 29th to December 17th,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nand I was born on December 5th, so...\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nSo there's 13 signs now?\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.000\nYes.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nWhat's the symbol of Aphiuchus?\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:23.000\nThere isn't one, because...\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nThere isn't a symbol?\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nNo, no.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nBecause astrology is a made-up game.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:33.000\nThe symbol is a strawberry writing a bull.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:36.000\nIsn't there supposed to be an attendant constellation\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nthat's a part of the sky?\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:42.000\nYeah, they don't just make those up out of, you know, thin air.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:45.000\nI mean, they kind of actually do.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nThey literally look to the sky,\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nand they're like, that looks like a bull.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nDoes it look like a bull?\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:54.000\nI think that means that myself and other people\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:58.000\nborn during that time, where it's a wild card thing,\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:03.000\nso maybe people born during that time are insecure,\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nbut charming.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nMaybe you guys aren't tied to a destiny,\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nand you can do whatever you want,\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nbecause the rest of us are on the tracks\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:14.000\nthat are dictated by our horoscopes,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nbut you guys do whatever you want.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nI was that terrible guy in high school\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:24.000\nthat would read zodiac things to people.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nI would go, here, what's your sign?\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nI would read a different one,\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nand then get them to go like, oh, my God, that's terrible.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nI would get all flipped out.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:37.000\nI read a different one, that's not you.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:40.000\nI think you telling them that is the bad part,\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:43.000\nbecause otherwise it would just be for you,\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nbut this is also for them.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:48.000\nNo, I'm just saying, I used to be that dick,\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nand then I had a relationship with a girl\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:53.000\nwho was so into astrology, it was ridiculous,\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:56.000\nand it was such a challenge at first,\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nbecause I was like, come on,\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nbut then over time, the way I coped with it,\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nI would go, oh, well, actually,\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nshe's coping with life a little better than me,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nin a lot of ways.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nOh, yeah, it's those matters.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nSomeone would spill something on her new dress\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:12.000\nat a party, and she would go,\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:15.000\nwell, it's such a Gemini,\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nand not get upset,\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\neven though she was not the most noble of people.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nShe sounds dumb.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:26.000\nYeah, you didn't raise a stink, right?\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nBecause you're not tied to any destiny.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nYou guys can do whatever you want.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nYeah.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nI was a shitty person in high school\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nwho had interpret dreams.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nYou would just tell people.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:40.000\nWell, I read a dream dictionary,\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nand then claimed that I was able to interpret dreams\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nand would stand in a certain doorway,\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nand people would come and tell me their dreams.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nWould you stand in a certain doorway?\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:51.000\nYeah, there's a certain doorway\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nwhere the door is never opened,\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nand I would stand there.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nThe certain doorway where the door is never opened?\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:58.000\nYes.\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nWhat are you saying?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nWhat?\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nIt sounds like darn your shit.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nYeah, at my high school, there was some door.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nI don't know if it was a janitor's closet or something,\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nbut no one ever...\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:11.000\nThat's way less romantic than the way you described it.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:15.000\nWhat I'm saying is that there's this enclave?\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nIs that a word?\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nEnclave.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nEnclave is a word.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nEnclave.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nWhere I would stand,\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:25.000\nand people would come and tell me their dreams.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nHow did you get in there if the door didn't open?\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nWell, it was just like...\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nIt was a...\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nLike, if there was a wall,\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nthen there was a part that went in,\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nand there were doors there,\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nbecause it was a doorway,\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nbut no one used it,\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nand I would stand there,\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nand that's where I would interpret dreams.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nOh, so a little recess in a hallway.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:42.000\nYeah.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nWe're asking the wrong question.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nShe's talking about how she used to read\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\npeople's dreams,\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nbut how did you stand there?\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nWe're all architecture architects.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nHow did you stand there?\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nWas there a load-bearing pillar there?\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nI'm just trying to get a visual idea,\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nbecause before you told us why you stood,\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nI pictured Lucy from Peanuts,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nas little the doctor is in, little Lucy.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nI was picturing a door that never opened or closed.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nI thought that was how she described it.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nShe was in this closet,\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nbut how did you get in there?\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nIt was like an Agatha Christie riddle or something.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nThere's a puddle of water on the floor\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nand a dead man in the corner\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nand a peacock feather in his hands.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nThere was a place where no one stood,\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nso I stood there.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nOh, that's very profound.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:28.000\nDid you feel qualified to do this?\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nDid you feel like you had some sort of an act of it?\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nOh, there's some fucking tension happening right now.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nYou're either two dream warriors.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:43.000\nOh, you thought you were qualified.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nSo who told you you had the right to do this shit?\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nWere you all born with it or...?\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:53.000\nDid you read a book or did you think that you had the stuff?\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:56.000\nYes, I read a book and it wasn't diabolical.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:59.000\nI really thought I knew everything.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:03.000\nAlso, I've always been a very sensitive person,\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nso a lot of it was my own feelings\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nabout the person I was talking to.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nYou are standing in a doorway right now.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:12.000\nYeah, maybe you're a little self-important,\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:15.000\nand that's really talking about locking up a stairway.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:18.000\nBut I had read the Dream Dictionary.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nIt was an embarrassing thing.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nWhat's in a Dream Dictionary?\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:30.000\nYou can look up things like your teeth falling out.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nWhat is that? Money.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nIs it really money?\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nWhen your teeth are rotting and falling out, that's money.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:39.000\nI've also read it's health, which makes sense too.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:43.000\nI used to have those dreams all the time.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:47.000\nBut I think it's so much more personal in that.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nI don't doubt that there's...\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nI think the reason why we think that there's these universal symbols\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nis kind of Jungian,\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:56.000\noh, a horse means this and teeth falling out means that,\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nis because things like teeth falling out\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:06.000\nprobably does mean a lot of very similar things to most people.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nBut I think the bottom line is you go to bed\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:13.000\nand your brain fires off this random thing.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:16.000\nThere's these lightning bolts race through your synaptic pathways.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nAnd unlike when your conscious mind is in control,\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:21.000\nit's just sort of random.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nIt's like this Pachinko machine.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nSo there's things that are on your mind,\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nand then there's just random chaos.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nYou have these weird hallucinations that time is passing,\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nthat you have an identity,\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nthat you're encountering other people,\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nthat there are places you're going.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nAnd what's really happening is your brain is just sort of like,\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:40.000\nit's sort of like the tide rolling in over a sand castle,\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:43.000\nkind of like just, or as I said, lightning,\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:46.000\ngoing through pudding and kind of just going to these different places.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:47.000\nSo you wake up and you go like,\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:52.000\nwhy did John Travolta drive that train into a mountain\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nand then it exploded and that gave me the power\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:58.000\nto tell Bruce Willis to go fuck himself?\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:02.000\nYou can't look at Bruce Willis in a book and go,\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.000\nBruce Willis means strength.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nBut he does.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nBruce Willis means, to me, he does.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:11.000\nBruce Willis means something to that dreamer.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:14.000\nSo Erin, you were standing here in your little recess in the hallway,\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nand did you have to bark up a crowd?\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nWas there a sign?\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nNo, they came to me.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nDid you have flyers put up?\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:22.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nLike good little things they could rip off.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:28.000\nThey would just say, they're doorway on it.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:31.000\nThe place where no one stands.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:36.000\nIt started with me just doing a casually and passing edit lunch.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nAnd I also really thought that I was good at it.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:42.000\nI had read that dictionary and then just let it go.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:47.000\nSo I really was just pretending to be a therapist, I guess,\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:48.000\nin my own mind.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nBut I wasn't bullshitting.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nI thought that I was legit.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:55.000\nBut eventually there was such a high demand that I had to find a doorway.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:58.000\nYou probably were good at it relative to your other high school classmates\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nbecause you're an intuitive person.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:01.000\nRight.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:07.000\nIn the same way that I insisted that I become a student peer counselor at my high school,\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:10.000\nI was like, if anyone has any problems, no one came to me.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:15.000\nBut I was an official peer counselor at my high school,\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:19.000\nbut no one ever came to me because they were adult counselors.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nSo you had two jobs.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.000\nYou were the peer counselor and you also were the dream interpreter?\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:26.000\nI guess so.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nThat's pretty good.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:32.000\nThere was a portion where I got really into hypnotizing people.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nI fancied myself.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nWhat?\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nI read a bunch of books about hypnosis.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:39.000\nAll hypnotists will tell you that there's no such thing as hypnotic state.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:47.000\nIt's just a state of enhanced relaxation and openness to suggestibility and stuff.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:50.000\nAnd I used to go to parties with Matt Gurley.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:54.000\nAnd part of being a hypnotizing people is you have someone else go up and go,\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nis she the guy over there?\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nThe guy with the tall guy over there?\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nOh yeah, the liar.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nNo, the liar number one.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nI'm the big liar.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nAnd then they go, yeah, he's a hypnotist.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nHe can hypnotize you.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:07.000\nAnd you find people that are open to that idea.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:10.000\nAnd I would walk up to people and they would go, oh, hypnotize me.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:13.000\nAnd I'd go, okay, it's easy to forget things.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:16.000\nSo even things that you know.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:20.000\nFor instance, I could ask you a question that you know the answer to,\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nbut you might not be able to tell me the answer.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:25.000\nYou start waving your hands around a little bit and they start getting ready to be hypnotized.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nAnd you go, like you, what's your name?\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:28.000\nAaron.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nSee, I'm bad at it now.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:33.000\nI actually got to the point where I could do that and people would go like,\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:36.000\nand they would pretend to not know their name.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:40.000\nIt was really like, and then I would knock people out and make them think that like all this.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nSo they've just hypnotized themselves.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:46.000\nYeah, that's a question that he'd pay like what, $300,000 or something like that.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:49.000\nIf anybody could prove to him there was such a thing as a hypnotic state.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:58.000\nYou know, I remember going to Pasadena to the Ice House Comedy Club\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:04.000\nbecause my Armenian plumber neighbor had won one of those comedy contests where they paper the house\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:07.000\nand they brought him a limo and stuff.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:12.000\nHe's like, I got eight tickets to the Pasadena Ice House Comedy Club.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nMotherfucker, we got to go.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:19.000\nAnd I was like, all right, I'll go and we piled into the limo.\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:23.000\nWe were literally the only eight people in the Pasadena Ice House.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:26.000\nAnd it wasn't a comedian, it was a hypnotist.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:31.000\nAnd I had seen these guys like identical acts that came to my high school and stuff.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:34.000\nSo I had gleaned this, what was happening.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:38.000\nSo I faked being hypnotizable.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:41.000\nYou know, they do a thing where they go like, hold your hands above your head\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:45.000\nand now you can't put them down. And I purposely didn't put them down\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nbecause I knew he needed somebody up there.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:53.000\nI went up there and sat in a chair and did 45 minutes with this guy\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:56.000\nwhere he would go like, you're a Chinese rapper.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nAnd I'd go, cha-cha-cha-ching-cha, cha-cha-cha.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:03.000\nLike, I was just doing bad improv.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:08.000\nLike, what's bad about cha-cha-cha-cha-ching-cha?\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:12.000\nAsk Rosie O'Donnell.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:15.000\nYeah, I mean, it was in that case racist.\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:18.000\nAnd then other shit was like, okay, you're naked now, you're naked.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nAnd I would act like I thought I was naked.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:23.000\nI was up there for full 45.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nDoing this guy's act.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.000\nHe wasn't doing anything, but wearing a gross suit.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:31.000\nAnd like, suggesting that I...\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:35.000\nThere was no different from comedy sports except for a lot of key differences.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:38.000\nA lot of the stage hypnotists were literally...\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:42.000\nI've had friends that went up there and were the guests I had brought up.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nAnd they'll go like, hey, help me out.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nThey'll whisper to you like, help me out here.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nAnd they're like, ah, so?\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nYou can sleep.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:53.000\nThey just say, don't make me look like a fucking dick up.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nI bet that's most of it.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nThis guy didn't have to say that.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:01.000\nThe silence in the room and the empty chairs were speaking that.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nHow was the limo right back for you?\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:08.000\nAll my neighbors kept going like, what was happening?\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nWas it magical?\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nDid you remember anything?\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nAnd I was like, well, I remember...\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:15.000\nI kind of split the difference.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nOh, you didn't?\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:19.000\nI was sort of like, well, I kind of felt really relaxed.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nAnd I sort of just wanted to do...\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nI threaded a needle where I didn't lie to anybody,\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.000\nbut did this guy's act and kind of...\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nIt was really sad.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nYeah, the ice houses of darkness.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:35.000\nIt's never been darker than when I was rapping in Chinese.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nThat was insane.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.000\nYou can't say...\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nIt's a new world.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:55.000\nIf the words Ching Chong or anything else came out of my mouth,\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:58.000\nfucking teamsy headline.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:00.000\nWhat do you mean if it came out of your mouth?\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nYou just did that.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:06.000\nI mean, I'm hoping that the absurdity of the context...\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:09.000\nHow surgical would they have to be to pull that out?\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:10.000\nNot very.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nThere's a solid five seconds.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:16.000\nThere were people at the TCA's,\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:20.000\nand I said at one point, I said in my babbling,\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nI said, yeah, because somebody asked me...\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:25.000\nBasically, his question was like,\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:28.000\ndon't you think you could be more successful\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nif you shut up or something?\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nIt was some kind of Pharisee question.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nAnd I was like...\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nI was like, I don't know.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:40.000\nI guess I'm doing okay by my own standards,\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:44.000\nand I say stuff, and I get to be on honest ground,\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:47.000\nand that helps me sleep at night,\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nand sometimes people can pull stuff out of context,\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nand that helps them sell the Cardiads,\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.000\nand that's fine too.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nI accept that.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nAnd then there was the live tweeting was like,\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:58.000\nDan Harmon blames the media\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:02.000\nfor his out-of-context quotations,\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nand it was like so meta, like,\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:05.000\nwhat are you doing?\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nStop it.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:10.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:13.000\nI don't care.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nAll right, so who's to get Spencer up here?\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nLet's get him.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nSpencer!\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:24.000\nGo-pe-du-go-down-down.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:28.000\nBring your satchel and your flannel jacket.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:29.000\nBring your beard.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nYeah, I can hold him.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nHello, Spencer.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:35.000\nSitting down.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:36.000\nWhat's up?\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:37.000\nWhat happened?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nDid you enjoy doing the show yesterday?\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nIt was a culmination of a lot of effort.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:43.000\nYeah, I was freaking out.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:46.000\nSpencer is now, like, you came to the show one night\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:50.280\none night telling your friends in the car on the way over I feel like I should\n\n43:50.280 --> 43:55.120\nplay D&D with Dan Harmon. That night I said is there a Dungeon Master here\n\n43:55.120 --> 44:00.280\nbecause I had this thing like let's play D&D in the show flash forward to we\n\n44:00.280 --> 44:04.840\nplayed D&D in this show, now we're doing D&D in this stop animated thing that\n\n44:04.840 --> 44:08.760\nwe're recording and you come over to my house on Tuesday nights. That's what I\n\n44:08.760 --> 44:13.560\nwas thinking about. We have a private session. Yeah, it's almost like a bubble.\n\n44:13.560 --> 44:17.120\nIt's your assistant so he comes over more than just on Tuesday nights.\n\n44:17.120 --> 44:22.320\nAnd sometimes I'm just in your house. But you have three D&D campaigns that are going\n\n44:22.320 --> 44:25.640\nout at once. Yeah, I was texting Jeff like that was one of the things I've\n\n44:25.640 --> 44:30.240\nreally been thinking about is like you get like did you think when you saw me\n\n44:30.240 --> 44:34.840\nyou know like oh I'm probably gonna be playing three separate games of D&D with\n\n44:34.840 --> 44:39.600\nthis person in the future. I could do four man. I'm into it. Yeah, yeah.\n\n44:39.600 --> 44:43.880\nI'm just you in this show. Do you have other other games that you play\n\n44:43.880 --> 44:49.720\noutside of our group of friends? Better not. No. Do you? No. You do. How\n\n44:49.720 --> 44:57.520\nprettier are they? No. I tell you guys, would you? Would you? You didn't tell us\n\n44:57.520 --> 45:00.360\nwhen we went into that room full of mirrors in our private session that all\n\n45:00.360 --> 45:04.160\nwe had to do is smash all the mirrors. Wait, you found a box of rocks in the room\n\n45:04.160 --> 45:11.120\nbefore? Look, hey. Yeah, but there were eight different colors of laser bouncing\n\n45:11.120 --> 45:15.480\naround the room. We walk into a room and it's a maze of mirrors and there's a big\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:18.400\nball of light in the middle of this room if you can get to it. It's shooting\n\n45:18.400 --> 45:21.920\ndifferent colored lasers that are reflecting all around the thing and\n\n45:21.920 --> 45:26.400\nyou can if you reflect it back into the thing it comes out different colors\n\n45:26.400 --> 45:30.640\nand then we made a big white light that blasted a giant hole and then there was\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:35.640\na look. Here's where we spent fucking three hours in this room. Three hours moving\n\n45:35.640 --> 45:41.320\nmirrors. Holding up pieces of paper to the lasers. The reminiscent of the first\n\n45:41.320 --> 45:45.280\ndungeon on Plymouth Town. Dan kept sending his little snake, what's his name?\n\n45:45.280 --> 45:50.840\nLassiter? Dennehyde. Dennehyde. Dan is a snake and we kept sending a snake around to\n\n45:50.840 --> 45:54.840\ngo and recon mission because it was low enough to not get hit by the lasers and\n\n45:54.840 --> 46:00.120\nwe spent a good most of our lives in that in that fucking room. Finally Rob\n\n46:00.120 --> 46:03.280\nSharp was like, I go into the room where the rocks are and I take a rock and I go\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:07.080\nboot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot and I throw it at the thing and that was it. Now\n\n46:07.080 --> 46:11.160\nhere's my problem was that Spencer. Here's my problem. I think my theory is\n\n46:11.160 --> 46:15.520\nyou let us out of that thing because you felt bad for us. Okay. Because there\n\n46:15.520 --> 46:18.640\nwas a little there was a big mirror and then there was a little side mirror on\n\n46:18.640 --> 46:23.520\nthe wall that was directly facing the thing and you got all excited when\n\n46:23.520 --> 46:26.760\nwe started getting lights to bounce back and forth out of that. That seemed like\n\n46:26.760 --> 46:30.200\na thing and then and then all of a sudden we could have just broken it. There\n\n46:30.200 --> 46:36.320\nwas a way to get out of that one. Okay okay okay. And Jeff has theorized the same thing before like\n\n46:36.320 --> 46:41.400\nit's it's a big deal like this isn't. Well he's not entirely wrong I mean. Yeah you\n\n46:41.400 --> 46:46.920\nhad pity. The whole time all of those mirrors were completely breakable with\n\n46:46.920 --> 46:51.080\nthe condition that they were enchanted and the shards would float up and slice\n\n46:51.080 --> 46:55.640\nat you as you broke them but at the same time that's how you get through but you\n\n46:55.640 --> 46:58.960\nknow you were doing the red-blue-green lasers and you were trying to get them at\n\n46:58.960 --> 47:03.160\nthat same mirror that was the solution except you had them so they were\n\n47:03.160 --> 47:06.920\nseparately hitting and all of you guys were holding up the mirrors but if you\n\n47:06.920 --> 47:09.920\ntweaked them so they're touching at the same spot and all the colors combined\n\n47:09.920 --> 47:13.640\ninto white light that would also open the door. So it was double-sided. We were on\n\n47:13.640 --> 47:17.720\nthe right kind of path. Yeah and then you abandoned it and I was like oh shit. I\n\n47:17.720 --> 47:24.960\nwasn't I wasn't there for that session. How do you weigh in? I'm having a tough\n\n47:24.960 --> 47:28.640\ntime seeing this room in my head. It was tough seeing it with the mirror with the\n\n47:28.640 --> 47:34.600\nmap I drew too. It was pretty shit. All right look listen tough guy. This is a\n\n47:34.600 --> 47:38.320\nnew kind of episode of Harmontown. We're fucking rolling up our sleeves. We're\n\n47:38.320 --> 47:46.440\ngonna D&D the fuck out of the shit. Get your shit out. Get your dice. Get your\n\n47:46.440 --> 47:53.800\npencils. I'm not even that drunk yet. Spencer your wish to like play D&D\n\n47:53.800 --> 47:58.760\nwith Harmon came true in like a monkey's paw kind of way because it's like every\n\n47:58.760 --> 48:06.760\nwaking moment will be D&D with Dan Harmon. Get out your characters. Spencer do you\n\n48:06.760 --> 48:10.640\never... Oh can I say oh sorry I was gonna change the topic for a second before we\n\n48:10.640 --> 48:14.440\ndid D&D but... No go ahead. I was gonna say this real quick I don't think I've\n\n48:14.440 --> 48:16.680\ntalked about it we were talking about the dream thing when you're sleeping and\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:22.120\nweird shit happens like you know it just you're like when you punch your mom.\n\n48:22.120 --> 48:29.000\nGuys that was told why are you gonna bring up old shit? Literally like many\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:35.040\nyears old. Okay I'm gonna know what that means. What? Cumeo punches mom when he was\n\n48:35.040 --> 48:39.880\ncoming out of anesthesia. I remember. I didn't okay I didn't do it on purpose I\n\n48:39.880 --> 48:46.720\nmean I did technically do it on purpose. I moved to the US and I'll say this\n\n48:46.720 --> 48:49.760\nreal quick about my grandfather and I had like really weird relations like we\n\n48:49.760 --> 48:53.160\ndidn't get along and then I was in the US and he died and I couldn't go back for\n\n48:53.160 --> 48:55.880\nhis funeral and I felt like you know we had unresolved issues and I was felt\n\n48:55.880 --> 49:00.000\nreally bad about it for like a week and then I had a dream and I don't believe\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:05.840\nyou know. You didn't believe in that Jeff Davis shit. I don't believe like ghost\n\n49:05.840 --> 49:12.280\nstuff whatever it's like but he came in my dream and we talked and then I didn't\n\n49:12.280 --> 49:15.920\nfeel weird after that and my brain some part of my brain realized that that's\n\n49:15.920 --> 49:21.800\nwhat I needed to have happen in a dream. Right. To be able to move past that. Yeah.\n\n49:21.800 --> 49:27.280\nSo it's not always like random like sometimes it's. No not always random at\n\n49:27.280 --> 49:32.560\nall I mean I mean because our unconscious minds are absolutely containment\n\n49:32.560 --> 49:37.400\nunits and pathways to the things that are truly important so that's why dreams\n\n49:37.400 --> 49:42.000\nthat's why we remember them at all because they totally resonate like we\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:47.240\nwake up and go holy shit. I don't know if other people are different but nine\n\n49:47.240 --> 49:51.240\ntimes out of ten when I wake up I don't I don't remember having dreamed at all and\n\n49:51.240 --> 49:55.400\nthen other people like every night like Aaron's like I'm dreaming. She's like a\n\n49:55.400 --> 50:03.240\ndream junkie. But like I but I think the bottom line is that like if if it if what\n\n50:03.240 --> 50:07.360\nhappens in your unconscious mind resonates with your conscious mind i.e. if\n\n50:07.360 --> 50:12.040\nthis weird random kind of like like dragon's lair lightning path kind of\n\n50:12.040 --> 50:17.480\nlike creates a pattern that that can mean something to your forebrain then\n\n50:17.480 --> 50:22.040\nwhen you wake up you go oh wow that's weird that John Travolta attacked me\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:31.000\nwith a pencil. What does that mean. It's just insanity at the time that's like\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:34.360\nnot even anything but I think the stuff that's brewing down there is\n\n50:34.360 --> 50:39.480\ndefinitely absolutely important and I there's there's a scientific and\n\n50:39.480 --> 50:43.520\nspiritual explanation for your dad coming to you and your dream or grandpa\n\n50:43.520 --> 50:46.480\ncoming to your dream and you resolving that I think I think that's a that's a\n\n50:46.480 --> 50:50.960\nplace where science and religion both totally overlap right. I mean it sounds\n\n50:50.960 --> 50:54.920\nlike you've come to peace like you came to peace with your relationship with\n\n50:54.920 --> 51:00.640\nyour grandpa. It seems like you're doing a bit didn't it. She's like there's a\n\n51:00.640 --> 51:04.720\nlong line there's like 18 people behind you. Will you carry my my books to fifth\n\n51:04.720 --> 51:09.000\nperiod. You're exactly right. Oh you were doing a bit you were doing the dream\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:13.360\ninterpreter. I used to I used to. She was at the doorway. Can I say really quick how\n\n51:13.360 --> 51:21.480\nthat ended. How did it end. A friend of mine called Bullshit and came to me with\n\n51:21.480 --> 51:30.880\na fake dream and I. He den-harmoned you. Reading the wrong horoscope. He gave me\n\n51:30.880 --> 51:35.880\nthis really elaborate dream and I took a long time interpreting it and then at\n\n51:35.880 --> 51:39.880\nthe end of it was like I just made that up because because this is this is this\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:44.920\nis fake. Because this is too much power for one woman to have. Stop standing where\n\n51:44.920 --> 51:52.360\nno one stands. Turning this into a Walmart. Yeah. We were like making that my\n\n51:52.360 --> 51:55.720\nmy emotional experience with interpreting his dream and then finding out that it\n\n51:55.720 --> 52:00.320\nwasn't real made me never do it again. Welcome to the huge. No it's fine. It's fine.\n\n52:00.320 --> 52:03.840\nHe was just lying to you. And then later I would just talk to people about their\n\n52:03.840 --> 52:06.600\nfeelings. Okay well you can you interpret a dream that I've had a couple\n\n52:06.600 --> 52:15.720\ntimes. Sure gay. This is huge. Oh my god it's like Superman working together. No because\n\n52:15.720 --> 52:20.680\nbecause the obvious answer is gay because I had a dream. I used to have a dream once\n\n52:20.680 --> 52:24.280\nin a while that my dick kept coming off. It just went it would just detach. Would it\n\n52:24.280 --> 52:29.560\ngo off on its own or was it dead. It was like it would turn to you and it would say I wish\n\n52:29.560 --> 52:35.240\nI was in a butt. Yeah. Follow me. But stop putting me in vaginas and put me on men's\n\n52:35.240 --> 52:40.000\nbutt. Yeah. I want to try to do this for real and what situation would it. Well okay here's\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.480\nthe dream and this is embarrassing but I'm gonna tell you I want you to interpret this.\n\n52:42.480 --> 52:46.440\nI mean I don't think it requires all that much interpretation. I think it's just vanity\n\n52:46.440 --> 52:50.720\nbut I was in a dream having a sex dream. I have a lot of sex dreams. I'm kind of James\n\n52:50.720 --> 52:54.960\nBond in my dream. It's fucking and fighting at all times in my dreams. Are you fucking\n\n52:54.960 --> 53:00.680\nreal women or dream women. Dream women. Are they like oh that one looks like Jennifer\n\n53:00.680 --> 53:04.120\nLawrence or whatever or are you making them up. Sometimes we're actual people sometimes\n\n53:04.120 --> 53:07.040\nthat's that kind of that morphing thing where you're with somebody and they kind of morph into\n\n53:07.040 --> 53:14.840\nsomeone else and stuff. Okay. But I was going down on a gal administering. You're even you're\n\n53:14.840 --> 53:24.160\nso lucky. So your dream sex has like elaborate like foreplay. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Oh fucking\n\n53:24.160 --> 53:29.560\nlast night I said I was in a great sex dream last night. Some big tattooed rocky but they\n\n53:29.560 --> 53:32.840\njust laid me up on a bar and just started sucking my dick right at the bar and everyone\n\n53:32.840 --> 53:41.480\nelse. Everyone was really bummed out. Everyone was bummed out. They were. Oh no. I like this\n\n53:41.480 --> 53:54.080\nbar. So I'm going down in this gal and then as I'm doing it I realize that she has a dick\n\n53:54.080 --> 54:00.160\nbut it's my dick. So you're sucking your own. I'm sucking my dick on a girl and the whole\n\n54:00.160 --> 54:04.400\ntime I think she's all into it. She's not going to come. She's like she's loving it.\n\n54:04.400 --> 54:09.520\nAnd the whole time I'm thinking I don't want to come in my own mouth. You're nervous about\n\n54:09.520 --> 54:19.680\nyour taxes. And you can recognize your own dick. Yeah. What is that about? I see my dick\n\n54:19.680 --> 54:29.800\nmore than any other dick. Yes. Does it wear a hat? Sometimes it does. It tastes like Branca.\n\n54:29.800 --> 54:35.640\nSometimes it affects a little cape and a smart cane. I had a dream once. It has Calvin peeing\n\n54:35.640 --> 54:43.760\non a vagina on it. Tattooed. When I was like a teenager and I distinctly remember a dream\n\n54:43.760 --> 54:52.800\nI had where I was a woman and I was getting it from a guy. I was in my kitchen sink and\n\n54:52.800 --> 55:01.080\nI was a woman. I was a teenager. I was 17. In the height of my... And the guy was fucking\n\n55:01.080 --> 55:08.760\nyou in the sink? Yeah. And I was a woman. And I was enjoying it. I'm frequently a woman.\n\n55:08.760 --> 55:14.120\nSee I made that up. I wanted to get him to... In my dreams I'm off on a woman in my dreams.\n\n55:14.120 --> 55:19.520\nThat's the name of this episode by the way. I'm off on a woman in my dreams. I'm frequently\n\n55:19.520 --> 55:27.840\na woman. One dream I was Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island. I was getting fucked by the professor\n\n55:27.840 --> 55:33.480\nbut the skipper kept coming in and fucking bumming out our action. And the professor\n\n55:33.480 --> 55:43.400\ngot so mad. Listen to your voicemails. And then another time I was... Who's the daughter\n\n55:43.400 --> 55:49.520\non Good Times? Thelma? Thelma? I was Thelma. The sexy daughter from Good Times remembers\n\n55:49.520 --> 55:57.400\nthat sitcom and I was getting fucked by JJ. So you were doing Rule 34 stuff in your dreams\n\n55:57.400 --> 56:04.000\nbefore? What's that? Is it Rule 34? Is it? Yeah. That's the internet... If it exists\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:10.160\nthere is porn of it. Yeah. I was doing my own... That's Rule 34 of the internet. If it exists\n\n56:10.160 --> 56:15.200\nthere is porn of it. Right. I've never been a woman in my dreams. I feel like lame kind\n\n56:15.200 --> 56:22.040\nof. Maybe tonight. I've never been close to a woman in my dreams. I've never even\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:28.280\nbeen anybody else. I'm always me in my dreams. Not even the professor. Harmontown at the\n\n56:28.280 --> 56:33.560\nwedding professor garb but I still me. Dan, you're saying you wouldn't recognize your\n\n56:33.560 --> 56:39.840\nown dick in a dream? I mean it's just this little guy. I mean what is it? I see it from\n\n56:39.840 --> 56:48.680\nthe top. It's just like a little pink choo-choo train. I assume it looks the same as Adam\n\n56:48.680 --> 56:58.880\nGoldberg's? I don't know. Adam, get up here. Adam, get up here. No, we're kidding. If I\n\n56:58.880 --> 57:03.400\nsaw it coming at me I wouldn't go, that's my dick. No, but I bet if you saw a dick that\n\n57:03.400 --> 57:09.440\nwasn't yours you'd be like, that's not my dick. Well, yeah. If it was gigantic and effective.\n\n57:09.440 --> 57:22.240\nIf it was half inside a very happy person. I'd be like, that can't be my dick. I would\n\n57:22.240 --> 57:29.880\nalways recognize mine because I have a horrible zipper scar. Whoa. From circumcision you mean?\n\n57:29.880 --> 57:37.840\nNo, they didn't circumcise me with a zipper. From his audition for there's something about\n\n57:37.840 --> 57:45.400\nMary. You sliced yourself with a zipper? I've done that, that's the fucking word. I was\n\n57:45.400 --> 57:53.920\nlike 12 or 13. You scarred yourself? Yeah. Did you get stitches or something? No, I told\n\n57:53.920 --> 58:01.960\nnobody. We're very repressed over there. I went to, actually I wasn't wearing, this is\n\n58:01.960 --> 58:08.080\nthe weird part of the story. I didn't wear underwear for way too long. Like I was maybe\n\n58:08.080 --> 58:13.280\n13 when I started wearing underwear. I don't know, I don't want to talk about it. Yes,\n\n58:13.280 --> 58:26.520\nyou do. Too much to contain. Yeah, there's just a lot to contain. Let's go with that.\n\n58:26.520 --> 58:34.800\nI had just discovered masturbation. Well, I was like fucking so into it. I was having\n\n58:34.800 --> 58:39.480\nfun. I was pretty fun. And when I was doing it, it became this game, like how quickly\n\n58:39.480 --> 58:44.640\ncan I do it? So I would try and go for the record. So this was like, I think the fourth\n\n58:44.640 --> 58:48.680\ntime I was doing it that day. What is the record right now? Where does the record stand?\n\n58:48.680 --> 58:54.920\nI don't remember, but I bet it's around like seven or eight. Seconds? No, no, no, how many\n\n58:54.920 --> 58:59.080\ntimes in a day I've masturbated. Oh, I thought you were taking the record of how quickly\n\n58:59.080 --> 59:03.880\nyou could do it. Oh, yeah, but that was part of it too. Okay. Yeah, if you're going to\n\n59:03.880 --> 59:10.880\ndo it eight times. Yeah, I'm not here to, you know, measured in blinks. So, uh, yeah,\n\n59:10.880 --> 59:15.880\nso I did it. It was like the fourth time and we were going to this theme park in Pakistan\n\n59:15.880 --> 59:21.720\ncalled Fundland. That was the name of it, which seems like a real like, yeah, real first draft\n\n59:21.720 --> 59:30.360\nname, you know, fun land. Seems like a trap. Like they're trying to lure Americans in.\n\n59:30.360 --> 59:35.280\nYeah, yeah, like trying to get kids. Yeah, fun land, right? Yeah, like fun. You think\n\n59:35.280 --> 59:43.480\nthis is how you have fun? Can you just go to some land? So I was like, well, I was like,\n\n59:43.480 --> 59:46.400\nI had to get it before and I was going with my cousins. I was like, I could get it before\n\n59:46.400 --> 59:50.040\nit's time to go. So I was in there. I was trying to go, go, go. And my mom started yelling\n\n59:50.040 --> 59:55.160\nat me, it's time we have to go. The car is leaving. So that makes it harder than to come\n\n59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.520\nbecause I can hear my mom yelling at me. So I finally like fucking through sheer force\n\n01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:07.600\nof will, very proud that in these circumstances, I could do it. So I got it done. And I just\n\n01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:16.760\nzipped through my teeth. And it was jeans and I didn't have underwear and I rode roller\n\n01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:27.160\ncoasters all day. Bleeding. Geez. Yeah. Wow. Camille. Camille's comedy special is available\n\n01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:35.120\non. You should make Camille a cake. Zipper, Zipper dick. Can I get a penis that doesn't\n\n01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:42.320\nhave a zipper scar on it? Okay, Camille, I shut my little brother's penis in a gate.\n\n01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:54.360\nJeff, what time is it? So many questions. When my little brother was in diapers and I\n\n01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.880\nwas a few years older than him, I was a toddler. I wanted to change his diaper to show my parents\n\n01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:07.560\nthat I could change his diaper. And I yanked off his clean diaper and he was running away\n\n01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:13.680\nfrom me and we had marble stairs and there was a baby gate at the top of the marble stairs.\n\n01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:20.440\nThat's the name of the story. It's called Babygate. It was a little open and he was\n\n01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.560\nrunning up to the stairs and I was worried that he was going to fall down the stairs\n\n01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:30.840\nand at the exact wrong moment, I shut the gate. On his penis? On his penis and he had\n\n01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:40.360\nto get stitches. It was terrible. And he wiped it from his memory. We're really good friends.\n\n01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:46.440\nWe're good friends and a few years ago, we both camp-counseled at the same camp and at\n\n01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.520\na campfire, I was like, well, there was not time when I shut your penis in a gate. He's\n\n01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.880\nlike, what are you talking about? He had no idea. I assume his penis is fine. I looked\n\n01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.880\nat it completely crooked. Is that why it looks like a corkscrew? Yeah. Why is there a hinge\n\n01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:09.600\nimprint on it? All penises are in L, right? All right. Well, I'm glad we got to this\n\n01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.120\nplace because I think I felt like, as my own words critic, I thought the show started kind\n\n01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:22.280\nof flat and stale and inhuman. I came up and said I had nothing. We got to penises. Specifically\n\n01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:31.800\nlike their abuse. As you guys are sitting on the real question, real talk, Jeff, Camille,\n\n01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.960\nDan, Spencer, as you're sitting up here, are you aware of your penis just sitting there?\n\n01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:47.680\nLike, because it's just there. No. I am now. Only when it wants to play. Yeah. Which can\n\n01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.200\nbe random. And when you're like 11, 12 years old, that's the thing that people don't understand\n\n01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:58.680\nabout little boys. It's like, it's just happening. The plumbing is just like, we blame kids\n\n01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.320\nfor like, oh, what are you doing? And what are you thinking? And what are you talking\n\n01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.160\nabout? I was once in swim class when I was 10. And I was playing like chicken with this\n\n01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.800\nboy and the lifeguard said, hey, you come out. And he came out and he had an erection.\n\n01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.240\nI had never seen an erection before. And he was like, you're bad and made him leave the\n\n01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:23.040\npool. Yeah, not a good idea. That is the worst. Probably not that kid's choice. That kid is\n\n01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:30.040\na serial killer. I was at my high school, I was watching a lifeguard. He kills lifeguards.\n\n01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.080\nIf we're lucky. Don't moderate swimming. There was a guy in our water polo team in\n\n01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.160\nhigh school and he got out of the pool and like, you know, like the water polo team,\n\n01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.960\nthese guys were all like ridiculously good looking. They're like perfect bodies. And\n\n01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.280\nthis guy got out in his little speedos and he's like, he's like an Abercrombie and Fitch\n\n01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.240\nmodel, like looking back on it. And he had a fucking heart on and everybody teased him\n\n01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.400\nlike crazy. But like, there were parents there too. You know, there are moms are like, oh\n\n01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.920\nyeah. We're like, like, it was like, like looking back at it now, like like a hot 17\n\n01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.640\nyear old guy getting out with a big boner. Like the kids, we thought that was hilarious.\n\n01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.640\nWe teased him about it. But you know, there were moms that were like, I mean, as a woman,\n\n01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.440\nI've got to say, I've never seen an erection from far away and I started to be like, yeah,\n\n01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:22.080\nthat'll do me good. That's what mommy needs. That's real rigid.\n\n01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.080\nAll right, well,\n\n01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.680\nThere are some numbers that the grocery store wouldn't be sexy. Not sexy to see it like\n\n01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.960\na really attractive guy with an erection in a little bit. So I mean, if I was a mom at\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.120\na water polo game, I would have more feelings first like, Oh, that poor kid, like he's he's\n\n01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.360\nexperiencing all these things. If if I was on if I was a if I was an elderly woman who\n\n01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:51.280\nhad like a pool boy and he's like, can I can I can they take a dip Miss McGathey and\n\n01:04:51.280 --> 01:05:00.280\nI swam around and was swimming. What country is this guy from? Please don't interrupt her.\n\n01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:08.240\nLet this play out. Continue playing all the parts full accents. I think it was Miss McGathey's\n\n01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:14.760\nturn. Sorry. Continue. He's clean my pool. He's swimming around. Miss McGathey, I just\n\n01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.240\nhave to tell you, it's just so embarrassing, but you're so pretty. It's so embarrassing.\n\n01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:29.600\nAnd I'm like, oh, come on, Javier, it's fine. Swimming, swimming, swimming. Javier jumps\n\n01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:45.360\nout of the pool and looks down at his member, which is fully erect shy. He blushes and looks\n\n01:05:45.360 --> 01:06:04.320\nat Miss McGathey and Miss McGathey says, Javier, it's fine. This is a safe place. No, it's\n\n01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:20.160\nfine. Are you sure Miss McGathey? I am nervous. I am so embarrassed that I saw you standing\n\n01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:32.080\nat the pool and you're so smart. I had an erection. I was so emotionally centered. I\n\n01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:39.800\nwas watching on YouTube. I saw your UCB reel. You're in some very funny sketches. I had\n\n01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:45.080\nyour cake. It was delicious. I saw you interacting with people. It looks like you're really\n\n01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:52.480\nlistening. I had this erection. I don't know what to do with that. I don't know how to\n\n01:06:52.480 --> 01:07:01.040\nmake it go away. Javier, come upstairs with me. I'll show you. I'll make your erection\n\n01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:16.960\ngo away. I have a place. Talk to me for five more minutes. Can I talk to you about my dream\n\n01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:25.680\nwedding? You see it shrink in his drawers. Do you want to have kids? I want to have three\n\n01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.360\nor so. I don't know. Where are you going, Javier? I just want to have sex. No, but I\n\n01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:38.440\nwant to partner for life. Please, please, please don't leave me alone. You're freaking me out,\n\n01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:50.680\nMiss McGathey. My mom hated me. Please be my mommy. Please. Then Javier is like, all right.\n\n01:07:50.680 --> 01:08:08.280\nAnd then he takes me back to school shopping. All right. Who needs D&D? That was fucking.\n\n01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:17.280\nHey, Spencer, do you have any penis injuries? Oh, yeah. Tons. Anything weird ever happen\n\n01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:28.720\nto your penis, Spencer? Yeah, you know. It went places. Have you ever experimented and\n\n01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:38.120\nstuck your penis in a weird thing? Yeah, like most of them. Most things? Most weird things.\n\n01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.120\nWhat's the weirdest thing you've experimented with? One of those teenage mutant Ninja Turtle\n\n01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:54.760\nguys at the meltdown over there. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. What you guys don't know is that when\n\n01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.400\nyou guys leave and they lock the door, Spencer hides under that little folding table and\n\n01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:05.520\nhe emerges and he's just fucking everything. Turtle power. Who thinks Donatello did that?\n\n01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:14.120\nHe's a big tripper by the Beatles starts playing and he just runs around. He just hums everything.\n\n01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:21.840\nEvery Alan Moore comic. All right. Well, do you, I mean, we were just trying to loop you\n\n01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.840\nin. Do you want to play some D&D? I mean, I love doing everything. Literally. Yeah.\n\n01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:34.000\nAll right. Well, let's do it. Do you want to tell us a story or just do D&D? What? I\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:45.600\nmean, I have stuff to say. I don't know. Say it. I'm not saying I whatever. I used to interpret\n\n01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:56.760\ndreams of high school also. Yeah. It happened. That's all. Did you have a doorway? Did you\n\n01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:03.800\nstand in a place where no one stands? Yeah. No, no. I don't know. It was just, it wasn't\n\n01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.280\nanywhere near as formal as yours. But how was your high school experience? Did you enjoy it?\n\n01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.800\nDid you hate it? It was really awkward. Like my older brother was really, I mean, not like\n\n01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.000\nin a bad way, in a great way, but like my older brother was pretty popular. So like a lot of\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.240\npeople that were older knew me and I just, I kind of knew a lot of different people, but\n\n01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.800\nI didn't really hang out with very many people. I hung out with, you know, like my friends\n\n01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:32.560\nand stuff mostly and we did weird stuff. That's pretty standard. Yeah. Played video games\n\n01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560\nand Magic the Gathering cards.\n\n01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.560\nPlayed video games.\n\n01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.560\nOh. I know. It was from Magic the Gathering.\n\n01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:49.440\nInterpreting. I used to, sometimes in the high school, I used to like give like orrations\n\n01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.320\nlike where you just start talking and my friends. Unsolicited orrations? Yeah. Well, kind of,\n\n01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.320\nyou know, just start talking about stuff. Out in the common area? Yeah. Like not like\n\n01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.320\nin plain view. So people would come and watch, but I just, you know, just alone in the bathroom.\n\n01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.320\nWere you ever in a doorway? No. Well, yeah. Like when people come up to you and go like,\n\n01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.320\nhey Spencer, talk about, talk about that late boat. Yeah. Stuff like that. And I just go\n\n01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.320\noff on ramps. That was a good thing with me too. It was like, do that freezer talk. Yeah.\n\n01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.320\nExactly. Like it was just kind of like, talk smart about that bulletin board. That's what\n\n01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.320\nit was. Just that. I used to dance for money. Wait. All right. Let's play D&D. No, no, no.\n\n01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:36.320\nWhen we last met, no. For really? Yeah. Can we see a little dancer? Oh, why? Okay.\n\n01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:43.320\nNo, no. Could you, could you give me a little cigar with your butt? Come on, Spencer. Let's\n\n01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:53.320\nsee it. This is, this is an inside D&D reference. Yeah. Fuck everybody who's expecting you to\n\n01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.320\ndance. What do you mean you would dance for money? Like people, they would go like at\n\n01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.320\ndances? No, I'd write down on paper like, I will dance for money. And then I'd just be\n\n01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.320\ntalking with my friends and holding it and someone would be like, you dance for money?\n\n01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.320\nAnd I'd be like, yeah, sure. And then they'd give me a quarter and I'd just be like, and\n\n01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.320\nthen I'd stop. And then sometimes they'd be like, well, that wasn't enough. And you know,\n\n01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.320\nI'd be like, whatever. And then we, did you ever, did you ever suffer any in high school?\n\n01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.320\nDid you, did you feel like you were like a bottom rung or? I mean, I got made fun of\n\n01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.320\nsome, but um, for being the guy who danced for money. Yeah. I mean, well, just everyone\n\n01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:35.320\nhas antagonists and not like, I wasn't like a lower, lower, lower beast, I don't think.\n\n01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.320\nI think a lot of people like me. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're pretty self-aware. You were\n\n01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:44.320\nlike a, like a known guy around the school. Yeah. Well, it's like now, you know, everyone's\n\n01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.320\nlike, oh, Spencer, that guy, just look at him. No one talks to me or anything, but you\n\n01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:55.320\nknow, they know who I am. All right. That's it. That's the next t-shirt. Are you becoming\n\n01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.320\na little more extroverted now that you've moved to Hollywood and you're, you know, like,\n\n01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.320\nwell, we were just talking after the Harmon quest thing, um, I was, there was that party\n\n01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.320\nand I was going to go and then I was like, uh, no, like we were actually driving there\n\n01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.320\nand we were getting off the free one. I was like, fuck this. And then I just drove home.\n\n01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:18.320\nYeah. So no, no. So you don't like big social situations. I mean, party specific parties\n\n01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.320\nare weird because like, unless you have interesting, cool stuff to say all the time, people just\n\n01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:29.320\nwalk away and, um, at a certain part, at a certain part of the night, like people cluster\n\n01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.320\nup in these little groups, like, you know, there's actually like a whole ethnology to\n\n01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:42.320\nlike parties. Like you could study them. They're really interesting from the outside. Um, but\n\n01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.320\nuh, yeah, there's those little clustery groups that happen and I have no fucking idea because\n\n01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.320\nthat's when most people are drunk and people are being like intimate and people are like,\n\n01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:57.320\noh, I just don't know. Like it's just growing on my hip. Like I just, people are, you know,\n\n01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.320\ntalking about their problems and I'm not in one of those clusters. So I just like wander\n\n01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:07.320\naround and I leave. And then it's like, they're talking about something too serious. Yeah.\n\n01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.320\nAnd then it's just weird. Yeah. You don't want to walk in. You feel, yeah, you're fucking\n\n01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.320\nit up. You're not a, you're not a big drinker, right? So it's got to be. Yeah. That's the\n\n01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.320\nthing. Most people got to seem like assholes when you walk up to that big group and they're\n\n01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.320\nlike, oh, but rice, crispy snuck. Well, I feel like the asshole. No, but yeah, there's\n\n01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.320\nlike the mystical. There's a point during the Harmonton tour, like a really sincere moment\n\n01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:32.320\nbetween Spencer and I, who I, I, I like you so much. Thanks. Like Spencer, Spencer really\n\n01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.320\nis like legitimately the coolest person ever. He's so fun to talk to and so nice and so.\n\n01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:49.320\nYou haven't cleaned your pool. So handsome and so strong. There's, there's a pointer\n\n01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:56.320\nthat Harmonton tour, like after like a few informal bonding sessions that Spencer and\n\n01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.320\nI had where he asked me legitimately, like, we're, is this friendship just because you\n\n01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:07.320\nwere drunk when we were talking or is it, is it a real friendship? Like, is this just\n\n01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.320\nyou being drunk and being nice to me? Well, drunk people talk. Well, that's it. Drunk\n\n01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.320\npeople talk. They, you can't stop them. Well, yeah, if we were all sober all the time,\n\n01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.320\nthen we'd never talk. No one would just be talking about the ethnology of parties.\n\n01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:28.320\nSomebody's got to do the heroic move of getting sloppy and like talking about Rice\n\n01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.320\nKrispies in a big glob. The other night when I was drunk told that Nicole Brown that I\n\n01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.320\nwould really like to see her in a black rom-com and it would not stop talking about it. I\n\n01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:44.320\nhave to send her an email. I really over and over again. I was like, play. I love black\n\n01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:51.320\nrom. It's creepy for me. Well, it's good. You know, it's like fire. It can, it has its\n\n01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.320\nuses. It can burn. All right, Spencer, shall we get this underway? Why, why not? Are we\n\n01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:03.320\nready? I think everyone's fine. When we last met, our heroes were on the road to\n\n01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:11.320\nFornheim, the frozen city, but the road was less of a road and more of a bridge. An ice\n\n01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.320\nbridge to be more specific. To be even more specific, it was an ice bridge guarded by\n\n01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.320\nskeleton warriors wielding icy blades. After a vicious and deadly combat, Quark wrestled\n\n01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.320\none off the cliff while Sharpie and Mulraine teamed up and destroyed the other two. And\n\n01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:34.320\nafter defeating their foes, a voice called out from within, welcome to Fornheim, the\n\n01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:40.320\nfrozen city. What they found inside was not dwarves like Sharpie had expected, but rather\n\n01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.320\nfrost giants, great blue-skinned humanoids living and talking, laughing and working in\n\n01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:52.320\ntheir giant city. After chatting with the most kind face of the giants, the gang was\n\n01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.320\ntold to follow a group of skeletons directly towards the Jarl, who was the leader of\n\n01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:04.320\nFornheim. And so our heroes went after the skeletons and met with the Jarl. The Jarl\n\n01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:11.320\nwas most kind and was willing to help the party, but for a price. All of their fragments\n\n01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.320\nof power. But with so much writing on the line and their fight against Admiral Darkstar,\n\n01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:23.320\nwould they really be willing to pay such a price? In defeat, Admiral Darkstar, in his\n\n01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.320\nblack keep, will find out.\n\n01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320\nNext.\n\n01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.320\nYeah, we're having a sidebar here, the Jarl can't hear us.\n\n01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:46.320\nOkay. I mean, the shards of power, it's like the ring of power in the Middle Earth.\n\n01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.320\nYeah, the wrong hands, that's bad.\n\n01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:55.320\nIt doesn't do anybody any good for anybody to have all of them. Yeah, I'm assuming. This\n\n01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320\nguy's pretty powerful to begin with.\n\n01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.320\nMaybe I should just talk to him.\n\n01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.320\nGo ahead.\n\n01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:09.320\nAlright, let me do this, I kind of straighten her hair and I unbutton a button on her tunic.\n\n01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:16.320\nI don't know what my reaction to that would be. Stop touching my hair.\n\n01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.320\nThe Jarl is just looking at you, what is happening?\n\n01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.320\nI mean, we were lovers at a point at a time.\n\n01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320\nMaybe.\n\n01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320\nYou don't remember?\n\n01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320\nWe fucked under her horse.\n\n01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320\nOh yeah, we fucked under your horse, yeah.\n\n01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.320\nThat is the last voice that I wanted to say that.\n\n01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.320\nYou fucked under her horse.\n\n01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320\nWere you drawing that?\n\n01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.320\nI have three D&D games going in my life.\n\n01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.320\nSorry, go ahead.\n\n01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320\nWell, go talk to the giant.\n\n01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.320\nWhat's the strategy?\n\n01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320\nWhat are you going to say?\n\n01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320\nAlright, I'll talk to him.\n\n01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320\nJarl!\n\n01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.320\nOh, okay, cool.\n\n01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320\nHey.\n\n01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:05.320\nJarl, we have the same interest you do, keeping the Earth from the clutches of Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.320\nI'm there too.\n\n01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.320\nAre we supposed to do it together?\n\n01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.320\nAlright, I'll jump in too.\n\n01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:26.320\nHowever, we can't leave all the shards of power in the hands of...\n\n01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:34.320\nI'm off to the side doing the Wayne Brady improv game of doing sign language.\n\n01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.320\nThese shards of power are...\n\n01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.320\nThings we might actually need to defeat Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:48.320\nNot only that, but you know only that.\n\n01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.320\nI mean, I guess what I'm saying is...\n\n01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.320\nI guess what I'm saying is...\n\n01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:59.320\nIt's this, it's this, it's this, it's this.\n\n01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.320\nIf you're a requirement, I walk over to Wayne Brady.\n\n01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:12.320\nIf you're a requirement to help us, is your own self-interest, then it's not called helping.\n\n01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.320\nIt's called buying.\n\n01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:22.320\nWe're here rounding up volunteers, people who are willing to sacrifice for the goodness of the Earth.\n\n01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.320\nNot people who are looking to make out, like bandits.\n\n01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:31.320\nThat's Admiral Darkstar. He's the one who wants to take.\n\n01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.320\nWe want to give, but not to you.\n\n01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.320\nGood is for sale.\n\n01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.320\nThe right thing is for...\n\n01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.320\nI think we should tell him about sale.\n\n01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.320\nSale.\n\n01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:54.320\nHe finds it really hard to understand what the hell you guys are trying to say.\n\n01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.320\nZero shards of power. Zero shards of power for giants.\n\n01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:04.320\nOkay? Here's our offer. Help us or perish.\n\n01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.320\nOh, no.\n\n01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.320\nNo, no.\n\n01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.320\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Disregard that sidebar.\n\n01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.320\nPerish? Are we threatening them?\n\n01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:20.320\nYou don't come in with a cosmetic figure with these guys, you know?\n\n01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:26.320\nWhile this was happening, while I was chiming in, I was transcribing everything he was saying.\n\n01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.320\nI write it on my water skin and I offer it up to him.\n\n01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:35.320\nI do a little wink.\n\n01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.320\nYou're waiting for you to do it.\n\n01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.320\nNot by our hands. We know that your might is the most mighty.\n\n01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.320\nWe know you could step on us like insects.\n\n01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.320\nYeah, I was also going to point that out.\n\n01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:52.320\nBut I'm going to tell you something that I heard in the 60s in Brooklyn.\n\n01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.320\nI thought that I could step on people because they were like insects.\n\n01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.320\nAnd then someone came and stepped on me because they were like giant insects.\n\n01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.320\nAnd then I realized that I was the insect.\n\n01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.320\nA giant man.\n\n01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320\nYeah, that's the situation you find yourself in.\n\n01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320\nSure.\n\n01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.320\nAnd it's the situation you'll find yourself in. Can I finish?\n\n01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.320\nNo, but I would just like to interject quickly.\n\n01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.320\nSo I guess the answer is no.\n\n01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.320\nI mean, what an amazing thing to be so much bigger than so many other creatures.\n\n01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:26.320\nYeah, it gives me a position of power over you guys.\n\n01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.320\nYeah, and I mean, wow.\n\n01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:36.320\nYou are in this position where you have all this responsibility to be so good to all these other creatures.\n\n01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320\nAnd that must be a difficult thing.\n\n01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.320\nAnd I have to say, I admire you for being so diplomatic.\n\n01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.320\nNo, fuck you, motherfucker.\n\n01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320\nYou're bigger than people, big deal.\n\n01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.320\nYou know who's bigger than everyone?\n\n01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320\nAdmiral Darkstar.\n\n01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.320\nYou know what kind of world we're going to live in if big people decide they can do whatever they want because they're bigger?\n\n01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320\nA shitty world.\n\n01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.320\nAnd believe me, there's a lot of bigger people than you out there.\n\n01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.320\nAnd this tiny little fucker is telling you.\n\n01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:03.320\nIt's time for people to start doing things based on what they want and what's right.\n\n01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.320\nInstead of what's based on their size, I'm a little drunk.\n\n01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.320\nI'm so, I'm so...\n\n01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:16.320\nAnd if you start your happy life by stepping on me, I guarantee you it won't be happy for long.\n\n01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320\nI promise you.\n\n01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320\nWe are here based on what's right.\n\n01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.320\nSo fuck you, you giant fuck.\n\n01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.320\nFuck you.\n\n01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320\nThat's what you get from me.\n\n01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.320\nA plea for help and a dick in your teeth.\n\n01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.320\nA dick in your teeth?\n\n01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.320\nMy final offer.\n\n01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.320\nWe'll happily walk out of here.\n\n01:23:35.320 -->

01:24:01.320\nThank you, thank you.\n\n01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:02.320\nI thought he was gonna go for it.\n\n01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.320\nI grab Sharpie's face and I pass it on.\n\n01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.320\nAre you still alive?\n\n01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.320\nI mean, if I was at full when I came in.\n\n01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.320\nI mean, you took some damage from those skeletons.\n\n01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.320\nHey guys, Sharpie died.\n\n01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320\nIs Sharpie, is Sharpie dead?\n\n01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.320\nSharpie's fucking

on your friend and it lifts up\n\n01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.320\nand it's like a crater and he's in it and he's crumpled\n\n01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320\nand he's dying.\n\n01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.320\nBut I still have shit to say.\n\n01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:55.320\nI jump in the crater and I don't think I have any healing powder.\n\n01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320\nWhy are you jumping in there then?\n\n01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.320\nBecause I love him.\n\n01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.320\nI run to Sharpie and I say, alright, here's the deal.\n\n01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:10.320\nSorry about the dick in your teeth come and my friend just made.\n\n01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320\nYou don't run to Sharpie, you run to the...\n\n01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.320\nI go to the Jarl and I say, look, we'll give you one shard\n\n01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.320\nand on completion of the mission we'll give you whatever you want.\n\n01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320\nNo, no, no, no, let's

01:25:29.320\nListen, that amazing speech he gave, that can't be for nothing.\n\n01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.320\nHe can't give the speech and then die and then we do what they want.\n\n01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.320\nRight?\n\n01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320\nYou don't want, sir.\n\n01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.320\nYou take...\n\n01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.320\nYou listen to me\n\n01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:49.320\nand you take this dick in your teeth.\n\n01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.320\nSir, respectfully, sir, fuck you.\n\n01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.320\nI give a broken thumbs up for my crater.\n\n01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.320\nSidebar, sidebar.\n\n01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.320\nWith dick in your teeth, does that mean that someone's smiling\n\n01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.320\nand then someone puts their dick on the teeth?\n\n01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.320\nLike, what is...\n\n01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.320\nHe's dying like a bat.\n\n01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:15.320\nI jump down into the crater and I start a blowing breath into Sharpie\n\n01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.320\nand reciting an old...\n\n01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320\nWhat is my class?\n\n01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.320\nRanger.\n\n01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.320\nOld Ranger poetry.\n\n01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.320\nYeah, okay, so that kind of works.\n\n01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.320\nYou...\n\n01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.320\nHe's not bleeding so much anymore.\n\n01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.320\nThat's not what?\n\n01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.320\nHe's not bleeding.\n\n01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320\nI mean, like, externally, at least.\n\n01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.320\nDid the y'all have any response to my...\n\n01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.320\nOh, yeah, no, I mean...\n\n01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320\nThat was also...\n\n01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320\nYeah, no.\n\n01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320\nHe's turned, cool.\n\n01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.320\nWhat?\n\n01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.320\nHe steps on you also.\n\n01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.320\nLet's give him the shards, you guys.\n\n01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.320\nHe hates the dick in the teeth thing.\n\n01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.320\nStop saying that.\n\n01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.320\nYou take 16 damage.\n\n01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320\nGod damn it!\n\n01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:05.320\nDo the thing we did but without the dick in the teeth part.\n\n01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320\nI say, look, you heard what my friends say.\n\n01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.320\nPlease don't step on me.\n\n01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.320\nWe'll give you one shard and we'll give you another one\n\n01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320\non completion of the thing.\n\n01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.320\nStop stepping on us.\n\n01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.320\nNo.\n\n01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:20.320\nI yell up, also, the three of us have written a show.\n\n01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.320\nWe're going to have to use our understudies\n\n01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:28.320\nbecause we're dying.\n\n01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320\nWhat does he say to me?\n\n01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.320\nMy offer of one shard down payment.\n\n01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320\nOh, I thought you guys were arguing about it.\n\n01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.320\nI know, I say this to him.\n\n01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.320\nYeah, I mean, I want all the shards and he's dying\n\n01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320\nand he has them so I could probably just take him\n\n01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320\noff of his dying body.\n\n01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.320\nI take it aside with Christopher and you.\n\n01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.320\nQuark.\n\n01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.320\nQuark.\n\n01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320\nA little drunk.\n\n01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320\nI try to take him off my dying body\n\n01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.320\nand I'm in a fucking punchy giant dick.\n\n01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.320\nNo, that's it.\n\n01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320\nBro, stay down, Rock.\n\n01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.320\nChill.\n\n01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.320\nI don't give a shit, bro.\n\n01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.320\nNo, no, he doesn't know what he's saying.\n\n01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320\nHe'll murder you to death.\n\n01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:09.320\nGentlemen, it sounds like this giant is, pride is his...\n\n01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.320\nYou know, all I hear coming into the city is might.\n\n01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320\nMight this is the home of the mighty.\n\n01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.320\nMust be nice to be so big you can step on a person.\n\n01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320\nThat doesn't seem very mighty to me.\n\n01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.320\nMighty is getting stepped on, bitch.\n\n01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320\nDon't, okay.\n\n01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320\nThat takes strength.\n\n01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:32.320\nI take my beautiful foot and I muffle Sharpie.\n\n01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.320\nOh, good.\n\n01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.320\nSo it's fascism now.\n\n01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.320\nSo your giant philosophy is trickled down\n\n01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320\nto my normal sized friends.\n\n01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:45.320\nYeah, I said normal sized.\n\n01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.320\nGentlemen, I believe that we can defeat this giant\n\n01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.320\nby taking advantage of his ego.\n\n01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.320\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.320\nHow are we going to do it?\n\n01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.320\nHe's dying.\n\n01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320\nHe'll be fine.\n\n01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:09.320\nWhat if we suggest to the giant that we have written a show\n\n01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:15.320\nin tribute to him, and during the show...\n\n01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.320\nThis is what I have to listen to as I die.\n\n01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.320\nWhile my friends capitulate.\n\n01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.320\nWhile she's pitching this, I go to everybody,\n\n01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320\nand I steal, I take their shards,\n\n01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.320\nand I go up to him and I hand the guy.\n\n01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.320\nLook, here's what you want.\n\n01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320\nYou want the shard so bad?\n\n01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.320\nGive us an army.\n\n01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.320\nAlso, before we do that, let's do that and we'll get the army.\n\n01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.320\nCan we also get some medical help?\n\n01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.320\nCan that be part of the deal?\n\n01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.320\nI spit on your medical help.\n\n01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.320\nNo, he doesn't know what he's saying.\n\n01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.320\nI see one giant bandaid come near me.\n\n01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.320\nI'm going to piss on it.\n\n01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.320\nWe suggest to him that we are presenting a show\n\n01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.320\nthat is in his tribute.\n\n01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.320\nPerhaps one of us can come up behind him\n\n01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.320\nand kill him via neck or another place that kills a person.\n\n01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.320\nThere's so many giants here.\n\n01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.320\nThe one that we're talking to.\n\n01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320\nNo, but they're all going to come and kill us.\n\n01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.320\nIt's a city of frost giants.\n\n01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.320\nWe're going to have to fight every giant.\n\n01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.320\nWe killed them.\n\n01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.320\nPart of our show will have an audience involvement element,\n\n01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.320\nlike a comedy sports show,\n\n01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:16.320\nand it will say everybody circle the hole,\n\n01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.320\nand then...\n\n01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.320\nI give him the shards.\n\n01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.320\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.320\nSo, as you approach,\n\n01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.320\nhe kind of grabs them between his pinky and thumb\n\n01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.320\nand with his index finger, he flicks you,\n\n01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.320\nand he just kind of tumbled backwards.\n\n01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.320\nWhat?\n\n01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320\nAnd, yeah, we'll...\n\n01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.320\nSpencer, how many of these giants are there?\n\n01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320\nThere's just the one in the chamber.\n\n01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320\nYeah, but there's so many of them.\n\n01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.320\nThere's just the one.\n\n01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320\nThere's just the one.\n\n01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320\nWe don't kill the giant.\n\n01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.320\nHey, Jerry, please just do a show.\n\n01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320\nWith who?\n\n01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.320\nWe got two dead people almost.\n\n01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.320\nNo, but the three of them.\n\n01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.320\nHe'll be fine.\n\n01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320\nHe'll be fine.\n\n01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320\nYeah, I guess.\n\n01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320\nYeah, you're not dying.\n\n01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.320\nYou still have HP.\n\n01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.320\nOkay.\n\n01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.320\nWell, I'm still...\n\n01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320\nI've had a really shitty day.\n\n01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.320\nI don't feel like having a fucking show\n\n01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.320\nfor the guy who has killed our friend.\n\n01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.320\nAre you dead?\n\n01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320\nI'm not dead.\n\n01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.320\nI'm not alive enough to spit a tooth at him.\n\n01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.320\nThat's what I do with my round.\n\n01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:16.320\nI'm gonna die proud, fuckface.\n\n01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.320\nWhat if we did a show about how...\n\n01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.320\nWe're not doing a fucking show!\n\n01:31:20.320 -->

01:33:16.320\nYeah, there's no reason for the show.\n\n01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.320\nNobody wants to be in the show.\n\n01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:21.320\nSharpie's got to be in a foot-sized crater right now.\n\n01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.320\nYeah.\n\n01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.320\nIt's a city boy.\n\n01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.320\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.320\nCan

walk up and slither through.\n\n01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.320\nThey're lovers.\n\n01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.320\nI'm right behind you.\n\n01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.320\nAre you leaving?\n\n01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.320\nIs that what you said?\n\n01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.320\nNo, he slits her throat.\n\n01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.320\nOh, God.\n\n01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.320\nRoll it, Spencer.\n\n01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.320\nRoll it is...\n\n01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320\nNo, no.\n\n01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.320\nWhen you were doing your show, I rolled...\n\n01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.320\nYeah, you fell on your face.\n\n01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.320\nBecause you put ice on the floor and made it slippery and then you're doing your routine and you fall.\n\n01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.320\nAfter the fall, can I make a noise like...\n\n01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320\nDa-da!\n\n01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320\nYeah.\n\n01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.320\nDo more of the show.\n\n01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.320\nIt sounds like you don't like somebody's show.\n\n01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.320\nNo, I love it.\n\n01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.320\nI'm laughing so hard.\n\n01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.320\nHe just said he wanted to slit your throat.\n\n01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:45.320\nThat was part of the show!\n\n01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.320\nWhat is it like being bigger than me?\n\n01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:56.320\nA book to you is a mesh book to me.\n\n01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.320\nOh, God.\n\n01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.320\nJesus.\n\n01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.320\nIt's the other way around.\n\n01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320\nIt's the other way around.\n\n01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.320\nA book to you is like a match book to him.\n\n01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.320\nThat's... yeah.\n\n01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.320\nWe're still working on it.\n\n01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:12.320\nThis is like a dress rehearsal.\n\n01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.320\nYou are so great.\n\n01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.320\nPlease let us go.\n\n01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.320\nPlease let us leave from the place of...\n\n01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.320\nShe doesn't care, Camille.\n\n01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.320\nShe doesn't care.\n\n01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.320\nShe's not paying attention to what's happening.\n\n01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.320\nShe's doing a fucking show.\n\n01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.320\nPlease give me more supply so I can make more progress.\n\n01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.320\nI'm going to attack you if you don't stop doing this.\n\n01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.320\nI'm going to take my sword out and kill you.\n\n01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:40.320\nI take my sword out and I hold it up over.\n\n01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.320\nI'm going to kill you if you don't stop doing this.\n\n01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320\nJarl, can we get the fucking army?\n\n01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.320\nAnd that's the show!\n\n01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.320\nYeah, he doesn't applaud.\n\n01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.320\nYou don't say.\n\n01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.320\nYeah, no.\n\n01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.320\nHe politely waits for the salt to end.\n\n01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.320\nAnd over.\n\n01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.320\nI'm going to fucking kill you.\n\n01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:07.320\nI'm going to kill you.\n\n01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.320\nHe kind of holds up a finger.\n\n01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.320\nAnd a cloud kind of floats in the room.\n\n01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.320\nAnd he reaches into the cloud and pulls out a handful of Onyx gems.\n\n01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.320\nAnd he crushes them in his palm.\n\n01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.320\nAnd you see kind of like magical mist float up.\n\n01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.320\nAnd then he drops it on the floor and it falls on the floor.\n\n01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.320\nAnd it kind of forms into the shape of these skeleton things.\n\n01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.320\nAnd the room has like 40 skeletons in it.\n\n01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.320\nAnd he's like, yeah, here's your army.\n\n01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.320\n40 skeletons!\n\n01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.320\nWhat are your names?\n\n01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.320\nAll we get is 40 skeletons.\n\n01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.320\nShut up!\n\n01:36:43.320 -->

mood?\n\n01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.320\nYou're right there.\n\n01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.320\nLet's do an ice-breaking game.\n\n01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:13.320\nWe should have negotiated for how many skeletons we would get.\n\n01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.320\nSeriously, it's all we get is 40 skeletons?\n\n01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320\nWhat is the expression on their faces?\n\n01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.320\nAre they nice?\n\n01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.320\nIt's like a skull.\n\n01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.320\nCan we have?\n\n01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.320\nNo, but they still have expressions on their faces.\n\n01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.320\nTissue and muscle makes an expression.\n\n01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.320\nYou have to have eyebrows and lips and shit.\n\n01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.320\nNo, that's all tissues.\n\n01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.320\nWhy are we talking about the expressions on their faces?\n\n01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.320\nWhy did she do a show? It's fucking stupid.\n\n01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320\nOkay, let's regroup.\n\n01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320\nSharpie, how are you doing?

these Onyx gems between his finger, and he's like,\n\n01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:36.320\nAcromantica Deus Ex Machinima.\n\n01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.320\nAnd you just, you spring up fresh as a
