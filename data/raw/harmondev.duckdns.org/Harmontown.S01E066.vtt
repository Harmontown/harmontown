Hello, what and all, welcome to Meltdown Comics and the world-famous Dirtmelt Theater, Harmontown,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
is once again in session.

00:23.000 --> 00:33.000
Oh, yeah. Once you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, I'm Harmontown! Yo!

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you, Jeff Davis, our Comptroller. Let's have a hand for his Comptroller.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
What a fantastic person. And what a good group of people you are.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
And what a great country this is. God looking down on it, smiling and hoping it keeps moving forward.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
I don't have anything to talk about tonight. I thought maybe I could stretch that into something.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
Jingoism would be like taffy. I could stretch it to a finish line, but I don't have that much.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
You got anything, Jeff? You got any burrs in your boots?

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
I almost didn't make the show. I took a nap on my couch because we had brunch today that went straight to the drawing room.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
We just drank all day long, and I took a nap and just woke up and it was like 7.15, and I was like, geez, Louise.

01:29.000 --> 01:40.000
I had to take a little nap today too, because we did brunch. This is my life. We did brunch and then I...

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
We really did it too.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
And then during brunch, you know, it's like, let's go get a drink.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
God, I'm so dehydrated right now. My eyes are red, I'm puffy.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
But I got a dog now, which I think is probably saving my life, because I got to go home every couple hours just to make sure the dog kind of...

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
But sometimes the dog is laying there and it's crate, and then I'll come home and go like, come on, I need to run you around the yard,

02:08.000 --> 02:17.000
and the dog will be like, what's happening? And I'll wake it up specifically and then trot it around the yard, and it'll just start getting energized,

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
and then I'll put it back in the crate.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
There was a moment today.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
It feels bad.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Because we went and had brunch, and Dan had pancakes, and even shouted out the word pancakes after having eaten them.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah, because it was like a Schrab.el, like, medic pancakes!

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
And then we had a bunch of beers and funnets at Little Dom's, and then we went down to the drawing room, and I overheard Dan saying,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
like, I could get an Uber car, which is like, you know, like a kind of a car service.

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
And he was talking about getting an Uber car from the drawing room to his house, which is seven blocks, seven blocks, just so you could go walk your dog.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
And such is our level of trust and friendship that I let you drive my car drunk. I gave you my car.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
When you say drive my car drunk, it puts a really fine point on it.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
I start picturing that in the TMZs and the Aussiellos and the whatever.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Okay, we'll edit that out then.

03:12.000 --> 03:25.000
I drove Jeff's car drunk. I drove it up a tree, and there was a gypsy in it, and I ran her over, and I take that NBC.

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
But I napped during Prometheus. I pressed play on Prometheus, which I had already seen in the theater, and I just fell asleep listening to it,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
and I just had these, like, shitty prequel dreams.

03:39.000 --> 03:50.000
Like, just dreams about people walking around going, one day there's going to be a dream here.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
But I got nothing. Let's do a little experiment, because I got nothing. Let's follow the I Got Nothing thread.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
And let's bring up our friends. Let's bring up Kumail Nanjiani.

04:04.000 --> 04:22.000
It's a nice summer evening. It is a nice summer evening. And I got nothing.

04:22.000 --> 04:31.000
Maybe sit on the porch with me, won't you, Kumail? And have a nice tall glass of Country Time Livin'.

04:31.000 --> 04:41.000
Just rack back and forth in your chair, and look out in the starlit field, and worry about minorities moving in.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm sorry, you don't know this. That's what you do on a porch. You're not familiar with this tradition.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
They're racist? The porches are racist?

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
You can't have a porch and not be racist.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
I feel like I felt that vibe when I walk onto a porch. I just kind of want to be like, you know...

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
That's what porches are for. They're racial outposts.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah. I'm like, ah, some of these people could work harder.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
Just sort of sit out there and watch the people walk by and give them a subtle look.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Don't buy a place around here.

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
I can see you with one of those kind of plantation, big colonial columns out front, like a seersucker suit and a straw hat,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
drinking some lemonade and just being racist.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
Thanks, Jeff. Why is it so much fun to be racist?

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
It simplifies life. The same reason it's fun to be into astrology. There's 12 kinds of people.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, yeah. I think there's 13 now. Didn't they find a new planet or something?

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah. And then they found out that everything we knew was wrong. So, tourists are actually leos.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And then we kind of read them. We were like, ah, let's ignore this. This is weird.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah. All these people are like, you told me if I was a Capricorn, I should expect to find romance in the workplace.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah. That wasn't right. I married a guy in the copy room.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
Not a guy from the copy room. I married him in the copy room. I printed out the invitations in that room.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
But there is liberation too. I mean, primates have these dopamine things in their head. We look for patterns.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
It's way simpler. That's why I would...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Okay, this is going to get weird.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
But I think at one point I was very, very religious. And it was actually kind of easier.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Just to be like, oh, something... Order. Order.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah. All of this makes sense rather than, oh, this person got hit by a car for no reason.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
Even before monotheism, even before we started to really order things, the people that we call pagans,

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
the people that we call prehistoric, they still had order. Otherwise, we wouldn't even know they existed.

07:01.000 --> 07:13.000
Because unlike the chimps and whatever that came before them, they were asked by God to think about shit

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
with their little tiny monkey brains. And they're like, this is a lot of shit to figure out.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
The fact that this guy is dead and that guy is alive.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
First of all, the sun makes... I'm supposed to eat this deer, but also the deer was alive.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah. Plus the fucking sun makes no sense at all.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
No, it picks and chooses when to come up and go down.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah. And when it's not, it gets cold, but sometimes it's hot.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
And then just when you think you got it figured out, you get hit by a lightning.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah. I feel like almost nothing makes sense. And then you're like, oh no, it does make sense.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
And then someone goes, no, no. Black people.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Right? That's something we can all get behind.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
They're bad people. And then as a caveman, you go like, ah, got it. I know one thing.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I figured it out. I mean, it's anything, anything.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, see that log over there? When you knock on it three times, it gives you a wish.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Like, try it. I wish for a sandwich. Okay, there's no sandwich. You know why?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Because you didn't knock hard enough. You didn't have faith.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
We occupy our brains with these systems. That's a, you know, you go to Las Vegas

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
and you see these fields of what? Awesome crap tables? No.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Because craps are actually, they're closer to chaos than order.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Craps are the best bet in the house. If you know how to play craps, that's actually the, you know,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
the best way to actually make money if you walk into Vegas with money.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Not that there's any good way to make money, the house always wins.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
But the worst way is slot machines. There's a fixed percentage you're going to lose,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
but it's the most appealing because you go up and you pull the lever

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
and the Adams family guy says like, ooh, you win a jackpot.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
Triple diamond. And then you go, ah, triple diamond.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And the thing spits out and your girlfriend comes up and she goes,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
hey, we're going to the hard rock with the thing. I almost got this figured out though.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
I, you know, I push the two buttons and then the triple diamond comes up

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
and I've lost so many times in a row. I know that I'm going to win now.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Did I tell you?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And that is like racism.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
It is though. It is. It's a human, human, human slot machine.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Did I mention this on the show before? I have a friend that used to work as a slots person.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Like in Vegas she ran like the VIP slots and like she would take care of like high roller guests and stuff.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
And we were going through the MGM and she saw a woman sitting at one of the more popular slot machines.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
The MGM Lions. It's been there forever. It's like it makes all the money there.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
It's one machine?

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
It's a bank of machines. It's a row of this certain like brand of slot machine.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And there's a woman sitting at one of them and it was a progressive one.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Like it was like a little tally of like money that comes up.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
And she looked at the numbers and she goes, oh, God, I want to go tell that woman to move one to the left.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
She goes, that one's going to pay off soon.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I'm like, wait, what?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
She knows which one.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Because it's numbers and probability and stuff?

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
She's like, she's sitting at one that's not going to pay off today.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
The one next to her will.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
That's crazy that just with numbers and probability you can predict it.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh, and also they can tune them up.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh, they're cheating.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Okay.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
And they don't give the old lady any money today.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
Also they put ones that pay off a little bit more often in walkways because they want those bells to ring more because it attracts more people in.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
That's so smart.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, it's really...

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
You get sucked in like the intestines of an animal.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
And also in Las Vegas there's a thing where they don't allow you, if you walk through a casino, if you walk through the floor of any casino in Las Vegas,

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
you are not allowed to take more than a certain amount of steps in a row without running into a place to put money in something.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
You cannot walk in a straight line for more than like 10 paces anywhere.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
You have to...

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, you have to like walk around and maybe...

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
You constantly have to go, you have to be stopped by a thing that you could put money in.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Sex in the city.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Adams family.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Transformers.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
What is that?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I want to know how they base that shit.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
People love the Transformers slot machine.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
They're going for everything.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
Like sometimes you see like a 75 year old guy just cranking that Transformers machine.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Transform and rule out.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Bing, bing, bing.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Just look at the guy like, you're not into Transformers.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
He doesn't know about Megatron and Galvatron.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
But then again, knowing that's not going to win you anywhere money.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
No.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
It's just kind of funny.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I've never been to Vegas.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Is it awesome?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
What?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I've never been.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh.

11:31.000 --> 11:41.000
This episode, we're going to Vegas.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
We're floating through space on a green screen effect.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Oh, here come those neon signs.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Vegas.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Time to land.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Is this a Vegas?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
We're landing on the strip.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Look around you.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
There's Circus Circus.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
There's Crème Brûlée.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
You guys ever fly to Las Vegas from like Burbank on a Friday morning?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Very sad.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
What's known as the stripper express because it's you and 40 strippers.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
They're all fresh faced and they got their juicy suits on and they're looking good and

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
ready to go.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
And then you fly back on a Sunday afternoon and it's just like the Cherokee trail of tears,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
man.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And it's just a bunch of people.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
But they should be happy.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
They're like, oh no, no.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
They've been through hell.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
But they just worked.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
They're rich.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
They're the richest creatures.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
But man, they're just faded.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Faded.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
That's hard work.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
It's hard work.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
You have to give up parts of yourself.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
No, no.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't doubt that at all.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I was just confused.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Like I thought he meant like they didn't hit the mother load or something.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I'd never been to.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
I went to a strip club for the first time earlier this year.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And yeah, I was with Emily.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
And I'd never been.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
We were in Portland.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
You went with your wife?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
It was a bunch of us.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
It was a music festival.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I wanted the names of the people I was with because so we went in and I sat down and they

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
had food.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
They had a full.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Oh, yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
The fucking, the strip club buffet is one of the oddest fucking.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's all over the place.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
It's Chinese, but also there's like Italian stuff.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Can I get some more pubes in my coles laplies?

13:14.000 --> 13:22.000
I think it's weird to put that much mayonnaise near that much mayonnaise.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Genitalia.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I just, yeah, I do.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Because I was working, having worked in food service where there are no women like with

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
their crotches above the food.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
You're still warned a lot about how, you know, how, you know, the air around us is filled

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
with all kinds of beasties just looking for a, for a perch.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Looking for purchase.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
And, and, and there's a, there's a zone, you know, you got to keep icing that, that colesla.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
You got to ice that, that, that sauce.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
They don't give a, they're not giving a shit about icing that colesla.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
Don't let these microbial organisms ever think for a second they have a shot at having children.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Is this black people again?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Maybe.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
But, but, but, but then to go in a strip club and like it's all dark and there's like a lady

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
dancing and three feet from her crotch.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
There's just crab legs and colesla.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
That's weird to me.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
And imagine me how, how hardcore do you have to be into her crotch to not grab something

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
on the way in?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You know, like, like, like I got at McDonald's or something.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
To be like, well you only have to, you have to, I want to eat and I want to look at naked women.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I'll just eat at the strip club.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I have time for one stop.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, oh, I'll fill up there.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
It's not bad.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
That's going to be a sad day when you're like, hey, the strip club food is not bad.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
But we were there and I didn't know how it worked.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
So they were like, my friend was like, all right, every time they do a song, you have

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
to go and give money.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
So their eyes were not smiling.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
They did not want to be there, these strippers.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
And yeah, it was very sad.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Go figure.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
The saddest, the saddest thing is they're on the pole and when the shift changes, the

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
other woman has to come and like, she has to, she has to sanitize the pole, but they're

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
still trying to make like a thing of it, like while she's cleaning.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
That's the car wash.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
She's like sprinting and kind of doing a little thing.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Put your hands together for wipe down.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Here she comes.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Get your dollars ready.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Wipe down's coming out.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
If you've not been to Jembo's Clown Room, I recommend that you go.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Everybody, Jembo's?

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Jembo's Clown Room is kind of the last stop.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Like Courtney Love used to dance there.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
They call it the gateway to rock bottom.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, exactly.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And it's like, it's, it's, it's druggy in there.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Like it's pretty, like there's a lot of heroin addicts on that stage.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And what are the girls like?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
It ranges.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
It used to be, they put it, they kind of put a paint job on Jembo's.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
It's a little tiny place.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
It's very small.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
You could buy a drink and tip the stage at the same time.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It's really like it's very little in there.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
And don't touch anything at the Jembo's Clown Room.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
It's unclean.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
And there was a girl that used to dance there, this Latina lady who was a dude.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah, an ex, an ex gentleman.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Okay, okay.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Up there dancing around under, you know, a new, a new identity.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Dancing around under a new identity.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
I think that's the name of her autobiography.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
She had a bull whip and she'd come out and she would frequently hurt somebody in the crowd.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Like she's like, it's not big enough to swing a bull whip in there.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
And she was constantly just like, like maiming somebody in the front row.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
And she would do a thing and some frat boys would roll in because they'd read about it

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
and they'd heard that, you know, Courtney Leb before she started murdering husbands

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
used to work there and stuff.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
Hey, she murdered one husband.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
All right, I'm sorry.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I take that back.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Just one.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Just the one.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
And she would do this thing.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
It was so good.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
She was kind of like a rock star.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
She would light a cigarette and then, you know, there's a little brass railing about a foot,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
you know, like kind of six inches above the, like lining the edge of the stage.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
I guess keep her from going headlong into the crowd, you know.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
But it's a little brass railing and she would light a cigarette and put it on,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
balance it on the rail with the lit end out.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And then do a headstand.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
So now picture her on her head with her ass facing the crowd,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
like for her facing away, ass facing out.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
And then she would do a back bend and pick up the cigarette with her ass cheeks,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
then press back up into a headstand and do smoke rings out of her ass.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
She would like, she would like.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
She would like fart a little bit.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
She kind of, I think just the air pressure flexing her, like kind of like flexing her ass cheeks.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I can't even picture it in my head.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
She would puff smoke out of her ass and then she would go down to a frat boy in the front row

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
and put it in a guy's mouth and be like, yeah!

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And the greatest thing in the world.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
People died every week.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
The greatest thing in the world is to be in the bathroom later on.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
You go, you know that's a dude, right?

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
Because that's their deal breaker.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
I thought I was, I thought I was, I thought I was Carrie Grant.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
I thought, I thought I was ingesting the fecal matter of a female stripper.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
No one, they used to be a male.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Who's in pain tonight?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
There's a big flock here.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
All right.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
There's a hand that's shut up.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Ma'am in the glasses.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Are you willing to share your pain?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Are you willing to share it up here?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Okay.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
We don't bully people.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
You want to come up and come up here?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I don't know why people laugh at that.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
I guess sometimes we do.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
What's your name?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
My name is Miranda Harmon.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Miranda Harmon?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
H-A-R-M-O-N.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Are you from the future?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I'm your daughter from the future.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
She is exactly how I picture my daughter.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Bad news.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I've come to warn you.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I'm season eight of Commutina.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
Don't eat mangoes.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Do you think maybe we're related?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I don't know.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, actually no.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
My family's last name used to be Hamburger.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Hamburger?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
In World War II, we changed it to Harmon.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Oh, like the comedian?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Do you guys know Hamburger?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Hamburger.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Wait, your family's last name was Hamburger?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah, actually my parents are.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
Oh, the hamburgers are here.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Are you from Germany?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Did your family live in a hamlet?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It's possible, yeah.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
It's funny, my grandparents on my mom's side are German.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
Their last name, my mom's maiden name is Riek, R-I-E-C-K.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
But it used to be pronounced Reich.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
And they made a strategic decision to alter the pronunciation.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
That's a very common thing back then.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
There's a place in Wisconsin called New Berlin.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It's just a town, a delightful little town.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Great place to go, buy some antiques, some souvenirs.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
New Berlin.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Berlin, not Berlin.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
No, not New Berlin.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
It was New Berlin at one point.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
But I grew up and was like, oh, let's go to New Berlin.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Just make that decision at some point.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
You have to.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Otherwise, you just start calling it something else.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I like the Reich thing.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
That's a solid decision.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
You know a legacy is bad when you choose the word riek.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
It was riek all along.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
His name is Adolf.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
So it's Maria, you said?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Miranda.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Miranda.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
You nodded and said, Miranda, like I was right.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Close enough.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Not close enough.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Call me on that.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Miranda, what's your pain?

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
Well, so I don't know what I want to do.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm 21 years old and I feel like I went to the wrong school

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
and I feel like I have no idea where,

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
and I feel like the only thing I know how to do is make things

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
and be creative and I feel like that's the only way I know

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
really how to connect to the world.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
And so I'm worried that I'm never going to be happy.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Well, I mean, if you're never happy,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
you could actually make money creating things.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
Thank you so much for coming, Miranda.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I guess that's probably actually a really harsh thing to say.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
We have a word for happy people in the creative sector.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
They're called welders,

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
because they know exactly what to do and when to do it,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and they sleep like babies at night.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Everyone else is just like,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
horrible hack.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
But you're 21.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
By the way, this isn't the first time someone's come up here

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
with that particular pain.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
White people problems.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You don't know what to do.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You're 21.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I could hit you on the head with a bottle

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
and you could be unconscious for eight years.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
You would wake up and you'd still be ahead of schedule.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Maybe that's me being 40.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
But it seems like you could waste a lot of time.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
You do have time.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Like they say, you know, 40 is the new 30.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
21 is the new 11.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Do whatever you want.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
If you're here with your parents,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
that means you have a support system.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So unlike a lot of people,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
your job, if you want to be a creative,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
is to kind of fuck around for a while.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Why do you say you went to the wrong school?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Well, I went to a liberal arts college and it's lovely,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
but then I decided,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
well, okay, so I always knew I wanted to be a cartoonist or an animator.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
But in fact, that daffy duck is sitting there.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Keep making us.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
And I thought that by going to a liberal arts college,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I would want to be something else.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I would learn how to be like a doctor.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Or a teacher.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Or something different, I guess.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I don't know why.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
But then it's my senior year and it turns out

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I still really want to do animation,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
but there's no animation program at my school.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
And so now I'm kind of wondering what...

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Oops.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
You're just feeling the embarrassment of like...

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I don't know what to say.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
What sort of animation do you want to do?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
What's your dream job?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Like pie in the sky, don't embarrass yourself.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Aim way too big.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Like a storyboard artist on Adventure Time.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Something like that.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Or a graphic novelist or something.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Something where I get to draw.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
These things are within reach and they don't pay much more

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
than what you're doing now.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Yeah.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I mean, where are you from?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm from Orlando, Florida.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Are you visiting here?

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
No, my family and I are kind of taking a trip up the west coast.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Really?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
So you live in Orlando?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
No, I actually go to school in Baltimore.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Okay, where?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
It's called Goucher College.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Goucho?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
But at least you get to be in Baltimore, right?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Oh, it's wonderful.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
It's a perfect view of Hamster Dam.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
No.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm really lucky.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I shouldn't say it.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So you're touring up the west coast because you kind of have a feeling,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
you're feeling west coasty about your future?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Your college?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Yeah, eventually, yeah.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Or where I live.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And your parents are cool enough that they're just indulging this pilgrimage and kind of...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
My parents are wonderful.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I mean...

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
That's awesome.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
What are their names?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
What are your parents' names?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Hamburgers, show yourself.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah, they're right there.

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
Wow, a guy that looks like prime sexy Sean Connery just stood up.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Like perfect...

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Zardos.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
That's Zardos Connery.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah, like super duper perfect Sean Connery.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Like stood up in a denim shirt and flexed.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
I mean, there's other bad news there too.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
I'm just being an asshole when I say this, but having cool parents,

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
another nail in the coffin of creativity.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Oh, yeah, no. Listen, my parents did everything right.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah, that's the problem.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
No, no, no.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
It's really good though.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
But Lena Dunham had good parents, right?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And she's a great writer.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
I'm always jaded and go like, I'm always making that joke.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Like, oh, you have to hate your parents, you have to hate yourself,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
you have to be an alcoholic, you have to do other stuff.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
I'm just justifying myself.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
The hardest thing for me graduating college was up until this point,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
there are sections of your life have...

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
periods of your life have already been sectioned off.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Like you're going to be in this grade, this grade, this grade,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
then you're college for four years and after that,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
you sort of have to create your own periods.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
You know, like you don't want to be the person who's been doing the same thing

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
for ten years and you're like, shit, I'm still where I was after college.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
But, you know, I just sort of do what you want to do

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
and you don't... I don't think you need to go to school.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You guys can thank me later.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't think you need to go to a school.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
You could just... there's plenty of really talented people here

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
and you could go online and figure out how to do it

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
and just start doing it, you know, and then see how it feels.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Thanks, man.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
She just excused herself.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah, no, that's great.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
That bodes well for her future.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Thank you, Miranda.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I would say if you want to be a graphic novelist,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
change your name to Miranda Hamburger.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I'd buy that.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Yeah, the war is over.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
I want to watch a cartoon and I want to see a title card

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
that says, created by Miranda Hamburger.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
And then I want to find out that that was actually her name.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah, I'm getting pretty tired of the word Harmon on stuff.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Me too.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, garbage.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
It's like a low rent apatow.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
So, I just... because we did Harmon Quest last night.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
That's not going to be the final title of what we did,

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
this D&D thing where Spencer DMs and we play,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
and we're going to animate it.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The working title for Cine Family is Harmon Quest.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And I suddenly realized, Jesus Christ, we can...

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
You're like Batman.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Yeah, we're going to get my...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I said, I think we can beat that title,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
and somebody was like, why?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
That's great.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
And I was like, no, I think this thing could actually be good.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I don't want somebody that could watch this thing

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
having to think that they have to drink the Kool-Aid

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
or some Kevin Smith-y guy.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
There's more to it than that.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
The thing we did last night is actually,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
I think is going to be really, really amazing.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And I would hope that it would please a lot more people

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
that are capable of liking me.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
We should open it up to the...

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
If you guys think of a good name for our animated campaign

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
that we're going to do, we're open to suggestions.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Were any of you guys there last night?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It was awesome.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Alright, let's bring out the lovely Erin McGathy.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Hi.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Hello.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I was born...

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
The new astrological sign is my new sign.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
What is it?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Efficius.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Efficius?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
That's Pisces.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Am I pronouncing it wrong?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
What is it?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Aphiuchus?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I know, right?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Adam Glover to the rescue.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Is it Aphiuchus?

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
Okay, Aphiuchus, which is November 29th to December 17th,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
and I was born on December 5th, so...

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
So there's 13 signs now?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Yes.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
What's the symbol of Aphiuchus?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
There isn't one, because...

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
There isn't a symbol?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
No, no.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Because astrology is a made-up game.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
The symbol is a strawberry writing a bull.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Isn't there supposed to be an attendant constellation

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
that's a part of the sky?

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah, they don't just make those up out of, you know, thin air.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
I mean, they kind of actually do.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
They literally look to the sky,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
and they're like, that looks like a bull.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Does it look like a bull?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
I think that means that myself and other people

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
born during that time, where it's a wild card thing,

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
so maybe people born during that time are insecure,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
but charming.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Maybe you guys aren't tied to a destiny,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
and you can do whatever you want,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
because the rest of us are on the tracks

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
that are dictated by our horoscopes,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
but you guys do whatever you want.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I was that terrible guy in high school

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
that would read zodiac things to people.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
I would go, here, what's your sign?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I would read a different one,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
and then get them to go like, oh, my God, that's terrible.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I would get all flipped out.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
I read a different one, that's not you.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
I think you telling them that is the bad part,

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
because otherwise it would just be for you,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
but this is also for them.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
No, I'm just saying, I used to be that dick,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
and then I had a relationship with a girl

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
who was so into astrology, it was ridiculous,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
and it was such a challenge at first,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
because I was like, come on,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
but then over time, the way I coped with it,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I would go, oh, well, actually,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
she's coping with life a little better than me,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
in a lot of ways.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Oh, yeah, it's those matters.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Someone would spill something on her new dress

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
at a party, and she would go,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
well, it's such a Gemini,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
and not get upset,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
even though she was not the most noble of people.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
She sounds dumb.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
Yeah, you didn't raise a stink, right?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Because you're not tied to any destiny.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
You guys can do whatever you want.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Yeah.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I was a shitty person in high school

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
who had interpret dreams.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
You would just tell people.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Well, I read a dream dictionary,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
and then claimed that I was able to interpret dreams

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
and would stand in a certain doorway,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
and people would come and tell me their dreams.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Would you stand in a certain doorway?

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, there's a certain doorway

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
where the door is never opened,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
and I would stand there.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The certain doorway where the door is never opened?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Yes.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
What are you saying?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
What?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
It sounds like darn your shit.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah, at my high school, there was some door.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't know if it was a janitor's closet or something,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
but no one ever...

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
That's way less romantic than the way you described it.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
What I'm saying is that there's this enclave?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Is that a word?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Enclave.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Enclave is a word.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Enclave.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Where I would stand,

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
and people would come and tell me their dreams.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
How did you get in there if the door didn't open?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Well, it was just like...

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
It was a...

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Like, if there was a wall,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
then there was a part that went in,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
and there were doors there,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
because it was a doorway,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
but no one used it,

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
and I would stand there,

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
and that's where I would interpret dreams.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Oh, so a little recess in a hallway.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
We're asking the wrong question.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
She's talking about how she used to read

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
people's dreams,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
but how did you stand there?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
We're all architecture architects.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
How did you stand there?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Was there a load-bearing pillar there?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I'm just trying to get a visual idea,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
because before you told us why you stood,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I pictured Lucy from Peanuts,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
as little the doctor is in, little Lucy.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I was picturing a door that never opened or closed.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I thought that was how she described it.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
She was in this closet,

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
but how did you get in there?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It was like an Agatha Christie riddle or something.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
There's a puddle of water on the floor

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
and a dead man in the corner

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and a peacock feather in his hands.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
There was a place where no one stood,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
so I stood there.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Oh, that's very profound.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
Did you feel qualified to do this?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Did you feel like you had some sort of an act of it?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Oh, there's some fucking tension happening right now.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
No, no, no.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
You're either two dream warriors.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Oh, you thought you were qualified.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
So who told you you had the right to do this shit?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Were you all born with it or...?

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Did you read a book or did you think that you had the stuff?

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
Yes, I read a book and it wasn't diabolical.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
I really thought I knew everything.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
Also, I've always been a very sensitive person,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
so a lot of it was my own feelings

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
about the person I was talking to.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
You are standing in a doorway right now.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, maybe you're a little self-important,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
and that's really talking about locking up a stairway.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
But I had read the Dream Dictionary.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It was an embarrassing thing.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
No, no, no.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
What's in a Dream Dictionary?

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
You can look up things like your teeth falling out.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
What is that? Money.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Is it really money?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
When your teeth are rotting and falling out, that's money.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
I've also read it's health, which makes sense too.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
I used to have those dreams all the time.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
But I think it's so much more personal in that.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I don't doubt that there's...

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
I think the reason why we think that there's these universal symbols

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
is kind of Jungian,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
oh, a horse means this and teeth falling out means that,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
is because things like teeth falling out

34:58.000 --> 35:06.000
probably does mean a lot of very similar things to most people.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
But I think the bottom line is you go to bed

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
and your brain fires off this random thing.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
There's these lightning bolts race through your synaptic pathways.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
And unlike when your conscious mind is in control,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
it's just sort of random.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
It's like this Pachinko machine.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
So there's things that are on your mind,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
and then there's just random chaos.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
You have these weird hallucinations that time is passing,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
that you have an identity,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
that you're encountering other people,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
that there are places you're going.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And what's really happening is your brain is just sort of like,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
it's sort of like the tide rolling in over a sand castle,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
kind of like just, or as I said, lightning,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
going through pudding and kind of just going to these different places.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
So you wake up and you go like,

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
why did John Travolta drive that train into a mountain

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
and then it exploded and that gave me the power

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
to tell Bruce Willis to go fuck himself?

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
You can't look at Bruce Willis in a book and go,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
Bruce Willis means strength.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
But he does.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Bruce Willis means, to me, he does.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
Bruce Willis means something to that dreamer.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
So Erin, you were standing here in your little recess in the hallway,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and did you have to bark up a crowd?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Was there a sign?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
No, they came to me.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Did you have flyers put up?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
No, no, no.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Like good little things they could rip off.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
They would just say, they're doorway on it.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
The place where no one stands.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
It started with me just doing a casually and passing edit lunch.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
And I also really thought that I was good at it.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
I had read that dictionary and then just let it go.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
So I really was just pretending to be a therapist, I guess,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
in my own mind.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
But I wasn't bullshitting.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I thought that I was legit.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
But eventually there was such a high demand that I had to find a doorway.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
You probably were good at it relative to your other high school classmates

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
because you're an intuitive person.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Right.

37:01.000 --> 37:07.000
In the same way that I insisted that I become a student peer counselor at my high school,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
I was like, if anyone has any problems, no one came to me.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
But I was an official peer counselor at my high school,

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
but no one ever came to me because they were adult counselors.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
So you had two jobs.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
You were the peer counselor and you also were the dream interpreter?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
I guess so.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That's pretty good.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
There was a portion where I got really into hypnotizing people.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
I fancied myself.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
What?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I read a bunch of books about hypnosis.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
All hypnotists will tell you that there's no such thing as hypnotic state.

37:39.000 --> 37:47.000
It's just a state of enhanced relaxation and openness to suggestibility and stuff.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
And I used to go to parties with Matt Gurley.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
And part of being a hypnotizing people is you have someone else go up and go,

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
is she the guy over there?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
The guy with the tall guy over there?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Oh yeah, the liar.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah, yeah.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah, exactly.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
No, the liar number one.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
I'm the big liar.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
And then they go, yeah, he's a hypnotist.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
He can hypnotize you.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
And you find people that are open to that idea.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
And I would walk up to people and they would go, oh, hypnotize me.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
And I'd go, okay, it's easy to forget things.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
So even things that you know.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
For instance, I could ask you a question that you know the answer to,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
but you might not be able to tell me the answer.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
You start waving your hands around a little bit and they start getting ready to be hypnotized.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And you go, like you, what's your name?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Aaron.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
See, I'm bad at it now.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
I actually got to the point where I could do that and people would go like,

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
and they would pretend to not know their name.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
It was really like, and then I would knock people out and make them think that like all this.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
So they've just hypnotized themselves.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Yeah, that's a question that he'd pay like what, $300,000 or something like that.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
If anybody could prove to him there was such a thing as a hypnotic state.

38:49.000 --> 38:58.000
You know, I remember going to Pasadena to the Ice House Comedy Club

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
because my Armenian plumber neighbor had won one of those comedy contests where they paper the house

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
and they brought him a limo and stuff.

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
He's like, I got eight tickets to the Pasadena Ice House Comedy Club.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Motherfucker, we got to go.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
And I was like, all right, I'll go and we piled into the limo.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
We were literally the only eight people in the Pasadena Ice House.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
And it wasn't a comedian, it was a hypnotist.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
And I had seen these guys like identical acts that came to my high school and stuff.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
So I had gleaned this, what was happening.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
So I faked being hypnotizable.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
You know, they do a thing where they go like, hold your hands above your head

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
and now you can't put them down. And I purposely didn't put them down

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
because I knew he needed somebody up there.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
I went up there and sat in a chair and did 45 minutes with this guy

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
where he would go like, you're a Chinese rapper.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
And I'd go, cha-cha-cha-ching-cha, cha-cha-cha.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
Like, I was just doing bad improv.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
Like, what's bad about cha-cha-cha-cha-ching-cha?

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
Ask Rosie O'Donnell.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Yeah, I mean, it was in that case racist.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
And then other shit was like, okay, you're naked now, you're naked.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
And I would act like I thought I was naked.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
I was up there for full 45.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Doing this guy's act.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
He wasn't doing anything, but wearing a gross suit.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
And like, suggesting that I...

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
There was no different from comedy sports except for a lot of key differences.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
A lot of the stage hypnotists were literally...

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
I've had friends that went up there and were the guests I had brought up.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
And they'll go like, hey, help me out.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
They'll whisper to you like, help me out here.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
And they're like, ah, so?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
You can sleep.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
They just say, don't make me look like a fucking dick up.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I bet that's most of it.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
This guy didn't have to say that.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
The silence in the room and the empty chairs were speaking that.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
How was the limo right back for you?

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
All my neighbors kept going like, what was happening?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Was it magical?

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Did you remember anything?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
And I was like, well, I remember...

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
I kind of split the difference.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Oh, you didn't?

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
I was sort of like, well, I kind of felt really relaxed.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
And I sort of just wanted to do...

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
I threaded a needle where I didn't lie to anybody,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
but did this guy's act and kind of...

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
It was really sad.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah, the ice houses of darkness.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
It's never been darker than when I was rapping in Chinese.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
That was insane.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
You can't say...

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
It's a new world.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
If the words Ching Chong or anything else came out of my mouth,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
fucking teamsy headline.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
What do you mean if it came out of your mouth?

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
You just did that.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
I mean, I'm hoping that the absurdity of the context...

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
How surgical would they have to be to pull that out?

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Not very.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
There's a solid five seconds.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
There were people at the TCA's,

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
and I said at one point, I said in my babbling,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I said, yeah, because somebody asked me...

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Basically, his question was like,

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
don't you think you could be more successful

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
if you shut up or something?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
It was some kind of Pharisee question.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
And I was like...

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I was like, I don't know.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
I guess I'm doing okay by my own standards,

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
and I say stuff, and I get to be on honest ground,

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
and that helps me sleep at night,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
and sometimes people can pull stuff out of context,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
and that helps them sell the Cardiads,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
and that's fine too.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
I accept that.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And then there was the live tweeting was like,

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Dan Harmon blames the media

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
for his out-of-context quotations,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
and it was like so meta, like,

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
what are you doing?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
What are you doing?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Stop it.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
It doesn't matter.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
I don't care.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
All right, so who's to get Spencer up here?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Let's get him.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Spencer!

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
Go-pe-du-go-down-down.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
Bring your satchel and your flannel jacket.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Bring your beard.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Yeah, I can hold him.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Hello, Spencer.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
Sitting down.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
What's up?

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
What happened?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Did you enjoy doing the show yesterday?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
It was a culmination of a lot of effort.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
Yeah, I was freaking out.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Spencer is now, like, you came to the show one night

43:46.000 --> 43:50.280
one night telling your friends in the car on the way over I feel like I should

43:50.280 --> 43:55.120
play D&D with Dan Harmon. That night I said is there a Dungeon Master here

43:55.120 --> 44:00.280
because I had this thing like let's play D&D in the show flash forward to we

44:00.280 --> 44:04.840
played D&D in this show, now we're doing D&D in this stop animated thing that

44:04.840 --> 44:08.760
we're recording and you come over to my house on Tuesday nights. That's what I

44:08.760 --> 44:13.560
was thinking about. We have a private session. Yeah, it's almost like a bubble.

44:13.560 --> 44:17.120
It's your assistant so he comes over more than just on Tuesday nights.

44:17.120 --> 44:22.320
And sometimes I'm just in your house. But you have three D&D campaigns that are going

44:22.320 --> 44:25.640
out at once. Yeah, I was texting Jeff like that was one of the things I've

44:25.640 --> 44:30.240
really been thinking about is like you get like did you think when you saw me

44:30.240 --> 44:34.840
you know like oh I'm probably gonna be playing three separate games of D&D with

44:34.840 --> 44:39.600
this person in the future. I could do four man. I'm into it. Yeah, yeah.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.880
I'm just you in this show. Do you have other other games that you play

44:43.880 --> 44:49.720
outside of our group of friends? Better not. No. Do you? No. You do. How

44:49.720 --> 44:57.520
prettier are they? No. I tell you guys, would you? Would you? You didn't tell us

44:57.520 --> 45:00.360
when we went into that room full of mirrors in our private session that all

45:00.360 --> 45:04.160
we had to do is smash all the mirrors. Wait, you found a box of rocks in the room

45:04.160 --> 45:11.120
before? Look, hey. Yeah, but there were eight different colors of laser bouncing

45:11.120 --> 45:15.480
around the room. We walk into a room and it's a maze of mirrors and there's a big

45:15.480 --> 45:18.400
ball of light in the middle of this room if you can get to it. It's shooting

45:18.400 --> 45:21.920
different colored lasers that are reflecting all around the thing and

45:21.920 --> 45:26.400
you can if you reflect it back into the thing it comes out different colors

45:26.400 --> 45:30.640
and then we made a big white light that blasted a giant hole and then there was

45:30.640 --> 45:35.640
a look. Here's where we spent fucking three hours in this room. Three hours moving

45:35.640 --> 45:41.320
mirrors. Holding up pieces of paper to the lasers. The reminiscent of the first

45:41.320 --> 45:45.280
dungeon on Plymouth Town. Dan kept sending his little snake, what's his name?

45:45.280 --> 45:50.840
Lassiter? Dennehyde. Dennehyde. Dan is a snake and we kept sending a snake around to

45:50.840 --> 45:54.840
go and recon mission because it was low enough to not get hit by the lasers and

45:54.840 --> 46:00.120
we spent a good most of our lives in that in that fucking room. Finally Rob

46:00.120 --> 46:03.280
Sharp was like, I go into the room where the rocks are and I take a rock and I go

46:03.280 --> 46:07.080
boot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot and I throw it at the thing and that was it. Now

46:07.080 --> 46:11.160
here's my problem was that Spencer. Here's my problem. I think my theory is

46:11.160 --> 46:15.520
you let us out of that thing because you felt bad for us. Okay. Because there

46:15.520 --> 46:18.640
was a little there was a big mirror and then there was a little side mirror on

46:18.640 --> 46:23.520
the wall that was directly facing the thing and you got all excited when

46:23.520 --> 46:26.760
we started getting lights to bounce back and forth out of that. That seemed like

46:26.760 --> 46:30.200
a thing and then and then all of a sudden we could have just broken it. There

46:30.200 --> 46:36.320
was a way to get out of that one. Okay okay okay. And Jeff has theorized the same thing before like

46:36.320 --> 46:41.400
it's it's a big deal like this isn't. Well he's not entirely wrong I mean. Yeah you

46:41.400 --> 46:46.920
had pity. The whole time all of those mirrors were completely breakable with

46:46.920 --> 46:51.080
the condition that they were enchanted and the shards would float up and slice

46:51.080 --> 46:55.640
at you as you broke them but at the same time that's how you get through but you

46:55.640 --> 46:58.960
know you were doing the red-blue-green lasers and you were trying to get them at

46:58.960 --> 47:03.160
that same mirror that was the solution except you had them so they were

47:03.160 --> 47:06.920
separately hitting and all of you guys were holding up the mirrors but if you

47:06.920 --> 47:09.920
tweaked them so they're touching at the same spot and all the colors combined

47:09.920 --> 47:13.640
into white light that would also open the door. So it was double-sided. We were on

47:13.640 --> 47:17.720
the right kind of path. Yeah and then you abandoned it and I was like oh shit. I

47:17.720 --> 47:24.960
wasn't I wasn't there for that session. How do you weigh in? I'm having a tough

47:24.960 --> 47:28.640
time seeing this room in my head. It was tough seeing it with the mirror with the

47:28.640 --> 47:34.600
map I drew too. It was pretty shit. All right look listen tough guy. This is a

47:34.600 --> 47:38.320
new kind of episode of Harmontown. We're fucking rolling up our sleeves. We're

47:38.320 --> 47:46.440
gonna D&D the fuck out of the shit. Get your shit out. Get your dice. Get your

47:46.440 --> 47:53.800
pencils. I'm not even that drunk yet. Spencer your wish to like play D&D

47:53.800 --> 47:58.760
with Harmon came true in like a monkey's paw kind of way because it's like every

47:58.760 --> 48:06.760
waking moment will be D&D with Dan Harmon. Get out your characters. Spencer do you

48:06.760 --> 48:10.640
ever... Oh can I say oh sorry I was gonna change the topic for a second before we

48:10.640 --> 48:14.440
did D&D but... No go ahead. I was gonna say this real quick I don't think I've

48:14.440 --> 48:16.680
talked about it we were talking about the dream thing when you're sleeping and

48:16.680 --> 48:22.120
weird shit happens like you know it just you're like when you punch your mom.

48:22.120 --> 48:29.000
Guys that was told why are you gonna bring up old shit? Literally like many

48:29.000 --> 48:35.040
years old. Okay I'm gonna know what that means. What? Cumeo punches mom when he was

48:35.040 --> 48:39.880
coming out of anesthesia. I remember. I didn't okay I didn't do it on purpose I

48:39.880 --> 48:46.720
mean I did technically do it on purpose. I moved to the US and I'll say this

48:46.720 --> 48:49.760
real quick about my grandfather and I had like really weird relations like we

48:49.760 --> 48:53.160
didn't get along and then I was in the US and he died and I couldn't go back for

48:53.160 --> 48:55.880
his funeral and I felt like you know we had unresolved issues and I was felt

48:55.880 --> 49:00.000
really bad about it for like a week and then I had a dream and I don't believe

49:00.000 --> 49:05.840
you know. You didn't believe in that Jeff Davis shit. I don't believe like ghost

49:05.840 --> 49:12.280
stuff whatever it's like but he came in my dream and we talked and then I didn't

49:12.280 --> 49:15.920
feel weird after that and my brain some part of my brain realized that that's

49:15.920 --> 49:21.800
what I needed to have happen in a dream. Right. To be able to move past that. Yeah.

49:21.800 --> 49:27.280
So it's not always like random like sometimes it's. No not always random at

49:27.280 --> 49:32.560
all I mean I mean because our unconscious minds are absolutely containment

49:32.560 --> 49:37.400
units and pathways to the things that are truly important so that's why dreams

49:37.400 --> 49:42.000
that's why we remember them at all because they totally resonate like we

49:42.000 --> 49:47.240
wake up and go holy shit. I don't know if other people are different but nine

49:47.240 --> 49:51.240
times out of ten when I wake up I don't I don't remember having dreamed at all and

49:51.240 --> 49:55.400
then other people like every night like Aaron's like I'm dreaming. She's like a

49:55.400 --> 50:03.240
dream junkie. But like I but I think the bottom line is that like if if it if what

50:03.240 --> 50:07.360
happens in your unconscious mind resonates with your conscious mind i.e. if

50:07.360 --> 50:12.040
this weird random kind of like like dragon's lair lightning path kind of

50:12.040 --> 50:17.480
like creates a pattern that that can mean something to your forebrain then

50:17.480 --> 50:22.040
when you wake up you go oh wow that's weird that John Travolta attacked me

50:22.040 --> 50:31.000
with a pencil. What does that mean. It's just insanity at the time that's like

50:31.000 --> 50:34.360
not even anything but I think the stuff that's brewing down there is

50:34.360 --> 50:39.480
definitely absolutely important and I there's there's a scientific and

50:39.480 --> 50:43.520
spiritual explanation for your dad coming to you and your dream or grandpa

50:43.520 --> 50:46.480
coming to your dream and you resolving that I think I think that's a that's a

50:46.480 --> 50:50.960
place where science and religion both totally overlap right. I mean it sounds

50:50.960 --> 50:54.920
like you've come to peace like you came to peace with your relationship with

50:54.920 --> 51:00.640
your grandpa. It seems like you're doing a bit didn't it. She's like there's a

51:00.640 --> 51:04.720
long line there's like 18 people behind you. Will you carry my my books to fifth

51:04.720 --> 51:09.000
period. You're exactly right. Oh you were doing a bit you were doing the dream

51:09.000 --> 51:13.360
interpreter. I used to I used to. She was at the doorway. Can I say really quick how

51:13.360 --> 51:21.480
that ended. How did it end. A friend of mine called Bullshit and came to me with

51:21.480 --> 51:30.880
a fake dream and I. He den-harmoned you. Reading the wrong horoscope. He gave me

51:30.880 --> 51:35.880
this really elaborate dream and I took a long time interpreting it and then at

51:35.880 --> 51:39.880
the end of it was like I just made that up because because this is this is this

51:39.880 --> 51:44.920
is fake. Because this is too much power for one woman to have. Stop standing where

51:44.920 --> 51:52.360
no one stands. Turning this into a Walmart. Yeah. We were like making that my

51:52.360 --> 51:55.720
my emotional experience with interpreting his dream and then finding out that it

51:55.720 --> 52:00.320
wasn't real made me never do it again. Welcome to the huge. No it's fine. It's fine.

52:00.320 --> 52:03.840
He was just lying to you. And then later I would just talk to people about their

52:03.840 --> 52:06.600
feelings. Okay well you can you interpret a dream that I've had a couple

52:06.600 --> 52:15.720
times. Sure gay. This is huge. Oh my god it's like Superman working together. No because

52:15.720 --> 52:20.680
because the obvious answer is gay because I had a dream. I used to have a dream once

52:20.680 --> 52:24.280
in a while that my dick kept coming off. It just went it would just detach. Would it

52:24.280 --> 52:29.560
go off on its own or was it dead. It was like it would turn to you and it would say I wish

52:29.560 --> 52:35.240
I was in a butt. Yeah. Follow me. But stop putting me in vaginas and put me on men's

52:35.240 --> 52:40.000
butt. Yeah. I want to try to do this for real and what situation would it. Well okay here's

52:40.000 --> 52:42.480
the dream and this is embarrassing but I'm gonna tell you I want you to interpret this.

52:42.480 --> 52:46.440
I mean I don't think it requires all that much interpretation. I think it's just vanity

52:46.440 --> 52:50.720
but I was in a dream having a sex dream. I have a lot of sex dreams. I'm kind of James

52:50.720 --> 52:54.960
Bond in my dream. It's fucking and fighting at all times in my dreams. Are you fucking

52:54.960 --> 53:00.680
real women or dream women. Dream women. Are they like oh that one looks like Jennifer

53:00.680 --> 53:04.120
Lawrence or whatever or are you making them up. Sometimes we're actual people sometimes

53:04.120 --> 53:07.040
that's that kind of that morphing thing where you're with somebody and they kind of morph into

53:07.040 --> 53:14.840
someone else and stuff. Okay. But I was going down on a gal administering. You're even you're

53:14.840 --> 53:24.160
so lucky. So your dream sex has like elaborate like foreplay. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Oh fucking

53:24.160 --> 53:29.560
last night I said I was in a great sex dream last night. Some big tattooed rocky but they

53:29.560 --> 53:32.840
just laid me up on a bar and just started sucking my dick right at the bar and everyone

53:32.840 --> 53:41.480
else. Everyone was really bummed out. Everyone was bummed out. They were. Oh no. I like this

53:41.480 --> 53:54.080
bar. So I'm going down in this gal and then as I'm doing it I realize that she has a dick

53:54.080 --> 54:00.160
but it's my dick. So you're sucking your own. I'm sucking my dick on a girl and the whole

54:00.160 --> 54:04.400
time I think she's all into it. She's not going to come. She's like she's loving it.

54:04.400 --> 54:09.520
And the whole time I'm thinking I don't want to come in my own mouth. You're nervous about

54:09.520 --> 54:19.680
your taxes. And you can recognize your own dick. Yeah. What is that about? I see my dick

54:19.680 --> 54:29.800
more than any other dick. Yes. Does it wear a hat? Sometimes it does. It tastes like Branca.

54:29.800 --> 54:35.640
Sometimes it affects a little cape and a smart cane. I had a dream once. It has Calvin peeing

54:35.640 --> 54:43.760
on a vagina on it. Tattooed. When I was like a teenager and I distinctly remember a dream

54:43.760 --> 54:52.800
I had where I was a woman and I was getting it from a guy. I was in my kitchen sink and

54:52.800 --> 55:01.080
I was a woman. I was a teenager. I was 17. In the height of my... And the guy was fucking

55:01.080 --> 55:08.760
you in the sink? Yeah. And I was a woman. And I was enjoying it. I'm frequently a woman.

55:08.760 --> 55:14.120
See I made that up. I wanted to get him to... In my dreams I'm off on a woman in my dreams.

55:14.120 --> 55:19.520
That's the name of this episode by the way. I'm off on a woman in my dreams. I'm frequently

55:19.520 --> 55:27.840
a woman. One dream I was Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island. I was getting fucked by the professor

55:27.840 --> 55:33.480
but the skipper kept coming in and fucking bumming out our action. And the professor

55:33.480 --> 55:43.400
got so mad. Listen to your voicemails. And then another time I was... Who's the daughter

55:43.400 --> 55:49.520
on Good Times? Thelma? Thelma? I was Thelma. The sexy daughter from Good Times remembers

55:49.520 --> 55:57.400
that sitcom and I was getting fucked by JJ. So you were doing Rule 34 stuff in your dreams

55:57.400 --> 56:04.000
before? What's that? Is it Rule 34? Is it? Yeah. That's the internet... If it exists

56:04.000 --> 56:10.160
there is porn of it. Yeah. I was doing my own... That's Rule 34 of the internet. If it exists

56:10.160 --> 56:15.200
there is porn of it. Right. I've never been a woman in my dreams. I feel like lame kind

56:15.200 --> 56:22.040
of. Maybe tonight. I've never been close to a woman in my dreams. I've never even

56:22.040 --> 56:28.280
been anybody else. I'm always me in my dreams. Not even the professor. Harmontown at the

56:28.280 --> 56:33.560
wedding professor garb but I still me. Dan, you're saying you wouldn't recognize your

56:33.560 --> 56:39.840
own dick in a dream? I mean it's just this little guy. I mean what is it? I see it from

56:39.840 --> 56:48.680
the top. It's just like a little pink choo-choo train. I assume it looks the same as Adam

56:48.680 --> 56:58.880
Goldberg's? I don't know. Adam, get up here. Adam, get up here. No, we're kidding. If I

56:58.880 --> 57:03.400
saw it coming at me I wouldn't go, that's my dick. No, but I bet if you saw a dick that

57:03.400 --> 57:09.440
wasn't yours you'd be like, that's not my dick. Well, yeah. If it was gigantic and effective.

57:09.440 --> 57:22.240
If it was half inside a very happy person. I'd be like, that can't be my dick. I would

57:22.240 --> 57:29.880
always recognize mine because I have a horrible zipper scar. Whoa. From circumcision you mean?

57:29.880 --> 57:37.840
No, they didn't circumcise me with a zipper. From his audition for there's something about

57:37.840 --> 57:45.400
Mary. You sliced yourself with a zipper? I've done that, that's the fucking word. I was

57:45.400 --> 57:53.920
like 12 or 13. You scarred yourself? Yeah. Did you get stitches or something? No, I told

57:53.920 --> 58:01.960
nobody. We're very repressed over there. I went to, actually I wasn't wearing, this is

58:01.960 --> 58:08.080
the weird part of the story. I didn't wear underwear for way too long. Like I was maybe

58:08.080 --> 58:13.280
13 when I started wearing underwear. I don't know, I don't want to talk about it. Yes,

58:13.280 --> 58:26.520
you do. Too much to contain. Yeah, there's just a lot to contain. Let's go with that.

58:26.520 --> 58:34.800
I had just discovered masturbation. Well, I was like fucking so into it. I was having

58:34.800 --> 58:39.480
fun. I was pretty fun. And when I was doing it, it became this game, like how quickly

58:39.480 --> 58:44.640
can I do it? So I would try and go for the record. So this was like, I think the fourth

58:44.640 --> 58:48.680
time I was doing it that day. What is the record right now? Where does the record stand?

58:48.680 --> 58:54.920
I don't remember, but I bet it's around like seven or eight. Seconds? No, no, no, how many

58:54.920 --> 58:59.080
times in a day I've masturbated. Oh, I thought you were taking the record of how quickly

58:59.080 --> 59:03.880
you could do it. Oh, yeah, but that was part of it too. Okay. Yeah, if you're going to

59:03.880 --> 59:10.880
do it eight times. Yeah, I'm not here to, you know, measured in blinks. So, uh, yeah,

59:10.880 --> 59:15.880
so I did it. It was like the fourth time and we were going to this theme park in Pakistan

59:15.880 --> 59:21.720
called Fundland. That was the name of it, which seems like a real like, yeah, real first draft

59:21.720 --> 59:30.360
name, you know, fun land. Seems like a trap. Like they're trying to lure Americans in.

59:30.360 --> 59:35.280
Yeah, yeah, like trying to get kids. Yeah, fun land, right? Yeah, like fun. You think

59:35.280 --> 59:43.480
this is how you have fun? Can you just go to some land? So I was like, well, I was like,

59:43.480 --> 59:46.400
I had to get it before and I was going with my cousins. I was like, I could get it before

59:46.400 --> 59:50.040
it's time to go. So I was in there. I was trying to go, go, go. And my mom started yelling

59:50.040 --> 59:55.160
at me, it's time we have to go. The car is leaving. So that makes it harder than to come

59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.520
because I can hear my mom yelling at me. So I finally like fucking through sheer force

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:07.600
of will, very proud that in these circumstances, I could do it. So I got it done. And I just

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:16.760
zipped through my teeth. And it was jeans and I didn't have underwear and I rode roller

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:27.160
coasters all day. Bleeding. Geez. Yeah. Wow. Camille. Camille's comedy special is available

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:35.120
on. You should make Camille a cake. Zipper, Zipper dick. Can I get a penis that doesn't

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:42.320
have a zipper scar on it? Okay, Camille, I shut my little brother's penis in a gate.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:54.360
Jeff, what time is it? So many questions. When my little brother was in diapers and I

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.880
was a few years older than him, I was a toddler. I wanted to change his diaper to show my parents

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:07.560
that I could change his diaper. And I yanked off his clean diaper and he was running away

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:13.680
from me and we had marble stairs and there was a baby gate at the top of the marble stairs.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:20.440
That's the name of the story. It's called Babygate. It was a little open and he was

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.560
running up to the stairs and I was worried that he was going to fall down the stairs

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:30.840
and at the exact wrong moment, I shut the gate. On his penis? On his penis and he had

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:40.360
to get stitches. It was terrible. And he wiped it from his memory. We're really good friends.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:46.440
We're good friends and a few years ago, we both camp-counseled at the same camp and at

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.520
a campfire, I was like, well, there was not time when I shut your penis in a gate. He's

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.880
like, what are you talking about? He had no idea. I assume his penis is fine. I looked

01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.880
at it completely crooked. Is that why it looks like a corkscrew? Yeah. Why is there a hinge

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:09.600
imprint on it? All penises are in L, right? All right. Well, I'm glad we got to this

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.120
place because I think I felt like, as my own words critic, I thought the show started kind

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:22.280
of flat and stale and inhuman. I came up and said I had nothing. We got to penises. Specifically

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:31.800
like their abuse. As you guys are sitting on the real question, real talk, Jeff, Camille,

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.960
Dan, Spencer, as you're sitting up here, are you aware of your penis just sitting there?

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:47.680
Like, because it's just there. No. I am now. Only when it wants to play. Yeah. Which can

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.200
be random. And when you're like 11, 12 years old, that's the thing that people don't understand

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:58.680
about little boys. It's like, it's just happening. The plumbing is just like, we blame kids

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.320
for like, oh, what are you doing? And what are you thinking? And what are you talking

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.160
about? I was once in swim class when I was 10. And I was playing like chicken with this

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.800
boy and the lifeguard said, hey, you come out. And he came out and he had an erection.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.240
I had never seen an erection before. And he was like, you're bad and made him leave the

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:23.040
pool. Yeah, not a good idea. That is the worst. Probably not that kid's choice. That kid is

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:30.040
a serial killer. I was at my high school, I was watching a lifeguard. He kills lifeguards.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.080
If we're lucky. Don't moderate swimming. There was a guy in our water polo team in

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.160
high school and he got out of the pool and like, you know, like the water polo team,

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.960
these guys were all like ridiculously good looking. They're like perfect bodies. And

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.280
this guy got out in his little speedos and he's like, he's like an Abercrombie and Fitch

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.240
model, like looking back on it. And he had a fucking heart on and everybody teased him

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.400
like crazy. But like, there were parents there too. You know, there are moms are like, oh

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.920
yeah. We're like, like, it was like, like looking back at it now, like like a hot 17

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.640
year old guy getting out with a big boner. Like the kids, we thought that was hilarious.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.640
We teased him about it. But you know, there were moms that were like, I mean, as a woman,

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.440
I've got to say, I've never seen an erection from far away and I started to be like, yeah,

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:22.080
that'll do me good. That's what mommy needs. That's real rigid.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.080
All right, well,

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.680
There are some numbers that the grocery store wouldn't be sexy. Not sexy to see it like

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.960
a really attractive guy with an erection in a little bit. So I mean, if I was a mom at

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.120
a water polo game, I would have more feelings first like, Oh, that poor kid, like he's he's

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.360
experiencing all these things. If if I was on if I was a if I was an elderly woman who

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:51.280
had like a pool boy and he's like, can I can I can they take a dip Miss McGathey and

01:04:51.280 --> 01:05:00.280
I swam around and was swimming. What country is this guy from? Please don't interrupt her.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:08.240
Let this play out. Continue playing all the parts full accents. I think it was Miss McGathey's

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:14.760
turn. Sorry. Continue. He's clean my pool. He's swimming around. Miss McGathey, I just

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.240
have to tell you, it's just so embarrassing, but you're so pretty. It's so embarrassing.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:29.600
And I'm like, oh, come on, Javier, it's fine. Swimming, swimming, swimming. Javier jumps

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:45.360
out of the pool and looks down at his member, which is fully erect shy. He blushes and looks

01:05:45.360 --> 01:06:04.320
at Miss McGathey and Miss McGathey says, Javier, it's fine. This is a safe place. No, it's

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:20.160
fine. Are you sure Miss McGathey? I am nervous. I am so embarrassed that I saw you standing

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:32.080
at the pool and you're so smart. I had an erection. I was so emotionally centered. I

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:39.800
was watching on YouTube. I saw your UCB reel. You're in some very funny sketches. I had

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:45.080
your cake. It was delicious. I saw you interacting with people. It looks like you're really

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:52.480
listening. I had this erection. I don't know what to do with that. I don't know how to

01:06:52.480 --> 01:07:01.040
make it go away. Javier, come upstairs with me. I'll show you. I'll make your erection

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:16.960
go away. I have a place. Talk to me for five more minutes. Can I talk to you about my dream

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:25.680
wedding? You see it shrink in his drawers. Do you want to have kids? I want to have three

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.360
or so. I don't know. Where are you going, Javier? I just want to have sex. No, but I

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:38.440
want to partner for life. Please, please, please don't leave me alone. You're freaking me out,

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:50.680
Miss McGathey. My mom hated me. Please be my mommy. Please. Then Javier is like, all right.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:08:08.280
And then he takes me back to school shopping. All right. Who needs D&D? That was fucking.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:17.280
Hey, Spencer, do you have any penis injuries? Oh, yeah. Tons. Anything weird ever happen

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:28.720
to your penis, Spencer? Yeah, you know. It went places. Have you ever experimented and

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:38.120
stuck your penis in a weird thing? Yeah, like most of them. Most things? Most weird things.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.120
What's the weirdest thing you've experimented with? One of those teenage mutant Ninja Turtle

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:54.760
guys at the meltdown over there. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. What you guys don't know is that when

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.400
you guys leave and they lock the door, Spencer hides under that little folding table and

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:05.520
he emerges and he's just fucking everything. Turtle power. Who thinks Donatello did that?

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:14.120
He's a big tripper by the Beatles starts playing and he just runs around. He just hums everything.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:21.840
Every Alan Moore comic. All right. Well, do you, I mean, we were just trying to loop you

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.840
in. Do you want to play some D&D? I mean, I love doing everything. Literally. Yeah.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:34.000
All right. Well, let's do it. Do you want to tell us a story or just do D&D? What? I

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:45.600
mean, I have stuff to say. I don't know. Say it. I'm not saying I whatever. I used to interpret

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:56.760
dreams of high school also. Yeah. It happened. That's all. Did you have a doorway? Did you

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:03.800
stand in a place where no one stands? Yeah. No, no. I don't know. It was just, it wasn't

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.280
anywhere near as formal as yours. But how was your high school experience? Did you enjoy it?

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.800
Did you hate it? It was really awkward. Like my older brother was really, I mean, not like

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.000
in a bad way, in a great way, but like my older brother was pretty popular. So like a lot of

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.240
people that were older knew me and I just, I kind of knew a lot of different people, but

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.800
I didn't really hang out with very many people. I hung out with, you know, like my friends

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:32.560
and stuff mostly and we did weird stuff. That's pretty standard. Yeah. Played video games

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560
and Magic the Gathering cards.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.560
Played video games.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.560
Oh. I know. It was from Magic the Gathering.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:49.440
Interpreting. I used to, sometimes in the high school, I used to like give like orrations

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.320
like where you just start talking and my friends. Unsolicited orrations? Yeah. Well, kind of,

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.320
you know, just start talking about stuff. Out in the common area? Yeah. Like not like

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.320
in plain view. So people would come and watch, but I just, you know, just alone in the bathroom.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.320
Were you ever in a doorway? No. Well, yeah. Like when people come up to you and go like,

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.320
hey Spencer, talk about, talk about that late boat. Yeah. Stuff like that. And I just go

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.320
off on ramps. That was a good thing with me too. It was like, do that freezer talk. Yeah.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.320
Exactly. Like it was just kind of like, talk smart about that bulletin board. That's what

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.320
it was. Just that. I used to dance for money. Wait. All right. Let's play D&D. No, no, no.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:36.320
When we last met, no. For really? Yeah. Can we see a little dancer? Oh, why? Okay.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:43.320
No, no. Could you, could you give me a little cigar with your butt? Come on, Spencer. Let's

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:53.320
see it. This is, this is an inside D&D reference. Yeah. Fuck everybody who's expecting you to

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.320
dance. What do you mean you would dance for money? Like people, they would go like at

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.320
dances? No, I'd write down on paper like, I will dance for money. And then I'd just be

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.320
talking with my friends and holding it and someone would be like, you dance for money?

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.320
And I'd be like, yeah, sure. And then they'd give me a quarter and I'd just be like, and

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.320
then I'd stop. And then sometimes they'd be like, well, that wasn't enough. And you know,

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.320
I'd be like, whatever. And then we, did you ever, did you ever suffer any in high school?

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.320
Did you, did you feel like you were like a bottom rung or? I mean, I got made fun of

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.320
some, but um, for being the guy who danced for money. Yeah. I mean, well, just everyone

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:35.320
has antagonists and not like, I wasn't like a lower, lower, lower beast, I don't think.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.320
I think a lot of people like me. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're pretty self-aware. You were

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:44.320
like a, like a known guy around the school. Yeah. Well, it's like now, you know, everyone's

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.320
like, oh, Spencer, that guy, just look at him. No one talks to me or anything, but you

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:55.320
know, they know who I am. All right. That's it. That's the next t-shirt. Are you becoming

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.320
a little more extroverted now that you've moved to Hollywood and you're, you know, like,

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.320
well, we were just talking after the Harmon quest thing, um, I was, there was that party

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.320
and I was going to go and then I was like, uh, no, like we were actually driving there

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.320
and we were getting off the free one. I was like, fuck this. And then I just drove home.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:18.320
Yeah. So no, no. So you don't like big social situations. I mean, party specific parties

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.320
are weird because like, unless you have interesting, cool stuff to say all the time, people just

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:29.320
walk away and, um, at a certain part, at a certain part of the night, like people cluster

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.320
up in these little groups, like, you know, there's actually like a whole ethnology to

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:42.320
like parties. Like you could study them. They're really interesting from the outside. Um, but

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.320
uh, yeah, there's those little clustery groups that happen and I have no fucking idea because

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.320
that's when most people are drunk and people are being like intimate and people are like,

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:57.320
oh, I just don't know. Like it's just growing on my hip. Like I just, people are, you know,

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.320
talking about their problems and I'm not in one of those clusters. So I just like wander

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:07.320
around and I leave. And then it's like, they're talking about something too serious. Yeah.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.320
And then it's just weird. Yeah. You don't want to walk in. You feel, yeah, you're fucking

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.320
it up. You're not a, you're not a big drinker, right? So it's got to be. Yeah. That's the

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.320
thing. Most people got to seem like assholes when you walk up to that big group and they're

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.320
like, oh, but rice, crispy snuck. Well, I feel like the asshole. No, but yeah, there's

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.320
like the mystical. There's a point during the Harmonton tour, like a really sincere moment

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:32.320
between Spencer and I, who I, I, I like you so much. Thanks. Like Spencer, Spencer really

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.320
is like legitimately the coolest person ever. He's so fun to talk to and so nice and so.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:49.320
You haven't cleaned your pool. So handsome and so strong. There's, there's a pointer

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:56.320
that Harmonton tour, like after like a few informal bonding sessions that Spencer and

01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.320
I had where he asked me legitimately, like, we're, is this friendship just because you

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:07.320
were drunk when we were talking or is it, is it a real friendship? Like, is this just

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.320
you being drunk and being nice to me? Well, drunk people talk. Well, that's it. Drunk

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.320
people talk. They, you can't stop them. Well, yeah, if we were all sober all the time,

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.320
then we'd never talk. No one would just be talking about the ethnology of parties.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:28.320
Somebody's got to do the heroic move of getting sloppy and like talking about Rice

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.320
Krispies in a big glob. The other night when I was drunk told that Nicole Brown that I

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.320
would really like to see her in a black rom-com and it would not stop talking about it. I

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:44.320
have to send her an email. I really over and over again. I was like, play. I love black

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:51.320
rom. It's creepy for me. Well, it's good. You know, it's like fire. It can, it has its

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.320
uses. It can burn. All right, Spencer, shall we get this underway? Why, why not? Are we

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:03.320
ready? I think everyone's fine. When we last met, our heroes were on the road to

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:11.320
Fornheim, the frozen city, but the road was less of a road and more of a bridge. An ice

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.320
bridge to be more specific. To be even more specific, it was an ice bridge guarded by

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.320
skeleton warriors wielding icy blades. After a vicious and deadly combat, Quark wrestled

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.320
one off the cliff while Sharpie and Mulraine teamed up and destroyed the other two. And

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:34.320
after defeating their foes, a voice called out from within, welcome to Fornheim, the

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:40.320
frozen city. What they found inside was not dwarves like Sharpie had expected, but rather

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.320
frost giants, great blue-skinned humanoids living and talking, laughing and working in

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:52.320
their giant city. After chatting with the most kind face of the giants, the gang was

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.320
told to follow a group of skeletons directly towards the Jarl, who was the leader of

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:04.320
Fornheim. And so our heroes went after the skeletons and met with the Jarl. The Jarl

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:11.320
was most kind and was willing to help the party, but for a price. All of their fragments

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.320
of power. But with so much writing on the line and their fight against Admiral Darkstar,

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:23.320
would they really be willing to pay such a price? In defeat, Admiral Darkstar, in his

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.320
black keep, will find out.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320
Next.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.320
Yeah, we're having a sidebar here, the Jarl can't hear us.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:46.320
Okay. I mean, the shards of power, it's like the ring of power in the Middle Earth.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.320
Yeah, the wrong hands, that's bad.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:55.320
It doesn't do anybody any good for anybody to have all of them. Yeah, I'm assuming. This

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320
guy's pretty powerful to begin with.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.320
Maybe I should just talk to him.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.320
Go ahead.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:09.320
Alright, let me do this, I kind of straighten her hair and I unbutton a button on her tunic.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:16.320
I don't know what my reaction to that would be. Stop touching my hair.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.320
The Jarl is just looking at you, what is happening?

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.320
I mean, we were lovers at a point at a time.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320
Maybe.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320
You don't remember?

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320
We fucked under her horse.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320
Oh yeah, we fucked under your horse, yeah.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.320
That is the last voice that I wanted to say that.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.320
You fucked under her horse.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320
Were you drawing that?

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.320
I have three D&D games going in my life.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.320
Sorry, go ahead.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320
Well, go talk to the giant.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.320
What's the strategy?

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320
What are you going to say?

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320
Alright, I'll talk to him.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320
Jarl!

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.320
Oh, okay, cool.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320
Hey.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:05.320
Jarl, we have the same interest you do, keeping the Earth from the clutches of Admiral Darkstar.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.320
I'm there too.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.320
Are we supposed to do it together?

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.320
Alright, I'll jump in too.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:26.320
However, we can't leave all the shards of power in the hands of...

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:34.320
I'm off to the side doing the Wayne Brady improv game of doing sign language.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.320
These shards of power are...

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.320
Things we might actually need to defeat Admiral Darkstar.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:48.320
Not only that, but you know only that.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.320
I mean, I guess what I'm saying is...

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.320
I guess what I'm saying is...

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:59.320
It's this, it's this, it's this, it's this.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.320
If you're a requirement, I walk over to Wayne Brady.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:12.320
If you're a requirement to help us, is your own self-interest, then it's not called helping.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.320
It's called buying.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:22.320
We're here rounding up volunteers, people who are willing to sacrifice for the goodness of the Earth.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.320
Not people who are looking to make out, like bandits.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:31.320
That's Admiral Darkstar. He's the one who wants to take.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.320
We want to give, but not to you.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.320
Good is for sale.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.320
The right thing is for...

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.320
I think we should tell him about sale.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.320
Sale.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:54.320
He finds it really hard to understand what the hell you guys are trying to say.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.320
Zero shards of power. Zero shards of power for giants.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:04.320
Okay? Here's our offer. Help us or perish.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.320
Oh, no.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.320
No, no.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Disregard that sidebar.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.320
Perish? Are we threatening them?

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:20.320
You don't come in with a cosmetic figure with these guys, you know?

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:26.320
While this was happening, while I was chiming in, I was transcribing everything he was saying.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.320
I write it on my water skin and I offer it up to him.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:35.320
I do a little wink.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.320
You're waiting for you to do it.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.320
Not by our hands. We know that your might is the most mighty.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.320
We know you could step on us like insects.

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.320
Yeah, I was also going to point that out.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:52.320
But I'm going to tell you something that I heard in the 60s in Brooklyn.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.320
I thought that I could step on people because they were like insects.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.320
And then someone came and stepped on me because they were like giant insects.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.320
And then I realized that I was the insect.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.320
A giant man.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320
Yeah, that's the situation you find yourself in.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320
Sure.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.320
And it's the situation you'll find yourself in. Can I finish?

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.320
No, but I would just like to interject quickly.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.320
So I guess the answer is no.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.320
I mean, what an amazing thing to be so much bigger than so many other creatures.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:26.320
Yeah, it gives me a position of power over you guys.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.320
Yeah, and I mean, wow.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:36.320
You are in this position where you have all this responsibility to be so good to all these other creatures.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320
And that must be a difficult thing.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.320
And I have to say, I admire you for being so diplomatic.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.320
No, fuck you, motherfucker.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320
You're bigger than people, big deal.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.320
You know who's bigger than everyone?

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320
Admiral Darkstar.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.320
You know what kind of world we're going to live in if big people decide they can do whatever they want because they're bigger?

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320
A shitty world.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.320
And believe me, there's a lot of bigger people than you out there.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.320
And this tiny little fucker is telling you.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:03.320
It's time for people to start doing things based on what they want and what's right.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.320
Instead of what's based on their size, I'm a little drunk.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.320
I'm so, I'm so...

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:16.320
And if you start your happy life by stepping on me, I guarantee you it won't be happy for long.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320
I promise you.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320
We are here based on what's right.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.320
So fuck you, you giant fuck.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.320
Fuck you.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320
That's what you get from me.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.320
A plea for help and a dick in your teeth.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.320
A dick in your teeth?

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.320
My final offer.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.320
We'll happily walk out of here.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.320
We don't need your help if you're a dick.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320
He steps on you.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.320
Shit.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320
I got inspired.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.320
I grab a Sharpie.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320
Wait, does he really?

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.320
He stepped on me.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.320
He's stepping.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.320
I grab Sharpie's face and I pass it on.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.320
You take 22 damage.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.320
22 damage?

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320
Yeah.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.320
Who me two?

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.320
No, him.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.320
He got stepped on.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.320
Hey, I thought the speech was great.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.320
I thought he was gonna go for it.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.320
Thank you, thank you.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:02.320
I thought he was gonna go for it.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.320
I grab Sharpie's face and I pass it on.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.320
Are you still alive?

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.320
I mean, if I was at full when I came in.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.320
I mean, you took some damage from those skeletons.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.320
Hey guys, Sharpie died.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320
Is Sharpie, is Sharpie dead?

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.320
Sharpie's fucking dead.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.320
I kissed Sharpie's limp face.

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.320
He just provoked a giant.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.320
I thought it was a, you know what?

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.320
For last court?

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.320
What?

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.320
I have 35 hit points.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.320
Okay.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.320
No, you're dying.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.320
You're not dead.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.320
Right.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.320
You're dying.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.320
I give him my sack and my quiver.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:41.320
A giant blue foot come down on your friend and it lifts up

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.320
and it's like a crater and he's in it and he's crumpled

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320
and he's dying.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.320
But I still have shit to say.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:55.320
I jump in the crater and I don't think I have any healing powder.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320
Why are you jumping in there then?

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.320
Because I love him.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.320
I run to Sharpie and I say, alright, here's the deal.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:10.320
Sorry about the dick in your teeth come and my friend just made.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320
You don't run to Sharpie, you run to the...

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.320
I go to the Jarl and I say, look, we'll give you one shard

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.320
and on completion of the mission we'll give you whatever you want.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320
No, no, no, no, let's not...

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320
Don't give him shit.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320
He's already almost killed.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.320
You barely breathe.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.320
Listen, that amazing speech he gave, that can't be for nothing.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.320
He can't give the speech and then die and then we do what they want.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.320
Right?

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320
You don't want, sir.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.320
You take...

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.320
You listen to me

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:49.320
and you take this dick in your teeth.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.320
Sir, respectfully, sir, fuck you.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.320
I give a broken thumbs up for my crater.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.320
Sidebar, sidebar.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.320
With dick in your teeth, does that mean that someone's smiling

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.320
and then someone puts their dick on the teeth?

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.320
Like, what is...

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.320
He's dying like a bat.

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:15.320
I jump down into the crater and I start a blowing breath into Sharpie

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.320
and reciting an old...

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320
What is my class?

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.320
Ranger.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.320
Old Ranger poetry.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.320
Yeah, okay, so that kind of works.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.320
You...

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.320
He's not bleeding so much anymore.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.320
That's not what?

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.320
He's not bleeding.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320
I mean, like, externally, at least.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.320
Did the y'all have any response to my...

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.320
Oh, yeah, no, I mean...

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320
That was also...

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320
Yeah, no.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320
He's turned, cool.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.320
No, no, no.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.320
What?

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.320
He steps on you also.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.320
Let's give him the shards, you guys.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.320
He hates the dick in the teeth thing.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.320
Stop saying that.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.320
You take 16 damage.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320
God damn it!

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:05.320
Do the thing we did but without the dick in the teeth part.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320
I say, look, you heard what my friends say.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.320
Please don't step on me.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.320
We'll give you one shard and we'll give you another one

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320
on completion of the thing.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.320
Stop stepping on us.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.320
No.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:20.320
I yell up, also, the three of us have written a show.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.320
We're going to have to use our understudies

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:28.320
because we're dying.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320
What does he say to me?

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.320
My offer of one shard down payment.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320
Oh, I thought you guys were arguing about it.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.320
I know, I say this to him.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.320
Yeah, I mean, I want all the shards and he's dying

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320
and he has them so I could probably just take him

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320
off of his dying body.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.320
I take it aside with Christopher and you.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.320
Quark.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.320
Quark.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320
A little drunk.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320
I try to take him off my dying body

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.320
and I'm in a fucking punchy giant dick.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.320
No, that's it.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320
Bro, stay down, Rock.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.320
Chill.

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.320
I don't give a shit, bro.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.320
No, no, he doesn't know what he's saying.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320
He'll murder you to death.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:09.320
Gentlemen, it sounds like this giant is, pride is his...

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.320
You know, all I hear coming into the city is might.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320
Might this is the home of the mighty.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.320
Must be nice to be so big you can step on a person.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320
That doesn't seem very mighty to me.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.320
Mighty is getting stepped on, bitch.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320
Don't, okay.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320
That takes strength.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:32.320
I take my beautiful foot and I muffle Sharpie.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.320
Oh, good.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.320
So it's fascism now.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.320
So your giant philosophy is trickled down

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320
to my normal sized friends.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:45.320
Yeah, I said normal sized.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.320
Gentlemen, I believe that we can defeat this giant

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.320
by taking advantage of his ego.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.320
Okay, cool.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.320
How are we going to do it?

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.320
He's dying.

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320
He'll be fine.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:09.320
What if we suggest to the giant that we have written a show

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:15.320
in tribute to him, and during the show...

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.320
This is what I have to listen to as I die.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.320
While my friends capitulate.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.320
While she's pitching this, I go to everybody,

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320
and I steal, I take their shards,

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.320
and I go up to him and I hand the guy.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.320
Look, here's what you want.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320
You want the shard so bad?

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.320
Give us an army.

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.320
Also, before we do that, let's do that and we'll get the army.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.320
Can we also get some medical help?

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.320
Can that be part of the deal?

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.320
I spit on your medical help.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.320
No, he doesn't know what he's saying.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.320
I see one giant bandaid come near me.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.320
I'm going to piss on it.

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.320
We suggest to him that we are presenting a show

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.320
that is in his tribute.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.320
Perhaps one of us can come up behind him

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.320
and kill him via neck or another place that kills a person.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.320
There's so many giants here.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.320
The one that we're talking to.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320
No, but they're all going to come and kill us.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.320
It's a city of frost giants.

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.320
We're going to have to fight every giant.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.320
We killed them.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.320
Part of our show will have an audience involvement element,

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.320
like a comedy sports show,

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:16.320
and it will say everybody circle the hole,

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.320
and then...

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.320
I give him the shards.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.320
Well, yeah.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.320
So, as you approach,

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.320
he kind of grabs them between his pinky and thumb

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.320
and with his index finger, he flicks you,

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.320
and he just kind of tumbled backwards.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.320
What?

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320
And, yeah, we'll...

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.320
Spencer, how many of these giants are there?

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320
There's just the one in the chamber.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320
Yeah, but there's so many of them.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.320
There's just the one.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320
There's just the one.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320
We don't kill the giant.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.320
Hey, Jerry, please just do a show.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320
With who?

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.320
We got two dead people almost.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.320
No, but the three of them.

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.320
He'll be fine.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320
He'll be fine.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320
Yeah, I guess.

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320
Yeah, you're not dying.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.320
You still have HP.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.320
Okay.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.320
Well, I'm still...

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320
I've had a really shitty day.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.320
I don't feel like having a fucking show

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.320
for the guy who has killed our friend.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.320
Are you dead?

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320
I'm not dead.

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.320
I'm not alive enough to spit a tooth at him.

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.320
That's what I do with my round.

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:16.320
I'm gonna die proud, fuckface.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.320
What if we did a show about how...

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.320
We're not doing a fucking show!

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.320
We're not doing a show!

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.320
What if we did a show about...

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:25.320
Sharpie's dying!

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.320
Well, what if we did a show about how unnecessary

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.320
it was to hurt Sharpie?

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.320
Can I go and use my healing power on him?

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.320
If you have any, yeah.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.320
Oh, you mean the skill or...

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.320
The vial.

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.320
Do I have anything?

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320
Yeah, I don't know.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.320
Does it say healing anything?

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.320
No, it does say blue poison.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:46.320
Well, let's try that.

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.320
Yeah, why not?

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.320
Blue's a color of fixing stuff.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:55.320
Blue cross, blue shield.

01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.320
The police are blue.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320
Blue grass.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.320
Blue grass is a...

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.320
Spencer, what is the giant's name?

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.320
Um, Limdol.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.320
I step forward.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.320
Limdol!

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.320
Call him Jarl.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.320
Jarl.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.320
I think that he is a Jarl.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320
That's weird.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.320
That would be like calling you a Pakistani.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.320
No.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320
No.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.320
No.

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.320
It's a respecting...

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.320
Really?

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.320
Yeah, because you call it your majesty, right?

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.320
Oh, and I realized it was a title.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.320
Well, yeah, he's a king.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.320
Oh, okay.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.320
By the way, big Pakistani, a title.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320
You're a king.

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.320
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:35.320
What does he do when I give him the shards?

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.320
He took them, yeah.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.320
He just has them now.

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.320
So I say, can we get our army now?

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.320
Are we good?

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.320
Well, I was just waiting for you guys to finish.

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:45.320
Jarl, I would like to present to you a show.

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.320
There's no...

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.320
I have a great show for you.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:54.320
You have that previously, that we do not respect your kind or your race, but...

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320
I never...

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.320
I didn't think that.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.320
Ha-ha-ha!

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.320
Well, you can think it now, you big fuck.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:11.320
Well, then this is a show to demonstrate how weak we are.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.320
First...

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.320
He's gonna let us do it.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.320
You don't have to do it.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.320
Yeah, there's no reason for the show.

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.320
Nobody wants to be in the show.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:21.320
Sharpie's got to be in a foot-sized crater right now.

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.320
Yeah.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.320
It's a city boy.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.320
Jesus Christ.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.320
Can I...

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:27.320
Can I cast Armored of Winter at her?

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.320
Yeah.

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:33.320
I shoot my Armored of Winter at her and she'll shoot a frost rate to stop the show.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:35.320
It's really cold.

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.320
Also slippery on the floor.

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.320
Okay.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.320
And I'm cold.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.320
But here you are.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.320
No one appreciates you,

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.320
but we are here to see where you will go.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.320
Where you will go far.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.320
My friends here.

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.320
I walk up and slither through.

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.320
They're lovers.

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.320
I'm right behind you.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.320
Are you leaving?

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.320
Is that what you said?

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.320
No, he slits her throat.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.320
Oh, God.

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.320
Roll it, Spencer.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.320
Roll it is...

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320
No, no.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.320
When you were doing your show, I rolled...

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.320
Yeah, you fell on your face.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.320
Because you put ice on the floor and made it slippery and then you're doing your routine and you fall.

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.320
After the fall, can I make a noise like...

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320
Da-da!

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320
Yeah.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.320
Do more of the show.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.320
It sounds like you don't like somebody's show.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.320
No, I love it.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.320
I'm laughing so hard.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.320
He just said he wanted to slit your throat.

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:45.320
That was part of the show!

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.320
What is it like being bigger than me?

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:56.320
A book to you is a mesh book to me.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.320
Oh, God.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.320
Jesus.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.320
It's the other way around.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320
It's the other way around.

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.320
A book to you is like a match book to him.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.320
That's... yeah.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.320
We're still working on it.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:12.320
This is like a dress rehearsal.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.320
You are so great.

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.320
Please let us go.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.320
Please let us leave from the place of...

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.320
She doesn't care, Camille.

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.320
She doesn't care.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.320
She's not paying attention to what's happening.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.320
She's doing a fucking show.

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.320
Please give me more supply so I can make more progress.

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.320
I'm going to attack you if you don't stop doing this.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.320
I'm going to take my sword out and kill you.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:40.320
I take my sword out and I hold it up over.

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.320
I'm going to kill you if you don't stop doing this.

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320
Jarl, can we get the fucking army?

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.320
And that's the show!

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.320
Yeah, he doesn't applaud.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.320
You don't say.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.320
Yeah, no.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.320
He politely waits for the salt to end.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.320
And over.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.320
I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:07.320
I'm going to kill you.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.320
He kind of holds up a finger.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.320
And a cloud kind of floats in the room.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.320
And he reaches into the cloud and pulls out a handful of Onyx gems.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.320
And he crushes them in his palm.

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.320
And you see kind of like magical mist float up.

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.320
And then he drops it on the floor and it falls on the floor.

01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.320
And it kind of forms into the shape of these skeleton things.

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.320
And the room has like 40 skeletons in it.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.320
And he's like, yeah, here's your army.

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.320
40 skeletons!

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.320
What are your names?

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.320
All we get is 40 skeletons.

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.320
Shut up!

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.320
Talking to the Jarl.

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.320
I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.320
Fucking had enough.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320
Yeah.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.320
All we get is 40 skeletons.

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.320
And your lives.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.320
You're a dick.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.320
Dude, don't.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320
I'm in a bad mood right now.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.320
I know.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.320
You know who else is in a bad mood?

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.320
You're right there.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.320
Let's do an ice-breaking game.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:13.320
We should have negotiated for how many skeletons we would get.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.320
Seriously, it's all we get is 40 skeletons?

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320
What is the expression on their faces?

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.320
Are they nice?

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.320
It's like a skull.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.320
Can we have?

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.320
No, but they still have expressions on their faces.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.320
Tissue and muscle makes an expression.

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.320
You have to have eyebrows and lips and shit.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.320
No, that's all tissues.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.320
Why are we talking about the expressions on their faces?

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.320
Why did she do a show? It's fucking stupid.

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320
Okay, let's regroup.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320
Sharpie, how are you doing? You all right over there?

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320
I'm all right.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320
I can't believe that if I'm going to die,

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.320
the last thing I see is that fucking show.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:55.320
And my friends selling all our shards for 40...

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.320
40 shitty skeletons.

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.320
Yes, it is delicious irony.

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.320
And he just puts his thumb on you.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.320
What? Is he hurting him?

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.320
He's all alone.

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.320
You're dead.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.320
I command the skeletons to attack the Jarl.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.320
No, no, no.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.320
Let's fucking talk for a second.

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.320
They killed our friends.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.320
No, dude, they killed our friends.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.320
Spencer, what do you mean?

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.320
What do you mean?

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.320
Turn the attack.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.320
There's a lot of emotions happening right now.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.320
We need to chill out.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.320
I'm going to kill something.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.320
Well, can we figure out if he acts like that?

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.320
Are you really dead? What do you mean?

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:43.320
I mean, currently.

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.320
He looks so dead.

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:47.320
He's dead. Do a show.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.320
Sing him a song.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.320
Kill this motherfucker.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.320
I give him my life tube.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.320
Oh, what?

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.320
Okay, that's a waste.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.320
Do you see how his head is separated from the rest of his body?

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.320
No, not that bad.

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.320
Spencer, do you really mean that he's dead?

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.320
Yes, currently.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.320
Kill me off.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.320
No, no, no.

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.320
Who has healing power?

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.320
One of the three guys has healing power.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.320
No, he's dead.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.320
Listen, you guys, this is what we're going to do.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.320
He's dead.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.320
We have to move on.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.320
We have to move on.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.320
No!

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.320
Shit happens.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.320
Listen, he's dead.

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320
He's fucking dead.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.320
This is what we're going to do.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.320
We're going to talk to the y'all.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.320
We're going to say, hey, our friend is dead.

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.320
Can we bury him?

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.320
And we'll plan a funeral.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.320
And then during the funeral, when everyone's there at the funeral,

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.320
we'll kill everybody.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.320
I won't leave him behind.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.320
I use my rope.

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.320
I take apart like a small...

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.320
Here we go. It's a rope.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.320
I pull out a small thread of the rope,

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.320
and I weave it into...

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:55.320
I have taken off the tip of one of my arrows.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.320
Jesus Christ.

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.320
You're making a scorpion weapon.

01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.320
And I puncture a hole in the top of the arrow,

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.320
and I weave in my...

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.320
Because his head's off, right?

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.320
No, his head is not off.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.320
Someone said that.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.320
No, I said that.

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.320
You can pay attention.

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:15.320
He's got smushed by a thumb.

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.320
Yeah.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.320
Okay, your grief is...

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.320
I use that, and I...

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.320
I'm going to kill you.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320
I want to kill you.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320
I sew together.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320
There you are.

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.320
She said that she wants to put her dick in your teeth.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.320
I heard her.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.320
I heard her say it.

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:29.320
She said it.

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.320
I heard her say it.

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.320
She said it.

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.320
I heard her.

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.320
I heard her.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.320
She's been saying it the whole time.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.320
She's been saying it the whole time she's been muttering this.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.320
In fact, it wasn't...

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320
She's a ventriloquist.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.320
She was making the dead guy.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:45.320
Spencer, will you describe Sharpie's injuries?

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.320
It looks like a guy that just, you know, like a truck dropped on him.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320
Okay, I run down.

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:58.320
I find a place where he was injured, and I start blowing air.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.320
Magical health air into the hole.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.320
I'm going to kill you.

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320
I'm going to kill you.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.320
Is she sucking his wounds right now?

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.320
She wanted to put a flesh tube in somebody.

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.320
I don't know what the fuck that is.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.320
I think it was a life tube.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.320
Life tube.

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.320
That's a dick, right?

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.320
It's a dick.

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.320
Life tube is one of those fuckable vaginas, right?

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.320
That's a flesh light.

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.320
That's a flesh light?

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.320
Yeah.

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.320
Okay.

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:23.320
I command the skeletons to attack, to join in the attack and kill the arrow.

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.320
No, man.

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:30.320
I go into a barbarian rage, and I jump up on a pedestal, and I point down at him with

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.320
my sword, and I go, he's one of us.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320
You're now part of our campaign.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.320
Attack!

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:41.320
The skeletons are under his control, and they don't do anything.

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.320
This is what I was saying!

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.320
This is what I was fucking saying!

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.320
As you jump up with your sword, he kind of just grabs you by the nape of your neck,

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.320
and he's like, now listen, man.

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.320
We made a deal.

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:54.320
We made a deal.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.320
I told you I would let you leave with the skeletons and your lives.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.320
And I'm a necromancer.

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.320
This is bad.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.320
And I have power over life and death.

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.320
Okay.

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.320
Okay.

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.320
Here's the deal.

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.320
Here's the deal.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320
Shut up.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.320
All right.

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:11.320
We're talking to the Yaw right now.

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.320
The adults are having a conversation.

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.320
Yeah.

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:16.320
Oh.

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.320
Fucking.

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.320
My friend is dead.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:19.320
You fuckers.

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.320
Yeah.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.320
Why don't you rape a helpless animal?

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.320
Do a show.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.320
I go down, and I start fucking.

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.320
I fuck the corpse of Sharpie just to fuck with her.

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.320
Then I get back up.

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.320
It makes no difference in my previous campaign of your personality.

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.320
Shut the fuck up.

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.320
I go into the Yaw.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.320
Okay.

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:38.320
We'll take your fucking skeletons.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.320
I'm gonna heal him right now, or I'm gonna fucking lose my shit.

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.320
Yeah.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.320
No, that's what I was saying before you so rudely interrupted me.

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:51.320
I just kind of, you know, I enjoyed this sort of thing.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.320
Heal my friend.

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.320
I'm gonna do it.

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.320
I'm gonna.

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.320
Stop being an ass.

01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.320
I'm gonna.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.320
Hey, hey, hey.

01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:58.320
He's gonna do it.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.320
We're all good.

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.320
We're all on the same page.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.320
Okay.

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.320
Do it.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320
He drops you to the floor.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320
This has been a real roller coaster.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.320
I know.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320
I'm gonna fucking.

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.320
At the end of the day, our friend's gonna be back.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:11.320
We're gonna have our 40 skeletons, and we're gonna walk out.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.320
And we'll remember this day forever.

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.320
Just do it.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.320
Heal my friend now.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.320
He looks to the ground at the crumpled body of Sharpie, and he points a finger at him,

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:26.320
and he kind of, he grinds some more of these Onyx gems between his finger, and he's like,

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:36.320
Acromantica Deus Ex Machinima.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.320
And you just, you spring up fresh as a daisy.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.320
Can I also make a suggestion?

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320
Sure.

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.320
So you can heal anything?

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.320
I mean, no.

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.320
Okay.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:50.320
What about like a zipper scar?

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.320
I mean.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.320
Down, down there.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:55.320
Sharpie, I go to Sharpie, and I say Sharpie, you were dead.

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:56.320
We brought you back to life.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.320
All we got is these 40 skeletons.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320
Don't, no.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.320
We gotta spend it positive.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.320
He's gonna go off again.

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:03.320
We gotta spend it positive.

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.320
Let me try.

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.320
We got 40 skeletons.

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.320
So fun.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.320
You were dead, and now you're alive.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.320
Sharpie, I was so worried you were.

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:16.320
She's so worried she did a show while you were fucking dying.

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.320
You remember it.

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.320
And then she tied a thing to her rope.

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.320
It was fucking stunning.

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.320
We are forgetting the power of theater.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.320
Can we leave?

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.320
Yeah.

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.320
Let's go.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.320
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.320
We're getting the fuck out of here.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.320
Okay.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.320
I go outside and have a fucking, the most important cigarette of my life.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320
I linger behind.

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.320
Don't do it.

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.320
Don't do it.

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.320
I want to be the last to leave the room.

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.320
Okay.

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.320
And I dust off my clothes.

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320
He's like, hey man, that was pretty cool.

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.320
Yeah?

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:47.320
Yeah, I'm just the Jarl.

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.320
I gotta, you know, it's important to be the big man.

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.320
It's important to be a man?

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.320
A big man in a city of big men.

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:57.320
Well, you should try getting stepped on by a fuck face sometime.

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.320
Okay.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320
And I come, and I grab by the eye.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:07.320
If manhood is your goal, if manhood is your goal, you should try getting stepped on sometime.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.320
Because that's the test.

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.320
Well, if you ever...

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.320
You fuck!

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.320
I drag Storm out.

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.320
I drag him out.

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.320
Yeah, we drag him out.

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.320
If you ever see any double giants, let me know.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.320
If I, I'm sorry, what, what, get off me, get off me.

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.320
No, no, no, no, no.

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.320
No, he's talking to me.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.320
What, what?

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.320
I present a show poster with his clothes.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.320
If you ever find any double giants, send him in.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.320
Remember finding any double giants?

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:31.320
Yeah.

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:34.320
What the dumb, you speak gibberish.

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.320
You already have a dick in your teeth.

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.320
What's a double giant?

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.320
It's a giant to giants.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.320
It's like a giant to giants.

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.320
You know what?

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.320
Dumb.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.320
We leave, we leave.

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.320
We leave.

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.320
If we see one, you're gonna come help us or what?

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.320
No, he was doing the best.

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.320
He's improvising.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.320
He's a fucking giant.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.320
He's got a brain the size of a fucking canape.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320
Sharpie.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.320
Sharpie, cool it.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.320
That's just not anatomically correct.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.320
Okay.

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.320
All right.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.320
Listen, you're great, Jarl.

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320
Thank you so much.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.320
Thank you so much.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.320
We're gonna go.

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320
Pleasure to meet you.

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.320
We're out.

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.320
We should get brunch sometime.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.320
Let's go.

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.320
Enjoy your frozen city.

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320
No, no, no.

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320
With its sharpie front gates.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320
Sharpie, sharpie.

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.320
And its shitty skeletons.

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.320
Get in the car.

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320
Get in the car.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:24.320
One of these days, you're gonna wake up and the earth's still gonna be here.

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:31.320
On that day, remember this, you're welcome.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.320
Sharpie out.

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.320
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:39.320
We love you very much.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.320
One more time.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.320
Erin McGathy.

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320
Tameo Luntiani.

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.320
Spencer Crittenden.

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.320
Miranda and the hamburgers.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.320
That was an adventure.

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.320
Holy shit.

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.320
See you next week.

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.320
We love you all dearly.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.320
Thank you, guys.

01:46:50.320 --> 01:47:00.320
Oh, on Saturday, come to Google the thing.

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.320
It's in a family.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320
Come see the taping of this thing.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320
It's really great.

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320
You won't believe it.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320
Oh, on Saturday, come to Google the thing.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320
It's in a family.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320
Come see the taping of this thing.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320
It's really great.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.320
You won't believe it.

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.320
It's in a family.
