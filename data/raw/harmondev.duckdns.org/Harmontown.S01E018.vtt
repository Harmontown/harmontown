{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:20.000\nOh, yes indeed.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:25.000\nWelcome you lucky sons of bitches to the Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:31.000\nAnd you send me lucky people listening on your whatever the fuck you listen to things on.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:41.000\nPlease welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:46.000\nThank you very much.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:51.000\nOkay, so let me get weird tonight.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:58.000\nI didn't have anything and so I went through my office at home and I found this journal I wrote in high school.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:03.000\nAnd that's something that L.A. people do a lot, special shows and things.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nYou know, you read your embarrassing adolescent journals and stuff.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nI thought, oh, that's ducks in a barrel.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:15.000\nYou know, oh, Dan the nerd, like being a nerd and trying to be cool, but being a nerd, trying to be a good writer,\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:23.000\nbeing a bad writer and I'll mock my teenage self and well, you know, the unspoken humble brag headline will be,\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:28.000\nI'm so much cooler now, which is how I think it usually works when you read these things.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:33.000\nI started reading it and I got really bummed out.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nJust devastated.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:44.000\nI want to say I was a vile person, but I mean it's just, I don't see the difference between this kid and myself.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:54.000\nAnd except that I just, I stopped trying to talk like Frasier all the time, which this kid at 15 is still doing.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nAnd I also just stopped like trying to impress other people, including myself.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:00.000\nI kind of stopped posturing.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nSo it's just, it's just, I don't know.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:05.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:10.000\nErin was like, oh, this is very, I mean, this is all what's interesting and people that do those journal shows.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nErin said, they always read the wrong entries.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nThey always, you know, because they don't get it.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:23.000\nThey don't understand what about their entries is, you know, is what we want to hear, you know, the shot in Freud of it all or whatever it is.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nWell, now you're holding a spiral.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nWith 27 post-it notes.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:31.000\nBecause I started marking, oh, I'll just read this and then I'll read that.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nI want to paint the picture for people listening to this.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nThis is not like a little, you know, like a little velvet case, you know, like diary.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nIt's a standard spiral notebook.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nHow many of these did you have?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:45.000\nI found two of them.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.000\nThis is the first one.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nI was obsessed with transition.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nSo there's a lot of, there's a lot of chapters that happen to this.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nAnd I bring the journal to a conclusion at 17.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:55.000\nI go, I'm done.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nThere's nothing more to say.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nI'm self-actualized.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:06.000\nThe title is Sand Pollution, The Journals of Dan Harmon.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:09.000\nNovember 1989 to September 1990.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:10.000\nSand pollution?\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nYes, I'm glad you asked.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:18.000\nI'll give you a taste of my voice at 15.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.000\nThis is how I ended the first entry.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:25.000\nI won't bother to, I mean, I'll start.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nNovember 27, 1989, 10.30 p.m.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:35.000\nA picture of me on like a bear mattress surrounded by just like probably just a lot of my own cum.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:42.000\nI can, I seem to recall not being able to stop touching myself physically or mentally\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.000\nbecause no one else was going to do either job.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:54.000\nI was astooned with acne and I had a yin-yang patch on my acid watch denim jacket sleeve\n\n03:54.000 --> 04:00.000\nbecause I was very into like Taoism and like exploring all religions and stuff.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nI think that for the first time, I'm going to try not to read it in this voice\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:09.000\nbecause I don't want to, I don't want to like, like, I'm just going to like just,\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:13.000\nthis hurts really bad but I'm not going to,\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:19.000\nif you catch me starting to go like this, like to make fun of myself, like, oh, stop me.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:25.000\nI think that for the first time in my life, I consciously realized something today.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nNovember 27 comes and goes with each identical year.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:37.000\nBut today was the first and last 11, 27, 89 I would ever experience.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nAbsolutely nothing extraordinary happened today.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:46.000\nThe day itself along with every other individual day of the year is gone now forever.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nAnd it took all this time to get that far.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nI suppose that's what an optimist or a reborn Christian is,\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nsomeone who can appreciate every day as the only one of its kind and every person is something unrepeatable.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:02.000\nBut I feel this renewed vision could only last so long before slowly decomposing\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:06.000\nwhilst laying in...\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nWow.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nWhilst laying in bitter wait for a replacement philosophy.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:17.000\nI am an agnostic and I realize that philosophy is, in the truest sense, food for thought.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nHanging onto one bit for too long is silly.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nIt rots on the shelf.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:21.000\nIt begins to stink.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:22.000\nNo one gets to enjoy it.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:26.000\nYou must consume philosophy perhaps after brief appreciation.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd how do you consume it?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nBy bringing out its opposite and exposing it as just more sand.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nIt's a theme that's coming.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nIt'll be slowly revealed to you.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nOkay.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nIt's sad in a way, I guess, but the alternatives are unhealthy.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:44.000\nI guess after averaging out all recollection, I'd have to give this day a solid five.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nI admit it.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nI'll give each day a number.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nCan I stop right there?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nSure.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nBut we'll never get anywhere.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nWhatever you think, whatever you want to say.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nFifteen.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nPretty good.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nMaybe that's what I wanted you to think.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nWell, so far, I'm on your side.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nSure.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nThat's probably what I thought the first entry of a journal should accomplish.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:09.000\nAnd yet, I don't think, I don't know if I think anyone's ever going to read this.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nBut I know that I'm trying to impress myself or some unseen reader.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nBlogging hasn't been invented yet.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:21.000\nSo I'm like doing like a MySpace blog.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nSo this is me signing off, and this is very typical.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nI won't read all the ones that are kind of typical like this.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nThis is one of my sign-offs.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nWell, deep...\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nWell, deep...\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nI have to do the voice.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nWell, deep...\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nDeep night...\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nIs it night or night?\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nNo, no.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nWell, deep night and weirdness.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nWhisper warnings of a melancholy marrow.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nAll right, I take it all back.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nYou lost me.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:55.000\nI look upon it with the usual neutral dread.\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:00.000\nMax, dear sir, be with me from six till six on the special twenty-eighth,\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nfor I predict it will be an ugly irksome four.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:09.000\nIs everyone in my dug Kafka?\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nYou should be asking, who's Max?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nWell, I have a lot of questions, but let's start with that one.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nMax, I figured out, because I was like, who's Max?\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nIs he the Sandmaster?\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nDo you remember what I told you?\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nDo you remember what I told you that, in a way, yes.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nDo you remember what I told you that my Dungeons & Dragons character,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nyou kind of pressed me to tell you, and I said it was Jim Nightblade.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:35.000\nThank you for calling out from the audience.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nThat's partly true.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:41.000\nJim Nightblade was a character I played in a game called Shadow Run.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nNice.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nNever let it be said that I did not find my crowd before I died.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:52.000\nYou cannot expect more than one woo for Shadow Run,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nbut if you get one, you have found your niche, sir.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nWas that a deep weariness and a weary Mauro?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nWas that a role-playing game?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nIt was a role-playing game.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:07.000\nIt was like setting the future, setting a future in which magic and technology\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:11.000\nhad both awakened, magic had reawakened,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nand so there were ogres and dragons and stuff,\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nbut there were also hackers and cyber things,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nand I played Jim Nightblade, a bounty hunter,\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:26.000\nwho was killing it with the ladies.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:32.000\nMy point being that I found a thing where I rattled off all of my...\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nI was talking about role-playing, and I suddenly realized who Max was.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:41.000\nMax was one of my... was my favorite actual D&D character.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:45.000\nActually, he was the one I played in a game called Middle Earth Role-Playing,\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:49.000\nwhich was a little cooler than D&D,\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:57.000\nsort of the crack to D&D's weed cocaine.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nAnd if you ever wanted musical cue, I don't know what it is,\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nbut Zack has cued up some of his hip-hop,\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nso if you ever want it, I don't know what it is.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nIt's sight unseen or ear unheard of.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nWell, when your cheeks get to a maximum redness,\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nfeel free to pop the champagne crack with a little brief hip-hop interlude.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:20.000\nDecember 12th, 1989, 10.40pm.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nTomorrow, if one thing goes right,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:31.000\nI shall have opportunity to partake in a Shadow Run with Neil and Rob.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:38.000\nAh, Seattle in the year 2050.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nYour coffee is so strong.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:45.000\nSuch a pleasant place to escape to,\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:48.000\nwhere prepositions can end sentences.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nAlright, take it easy, Harmon, don't bully anybody.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nWhere Jim Nightblade, bounty hunter,\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nstalks the dark streets without fear,\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nthe cybernetically enhanced anti-hero\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nfor whom nothing goes wrong that can't be fixed by next gaming session.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:05.000\nHow I envy thee, James,\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:10.000\nand how I long to control you again for an hour or two,\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nand how I wonder why language hasn't evolved\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nwhen technology has these and those.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nOh, I wonder when one writes in a journal,\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\none must take on an Orson-Willian bravado,\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nalthough one is writing about one's acne,\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nso that for one brief moment I might mistake myself for you\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nand this world for yours.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nAlso so that I might add to my treasure chest of fantastic experiences,\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:42.000\nwhich I share with myself alone after the game has been done for days.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nYou see, reader, there's a reader.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nJim's world has perfect screenplay potential.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:55.000\nI lament earlier that life has no screenplay potential.\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:00.000\nAnother thing.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nThis is one day earlier.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nI don't even know what to write, but I feel a surge of pathetic feelings.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nI know that in a matter of hours something will go wrong or right,\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:12.000\nand for the rest of my life some things will just keep going wrong or right.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:16.000\nReal life sucks. It has absolutely no screenplay potential.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:21.000\nLife is a monotonous hairball.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nSorry, my cheese got red.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:30.000\nLife is a monotonous hairball.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nThat's alright.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nI'm happy, then sad, right, then wrong.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nWait, let's break down monotonous hairball.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:44.000\nLet's break it down into the metaphor mixer.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nWas that it?\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nI'm happy, then sad, right, then wrong, early, then late, old, then young.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:57.000\nThese drops and peaks are tightly adhered to a steady flat line that is my boring existence.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:02.000\nThe problem is, these are normal teenage claims,\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nbut I'm not supposed to be a teenager.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:09.000\nIn fact, I'm not. I sense that.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nMy roots run deeper than any adults.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nMy branches puncture the farthest layer of sky.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nWhoa.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:20.000\nBut my roots have yet to drink freely,\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:23.000\nand my leaves have yet to even bud.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:29.000\nDo leaves bud? I don't even know.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:33.000\nSo anyways, I talk about going to play the role-playing game,\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nand then at that, but it has perfect screenplay potential.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nAs does, and this is, I'm gonna rattle off names.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nThese are all names of characters I played.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nI created and played in various role-playing games.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.000\nAs does Edison Newborn's,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nMelkintook's,\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nRaymond Flinks,\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.000\nand of course, Maxwell Artfall.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nMaxwell Artfall was my big, that was my guy.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nWho is he?\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nHe was a bit of a rapscallion, a sloshbuckler,\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:07.000\nand something of a ladies' man.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nStrangely enough.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nI mean, it gets dark.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nI become more and more of a dick\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:19.000\nas my sexual frustration kind of wheel.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nWould you start writing some of the prose again?\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nI want to cue that music again,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:28.000\nand I think my time out just right.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:33.000\nThere's a, so I'll be dipped in dog shit\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nif I didn't pass my road test on Friday.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nI'm a licensed driver!\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:42.000\nNow, that's a real journal entry.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nThat's a job I'm not doing in every other one.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nIt's like, why don't you stop telling me\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nabout the particulars of the Gestalt,\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nand tell me, remind me at 40 of like,\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nwhat were you doing?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nGee, the more I write, the less I have to say.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nI lost the debate meet on Saturday.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nThat is, Graham and I went two and one,\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nthe other team, one and two.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nI just had to throw them into the bus, I guess.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nI didn't go to the snowball dance at school.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:11.000\nI didn't go to the company Christmas party at ground round.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nI didn't go to comedy sports on Sunday.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nGina moved in with some guy by UWM.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nGina would be some girl I had a crush on,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nnot somebody that ever touched me.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nActually, she let me kiss her under her mistletoe.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nYou're still 15, right?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:29.000\nThis is December 17th and 89, yeah, I think I'm 15.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:33.000\nMy car insurance shall be costing me about $100 a month.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nYou had car insurance at 15 years old?\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nWhat?\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nWell, yeah, and a job.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\n15?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:41.000\nHalf my pay at any rate.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:42.000\nI was a dishwasher.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nGod knows what gasoline costs.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nI didn't know yet.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:50.000\nFunny thing is, these are my only problems.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nThere are a few more.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nI got a C and a Brit Lit paper,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nand I'm eight and a half stories behind in that class.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nI have to clean my room.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nNo Christmas shopping done.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:02.000\nNo girl to spend the remaining 40% of my money on.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nOh, ladies, don't week for me.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:10.000\nI spew some misogynist shit.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:13.000\nI guess the bottom line is that I need a little excitement\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nor a little order to my life.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:21.000\nI wish I had a few friends who didn't laugh at everything I said.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nNo, no, stop laughing.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nHe hates that.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\nYeah, I come to like it.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:35.000\nBut rather had a reply that might silently amuse me.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nI wish my zits would vanish,\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\ngranting me the confidence I feel I need\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:49.000\nto be more successful with the Chickers.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nKeep going.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nThat ain't gonna sound like that.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nSo then there's a page that says,\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:02.000\nDecember 18th through January 3rd, transitional movement.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nPhase two begins.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nYou ready?\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nDo you want the music back?\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:11.000\nDance taken off his jacket,\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\npicks up his vodka,\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:32.000\nand reads.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nPhase two, I say.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nFuck it.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:41.000\nIn reference to the dealings of my phase one self.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nFuck, fuck, fuck it.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nIn fact, I'm afraid the new policy is this.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:54.000\nOne, no more involvement in the affairs of others.\n\n16:54.000 --> 17:01.000\nNo extracurricular attempts at hobnobbing.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:07.000\nSpeak when spoken to and when wit is unavoidable.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:11.000\nYou know, sometimes you don't know your own strength.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:14.000\nNumber two, think before speaking.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nNo reflexive speech that wears a groove in your brain.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nLike, uh, uh, uh, uh, which I grew into the master of.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nShould have listened to some shit.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nNumber three, no more somber thoughts of existentialism\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:36.000\nthat aren't properly coated with wit and or humor.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nThis guy's laying it on the line.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:45.000\nNumber four, no unsolicited criticism outside the presence of the subject.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nWhat?\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:49.000\nYou know, like, don't talk shit about people.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nBehind their backs, tired to say into their face.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nNumber five, constant quest for adventure.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nPeriod, period, period.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nWhen offered two choices, take the less routine.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:07.000\nNumber six, an 80% reduction of all negative humor,\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:11.000\nwhich is easier to execute than the more enjoyable refreshing positive humor\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:21.000\nthat will replace it hence.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nWell, anyways, suffice to say that the policy in general dictates\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:29.000\na more light carefree image, including in my writing starting now.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nAh, that feels better.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nWell, tomorrow I begin another mat dash to finish homework in class,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:38.000\nso I'll better get some ugly sleep.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nInstead of beauty sleep.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:43.000\nOh, I get it. I get it. I get it.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nAll right.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nCool music.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nThis is the point where I started to go,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nthis is fucked up.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:53.000\nLike, this is really fucked up.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nAnd I don't know what to say to mitigate that before reading this.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:01.000\nI don't know what to do to protect myself from your judgment reading this\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nbecause as I was explaining to Aaron,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:07.000\nI don't know enough differences between me and this person\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nexcept that this person bothered to write this down.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:15.000\nAnd like, I mean, I know that this person is lying to himself,\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:18.000\nbut I don't, me saying that is not enough.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:22.000\nThis is a...\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:28.000\nTuesday, January 23rd, 1990, 11.14 p.m.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nI will probably never forget tonight for two reasons,\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\none big, one small.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nThe small reason is that I lost my virginity\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:44.000\nin the back of my mother's 83 firebird.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:48.000\nThe big reason is that I realized what a complete scumbag I am.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:51.000\nI am the worst shade of evil you can get.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:58.000\nTonight, I played the role of the heroic super stud to the last line.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nAnd boy, did I do good.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nI said, get your hands off of her.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:07.000\nWhat a macho one I was.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nI'm referring to this story that I've told\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nat least in another podcast, if not this one,\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nwhere the girl I lost my virginity to,\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nI met her online and I went to her place\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nand for a couple dates, I went to her place and we made out.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:23.000\nThen her crazy mom came home, started yelling at her\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nabout a new kids on the block fan club check\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nthat she had taped together after being disposed of\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nas punishment for not doing her chores.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nShe was 21 and had a kid.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nIt was really the new kids on the block.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nHer mom pulled a steak knife out of a drawer\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nand started yelling, drunk,\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:43.000\nand I stepped in between this girl's mom and her\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:48.000\nwith my acrylic sweater and my little rat tail and my zits\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:52.000\nand said, leave her alone.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:57.000\nAnd so afterward, we went under the home bridge\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nin Milwaukee and we had sex in the back of my mom's car.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nSo I'm coming home from that, I think,\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nand really feeling my oats.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nFeeling your oats?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nDoes that know what you do?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nYou sell them?\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nBefore you sell them, you kind of run over\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nand you threw your fingers a little bit.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:28.000\nIf you love oats, I love mine at 16.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nWhat a macho one I was.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nAnd it all worked.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:37.000\nI was partly responsible for patching up a family tonight.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:42.000\nPeople were happy and safe because of Dan Harmon.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:45.000\nAnd hey, I even got the ultimate prize.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:49.000\nI fucked her in the freezing cold weather in a cramped car.\n\n21:49.000 --> 22:02.000\nShe came twice.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:05.000\nHere's the punchline.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:09.000\nI don't give a shit about any of them.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nI'm not even going to write her name on papers.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nSo if my parents read this,\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:18.000\nI can pretend it was someone respectable.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nI don't even know what that means.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nAm I in a yacht club?\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\nWhy am I talking like Andrew McCarthy\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nand why I was lower middle class?\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nShe lived on the yacht.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nHer name was Tammy.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nShe existed.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nThat sounds a lot like she didn't exist,\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\nbut I have no reason to perpetuate that.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nShe existed.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:45.000\nShe might still exist.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nEverything I did tonight\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nthat made it look like I cared for her\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nwas some realistic charade\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nfrom my mother's soap operas.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nSome half-assed reflex,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nsomething in me that needed to play life just like on TV.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nOh, did I say half-assed?\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nNo way.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nIt was perfect.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nAll the while, in my mind,\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nI was up at comedy sports again,\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nstrutting my stuff on the astroturf stage.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:14.000\nTo the delight of the rabid audience\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:19.000\nthat demanded to see the new game called Romance.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:30.000\nStrutting your stuff on the astroturf.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:34.000\nGod knows I don't give a shit about anyone but me.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:37.000\nAnd then I drew a stick figure\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:42.000\nthat is, I know, is Maxwell Artfall\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nbecause he has a bandana around his head.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.000\nThere are three stick figure women\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nflocking towards him.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:53.000\nHe's brandishing a little stick figure sword\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:56.000\nand I labeled it sword of charm.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nAnd he's holding a rope\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.000\nabout to swing away like Errol Flynn\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:07.000\nand it says a rope of apathy.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nSome 16-year-olds don't know how to take\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:19.000\nI'll let you fuck me for the compliment it is.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nTuesday, February 13th,\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nthis is a little less than a month later.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.000\nAll's well that never ends.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:32.000\nOh, he's good.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:36.000\nTammy was taken away to a mental hospital.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nReal good.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:59.000\nHe fucked the brains out of her.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:12.000\nTammy was taken away to a mental home.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:16.000\nAttempted suicide is illegal, you see.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nQuite the opposite, Jeff.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nAfter I went to the pits of despair.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:24.000\nI wish I had another song queued up for that one.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:29.000\nI guess I didn't have to deal with her after all.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nMy hero.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nAfter I got off the phone with her\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nwhen I realized she was a manic depressive schizophrenic\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nwho thought she was a Satanist.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nShe did think she was a Satanist, that's the true story.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nI felt bad about not giving a shit about her.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nSo I wrote this eulogy\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\nand it says Tammy by Dan Harmon, filled in later.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:52.000\nAnd it's blank.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nShow me?\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nMan.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:59.000\nLike I'll do it later.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:02.000\nWhy don't you do it now?\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nWhy don't you eulogize her now?\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nRoses are red, violets are blue.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:11.000\nTammy, I'm so sorry I put my wiener anywhere near you.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:15.000\nTry to buck up wherever you are and I also apologize\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:19.000\nfor the size of my mom's car.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:23.000\nAnd just as the poem suggests, she's dead to me now.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nI mean, you know what I'm doing.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:30.000\nI'm like a 60-year-old nerd who actually got laid\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nand I can't deal with the idea.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:36.000\nLike the only person that would let me do it\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nwas this person I met online\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:41.000\nand she was kind of, you know, she was mentally unstable\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nand she did...\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nI don't even know exactly what I'm doing.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nI just know I'm coping with something,\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nsome energy larger than myself,\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:52.000\nby being a woman-hating, like, pompous asshole,\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nlike an acting like, well, whatever.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nAnd I just really...\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nThe uncomfortable thing is I just really...\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nThis is me.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nIt's not like Aaron said, so what?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nYou haven't atoned enough with the fact\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nthat this is your 16-year-old self, that you're not...\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nLike, why is it embarrassing if it's not you anymore?\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nAnd I'm like, it's not that it's me.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nI mean, it's been a million years,\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nbut it's just too uncomfortable seeing\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:21.000\nthe kind of core of your personality\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nlaid out by someone who doesn't know\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:26.000\nhow to dress it up right yet.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nHe knows how to dress it up,\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.000\nbut his dress is a special dress\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nthat belies the really gross shit underneath.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.000\nI'm sure he could come up with a much better metaphor\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:41.000\nfor what I'm trying to say.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nI'm not just getting the same things out of life\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nas everyone else.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nIt's another entry later.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nI'm only talking to myself on this paper,\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nso I'll just be honest.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nLook at everybody else.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nThey are so weird.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nThe way they talk, the way they write,\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nthe way they think, they're not like me at all.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nThe only similarities I have with these people\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nare the things I've picked up,\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nacquired as habit like a foreigner in America.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nI need a CAT scan.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:08.000\nMaybe I have a tumor.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nWhat the fuck happened to me?\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nYou notice I'm not talking like Frasier anymore.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nIt was like I needed that first orgasm\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:17.000\nto get out the Shakespeare thing.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nI am like the perfect person.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:24.000\nEverything goes swell for me.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nI have so much to be thankful for.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nMaybe the problem is I don't know who to thank.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nI remember I had a saying when I was around 12 or 13\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nthat used to amuse people.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nI'd say, thanks something.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nOne would think it was a malicious taunt,\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:39.000\na way of flaunting my then-fledgling agnosticism toward God.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nBut it wasn't.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nIt was a genuine plea, an honest praise,\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:45.000\na desperate attempt by me to show my appreciation\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nto whoever was in charge\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nwithout offending anyone by using the wrong name.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nAnd I don't mean anyone down here.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nNothing has changed.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nI'm so confused.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nI'm so confused.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nThere is nothing to latch onto.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nIt's like an equation in algebra with no numbers,\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\njust variables.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nYou'll never solve it.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nNever!\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nAnd don't think that admitting my confusion is therapeutic\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nbecause it doesn't do a thing for me.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nShould I be depressed, happy, introverted,\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:15.000\nviolent, observant, ambidextrous, funny,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:18.000\nyoung, prepared, afraid, apathetic?\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:19.000\nThere's no one to ask.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.000\nThere never was.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nNever will be anyone like me on this planet.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nAnd who cares if there was?\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nThe blind leading the blind.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nNo one knows, no one understands\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:33.000\nthe simultaneous pain and pleasure I live with.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nConstantly on the brink of the insanity\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nI swam in when I was younger,\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nsomewhere between seventh and eighth grade.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nWere you a cutter?\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:45.000\nNo, I was a visser.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nWho needs to cut themselves\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:50.000\nwhen they can do this kind of damage on paper?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nAlways finding a new excuse to postpone thought\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:53.000\nlest I go bonkers.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:54.000\nIs that nuts?\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:57.000\nI'm allergic to my own mind.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nI am so confused.\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\nI am so confused.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nWhat will become of me?\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:03.000\nEveryone else has this determined look on their face.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nThis purpose in life.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nWhat do I have?\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nWhat will I ever get?\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nWhere the fuck am I?\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nWho am I?\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:11.000\nAnd how did I end up in the body of a 17-year-old?\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nHelp.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:25.000\nJune 20th, 1990.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nHaven't written in a while.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nI think I'm going to write a short story\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nloosely based on my recent experiences\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nin life and love.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nI'll call it...\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:45.000\nTwinkies of Inferno.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nThat's been our show.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:49.000\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:54.000\nThat's not the whole title.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:57.000\nThere's a colon and then there's more.\n\n30:57.000 --> 31:04.000\nTwinkies of Inferno, The Adventures of Dapper Dan.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:08.000\nSpeaking of love, I think I am in love,\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nbut she hardly knows me.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nSurprise.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nAnd she's going to college in September.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:17.000\nShe is beautiful, intelligent, witty.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nHere's the best part.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nShe only laughs at my really good jokes.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:24.000\nAnd when she does, she lights up the whole room.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:27.000\nI'd better put her name down for future reference.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nAnd I do.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:31.000\nShe put her full name and then I put her address\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nand her phone number.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nSo future historians can track her down.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:41.000\nI go, what was it like to be loved by Maxwell Artfall?\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:44.000\nI'll never forgive myself when she's gone.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nNever.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:50.000\nTime for a poetry break, I say.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nAnd then I write a poem.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nI don't think that song will work\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nwith the meter of this poem.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:03.000\nWhat do you want?\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nWhat are you feeling?\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nIt's kind of staccato.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nWe'll do it a cappella.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:12.000\nYeah.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nThere's not a place that you can go.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nThere's no one here you need to know.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:17.000\nThere's not a thing.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:21.000\nDo you have anything by Dr. Seuss?\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nIt occurs to me.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nSomeone had some inspiration here.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:28.000\nI will not fuck you in a car.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:33.000\nUpbeat, downbeat, what are you like?\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nNo, no, no, really.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nI'm trying to make it work with whatever you pick.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:40.000\nIt'll be more of a, it'll be, this is a barrel through it\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:41.000\nlike a Dr. Seuss poem.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nThere's not a place that you can go.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nThere's no one here you need to know.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nThere's not a thing that you can be.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nThere's no such thing as symmetry.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nThere is no balance right or wrong.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nThere are no words.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:52.000\nThere is no song.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nThere is no pleasure without pain.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:57.000\nThere is no sunshine while it rains.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nThere's not a deed that you can do.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:00.000\nThere's no one else.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\nThere's only you.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.000\nYou're on your own.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.000\nDo what you will.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nYou'll die when you have had your fill.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:05.000\nYou'll die.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nYou'll die.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nAnd then you'll see.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nWe'll share the answers.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nYou and me.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nWhen you were not, I split you up.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nAnd now you seek to interrupt.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.000\nGo back.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nGo back and tend your own.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:17.000\nYou'll die.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nYou'll die.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nYou're not alone.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nI think that's God writing that to people.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:30.000\nThere's two final entries.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nI might as well complete the story.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nAnd then we'll bring up Spencer.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nI mean, this has been a full thing.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.000\nYou've watched this.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nYou don't have to sarcastically.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:43.000\nI hope that was applause for Spencer and not sarcastic applause for the ending of me reading\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nmy pretentious journal.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nThey're one of the same.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nBut you know what?\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nThis guy wouldn't care what you think.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:54.000\nObviously.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:58.000\nAre you strangling this audience with a rope of apathy right now?\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:06.000\nI use the rope to get away from the women who are drawn in by my sort of charm job.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:12.000\nWhat?\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:15.000\nSecond to last entry.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:19.000\nAugust 1st, 1990, 1251 AM.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:22.000\nI think that indicates that I've started drinking.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nI think I'm coming home later.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:27.000\nI ran into some old friends tonight.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:33.000\nI was at a stoplight in my 83 Firebird when a car pulled up next to me.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nI noticed it contained,\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:41.000\nShanard Dern, Dave Harrison, Mike Musgrove.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:44.000\nI rolled down my car window and said hello.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:49.000\nStrangely enough, the first words out of Mike's mouth were smooth grip lube tube.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nWhat?\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:55.000\nI then remembered that two years ago I had used that term in a speech on birth control\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:58.000\nto our oral communications class.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nMike and Dave were in that class.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nThey were seniors and I was a sophomore.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:07.000\nNow I was a senior sitting next to them once again at a red light.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nThey were drunk.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:14.000\nThe conversation was slacking, so I mentioned the fact that Andy Luciano,\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:17.000\nthe sports guy on TV6 News, was at White Hen Pantry.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nI said he looked like Don Ho.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:25.000\nI added that his wife was a Don Ho herself.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:35.000\nA gosh Don Ho.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:42.000\nAndy doesn't really look like Don Ho.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:51.000\nAndy looks Hawaiian and the only Hawaiian I know is Ho.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:55.000\nObviously a little tipsy going into the journal that night, I think, feeling a little...\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:58.000\nAll right, final entry.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:03.000\nSunday, September 30th, 1990, 11.04.04 p.m.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:06.000\nA lot has happened as of late.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nI will not bother to dwell.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:11.000\nAs of late.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:14.000\nI have become senior class vice president.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:19.000\nThe class of 91 has failed in their last chance to win homecoming week.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:24.000\nWe are truly the victims of an administrative conspiracy.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:28.000\nMy experiences continue to push me up the ladder towards self-actualization,\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:32.000\nspiritual unity with thought and body and deed.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:38.000\nAs I progress, I begin to realize that the top rung is connected to the goddamn bottom rung.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:45.000\nSo it's not so much climbing to the top as it is learning to deal with this round ladder.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:48.000\nStory circle.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nThe birth of a model.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:54.000\nThis journal seems so incomplete with all its gaps and ambiguities.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:57.000\nOh, there's enough, buddy.\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:00.000\nBut I sense that this is it for this journal.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:09.000\nI just had a funny feeling that maybe I'm speaking over a decade or more to my future self.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:14.000\nAnd my wife and kids.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nOops.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:21.000\nDan, old Dan.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.000\nTake a walk once in a while.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:31.000\nI may be young, but I do not lack in wisdom.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:39.000\nIf I don't say so myself.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:44.000\nI don't know when to tell you this, but at this point I was reading this in the green room and I started crying.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:47.000\nErin was watching me read and she's like, what is happening? What's going on?\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:52.000\nBecause she saw how upset I was with the previous entries and I'm like reading this and crying and kind of smiling a little.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:55.000\nAnd she's like, what is it? What is it?\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nAnd I'm like, I finished reading it and then I started crying.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nI'm not crying because it's good.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:06.000\nI'm just crying because my 17-year-old self landed the perfect closer to a segment.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:11.000\nI can't believe this kid did something right.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:16.000\nPerhaps you have turned to this book in a moment of need.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:20.000\nIt's true, I had no bits.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:27.000\nSo try to remember the spark that we share and listen to me when I say that you should hang on.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:31.000\nI wonder who the chick in your life is.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nIs she pretty?\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:40.000\nI know you don't care, but I'm 17.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:47.000\nI know you've loosened your stance.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:51.000\nYou must love her. It must be awesome.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:58.000\nYou two probably fight a little, but I'll bet she's the type that knows how to handle your little mind tricks.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nYou know what I hope?\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:06.000\nI hope some rainy night you two have a fight and she kicks you out of the house or you storm out,\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:16.000\ntake a walk or a ride in your Corvette.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:20.000\nNow I'm crying.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:25.000\nAnd she finds this notebook on the coffee table, open to this page,\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:30.000\nand she reads it and realizes that you really are capable of love.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:33.000\nYou don't show it sometimes.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:42.000\nAnd I hope you really did name your child Max.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.000\nBecause you're both Woody Allen fans.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:49.000\nAnd I hope that he or she is what you always dreamed of.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:54.000\nAnd I hope someday here she achieves what it seems you were not born to do.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:59.000\nWhatever and wherever they are, give my love to your loved ones.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:03.000\nAnd try to realize that your parents, if alive, feel the same way\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:10.000\nand would love a call from you on the visa phone.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:14.000\nWhich now exists.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:20.000\nWith that I leave this, the last entry in the first volume of my journals.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:23.000\nIt would have been nice if it would have been a whole year long,\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:26.000\nbut only the calendar runs on 12 month cycles.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:30.000\nPeople do not.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:33.000\nThe sun sets once again on this crazy beach.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:36.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:41.000\nThe people continue to construct their strange shapes in the sand.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:55.000\nWhile the tide rolls in and out.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nSpencer, come up.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nIf you will.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:03.000\nSpencer Crittenden, our DM.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:11.000\nThe positive word for it is catharsis, the bad word would be absolute draining,\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nlike just crippling sadness.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:19.000\nFrom 15 to 17, I think we would all be embarrassed by anything we did.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:23.000\nIt's pretty embarrassing because you really stuck the landing on it.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:27.000\nYou really did it with a big flourish at the end.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nYou John Hancocked it.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:35.000\nAnd also you asked your older self to enjoy it.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:39.000\nAnd also to appreciate your youthful wisdom.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:42.000\nThat's narcissistic.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:45.000\nI may be young, but I still have some wisdom to offer.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:48.000\nI'm a Spartan, you old man.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:51.000\nIt's like Looper.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:56.000\nI hope he kills himself as he keeps fake threatening too in all his dramatic journal entries.\n\n41:56.000 --> 42:04.000\nThere's that sweatiness of adolescence that kind of stinks up the joint.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:07.000\nBut still, you're still a pretty good writer back then.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nIt's a little frasiery at points.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:14.000\nThere's a lot of like, you could lose the wildest things like that.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:18.000\nYou notice the wildest went away kind of as the sexuality emerged.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:23.000\nThere was still some left over, but there was a lot of like, it's like sort of a stereotype.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:31.000\nThere was a lot of like, I was like Shakespeare, but bad, until like a girl let me touch her boobies.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nYeah, and then you were a carawak baby.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:37.000\nYeah, yeah, then I turned into a bad carawak.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:41.000\nThere's a threshold, I don't know if anyone's ever read it, Ask the Dust.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nYou become John Fonte in there for a moment,\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:48.000\nand then that's the threshold into becoming an actualized writer.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:49.000\nYeah.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:52.000\nSorry, John Fonte, I love you.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:57.000\nAnyways, so let's see, should we plunge right into T&D?\n\n42:57.000 --> 43:02.000\nProbably, right? Yeah, it's already nine o'clock, so.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nShould we grab our character sheets?\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:05.000\nYeah, do you want me to give them?\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:12.000\nThis is the character sheet distribution music.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:22.000\nThe character sheets, fluttering across the stage like so many pieces of densely written upon paper.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:30.000\nSpencer, if you will, Dungeon Master to the Stars, bring us up to date if you would.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:38.000\nIn the last adventure, our heroes, guided by the barbarian, Karen Broadleath, finally arrived at Yellowwood.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:42.000\nThe first of three Buttsalot encampments. Noticing something amiss,\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:47.000\nthe gang came to discover that the Buttsalot tribe had formed an uneasy alliance with Ashtale\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:52.000\nand his Blackpaw Knowles in a bid to gain control of the entire Butz Peninsula.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:57.000\nSharpie single-handedly sought out his father, only to find that he was in Blue Camp,\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:00.000\ngathering with advisors to discuss the door's possible surrender.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:04.000\nBut when the gang got to Blue Camp, they were told barbarian lord left for Red Camp,\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nthe gathering place of warriors.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:13.000\nEventually, Sharpie met with an old rival, Dead Eye Duncan, who revealed that the lord snuck away from Red Camp last night\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:17.000\nwith a retinue of elite warriors from the tribe. But where were they headed?\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:21.000\nI was pretty in the bag by then, I think. I think that might have been during a blackout.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:22.000\nDead Eye Duncan?\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nYeah. Dead Eye Duncan.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:25.000\nAn old rival.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nOh, I think I know, I remember.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.000\nYou met him?\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:33.000\nSo he said that my dad left with a retinue of Knowles or barbarians?\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nOf elite barbarian warriors.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nAnd they headed where?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:42.000\nWho knows? It was presumably a secret mission of sorts.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:48.000\nYou're standing in the middle of Red Camp, a few barbarians stand staring and muttering to one another.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nYou're saying he told no one where he went?\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:51.000\nYeah.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:56.000\nAnd he left in the dead of night, the most mysterious part of night.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:59.000\nYou know, Quark?\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nYeah.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:03.000\nI'm no wizard at this.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:06.000\nBut I am a wizard.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:15.000\nAnd I think we need a tracker, an experienced ranger of sorts.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:16.000\nYeah?\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:19.000\nWhat about that weird homophobic chick that you didn't like?\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:22.000\nOh my God, I thought you'd never ask.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:26.000\nDo we have a 20 on Mulraine Sedona?\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nDo you have a 20, like a location?\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.000\nYeah.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nWhat's your 20?\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nA little buddy.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:38.000\nYou look around and standing, leaning against a post in a very cool manner.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nStands Mulraine Sedona.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nYou mean she was following us the whole time?\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nYeah.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nShe's a tracker.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nThat's why we need her right now.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:50.000\nI saunter over to her.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:59.000\nSauntering Cooley, you approach the half-elf, half-human.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:07.000\nRole-player Erin McGathy.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:10.000\nReprising her role is Mulraine Sedona.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:14.000\nAnd in soap operas, when I was a kid, my mom used to watch Guiding Light.\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nAnd in soap operas, I don't know if they still do this,\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:19.000\nbut because they shoot one every day, and so you can't avoid,\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nlike sometimes a main character gets really sick.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:22.000\nYeah.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:23.000\nAnd they have no choice.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nSo they very often, like a guy will go,\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:29.000\nlike, well, where's Clifford? And then, like, this guy that you've been watching for 25 years\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:32.000\nas Clifford comes in, but it's a totally different guy wearing the same sweater.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nAnd then this voiceover would just come in and go,\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:38.000\nthe part of Clifford Johnson will be played by Daniel Piloff.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nAnd they would just move right along.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nIt was the coolest thing in the world.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:47.000\nDaniel Piloff was a goodie, though.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:50.000\nHello.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nMulraine.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:53.000\nSorry.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nI forgot that you were with us,\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:59.000\nor that you disappeared the last chapter of our campaign.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nWe were good.\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:02.000\nWe had a good time.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nIt's quite all right. I was on a different adventure.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nReally? You have different ones?\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nTell us about it. What happened?\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:11.000\nWell, I joined a different campaign.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:12.000\nYeah.\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nWhat were their names?\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:18.000\nTheir names were Surrey Cruz,\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:22.000\nand Jemima Syrupsalot.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:26.000\nAnd there were legs covered in eyes.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nThere, too.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nAnd there's a lake of fire.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nAre you lying to us right now?\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nYes.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:34.000\nMaking up names.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nYou just followed us and fell on.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:39.000\nYou just been tagging along like a stray dog.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nI've been in the branches.\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:44.000\nAdventure.\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:50.000\nWell, look, as fate would have it, we have a use for you.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:54.000\nChris, you fate.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nMy dad's missing.\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nHe didn't tell anybody where he went.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nHe left in the worst part of the night.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:03.000\nThe dead of night.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nI don't know how tracking works.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nI don't know if you need to find a broken branch.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:10.000\nI bet Mulray and Sedona knows exactly how tracking works.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nI do.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:15.000\nI use these skills.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nDescribe them briefly.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:28.000\nI regard the forest for signs of Buttsalot's father.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:33.000\nBut you were in an encampment in the plains and rolling hills.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:34.000\nI was.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nI'm such a liar.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:39.000\nI use my sense of smell.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:42.000\nBut now I'm present, right?\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:43.000\nYou are present.\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:44.000\nThat's true.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nShe's good.\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:47.000\nYou attract your own presence.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:51.000\nI look to the ground.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:58.000\nUsing your keen sense of smell, you detect the distinct aroma of Buttsalot warriors.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nThere are butts this way.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nAll right, well, lead the way.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:04.000\nI lead the way.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nThey lead out the door.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:09.000\nThe smells do.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:12.000\nLet's follow these smells.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nI open the door.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:17.000\nBecause I'm a gentleman.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nThank you.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:22.000\nYour token is accepted gratefully.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:27.000\nWell, you wouldn't notice that.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:28.000\nI did.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:31.000\nYou did, but these guys are pretty quiet about it.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:35.000\nMy journal has turned everyone into a petty 15-year-old.\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:40.000\nA sad, existential, self-involved mutterer.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:47.000\nHey, why are you talking? Was wit necessary or unavoidable?\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:48.000\nUnavoidable.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:49.000\nUnavoidable.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:50.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:56.000\nI didn't detect unavoidable wit.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nHoisted by your own petard, Sharpie.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:01.000\nYeah.\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:05.000\nWe're going to take a quick break from the D&D game.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:08.000\nBecause I cast a pallor over the evening with my journals.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:13.000\nRaise your hand if you were my biggest fan in the world.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:22.000\nSecond to Adam, who thinks maybe, really, you have a super claim.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nYou really, really adored me.\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:30.000\nYou felt like I was really a magnificent human being.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nAnd now they don't?\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:35.000\nI wanted to ask him if it changed because of the journals.\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:36.000\nIt was great.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nThanks, girlfriend.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nI like you more after your journal.\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:40.000\nOkay.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:41.000\nAll right.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:42.000\nHey, Seuss, right?\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:43.000\nYeah.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:44.000\nAll right.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:45.000\nHey, Seuss says you like me more.\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\nSorry, I had to know.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:47.000\nI'll edit it out.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:48.000\nJust concerned.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:49.000\nI liked you more.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:50.000\nOkay.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nNow everyone likes me less because I care.\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:53.000\nI don't know.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:54.000\nYeah.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nI told you I'm the same guy.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:57.000\nI care what people think.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nYou really are the same guy.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nWe don't change, as Tolstoy said.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nIdentity doesn't only change that much.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:08.000\nI still think women that have sex with me are bad people.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nAnd they all go insane afterwards.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:15.000\nMy goodness, we don't have sex.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:16.000\nI'm too busy journaling.\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:19.000\nHey, guys, we're having sex right now.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:20.000\nAll right.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:21.000\nFor what?\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:22.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nI'm totally kidding.\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:27.000\nYou're doing it wrong.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:31.000\nPressing play on this Spencer DVR.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nYou step out of red camp.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:36.000\nYou are an outside of red camp.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:37.000\nNow.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nIt is evening.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:44.000\nYou can't see far in the rolling hills.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:47.000\nStill got a track on those smells.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:52.000\nYou lose track of the smells.\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:53.000\nOh, shit.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nThat track, all it did was get us out.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nI examine the ground.\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:00.000\nYou examine the ground and see several pairs of tracks.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nIt looks like they've been attempted to be covered up.\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:06.000\nBut your keen eyes see through the illusion.\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:12.000\nI suggest that we follow the tracks that are most Buttsalot-like..\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:15.000\nYou suggest successfully.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nLet's follow these.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:18.000\nAll right.\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nWe have torches.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:21.000\nYeah.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nWe better light them up, gentlemen.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nLighting your torches.\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:29.000\nYou shed light on the path.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:32.000\nIt's just to keep, you know, like...\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.000\nThe Spencer suddenly hate this?\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:38.000\nI'm so awkward, you guys.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nNot true.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nLet's follow the footprints.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nI created a vortex of raw emotion.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nSpencer's not immune.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nWe're all feeling very adolescent.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:51.000\nI just come here to hate myself every week.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:56.000\nLike a sand dune shaped by the malevolent monotony.\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:59.000\nAs many shapes as I intend to create on this sand.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:04.000\nI know the tide will nexerably come.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nOh, my God.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:09.000\nI was 15 too, you guys.\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:17.000\nI wish I could have found you and had you do punch-up on my journal.\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:18.000\nWhat was the character?\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:21.000\nThe guy with the bandana was Maxwell Artfall.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:24.000\nWe got to meet that guy along his campaign at some point.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:27.000\nSpencer, can we draw that character up at some point?\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nYou know, he might have met us tragically.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:34.000\nI believe I heard he drowned in pussy.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nIt was, you know, it was terrible.\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nHis rope of apathy could not get him.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:41.000\nIt's only so long.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:46.000\nHis sort of charm couldn't strike enough pussy off.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:52.000\nI heard he drove away in a corvette.\n\n53:52.000 --> 54:02.000\nThe new 2050 Corvette with Bizaphone.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:05.000\nI examine our surroundings about it, Spencer.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:09.000\nYou fail to see the footprints that Mulraine Sedona has noticed with your key.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nAre we following the footprints?\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:15.000\nLet's follow those crudely covered up footprints.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nThrowing caution to the winds.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:18.000\nYou follow the footprints.\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nThey head south.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nEast, west.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:23.000\nThere we go. South, west.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nWhat's happening tonight, Spencer?\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nI'm just sick.\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nI'm going to say that every day will be awesome.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nYou were sick last week, you said.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nI know. That's my thing now.\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:34.000\nAre you in love?\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:38.000\nDid you eat some bad dice?\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:41.000\nHave you been licking your dice again?\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:48.000\nDid you roll a number two earlier?\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:52.000\nI did roll a number two.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nIt's a nice joke.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:58.000\nAnd a poop joke.\n\n54:58.000 --> 54:59.000\nSorry, Spencer.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nWe are concerned about your health.\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:04.000\nSpencer, is it an actual ailment?\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:13.000\nI think I just have terrible anxiety crossed with steadily poisoning my body with processed and fast foods.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:17.000\nIt just combines to make me feel terrible all the time.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:23.000\nI know. I'm really good at faking.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nYou're like a plus 15 at faking, aren't you?\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nYeah.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:28.000\nSorry, Spencer.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nI'm looking at my character sheet.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:36.000\nI noticed that you said that I'm 111 pounds and I've never been happier.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nI said I'm 111 pounds.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:39.000\nYeah, but you're a dude.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nYeah, I think six pounds of that is penis.\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:44.000\nYeah, even lighter.\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nAnyway, we follow the tracks.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:54.000\nFollowing the tracks to the southeast, you make very little progress.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:57.000\nYou track about a mile and a half before losing the trail.\n\n55:57.000 --> 56:02.000\nIt seems like it either veers to the southeast or the southwest, but you're not sure which.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:05.000\nThe southeast, you can see mountains in the distance.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nThe southwest, you can't make much out.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:08.000\nShit.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nLet's go towards the mountains, you guys.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:11.000\nRight?\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:12.000\nOf course.\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nCome on.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:17.000\nWell, he's going to meet with dwarves, right?\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:18.000\nYes.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:21.000\nAnd dwarves like being taller.\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nThey'll do anything to...\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nThey're going to be in the mountains.\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:26.000\nActing all tall.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nI was going to say, I think they live in mountains.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:29.000\nDid they?\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:30.000\nWell, probably.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nI mean, Lord of the Rings much.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:35.000\nAnachronism as much?\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nWell, I mean, I'm speaking as...\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:38.000\nOkay.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nLet's go to the mountains.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:41.000\nLet's head towards the mountains.\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:42.000\nThe mountains.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nYou hike for what seems like hours.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:49.000\nHey, Sharpie, you know, we've got a lot of downtime on this hike toward the mountains.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:50.000\nLet's do a walk and talk.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:53.000\nDo you want to make a journal entry while we're on the way?\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nCurse of the Earth.\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:58.000\nIt mocks my footsteps.\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:02.000\nI'm so perfect.\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:09.000\nI wish I could find a woman who only laughs when I'm really funny.\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:12.000\nThen I would give her my penis.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:18.000\nShe would love it, for I am seventeen.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nNice.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nWeird.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:25.000\nBut nice.\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:26.000\nBe comforted.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:27.000\nSorry.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:30.000\nTake it back.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nHow long until we need to camp?\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:33.000\nIt's nighttime.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:36.000\nYou've been walking for a good five or six hours in the evening.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nI mean, you could make camp or you could press on.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:43.000\nYou don't know where these tracks lead, so there's not really a good timing to it.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.000\nI think let's take a little break and let's play a game.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:49.000\nLike a board game or a word game or something like that.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nSure, that's a great idea.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:52.000\nYeah?\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nI mean, does anybody know any games we could play?\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nWell, what about like a role-playing game?\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:57.000\nRole-playing?\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:58.000\nAll right.\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:02.000\nWhat's that one where technology meets magic?\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nShadow Run.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:07.000\nCan I be Jim Nightblade?\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:11.000\nI don't see how this is constructed.\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:15.000\nA little too close to home there, Sharpie.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:22.000\nIt's very clever and very expressive, but ultimately I think it's going to get like a 1.7 and a Thursday at best.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:26.000\nI fear for its future.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nI think it should just...\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nWhat's the worst thing that would happen?\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nI'm going to fire you off the show?\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:36.000\nNot this one.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:37.000\nNot this one.\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:38.000\nThis is Harmontown.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:39.000\nI created this.\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:43.000\nYou created Sarah Silverman and Community too.\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:49.000\nYeah, but this time I put Harmon right in the title.\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:53.000\nLike there's no way.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:57.000\nWhat if we pretended we were a family?\n\n58:57.000 --> 59:01.000\nI know I'm a man, but what if I was the mommy?\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nBut what if you were the daddy?\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:06.000\nWhat if you were the uncle?\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:10.000\nI probably would go into a berserk rage.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:13.000\nIt might actually help me to get through some of these issues.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nI'm feeling really like ineffective right now.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nI'm trying to track my dad.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:20.000\nI left him in the first place because I didn't feel like I was enough of a man.\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nNow I can't even find the guy.\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:23.000\nDo you have any stories about your dad?\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:24.000\nYou can tell us where we're camped at.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:32.000\nHey, he hit me with a magic belt.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:35.000\nWhat sort of magic was it?\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:43.000\nIt was a plus three against asses.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nOh, sweetheart.\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:48.000\nThanks, Mulraine.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nBut it's not sensitivity that I need.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nIt's to give my shit together.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:53.000\nShit, shit, shit.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nI'm such a fuck up.\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:59.000\nNo, too hard on yourself.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nThere's got to be a better way to track them than just conventional means.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nWandering in random directions, looking for smells.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nThis is my dad.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nI use...\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nIf you've tried enough, you've helped enough.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nBut I must have something better than this.\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nThe father-son bond is what will lead me to him.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nI take my mage dagger and I make a tiny, painless cut on my hand.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI haven't had a dream in a long time.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nI hold my fist out by the torchlight and I squeeze a little drop of blood onto the dirt of my feet.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nAnd I say...\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nAyaaaahhhhhh...\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nWell, divination isn't your strong suit, but you do get the sense that he's to the southeast.\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nI said that.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nHe's by the mountains, you guys, to the southwest.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nWhat?\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.480\nThe mountains are to the southwest.\n\n01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:19.120\nSo I avoided getting lost with my hand cutting and fake Arabic Jewish stuff.\n\n01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120\nAssuming you were right.\n\n01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120\nWhat time of day is it Spencer?\n\n01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.120\nIt is evening.\n\n01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.320\nIt's like early, like 2, 4 a.m.\n\n01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.000\nWe use our torches and we go to the southeast.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.400\nI say extinguish the torches and travel out of the cover of night, safer to travel without\n\n01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400\nlights at night, right?\n\n01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.960\nLook, I'm a barbarian gnome.\n\n01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.080\nYou are incredibly convincing in your arguments.\n\n01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.240\nThe others are one over to your side immediately.\n\n01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.240\nAlright.\n\n01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.560\nWe extinguish our torches.\n\n01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.560\nExtinguishing your torches.\n\n01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:58.160\nYou stumble around in the dark, slowly but surely you head to the southeast before the\n\n01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.160\nbreak of dawn.\n\n01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:09.400\nI examine our surroundings now.\n\n01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.840\nYou see off in the distance smoke rising as if from some sort of encampment or small\n\n01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840\nvillage.\n\n01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840\nSharpie?\n\n01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840\nI say we hide.\n\n01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840\nLet's head towards the encampment.\n\n01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840\nLook man, I was going through your journal last night while you were sleeping.\n\n01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.840\nDon't read it.\n\n01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:31.760\nYou left them out, man.\n\n01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.840\nYou're going to find out how smart I am.\n\n01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.480\nYou talk a lot of trash when you're a 16-year-old, man.\n\n01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.840\nWell, I went through some shit.\n\n01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.040\nNo one ever understood me.\n\n01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.440\nMy roots punctured the earth but never drank freely.\n\n01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440\nI know, Sharpie.\n\n01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.920\nThere was a passage that really moved me when you talked to your current self and you got\n\n01:02:52.920 --> 01:03:00.480\nto date exactly right and you wished that you would start acting like an adult.\n\n01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.840\nYou assumed that you already would be and here you are just hiding in a bush for the\n\n01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.560\nrest of your life.\n\n01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:14.560\nThe 15-year-old hid in that journal and got hit by a magic bell.\n\n01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.920\nHe got hit by a magic bell.\n\n01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.040\nLet's let that spell loose.\n\n01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.560\nAll right, you're right.\n\n01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:30.080\nYou could cut the tension with a knife or a stick or anything with a finger.\n\n01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.720\nYou know what?\n\n01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.120\nAll that having been said, I think we head toward the encampment.\n\n01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.880\nTriumphantly, you raise yourself from the bushes.\n\n01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.800\nThey enjoy progress.\n\n01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.920\nI feel like hitting play more than pause.\n\n01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.280\nI just meant we're left-wingers.\n\n01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.920\nWe run to be encampment.\n\n01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.680\nRunning to the encampment, you detect the unmistakable aroma of noll hide.\n\n01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.840\nWe smell it.\n\n01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.840\nYou smell it.\n\n01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.280\nI smell it.\n\n01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.360\nI love it.\n\n01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.360\nNulls are bad.\n\n01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.360\nI just love smelling things.\n\n01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:22.360\nAll right, I think this session of D&D has been bringing Adam Goldberg up on stage of\n\n01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360\nD&D sessions.\n\n01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.360\nI think we had a no-window.\n\n01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.760\nYou mean exciting and illuminating?\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:40.880\nWhich you probably set up camp and pause it and not do anything.\n\n01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.800\nYou don't have to camp before you pause.\n\n01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.440\nYou could pause before action.\n\n01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.840\nIt's like a cliffhanger.\n\n01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:52.480\nI start to jump up into the air, freeze frame, a Toyota commercial frame.\n\n01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.960\nIs it like a drop bridge?\n\n01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.480\nI can start charging across.\n\n01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.960\nDid I do it bad?\n\n01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.360\nIt's not you, narcissist.\n\n01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360\nIt's me.\n\n01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360\nIt's not you.\n\n01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360\nIt's me.\n\n01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.360\nIt's me.\n\n01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360\nNo, it's not you.\n\n01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360\nIt's not me.\n\n01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360\nNot everything's you.\n\n01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360\nThe only person who's not blaming himself is Jeff.\n\n01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.360\nReally, I think it's him.\n\n01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:15.360\nI don't know what he did wrong, but maybe he wasn't supportive enough of my journal.\n\n01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360\nI love your journal.\n\n01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360\nI've been very supportive of you.\n\n01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.360\nI think it's these guys with the matching jackets on the front.\n\n01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360\nDon't throw the audience at them.\n\n01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360\nThey're not matching.\n\n01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360\nThey're just brown.\n\n01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360\nOne's leather.\n\n01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.360\nOne's like a kind of a Nailani kind of canvas business.\n\n01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.360\nThey look great.\n\n01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:36.360\nYeah, I see a CPS jacket and the other guy's got like a Nagahide thing going on.\n\n01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360\nI was just kidding.\n\n01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.360\nI made fun of it because I love it.\n\n01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.360\nBut what happened is, I said last week in a drunken D&D playing Stupor, I was like,\n\n01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.360\noh, we should not play anymore because I wanted you to get your friend or your famous friend\n\n01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360\nto come and play with us.\n\n01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.360\nAnd then we couldn't bag him as a guest.\n\n01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.360\nSo then Spencer was like, is he coming?\n\n01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360\nNo, sorry.\n\n01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.360\nSo now we're walking on a path for a whole week.\n\n01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.360\nIt's my fault.\n\n01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.360\nThe whole thing is my fault.\n\n01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.360\nI may have been an asshole when I was 16, but I have become a person who knows how to\n\n01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360\nover-apologize.\n\n01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:24.360\nThat is a coping mechanism that I have spent 30 years developing in place of math.\n\n01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.360\nIt was fine.\n\n01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360\nGood job, everybody.\n\n01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.360\nWell, thank you, Spencer.\n\n01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.360\nLet's thank Erin McGathy, Aaron.\n\n01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.360\nThank you very much, Aaron.\n\n01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:41.360\nSpencer, stay put because I personally am concerned about this growing anxiety of yours.\n\n01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.360\nYeah, let's just talk to Spencer like a human being for a change.\n\n01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.360\nSpencer, let's learn more about him.\n\n01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.360\nWill your anxiety permit you to come up on stage and sit in this chair and grab the\n\n01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.360\nmic so the audience can see?\n\n01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.360\nI'll do that.\n\n01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.360\nAll right.\n\n01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360\nSpencer, everyone.\n\n01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.360\nDo you need a drink?\n\n01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.360\nDo you want a drink?\n\n01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.360\nNo, no.\n\n01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.360\nOkay.\n\n01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.360\nSpencer, what's going on, man?\n\n01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.360\nI'm worried about you.\n\n01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.360\nLast week, you said you weren't feeling well, but then you said it was anxiety.\n\n01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.360\nAre you agoraphobic?\n\n01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:15.360\nNo, I'm just weird.\n\n01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.360\nBut you've been so like, everyone that I know that's heard the podcasts or people that come\n\n01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.360\nto the show, it's pretty unanimous that people really enjoy you in the show and they love\n\n01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.360\nwhat you do.\n\n01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360\nDo you not feel welcome here?\n\n01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360\nOh, I love it.\n\n01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.360\nThat's why I come here.\n\n01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.860\nBut it's like, I'm just anxious.\n\n01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.800\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.360\nIt's not like there's things that are happening that are like making me anxious.\n\n01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.360\nIt's like I'm anxious and that's making me feel weird about things that are happening.\n\n01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.360\nI've had that.\n\n01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.700\nBecause of this or because of other things?\n\n01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.700\nBecause of Harmontown?\n\n01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700\nProbably.\n\n01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.260\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.760\nThis is new.\n\n01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760\nIt's not regular.\n\n01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.960\nIt's a cause of stress, both good and bad.\n\n01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.360\nI mean, it just does that.\n\n01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.360\nAnxiety is a thing that happens.\n\n01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.360\nI got respiratory alkalosis.\n\n01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.860\nAll of a sudden, my body was breathing wrong.\n\n01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:04.860\nI didn't even know it.\n\n01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:09.360\nI was getting lightheaded and it was because I enjoyed the San Diego Zoo or something.\n\n01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.860\nYeah, it doesn't matter.\n\n01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:18.360\nIt's just your brain will turn anything around you into the anxious stuff.\n\n01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.360\nAre you feeling anxious right now?\n\n01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:25.860\nKind of, like now that you just brought it up.\n\n01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.860\nWhat if I really focus hard on it right now?\n\n01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.860\nWhat if I really call it the high relief?\n\n01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:30.860\nJust my anxiety?\n\n01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.860\nYeah.\n\n01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.360\nWell, I think I'm defiantly pressing it down now.\n\n01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.860\nWell, I hope you feel safer because I feel safer having you up here on stage.\n\n01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.360\nI think you create a very calming blanket in Harmontown.\n\n01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.360\nYou're very good at what you do.\n\n01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.860\nWell, I'm glad if that changes, let me know.\n\n01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.860\nI'll gracefully take my exit.\n\n01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:56.860\nIf that happens, if I'm good, it's fine, you guys.\n\n01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.860\nI think you're better at what you do than Dan or I are at whatever it is we do.\n\n01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:05.360\nI think you get up here and actually get up and do a specific job quite well.\n\n01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.860\nLuckily, you've defined it for me, so.\n\n01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.860\nYeah, so our jobs are undefined.\n\n01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.860\nWe have plenty of right to be anxious.\n\n01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.360\nDo you like Dream Pop, Spencer?\n\n01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.360\nYeah, yeah, no.\n\n01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.360\nI saw that Dino tweet.\n\n01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:20.860\nI do.\n\n01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.860\nI enjoy Dream Pop.\n\n01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.360\nI found out what kind of music I like.\n\n01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.360\nIt's called Dream Pop.\n\n01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.360\nWhat is that?\n\n01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.360\nIt's kind of a synth-y aesthetic, typically melancholy emotionally,\n\n01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.860\nbut kind of has more tone than melody sometimes.\n\n01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:39.860\nI would say Mazzy Star would be like a Dream Pop playlist item.\n\n01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.860\nEnos.\n\n01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:45.860\nM83, particularly fond of.\n\n01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:48.860\nI'd have to Wikipedia to find out the rest.\n\n01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:57.360\nDoes anybody have any on their phone or iPod or something we can play?\n\n01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.360\nI don't think it would be.\n\n01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.360\nI'm just curious.\n\n01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.860\nI think the mood is already a two-dream poppy right now.\n\n01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:09.860\nWe would need something more bluegrass-y to bring the show to the station.\n\n01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:18.360\nIs there anybody here tonight that feels like they're going through a particularly troubling period in their life?\n\n01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.860\nSomebody that has a terrible problem?\n\n01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.860\nHey, Seuss' hand is already going up.\n\n01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:23.860\nSorry.\n\n01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.860\nSorry.\n\n01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.860\nIt's alright.\n\n01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:26.860\nHey, Seuss.\n\n01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.860\nCan you come up here and talk about it a little bit?\n\n01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.860\nHey, Seuss.\n\n01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:38.860\nSpencer will take his judging master seat.\n\n01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.860\nHey, Seuss will come up.\n\n01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.860\nHey, Seuss, I remember it was in the front row, I think, or second row.\n\n01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:52.860\nThe night we interviewed everyone of all races, and he was one of the Latino people.\n\n01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.860\nNo, I know you didn't come up.\n\n01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.860\nI wasn't here.\n\n01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:56.860\nWhat?\n\n01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.860\nThat was the one week I missed.\n\n01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.860\nPretty racist.\n\n01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.860\nWow.\n\n01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:04.860\nDifferent Latino.\n\n01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.860\nIt's okay.\n\n01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:07.860\nDifferent Hey, Seuss.\n\n01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.860\nI swear to God there was a Hey, Seuss here.\n\n01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:10.860\nWe all look the same.\n\n01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.860\nJose, Hey, Seuss, Pedro.\n\n01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.860\nI mean, it's recorded, I remember his name was Hey, Seuss, and I remember your name was\n\n01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.860\nHey, Seuss, so I made that connection.\n\n01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.860\nThat's called racism.\n\n01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.860\nOr Alzheimer's.\n\n01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.860\nAs an ambassador of Mexican people, I forgive you.\n\n01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.860\nThank you.\n\n01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.860\nSo, Nate, what's your name?\n\n01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.860\nJulieta came up.\n\n01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.860\nYou weren't here?\n\n01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.860\nNo, I was here.\n\n01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.860\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.860\nJulieta, never mind, don't.\n\n01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.860\nOh, Julieta came up a different night when we interviewed.\n\n01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:39.860\nYeah.\n\n01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.860\nIt was a different night.\n\n01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.860\nI'm off the hook.\n\n01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:43.860\nI'm not racist.\n\n01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.860\nI'm just, yeah, I just have Alzheimer's.\n\n01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:51.860\nSee, you experience it, but I like catalog it sort of in my mind.\n\n01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.860\nOh, that's episode four.\n\n01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.860\nThat's episode 14.\n\n01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:54.860\nYeah.\n\n01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:57.860\nAll right, so what's the problem?\n\n01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:02.860\nIt's one of those things I feel are kind of like things I'm not allowed to complain about.\n\n01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.860\nI have a great job.\n\n01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:05.860\nI get paid.\n\n01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.860\nBrown people problems.\n\n01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.860\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:15.860\nI feel like most people that are like 40-year-olds, Mexicans that are like outside Home Depot\n\n01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:20.860\nwaiting for a job, hopefully they'll like work 12 hours and then maybe get like 30 bucks.\n\n01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860\nBut I have a steady job.\n\n01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.860\nI get paid $10 an hour.\n\n01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.860\nI mean, it's a lot of work.\n\n01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.860\nIt's a lot of time.\n\n01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.860\nI hate it, even though it's meaningful.\n\n01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.860\nYou know, I told you about it, SpaceX, the drilling holes in the spaceship parts.\n\n01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.860\nBullshit.\n\n01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.860\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.860\nYou work at a spaceship?\n\n01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860\nYes.\n\n01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.860\nFor real.\n\n01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:41.860\nIt's no joke.\n\n01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.860\nTell them about it.\n\n01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.860\nOh, it's meaningful.\n\n01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.860\nI just, I don't like it.\n\n01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.860\nIt's a lot of time.\n\n01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.860\nI spend a lot of the time listening to your show.\n\n01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.860\nWhile you're working on a spaceship?\n\n01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:55.860\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.860\nLike welding an X-wing onto an X-wing fighter?\n\n01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.860\nWhat is the real image of what you do?\n\n01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.860\nIs this the ship that's going to take us to the moon?\n\n01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:05.860\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.860\nYou're building the Harmontownship?\n\n01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:13.860\nYeah, I probably will if I continue on to this thing.\n\n01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:17.860\nBut let them know that you're not saying these things because you're schizophrenic.\n\n01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.860\nYou actually have a job at where?\n\n01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.860\nSpaceX, you can, I don't know.\n\n01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.860\nIt's like a private space company, right?\n\n01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:31.860\nI don't want to talk up because what you say is way more interesting than what I can say.\n\n01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860\nWell, I'll edit it out.\n\n01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.860\nYou work on a spaceship.\n\n01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:35.860\nThat's way more interesting.\n\n01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:39.860\nAnd this is one of the most boring episodes of Harmontown in recorded history.\n\n01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:40.860\nNo, no.\n\n01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:45.860\nI mean, like the first episode, it was really like, I was immediately hooked because it's like, oh, whatever.\n\n01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.860\nI'm looking at all these podcasts.\n\n01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.860\nThere are a lot of good ones.\n\n01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.860\nAnd then you, the first episode, you're talking about how much it sucked to be fired.\n\n01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.860\nI was like, whoa, like you're a really personal revelatory.\n\n01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:00.860\nLike this first, the first thing I heard from you and I was impressed.\n\n01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:05.860\nI started slowly, it became my favorite thing in the whole world.\n\n01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.860\nWell, I'm honored and flattered.\n\n01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.860\nBut okay, so let's go.\n\n01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:16.860\nSo you're, you're feeling unsatisfactory, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction in your job.\n\n01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:23.860\nRaise your hand if you're like in a creative, productive, media artsy kind of thing.\n\n01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.860\nLike, no?\n\n01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:27.860\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.860\nAnd you want that career to progress, right?\n\n01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:30.860\nAnd it's just everyone.\n\n01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:37.860\nWait, so what did you, so, wait, are you, are you saying you're creative, but you've ended up in a scientific kind of cul-de-sac in your career?\n\n01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.860\nOr are you saying?\n\n01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:43.860\nWell, just, yeah, I mean, I don't, because I'm complete, I have no reason for myself to doubt.\n\n01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:58.860\nTo be really risky, I just read a Tumblr entry that, that, I guess I'll just say, you, you believe your mom didn't love you.\n\n01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.860\nAnd, uh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.860\nYeah, I make that joke for, well, I mean, I think my parents are a little reptilian.\n\n01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.860\nA reptilian?\n\n01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:10.860\nLike, kind of, like, you know, I don't, I don't, I mean, they say they love me all the time.\n\n01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.860\nI just don't really, I'm not really, I don't really feel that, that's probably my fault.\n\n01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.860\nI'm, maybe I'm the reptile.\n\n01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:21.860\nI've also diagnosed myself with Aspergers and Bipolarism and anything that comes down the pike.\n\n01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.860\nBecause it could be broken inside me.\n\n01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.860\nBut anyways, sorry, I didn't mean to.\n\n01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.860\nBut, but, you're actually, did you bring that up because you feel like your mom didn't love you?\n\n01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.860\nNo, no, no, not at all.\n\n01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.860\nI feel like I have no excuse to have all this self-doubt.\n\n01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.860\nOh, God, I don't either.\n\n01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.860\nAre you kidding?\n\n01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:45.860\nNo, I grew up in a fucking beautiful little neighborhood in a lower middle class suburb of Milwaukee,\n\n01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:51.860\nand we played kick the can and, and, and, and, and partook of the nectar of the, of the pear trees.\n\n01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:54.860\nI don't know much about wildlife.\n\n01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:56.860\nMy point is I took advantage of it.\n\n01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.860\nI took advantage, we threw rocks at cars and ran away.\n\n01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.860\nWe caused trouble for the fuck of it because we lived in Eden, you know.\n\n01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:07.860\nIt's like tied ropes across the street to, to try to cause accidents.\n\n01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.860\nAnd people would get out of their cars and go, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.860\nAnd we'd go, like, run away.\n\n01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.860\nBecause that's what juveniles are doing.\n\n01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:16.860\nLike they're trying.\n\n01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.860\nThere, there, there's two, there's not enough pain in their life.\n\n01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:23.860\nI was looking at photos today and read it of what's going on in Syria.\n\n01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.860\nIt's just blowing my mind.\n\n01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:30.860\nWhat it was particularly blowing my mind is that I was looking at pictures of it and it was functioning as entertainment.\n\n01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:35.860\nI wasn't, you know, we use that word to, to, to usually mean like, haha, this is so fun.\n\n01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.860\nBut, but you can also be being entertained by like, holy shit, that's crazy.\n\n01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:44.860\nLike, which is what I was doing, looking at these pictures of like people's feet giving like, you know, all fucked up.\n\n01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.860\nAnd like, like, like just, like everyone pointing guns at us, holes in cement walls at each other.\n\n01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:52.860\nI can't tell who the good guys, the bad guys are, who they think, who, who's fighting who.\n\n01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:59.860\nIt's, it's, those guys are not like, you know, they're, they, they get to complain all they want, but they don't have time.\n\n01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.860\nThey're not doing it.\n\n01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:04.860\nThey're like, they're like, where's my gun? Where's my bullets? Where's Fred?\n\n01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.860\nOh, he's dead.\n\n01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.860\nOkay. Where's Steve then? You know, they move on.\n\n01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.860\nThey, they're self-actualized, but we don't want, that's not the solution.\n\n01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.860\nWe don't want to live that life.\n\n01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:18.860\nYou know, yeah, the people who get to sit around and whine and have first world problems, like, yeah.\n\n01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.860\nWell, that's most of North America.\n\n01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.860\nYeah.\n\n01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.860\nIt's the whole first world, you might say.\n\n01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:30.860\nBut, but, but we also, you know, I mean, we, we, we, we, there's guilt that comes with that, but the guilt doesn't really get you a lot of places,\n\n01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.860\nexcept for, I think it's a-\n\n01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.860\nThe Harmontown.\n\n01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:34.860\nTo-\n\n01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.860\nIt's, it's a hard time.\n\n01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.860\nAnyways, that was all to say, like, whatever, you don't have to, you've done enough,\n\n01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:45.860\nkind of, what do you call it, disclaiming of whatever your complaints are.\n\n01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.860\nSo imagine that everyone forgives you.\n\n01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.860\nImagine that everyone, that no one's going to be muttering into their coffee cup.\n\n01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.860\nThen that guy got up and he, he should be grateful, but he's not, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.860\nLike, what's your pettiest complaint?\n\n01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.860\nI told you, my gardener's doing something wrong.\n\n01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.860\nYou know, I, I have, I've chapped lips.\n\n01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.860\nIt's ruined my day.\n\n01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.860\nLike, what's your, what's your, what do you wish?\n\n01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.860\nIt was true that isn't her.\n\n01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:16.860\nIt's all the time I'm spending drilling holes into stuff that I could be in a room with\n\n01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:20.860\nfunny, awesome people making things, and I wish that was my job.\n\n01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.860\nI wish I could just get drunk and high and make things.\n\n01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.860\nLike, I've never seen an interview when you were talking about this embryo farm of, like,\n\n01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.860\nall these ideas and people would just add to it, and I was so excited and, you know,\n\n01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.860\nI have a Twitter account on every farm, but I don't do anything on it.\n\n01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.860\nI just thought, anyway, the point is, it's that, I want that to be my job really soon.\n\n01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.860\nWhen you were talking about Channel 101, and I started looking at all the Channel 101 things\n\n01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:51.860\nand, oh shit, the, you know, it's just the, the jealousy of other people that in high\n\n01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.860\nschool, I, I thought that my dream was a little too grandiose, and I was like, no,\n\n01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:01.860\nI'm not going to be a great actor, blah, blah, but then like a dozen or so of my friends in\n\n01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:06.860\nthe same class focused and struggled, and they succeeded.\n\n01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.860\nThey're doing what they love.\n\n01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.860\nThey're traveling around the world doing this stuff, and I...\n\n01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:12.860\nThey're creatives?\n\n01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:13.860\nYeah, they're creators.\n\n01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.860\nActors, writers.\n\n01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.860\nThey're creatives, actors, writers, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:17.860\nI'm not saying they're there.\n\n01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:21.860\nAnd you made a sensible, practical decision to go down like an engineering road.\n\n01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:28.860\nIt's so, it's so literary, or like, that you're not doing a creative thing, as far as\n\n01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.860\nyou're concerned, but what you're doing is drilling holes in spaceships.\n\n01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:38.860\nWell, yeah, you're the kind of, you're the, you're the mechanic of space flights.\n\n01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:44.860\nWell, that was interesting for like three months or two months, and now I'm just, I'm still\n\n01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:45.860\nthere.\n\n01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.860\nYou're feeling kind of like, like potential regret.\n\n01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.860\nYou're going like, oh, when they all, when they all put their lives on the line for their\n\n01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.860\nart and their craft, meaning that they ate ramen noodles, and you know, they, you took\n\n01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.860\na more sensible path.\n\n01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.860\nSo now your reward is you're drilling these holes, and you're thinking about Tony, who,\n\n01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.860\nwho may or may not be fucking Natalie Portman, or whatever it is that he's doing, whatever\n\n01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:03.860\nthe fantasy is.\n\n01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.860\nOh, who's fucking?\n\n01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.860\nOr just having a good time.\n\n01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.860\nI don't, I don't mean to make it sound shallow, the fantasy.\n\n01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.860\nI mean, because she's deep.\n\n01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:20.860\nUm, the, the, so, so, I, I, well, I have, I have good news for you.\n\n01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:28.860\nThe amount of time that creatives spend doing nothing, even remotely creative, is like almost\n\n01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.860\nequal to the amount of time that non creatives do.\n\n01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.860\nWell, I know, I, I did spend four years doing nothing at all.\n\n01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.860\nLike I could have spent that time writing, but I, I didn't.\n\n01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860\nYeah.\n\n01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.860\nBut I, well, I mean, so, I mean, I guess what I'm saying is it's not too late.\n\n01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.860\nYeah.\n\n01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:41.860\nYou didn't miss anything.\n\n01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.860\nYeah.\n\n01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:45.860\nAnd you're worried that, I think your concern might be that you would have to quit your\n\n01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.860\njob because you can't, you can't drill a hole in the spaceship at the same time as you\n\n01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.860\nwrite on a metal and notepad.\n\n01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.860\nUh, uh, what if a pickle, uh, uh, uh, met a big foot?\n\n01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:01.860\nUm, but, but I, I just, I just did that at the same time as I was supposed to be entertaining\n\n01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:07.860\npeople, uh, which is, and for a lot of these people, this show has become like me drilling\n\n01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:08.860\nholes in the spaceships.\n\n01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:15.860\nUh, but, but it becomes monotonous and quiet and, uh, uh, there's a lot of sweat involved.\n\n01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.860\nBringing boring people up to talk like me.\n\n01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:20.860\nNo, no, I think this is, this is, this is more interesting.\n\n01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:25.860\nI look at the, uh, the, the mutual anxiety association going on.\n\n01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.860\nLike I, I assume like, uh, as soon as you come up here, you seem so self assured.\n\n01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:32.860\nLike, like, uh, you give me a patch from the spaceship you're working on.\n\n01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.860\nYou seem like you got your shit together.\n\n01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.860\nDan, I, we all assume has a shit together.\n\n01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.860\nSpencer comes up here and nails it every time.\n\n01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.860\nAnd it's just so funny to me that they're like to look at you people and people don't\n\n01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.860\nassume that you guys haven't got it all together.\n\n01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:49.860\nLike you, you, you can look at people and assume that you guys have it all like laid\n\n01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:55.860\nout as long as you just said so, which it's, it's very, uh, it's, uh, eliminating and\n\n01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:01.860\ncrazy to like to find out that like, that you're, you know, like in a vortex of, uh,\n\n01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.860\nanxiety right now.\n\n01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:03.860\nIt's a little deep down.\n\n01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.860\nWe believe in ourselves and believe we're great.\n\n01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.860\nLike, you know, the journal entry, uh, you know, I believe in the whole like, yeah,\n\n01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:14.860\nI was probably around a couple of thousands of years ago in some form spinning around\n\n01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:19.860\nwith electrons, blah, blah, blah, and I have my past memories.\n\n01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:25.860\nBut, um, as, I think as a dungeon master, I hate myself.\n\n01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:26.860\nMake no mistake.\n\n01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:27.860\nDo you really?\n\n01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:28.860\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.860\nThis is becoming my favorite harm and turn ever.\n\n01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:36.860\nThere's escape velocity in this show.\n\n01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.860\nDreampop is very melancholy.\n\n01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.860\nSpencer and I both like it, but we do have our shit together.\n\n01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:43.860\nWe are happy people.\n\n01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.860\nAnd, uh, I think that like, and Dino's like that too.\n\n01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:51.860\nHe listens to like Pink Floyd and like a really, really bitter, dark, sad, depressing stuff.\n\n01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:54.860\n80% of my music at home is sad melancholy wallowing.\n\n01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:58.860\nBecause that's how we enjoy our, our, our, our great lives.\n\n01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.860\nLike we go like, oh, who would have thought?\n\n01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860\nYippee-ki-yay.\n\n01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.860\nAll the struggle.\n\n01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.860\nEverything.\n\n01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:11.860\nAnd I think that that's the, that's the feeling that people who are happy have kind of because\n\n01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.860\nhappy has to be in quotes and so does sad.\n\n01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.860\nBecause we've all met people who are kind of, who kind of enjoy being miserable.\n\n01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.860\nYou know, it's hard to put up.\n\n01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.860\nWe all have friends or hopefully not a lot of us are, have them as friends, but they're\n\n01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.860\nlike in your circle of friends.\n\n01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:28.860\nYou just kind of say about them like, yeah, he, he's, he's getting off on it.\n\n01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.860\nHe likes being, he likes his on wing.\n\n01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:35.860\nLike he keeps saying that, you know, and, and, and, and like, but that's his thing.\n\n01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.860\nThat's how he's happy.\n\n01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:37.860\nAnd I don't think that's you.\n\n01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.860\nI think the good news for you is you're actually on the precipice of making yourself happy because\n\n01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:46.860\nwhat's the first thing that's going to happen before you make yourself happy?\n\n01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.860\nIt's not going to be you being happy.\n\n01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.860\nIt's going to be you not being happy.\n\n01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.860\nOtherwise the next thing wouldn't make any sense.\n\n01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.860\nSo you're, you're, you're drilling holes in spaceships.\n\n01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:59.860\nYou're, you're, you're raising your hand when someone says who feels this way or that way.\n\n01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.860\nYou're, you're answering and calls us that.\n\n01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.860\nIt's supposed to, well, it's easy.\n\n01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:07.860\nIt's fucking like, yeah, it's so is jumping off a cliff kind of.\n\n01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.860\nSo is, so is writing pickle meets a big foot.\n\n01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.860\nSo is, uh,\n\n01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.860\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.860\nThe writing, the, the, okay.\n\n01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:14.860\nYou know, yeah.\n\n01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.860\nThis raising my hand and talking to you when the great role model, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:20.860\nIt's easy because it's following your bliss, so to speak.\n\n01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:26.860\nIt's doing what you feel like you really want to do to go home and write something and actually\n\n01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:31.860\nstare at the paper, like, uh, sitting in a room alone with God, I think was a good metaphor.\n\n01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860\nYou might have been blackout drunk.\n\n01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.860\nUm, a jail cell.\n\n01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:35.860\nJail cell.\n\n01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.860\nSorry.\n\n01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:37.860\nSorry.\n\n01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:38.860\nBut, uh, yeah.\n\n01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:39.860\nCause God rapes you when you write.\n\n01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.860\nIf you're really good at it.\n\n01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:44.860\nIt's like, it's a, it's a violent procedure.\n\n01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:45.860\nDon't we all feel like that?\n\n01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:46.860\nLike, I mean, I mean.\n\n01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.860\nYeah.\n\n01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:48.860\nEveryone feels like that.\n\n01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:49.860\nAnd that's why I don't have a,\n\n01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.860\nI think that people would, people would come to the show and sit in the back of a comic\n\n01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.860\nbook, uh, uh, uh, store and listen to the show.\n\n01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.860\nI think we're all kind of here for some reason or other, but the idea, I think we all have\n\n01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:02.860\ngreat aspirations, but also I think that we're not arrogant enough to assume that the world\n\n01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.860\nowes it to us.\n\n01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:07.860\nYou know, I think there's probably in this room, like the mind power and the creativity\n\n01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.860\nto do something like absolutely stupendous.\n\n01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:11.860\nIt's, it's, it's really interesting.\n\n01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.860\nIt's like, like, like a town, like a colony.\n\n01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.860\nLike, yeah, like to sort of like form some colony, but like, like that's really like\n\n01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:22.860\nfrom my vantage point, looking at Dan, Jesus, and Spencer and looking at like the brain\n\n01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:27.860\npower and the sensitivity and the, uh, and the sensibilities, like it's very like it's\n\n01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.860\nmoving to me.\n\n01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.860\nIt's like I'm, I'm kind of choking up over here.\n\n01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:31.860\nIt's, it's very cool.\n\n01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:35.860\nWell, let's do an experiment just because there is such a Baptist revival happening.\n\n01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.860\nAnd, uh, you know, the, the, the, you know, God forbid that, that anyone leave and go,\n\n01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:43.860\nwell that got a little, uh, cultish.\n\n01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.860\nLet's just commit to it.\n\n01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:50.860\nWe wallowed in a 15 year old's journal for a while and it brought out the 15 year old,\n\n01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.860\nuh, aspirations and I think, and me, I think, I would, I would say probably in plenty of\n\n01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.860\nways.\n\n01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.860\nAnd there's a, there's a, uh, a melancholy kind of, uh, Morrissey vibe going on in here,\n\n01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.860\nbut kind of a groovy way.\n\n01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.860\nAll right.\n\n01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.860\nPeople of Harmontown, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and the answer is going\n\n01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:13.860\nto be Jesus at the top of your lungs.\n\n01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.860\nWho has the power to create?\n\n01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:17.860\nJesus!\n\n01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:21.860\nWho has the power to make the earth a different shape?\n\n01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.860\nJesus!\n\n01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.860\nWho is so entitled to happiness?\n\n01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.860\nWait.\n\n01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:37.860\nI couldn't, I don't blame you, sir, because I kind of, I lost track of my thought.\n\n01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:40.860\nWho is so entitled to happiness?\n\n01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:41.860\nWait.\n\n01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:48.860\nThat, that, that he's, uh, uh, uh, uh, did, you know what, I'm making the problem worse\n\n01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.860\nbecause it's making it.\n\n01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.860\nWho has a dick the size of Montana?\n\n01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.860\nJesus!\n\n01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.860\nWho's dick is made of ink?\n\n01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:56.860\nJesus!\n\n01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.860\nWho's penis is a mighty pen?\n\n01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.860\nJesus!\n\n01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:05.860\nWho's dick will write life across the paper of the universe?\n\n01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:11.860\nAnd who's dick writing will make all the women, and even me, God, that weep when they\n\n01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:12.860\nread it?\n\n01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:13.860\nJesus!\n\n01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.860\nWho has a recipe for buttermilk biscuits that will make you shit yourself?\n\n01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:21.860\nActually, yeah, no, not Jesus, we need to know that because we're having a...\n\n01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:28.860\nWell, Rosa Parks, I just listened to a Greg Poops article where Rosa Parks had a, like,\n\n01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.860\na pancake recipe.\n\n01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.860\nOh, right, yeah.\n\n01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.860\nPeanut butter?\n\n01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:32.860\nPeanut butter, yeah.\n\n01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:33.860\nYeah, the peanut butter pancakes.\n\n01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:36.860\nThey're supposed to be fuck-around good pancakes, yeah.\n\n01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:41.860\nNot only, uh, you know, one of the Godmothers of the Civil Rights Movement, she also had\n\n01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.860\na recipe for peanut butter pancakes that will wipe you out.\n\n01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.860\nYeah, but you know what?\n\n01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.860\nWho would have been better at serving civil rights if he had been there than Rosa Parks?\n\n01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:51.860\nJesus!\n\n01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:54.860\nWho's smarter than Einstein?\n\n01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.860\nJesus!\n\n01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:01.860\nWho's better able to do accents on the fly than Robin Williams?\n\n01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.860\nJesus!\n\n01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:03.860\nProve it.\n\n01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.860\nProve it.\n\n01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860\nProve it.\n\n01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:06.860\nProve it.\n\n01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:12.580\nWho could go to SeaWorld, put his head in a whale tank, and just start babbling in dolphin\n\n01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.580\ntalk, and have the dolphins understand, even though they were in the wrong tank?\n\n01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:17.580\nPacers!\n\n01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.580\nAlright, now, guys, give Spencer some now.\n\n01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.580\nSpencer needs it most.\n\n01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.580\nHe's ill.\n\n01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.580\nIt's become a faith-healing tense right now.\n\n01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:28.580\nOh, but there's one over here that's having problems as well!\n\n01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:30.580\nI sense the pain in his beard.\n\n01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:33.580\nIt grows from his face, but it hasn't detached.\n\n01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.580\nHe's holding his fears and thoughts.\n\n01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.580\nWhat's wrong with you, young man?\n\n01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:39.580\nNothing.\n\n01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.580\nThings.\n\n01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:45.580\nHe has things wrong with him, but I feel the power to get those things away.\n\n01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:46.580\nHallelujah.\n\n01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:51.580\nI want to ask, where do those things go when they go away?\n\n01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:52.580\nThey go into...\n\n01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.580\nSeattle.\n\n01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:54.580\nYeah, I know what's confusing.\n\n01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.580\nWhy would they go into Jesus?\n\n01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:59.580\nWell, some of it's in Seattle.\n\n01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:04.580\nYou know, to enjoy those revivals, it actually takes a lot of work, I'm realizing.\n\n01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.580\nThey're not easy.\n\n01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:06.580\nNo, no.\n\n01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.580\nWho has the power to do a good revival?\n\n01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:10.580\nAnd Harvard.\n\n01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:11.580\nThank you.\n\n01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.580\nThank you.\n\n01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:20.580\nNow that I'm good at doing revivals, who's going to have his things go away?\n\n01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:25.580\nWho could take those things and write a little script about him?\n\n01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:30.580\nMaybe a modern family speck in his spare time between drilling holes with spaceships or\n\n01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:35.580\neven an original idea that would be really bad, and then he'd show it to his most trusted\n\n01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:39.580\nfriends, and they'd say, this is stupid, and he'd say, I know, but he'd wake up the next\n\n01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.580\nday and he'd still be alive.\n\n01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.580\nShut up and tell.\n\n01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.580\nI think it might be.\n\n01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:53.580\nIf you want to be a writer, you got to, you know, the first step is writing.\n\n01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.580\nYou already know that, but, you know, the...\n\n01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:56.580\nWell, now I have to.\n\n01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:57.580\nYeah, now I have to.\n\n01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:01.580\nWhat a lot of people can't accept is that it starts up being a really shitty writer,\n\n01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.580\nand there is no way.\n\n01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:06.580\nIt reminds me of all the stuff I deleted.\n\n01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:08.580\nYeah, I kind of wish I could...\n\n01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:13.580\nI think that's the nice thing about that thing is like, I was not a prodigy.\n\n01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.580\nThat was actually pretty...\n\n01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:18.580\nWell, the embarrassing thing is like, this is pretty good, you know, like...\n\n01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:23.580\nWell, there were bad things about it that got corrected over a long, long time, but\n\n01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.580\nalso, whatever, there's conflicting messages there.\n\n01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:29.580\nOne message is, it's never too late to start.\n\n01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:33.580\nOne message is, it could happen overnight, but not until you do it shitty for a while.\n\n01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:36.580\nAnother message is, like, it takes a long time, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:41.580\nI mean, the only things that you can control are the things that you do the next day.\n\n01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.580\nSo, you're drilling a hole in a spaceship.\n\n01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:47.580\nYou know, I hope it doesn't have to come to a big decision to either, like, quit and\n\n01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:51.580\ncast your life into chaos and better, because that's not really...\n\n01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:52.580\nWriting as a...\n\n01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.580\nBeing creative as a crew, it doesn't really earn that.\n\n01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:57.580\nLike, that's just something people do because they have to do it.\n\n01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:01.580\nLike, it doesn't necessarily, like, need that as fuel.\n\n01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:06.580\nYou could actually conceivably, with enough concern about it, you could maybe drill some\n\n01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:10.580\nholes in some spaceships and, like, Saturday or something, like, something.\n\n01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:12.580\nLike, chip away at it.\n\n01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:16.580\nWell, now that you've built up my confidence, I've been wanting to...\n\n01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:21.580\nI had a dream where I played a 16-bit video game designed by you.\n\n01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.580\nAnd I even played the beginning.\n\n01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.580\nSo, that's one thing I want you to do.\n\n01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.580\nI want you to make it like a flash video game.\n\n01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:27.580\nYou should do it.\n\n01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.580\nYou know, you're better.\n\n01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.580\nAll right.\n\n01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.580\nAnd that video game will be called...\n\n01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.580\nHey, Seuss!\n\n01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.580\nAll right.\n\n01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.580\nThat's not a real eyeball grabber.\n\n01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.580\nMaybe we'll put some tits on the cover.\n\n01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.580\nJesus, the video game.\n\n01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:47.580\nIn 16 bits.\n\n01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:51.580\nWreck it, Jesus.\n\n01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:53.580\nAll right, it's Hey, Seuss, everybody.\n\n01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:56.580\nGive him a hand.\n\n01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.580\nI am a drink, maybe.\n\n01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.580\nSpencer, do you feel any better?\n\n01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:06.580\nYeah, I'm feeling a lot better, you guys.\n\n01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:07.580\nI don't get it.\n\n01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.580\nWas that sarcasm or...?\n\n01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.580\nI don't know.\n\n01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.580\nThink of, like, the right thing.\n\n01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.580\nYou don't feel any better is what you're saying.\n\n01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.580\nNo, I feel better physically.\n\n01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.580\nAnd mentally.\n\n01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:24.580\nIs there anything Dan or I or the harmonians here tonight could do\n\n01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:29.580\nto make you feel spiritually or psychically better tonight?\n\n01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:32.580\nWhen you're subscribing to the podcast on iTunes\n\n01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:36.580\nand writing incredible ratings, like five-star reviews,\n\n01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:41.580\ntake a tall glass of Kettle One and enjoy it.\n\n01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:46.580\nAll right, well, everybody, listen.\n\n01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:51.580\nKeep your feet on the side of a
