00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh, yes indeed.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Welcome you lucky sons of bitches to the Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
And you send me lucky people listening on your whatever the fuck you listen to things on.

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
Please welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Thank you very much.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay, so let me get weird tonight.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
I didn't have anything and so I went through my office at home and I found this journal I wrote in high school.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
And that's something that L.A. people do a lot, special shows and things.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
You know, you read your embarrassing adolescent journals and stuff.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I thought, oh, that's ducks in a barrel.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
You know, oh, Dan the nerd, like being a nerd and trying to be cool, but being a nerd, trying to be a good writer,

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
being a bad writer and I'll mock my teenage self and well, you know, the unspoken humble brag headline will be,

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm so much cooler now, which is how I think it usually works when you read these things.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I started reading it and I got really bummed out.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Just devastated.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
I want to say I was a vile person, but I mean it's just, I don't see the difference between this kid and myself.

01:44.000 --> 01:54.000
And except that I just, I stopped trying to talk like Frasier all the time, which this kid at 15 is still doing.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And I also just stopped like trying to impress other people, including myself.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I kind of stopped posturing.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
So it's just, it's just, I don't know.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't know.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I don't know what it is.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
Erin was like, oh, this is very, I mean, this is all what's interesting and people that do those journal shows.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Erin said, they always read the wrong entries.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
They always, you know, because they don't get it.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
They don't understand what about their entries is, you know, is what we want to hear, you know, the shot in Freud of it all or whatever it is.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, now you're holding a spiral.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
With 27 post-it notes.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Because I started marking, oh, I'll just read this and then I'll read that.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I want to paint the picture for people listening to this.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
This is not like a little, you know, like a little velvet case, you know, like diary.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
It's a standard spiral notebook.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
How many of these did you have?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I found two of them.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
This is the first one.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I was obsessed with transition.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
So there's a lot of, there's a lot of chapters that happen to this.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And I bring the journal to a conclusion at 17.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I go, I'm done.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
There's nothing more to say.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm self-actualized.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
The title is Sand Pollution, The Journals of Dan Harmon.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
November 1989 to September 1990.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Sand pollution?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes, I'm glad you asked.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
I'll give you a taste of my voice at 15.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
This is how I ended the first entry.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I won't bother to, I mean, I'll start.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
November 27, 1989, 10.30 p.m.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
A picture of me on like a bear mattress surrounded by just like probably just a lot of my own cum.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
I can, I seem to recall not being able to stop touching myself physically or mentally

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
because no one else was going to do either job.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
I was astooned with acne and I had a yin-yang patch on my acid watch denim jacket sleeve

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
because I was very into like Taoism and like exploring all religions and stuff.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I think that for the first time, I'm going to try not to read it in this voice

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
because I don't want to, I don't want to like, like, I'm just going to like just,

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
this hurts really bad but I'm not going to,

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
if you catch me starting to go like this, like to make fun of myself, like, oh, stop me.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
I think that for the first time in my life, I consciously realized something today.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
November 27 comes and goes with each identical year.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
But today was the first and last 11, 27, 89 I would ever experience.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Absolutely nothing extraordinary happened today.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
The day itself along with every other individual day of the year is gone now forever.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
And it took all this time to get that far.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I suppose that's what an optimist or a reborn Christian is,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
someone who can appreciate every day as the only one of its kind and every person is something unrepeatable.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
But I feel this renewed vision could only last so long before slowly decomposing

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
whilst laying in...

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Wow.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Whilst laying in bitter wait for a replacement philosophy.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
I am an agnostic and I realize that philosophy is, in the truest sense, food for thought.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Hanging onto one bit for too long is silly.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
It rots on the shelf.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
It begins to stink.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
No one gets to enjoy it.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
You must consume philosophy perhaps after brief appreciation.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
And how do you consume it?

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
By bringing out its opposite and exposing it as just more sand.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
It's a theme that's coming.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It'll be slowly revealed to you.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Okay.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
It's sad in a way, I guess, but the alternatives are unhealthy.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
I guess after averaging out all recollection, I'd have to give this day a solid five.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I admit it.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Wait, wait, wait.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I'll give each day a number.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Can I stop right there?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Sure.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
But we'll never get anywhere.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Whatever you think, whatever you want to say.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Fifteen.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Pretty good.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Maybe that's what I wanted you to think.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, so far, I'm on your side.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Sure.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
That's probably what I thought the first entry of a journal should accomplish.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
And yet, I don't think, I don't know if I think anyone's ever going to read this.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
But I know that I'm trying to impress myself or some unseen reader.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Blogging hasn't been invented yet.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
So I'm like doing like a MySpace blog.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So this is me signing off, and this is very typical.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I won't read all the ones that are kind of typical like this.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
This is one of my sign-offs.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, deep...

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm sorry.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, deep...

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I have to do the voice.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Well, deep...

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Deep night...

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Is it night or night?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
No, no.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Well, deep night and weirdness.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Whisper warnings of a melancholy marrow.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
All right, I take it all back.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
You lost me.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I look upon it with the usual neutral dread.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Max, dear sir, be with me from six till six on the special twenty-eighth,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
for I predict it will be an ugly irksome four.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
Is everyone in my dug Kafka?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
You should be asking, who's Max?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Well, I have a lot of questions, but let's start with that one.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Max, I figured out, because I was like, who's Max?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Is he the Sandmaster?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Do you remember what I told you?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Do you remember what I told you that, in a way, yes.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Do you remember what I told you that my Dungeons & Dragons character,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
you kind of pressed me to tell you, and I said it was Jim Nightblade.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Thank you for calling out from the audience.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
That's partly true.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Jim Nightblade was a character I played in a game called Shadow Run.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Nice.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Never let it be said that I did not find my crowd before I died.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
You cannot expect more than one woo for Shadow Run,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
but if you get one, you have found your niche, sir.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Was that a deep weariness and a weary Mauro?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Was that a role-playing game?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
It was a role-playing game.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
It was like setting the future, setting a future in which magic and technology

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
had both awakened, magic had reawakened,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
and so there were ogres and dragons and stuff,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
but there were also hackers and cyber things,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
and I played Jim Nightblade, a bounty hunter,

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
who was killing it with the ladies.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
My point being that I found a thing where I rattled off all of my...

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
I was talking about role-playing, and I suddenly realized who Max was.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Max was one of my... was my favorite actual D&D character.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Actually, he was the one I played in a game called Middle Earth Role-Playing,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
which was a little cooler than D&D,

08:49.000 --> 08:57.000
sort of the crack to D&D's weed cocaine.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And if you ever wanted musical cue, I don't know what it is,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
but Zack has cued up some of his hip-hop,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
so if you ever want it, I don't know what it is.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
It's sight unseen or ear unheard of.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, when your cheeks get to a maximum redness,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
feel free to pop the champagne crack with a little brief hip-hop interlude.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
December 12th, 1989, 10.40pm.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Tomorrow, if one thing goes right,

09:23.000 --> 09:31.000
I shall have opportunity to partake in a Shadow Run with Neil and Rob.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
Ah, Seattle in the year 2050.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Your coffee is so strong.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Such a pleasant place to escape to,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
where prepositions can end sentences.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Alright, take it easy, Harmon, don't bully anybody.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Where Jim Nightblade, bounty hunter,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
stalks the dark streets without fear,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
the cybernetically enhanced anti-hero

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
for whom nothing goes wrong that can't be fixed by next gaming session.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
How I envy thee, James,

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
and how I long to control you again for an hour or two,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and how I wonder why language hasn't evolved

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
when technology has these and those.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh, I wonder when one writes in a journal,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
one must take on an Orson-Willian bravado,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
although one is writing about one's acne,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
so that for one brief moment I might mistake myself for you

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
and this world for yours.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Also so that I might add to my treasure chest of fantastic experiences,

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
which I share with myself alone after the game has been done for days.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
You see, reader, there's a reader.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Jim's world has perfect screenplay potential.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
I lament earlier that life has no screenplay potential.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Another thing.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
This is one day earlier.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I don't even know what to write, but I feel a surge of pathetic feelings.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I know that in a matter of hours something will go wrong or right,

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
and for the rest of my life some things will just keep going wrong or right.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Real life sucks. It has absolutely no screenplay potential.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
Life is a monotonous hairball.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Sorry, my cheese got red.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Life is a monotonous hairball.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
That's alright.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I'm happy, then sad, right, then wrong.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Wait, let's break down monotonous hairball.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
Let's break it down into the metaphor mixer.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Was that it?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah, I don't know.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm happy, then sad, right, then wrong, early, then late, old, then young.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
These drops and peaks are tightly adhered to a steady flat line that is my boring existence.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
The problem is, these are normal teenage claims,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
but I'm not supposed to be a teenager.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
In fact, I'm not. I sense that.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
My roots run deeper than any adults.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
My branches puncture the farthest layer of sky.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Whoa.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
But my roots have yet to drink freely,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
and my leaves have yet to even bud.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
Do leaves bud? I don't even know.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
So anyways, I talk about going to play the role-playing game,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
and then at that, but it has perfect screenplay potential.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
As does, and this is, I'm gonna rattle off names.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
These are all names of characters I played.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I created and played in various role-playing games.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
As does Edison Newborn's,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Melkintook's,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Raymond Flinks,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
and of course, Maxwell Artfall.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Maxwell Artfall was my big, that was my guy.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Who is he?

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
He was a bit of a rapscallion, a sloshbuckler,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
and something of a ladies' man.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Strangely enough.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I mean, it gets dark.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I become more and more of a dick

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
as my sexual frustration kind of wheel.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Would you start writing some of the prose again?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I want to cue that music again,

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
and I think my time out just right.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
There's a, so I'll be dipped in dog shit

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
if I didn't pass my road test on Friday.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm a licensed driver!

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
Now, that's a real journal entry.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
That's a job I'm not doing in every other one.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
It's like, why don't you stop telling me

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
about the particulars of the Gestalt,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
and tell me, remind me at 40 of like,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
what were you doing?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Gee, the more I write, the less I have to say.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I lost the debate meet on Saturday.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
That is, Graham and I went two and one,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
the other team, one and two.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I just had to throw them into the bus, I guess.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I didn't go to the snowball dance at school.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
I didn't go to the company Christmas party at ground round.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I didn't go to comedy sports on Sunday.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Gina moved in with some guy by UWM.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Gina would be some girl I had a crush on,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
not somebody that ever touched me.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Actually, she let me kiss her under her mistletoe.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You're still 15, right?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
This is December 17th and 89, yeah, I think I'm 15.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
My car insurance shall be costing me about $100 a month.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
You had car insurance at 15 years old?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
What?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Well, yeah, and a job.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
15?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Half my pay at any rate.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
I was a dishwasher.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
God knows what gasoline costs.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I didn't know yet.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Funny thing is, these are my only problems.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
There are a few more.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I got a C and a Brit Lit paper,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and I'm eight and a half stories behind in that class.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I have to clean my room.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
No Christmas shopping done.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
No girl to spend the remaining 40% of my money on.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Oh, ladies, don't week for me.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
I spew some misogynist shit.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I guess the bottom line is that I need a little excitement

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
or a little order to my life.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
I wish I had a few friends who didn't laugh at everything I said.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
No, no, stop laughing.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
He hates that.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah, I come to like it.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
But rather had a reply that might silently amuse me.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I wish my zits would vanish,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
granting me the confidence I feel I need

15:39.000 --> 15:49.000
to be more successful with the Chickers.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
Keep going.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That ain't gonna sound like that.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
So then there's a page that says,

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
December 18th through January 3rd, transitional movement.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Phase two begins.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
You ready?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Do you want the music back?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Dance taken off his jacket,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
picks up his vodka,

16:13.000 --> 16:32.000
and reads.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Phase two, I say.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Fuck it.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
In reference to the dealings of my phase one self.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck it.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
In fact, I'm afraid the new policy is this.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
One, no more involvement in the affairs of others.

16:54.000 --> 17:01.000
No extracurricular attempts at hobnobbing.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
Speak when spoken to and when wit is unavoidable.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
You know, sometimes you don't know your own strength.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Number two, think before speaking.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
No reflexive speech that wears a groove in your brain.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Like, uh, uh, uh, uh, which I grew into the master of.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Should have listened to some shit.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Number three, no more somber thoughts of existentialism

17:27.000 --> 17:36.000
that aren't properly coated with wit and or humor.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
This guy's laying it on the line.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
Number four, no unsolicited criticism outside the presence of the subject.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
What?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
You know, like, don't talk shit about people.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Behind their backs, tired to say into their face.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Number five, constant quest for adventure.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Period, period, period.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
When offered two choices, take the less routine.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
Number six, an 80% reduction of all negative humor,

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
which is easier to execute than the more enjoyable refreshing positive humor

18:11.000 --> 18:21.000
that will replace it hence.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Well, anyways, suffice to say that the policy in general dictates

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
a more light carefree image, including in my writing starting now.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Ah, that feels better.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Well, tomorrow I begin another mat dash to finish homework in class,

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
so I'll better get some ugly sleep.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Instead of beauty sleep.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
All right.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Cool music.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
This is the point where I started to go,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
this is fucked up.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Like, this is really fucked up.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
And I don't know what to say to mitigate that before reading this.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
I don't know what to do to protect myself from your judgment reading this

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
because as I was explaining to Aaron,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I don't know enough differences between me and this person

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
except that this person bothered to write this down.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
And like, I mean, I know that this person is lying to himself,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
but I don't, me saying that is not enough.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
This is a...

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
Tuesday, January 23rd, 1990, 11.14 p.m.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
I will probably never forget tonight for two reasons,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
one big, one small.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
The small reason is that I lost my virginity

19:36.000 --> 19:44.000
in the back of my mother's 83 firebird.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
The big reason is that I realized what a complete scumbag I am.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I am the worst shade of evil you can get.

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
Tonight, I played the role of the heroic super stud to the last line.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
And boy, did I do good.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I said, get your hands off of her.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
What a macho one I was.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I'm referring to this story that I've told

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
at least in another podcast, if not this one,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
where the girl I lost my virginity to,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I met her online and I went to her place

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
and for a couple dates, I went to her place and we made out.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Then her crazy mom came home, started yelling at her

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
about a new kids on the block fan club check

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
that she had taped together after being disposed of

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
as punishment for not doing her chores.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
She was 21 and had a kid.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
It was really the new kids on the block.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Her mom pulled a steak knife out of a drawer

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
and started yelling, drunk,

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
and I stepped in between this girl's mom and her

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
with my acrylic sweater and my little rat tail and my zits

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
and said, leave her alone.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
And so afterward, we went under the home bridge

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
in Milwaukee and we had sex in the back of my mom's car.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
So I'm coming home from that, I think,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
and really feeling my oats.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Feeling your oats?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Does that know what you do?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
You sell them?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Before you sell them, you kind of run over

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
and you threw your fingers a little bit.

21:15.000 --> 21:28.000
If you love oats, I love mine at 16.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
What a macho one I was.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
And it all worked.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
I was partly responsible for patching up a family tonight.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
People were happy and safe because of Dan Harmon.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
And hey, I even got the ultimate prize.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
I fucked her in the freezing cold weather in a cramped car.

21:49.000 --> 22:02.000
She came twice.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Here's the punchline.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
I don't give a shit about any of them.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm not even going to write her name on papers.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
So if my parents read this,

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
I can pretend it was someone respectable.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I don't even know what that means.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Am I in a yacht club?

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
Why am I talking like Andrew McCarthy

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
and why I was lower middle class?

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
She lived on the yacht.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Her name was Tammy.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
She existed.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
That sounds a lot like she didn't exist,

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
but I have no reason to perpetuate that.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
She existed.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
She might still exist.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Everything I did tonight

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
that made it look like I cared for her

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
was some realistic charade

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
from my mother's soap operas.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Some half-assed reflex,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
something in me that needed to play life just like on TV.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Oh, did I say half-assed?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
No way.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
It was perfect.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
All the while, in my mind,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I was up at comedy sports again,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
strutting my stuff on the astroturf stage.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
To the delight of the rabid audience

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
that demanded to see the new game called Romance.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Strutting your stuff on the astroturf.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
God knows I don't give a shit about anyone but me.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
And then I drew a stick figure

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
that is, I know, is Maxwell Artfall

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
because he has a bandana around his head.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
There are three stick figure women

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
flocking towards him.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
He's brandishing a little stick figure sword

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
and I labeled it sword of charm.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And he's holding a rope

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
about to swing away like Errol Flynn

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
and it says a rope of apathy.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Some 16-year-olds don't know how to take

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
I'll let you fuck me for the compliment it is.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Tuesday, February 13th,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
this is a little less than a month later.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
All's well that never ends.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh, he's good.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Tammy was taken away to a mental hospital.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Real good.

24:49.000 --> 24:59.000
He fucked the brains out of her.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
Tammy was taken away to a mental home.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Attempted suicide is illegal, you see.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Quite the opposite, Jeff.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
After I went to the pits of despair.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I wish I had another song queued up for that one.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
I guess I didn't have to deal with her after all.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
My hero.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
After I got off the phone with her

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
when I realized she was a manic depressive schizophrenic

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
who thought she was a Satanist.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
She did think she was a Satanist, that's the true story.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I felt bad about not giving a shit about her.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
So I wrote this eulogy

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
and it says Tammy by Dan Harmon, filled in later.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
And it's blank.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Show me?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Man.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Like I'll do it later.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Why don't you do it now?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Why don't you eulogize her now?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Roses are red, violets are blue.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Tammy, I'm so sorry I put my wiener anywhere near you.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Try to buck up wherever you are and I also apologize

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
for the size of my mom's car.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And just as the poem suggests, she's dead to me now.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Blah, blah, blah.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I mean, you know what I'm doing.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
I'm like a 60-year-old nerd who actually got laid

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and I can't deal with the idea.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Like the only person that would let me do it

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
was this person I met online

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
and she was kind of, you know, she was mentally unstable

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
and she did...

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I don't even know exactly what I'm doing.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I just know I'm coping with something,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
some energy larger than myself,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
by being a woman-hating, like, pompous asshole,

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
like an acting like, well, whatever.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
And I just really...

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
The uncomfortable thing is I just really...

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
This is me.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
It's not like Aaron said, so what?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
You haven't atoned enough with the fact

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
that this is your 16-year-old self, that you're not...

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Like, why is it embarrassing if it's not you anymore?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And I'm like, it's not that it's me.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I mean, it's been a million years,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
but it's just too uncomfortable seeing

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
the kind of core of your personality

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
laid out by someone who doesn't know

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
how to dress it up right yet.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
He knows how to dress it up,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
but his dress is a special dress

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
that belies the really gross shit underneath.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
I'm sure he could come up with a much better metaphor

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
for what I'm trying to say.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm not just getting the same things out of life

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
as everyone else.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
It's another entry later.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I'm only talking to myself on this paper,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
so I'll just be honest.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Look at everybody else.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
They are so weird.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
The way they talk, the way they write,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
the way they think, they're not like me at all.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
The only similarities I have with these people

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
are the things I've picked up,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
acquired as habit like a foreigner in America.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I need a CAT scan.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Maybe I have a tumor.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
What the fuck happened to me?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You notice I'm not talking like Frasier anymore.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It was like I needed that first orgasm

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
to get out the Shakespeare thing.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I am like the perfect person.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
Everything goes swell for me.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I have so much to be thankful for.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Maybe the problem is I don't know who to thank.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I remember I had a saying when I was around 12 or 13

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
that used to amuse people.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I'd say, thanks something.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
One would think it was a malicious taunt,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
a way of flaunting my then-fledgling agnosticism toward God.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
But it wasn't.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It was a genuine plea, an honest praise,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
a desperate attempt by me to show my appreciation

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
to whoever was in charge

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
without offending anyone by using the wrong name.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And I don't mean anyone down here.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Nothing has changed.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
I'm so confused.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I'm so confused.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
There is nothing to latch onto.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
It's like an equation in algebra with no numbers,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
just variables.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
You'll never solve it.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Never!

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
And don't think that admitting my confusion is therapeutic

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
because it doesn't do a thing for me.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Should I be depressed, happy, introverted,

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
violent, observant, ambidextrous, funny,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
young, prepared, afraid, apathetic?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
There's no one to ask.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
There never was.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Never will be anyone like me on this planet.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And who cares if there was?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
The blind leading the blind.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
No one knows, no one understands

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
the simultaneous pain and pleasure I live with.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Constantly on the brink of the insanity

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I swam in when I was younger,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
somewhere between seventh and eighth grade.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Were you a cutter?

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
No, I was a visser.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Who needs to cut themselves

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
when they can do this kind of damage on paper?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Always finding a new excuse to postpone thought

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
lest I go bonkers.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Is that nuts?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm allergic to my own mind.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
I am so confused.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
I am so confused.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
What will become of me?

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Everyone else has this determined look on their face.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
This purpose in life.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
What do I have?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
What will I ever get?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Where the fuck am I?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Who am I?

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
And how did I end up in the body of a 17-year-old?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Help.

30:13.000 --> 30:25.000
June 20th, 1990.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Haven't written in a while.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I think I'm going to write a short story

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
loosely based on my recent experiences

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
in life and love.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I'll call it...

30:35.000 --> 30:45.000
Twinkies of Inferno.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
That's been our show.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
That's not the whole title.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
There's a colon and then there's more.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
Twinkies of Inferno, The Adventures of Dapper Dan.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
Speaking of love, I think I am in love,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
but she hardly knows me.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Surprise.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And she's going to college in September.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
She is beautiful, intelligent, witty.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Here's the best part.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
She only laughs at my really good jokes.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
And when she does, she lights up the whole room.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
I'd better put her name down for future reference.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
And I do.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
She put her full name and then I put her address

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
and her phone number.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
So future historians can track her down.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
I go, what was it like to be loved by Maxwell Artfall?

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
I'll never forgive myself when she's gone.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Never.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Time for a poetry break, I say.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
And then I write a poem.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I don't think that song will work

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
with the meter of this poem.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
What do you want?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
What are you feeling?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
I don't know.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
It's kind of staccato.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
We'll do it a cappella.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Yeah.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
There's not a place that you can go.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
There's no one here you need to know.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
There's not a thing.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Do you have anything by Dr. Seuss?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
It occurs to me.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Someone had some inspiration here.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
I will not fuck you in a car.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
Upbeat, downbeat, what are you like?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
No, no, no, really.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm trying to make it work with whatever you pick.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
It'll be more of a, it'll be, this is a barrel through it

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
like a Dr. Seuss poem.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
There's not a place that you can go.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
There's no one here you need to know.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
There's not a thing that you can be.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
There's no such thing as symmetry.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
There is no balance right or wrong.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
There are no words.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
There is no song.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
There is no pleasure without pain.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
There is no sunshine while it rains.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
There's not a deed that you can do.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
There's no one else.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
There's only you.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
You're on your own.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Do what you will.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
You'll die when you have had your fill.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
You'll die.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
You'll die.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
And then you'll see.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
We'll share the answers.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
You and me.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
When you were not, I split you up.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
And now you seek to interrupt.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Go back.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Go back and tend your own.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
You'll die.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
You'll die.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
You're not alone.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
I think that's God writing that to people.

33:21.000 --> 33:30.000
There's two final entries.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I might as well complete the story.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
And then we'll bring up Spencer.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I mean, this has been a full thing.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
You've watched this.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
You don't have to sarcastically.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
I hope that was applause for Spencer and not sarcastic applause for the ending of me reading

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
my pretentious journal.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
They're one of the same.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
But you know what?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
This guy wouldn't care what you think.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
Obviously.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Are you strangling this audience with a rope of apathy right now?

33:58.000 --> 34:06.000
I use the rope to get away from the women who are drawn in by my sort of charm job.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
What?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Second to last entry.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
August 1st, 1990, 1251 AM.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
I think that indicates that I've started drinking.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I think I'm coming home later.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
I ran into some old friends tonight.

34:27.000 --> 34:33.000
I was at a stoplight in my 83 Firebird when a car pulled up next to me.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I noticed it contained,

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
Shanard Dern, Dave Harrison, Mike Musgrove.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
I rolled down my car window and said hello.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
Strangely enough, the first words out of Mike's mouth were smooth grip lube tube.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
What?

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
I then remembered that two years ago I had used that term in a speech on birth control

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
to our oral communications class.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Mike and Dave were in that class.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
They were seniors and I was a sophomore.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
Now I was a senior sitting next to them once again at a red light.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
They were drunk.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
The conversation was slacking, so I mentioned the fact that Andy Luciano,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
the sports guy on TV6 News, was at White Hen Pantry.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I said he looked like Don Ho.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
I added that his wife was a Don Ho herself.

35:25.000 --> 35:35.000
A gosh Don Ho.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
Andy doesn't really look like Don Ho.

35:42.000 --> 35:51.000
Andy looks Hawaiian and the only Hawaiian I know is Ho.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
Obviously a little tipsy going into the journal that night, I think, feeling a little...

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
All right, final entry.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
Sunday, September 30th, 1990, 11.04.04 p.m.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
A lot has happened as of late.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I will not bother to dwell.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
As of late.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
I have become senior class vice president.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
The class of 91 has failed in their last chance to win homecoming week.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
We are truly the victims of an administrative conspiracy.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
My experiences continue to push me up the ladder towards self-actualization,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
spiritual unity with thought and body and deed.

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
As I progress, I begin to realize that the top rung is connected to the goddamn bottom rung.

36:38.000 --> 36:45.000
So it's not so much climbing to the top as it is learning to deal with this round ladder.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Story circle.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
The birth of a model.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
This journal seems so incomplete with all its gaps and ambiguities.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Oh, there's enough, buddy.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
But I sense that this is it for this journal.

37:00.000 --> 37:09.000
I just had a funny feeling that maybe I'm speaking over a decade or more to my future self.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
And my wife and kids.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Oops.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
Dan, old Dan.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
Take a walk once in a while.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
I may be young, but I do not lack in wisdom.

37:31.000 --> 37:39.000
If I don't say so myself.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
I don't know when to tell you this, but at this point I was reading this in the green room and I started crying.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
Erin was watching me read and she's like, what is happening? What's going on?

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
Because she saw how upset I was with the previous entries and I'm like reading this and crying and kind of smiling a little.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
And she's like, what is it? What is it?

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
And I'm like, I finished reading it and then I started crying.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I'm not crying because it's good.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
I'm just crying because my 17-year-old self landed the perfect closer to a segment.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
I can't believe this kid did something right.

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
Perhaps you have turned to this book in a moment of need.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
It's true, I had no bits.

38:20.000 --> 38:27.000
So try to remember the spark that we share and listen to me when I say that you should hang on.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
I wonder who the chick in your life is.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Is she pretty?

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
I know you don't care, but I'm 17.

38:40.000 --> 38:47.000
I know you've loosened your stance.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
You must love her. It must be awesome.

38:51.000 --> 38:58.000
You two probably fight a little, but I'll bet she's the type that knows how to handle your little mind tricks.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
You know what I hope?

39:00.000 --> 39:06.000
I hope some rainy night you two have a fight and she kicks you out of the house or you storm out,

39:06.000 --> 39:16.000
take a walk or a ride in your Corvette.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
Now I'm crying.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
And she finds this notebook on the coffee table, open to this page,

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
and she reads it and realizes that you really are capable of love.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
You don't show it sometimes.

39:33.000 --> 39:42.000
And I hope you really did name your child Max.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Because you're both Woody Allen fans.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
And I hope that he or she is what you always dreamed of.

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
And I hope someday here she achieves what it seems you were not born to do.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
Whatever and wherever they are, give my love to your loved ones.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
And try to realize that your parents, if alive, feel the same way

40:03.000 --> 40:10.000
and would love a call from you on the visa phone.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Which now exists.

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
With that I leave this, the last entry in the first volume of my journals.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
It would have been nice if it would have been a whole year long,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
but only the calendar runs on 12 month cycles.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
People do not.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
The sun sets once again on this crazy beach.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Jesus Christ.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
The people continue to construct their strange shapes in the sand.

40:41.000 --> 40:55.000
While the tide rolls in and out.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Spencer, come up.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
If you will.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Spencer Crittenden, our DM.

41:03.000 --> 41:11.000
The positive word for it is catharsis, the bad word would be absolute draining,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
like just crippling sadness.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
From 15 to 17, I think we would all be embarrassed by anything we did.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
It's pretty embarrassing because you really stuck the landing on it.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
You really did it with a big flourish at the end.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
You John Hancocked it.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
And also you asked your older self to enjoy it.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
And also to appreciate your youthful wisdom.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
That's narcissistic.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
I may be young, but I still have some wisdom to offer.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
I'm a Spartan, you old man.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
It's like Looper.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
I hope he kills himself as he keeps fake threatening too in all his dramatic journal entries.

41:56.000 --> 42:04.000
There's that sweatiness of adolescence that kind of stinks up the joint.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
But still, you're still a pretty good writer back then.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
It's a little frasiery at points.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
There's a lot of like, you could lose the wildest things like that.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
You notice the wildest went away kind of as the sexuality emerged.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
There was still some left over, but there was a lot of like, it's like sort of a stereotype.

42:23.000 --> 42:31.000
There was a lot of like, I was like Shakespeare, but bad, until like a girl let me touch her boobies.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Yeah, and then you were a carawak baby.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah, yeah, then I turned into a bad carawak.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
There's a threshold, I don't know if anyone's ever read it, Ask the Dust.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
You become John Fonte in there for a moment,

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
and then that's the threshold into becoming an actualized writer.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Yeah.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Sorry, John Fonte, I love you.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
Anyways, so let's see, should we plunge right into T&D?

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
Probably, right? Yeah, it's already nine o'clock, so.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Should we grab our character sheets?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Yeah, do you want me to give them?

43:05.000 --> 43:12.000
This is the character sheet distribution music.

43:12.000 --> 43:22.000
The character sheets, fluttering across the stage like so many pieces of densely written upon paper.

43:22.000 --> 43:30.000
Spencer, if you will, Dungeon Master to the Stars, bring us up to date if you would.

43:30.000 --> 43:38.000
In the last adventure, our heroes, guided by the barbarian, Karen Broadleath, finally arrived at Yellowwood.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
The first of three Buttsalot encampments. Noticing something amiss,

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
the gang came to discover that the Buttsalot tribe had formed an uneasy alliance with Ashtale

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
and his Blackpaw Knowles in a bid to gain control of the entire Butz Peninsula.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
Sharpie single-handedly sought out his father, only to find that he was in Blue Camp,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
gathering with advisors to discuss the door's possible surrender.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
But when the gang got to Blue Camp, they were told barbarian lord left for Red Camp,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
the gathering place of warriors.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
Eventually, Sharpie met with an old rival, Dead Eye Duncan, who revealed that the lord snuck away from Red Camp last night

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
with a retinue of elite warriors from the tribe. But where were they headed?

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
I was pretty in the bag by then, I think. I think that might have been during a blackout.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Dead Eye Duncan?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Yeah. Dead Eye Duncan.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
An old rival.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Oh, I think I know, I remember.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
You met him?

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
So he said that my dad left with a retinue of Knowles or barbarians?

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Of elite barbarian warriors.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
And they headed where?

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
Who knows? It was presumably a secret mission of sorts.

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
You're standing in the middle of Red Camp, a few barbarians stand staring and muttering to one another.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
You're saying he told no one where he went?

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
And he left in the dead of night, the most mysterious part of night.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
You know, Quark?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Yeah.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm no wizard at this.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
But I am a wizard.

45:06.000 --> 45:15.000
And I think we need a tracker, an experienced ranger of sorts.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Yeah?

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
What about that weird homophobic chick that you didn't like?

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
Oh my God, I thought you'd never ask.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Do we have a 20 on Mulraine Sedona?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Do you have a 20, like a location?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Yeah.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
What's your 20?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
A little buddy.

45:32.000 --> 45:38.000
You look around and standing, leaning against a post in a very cool manner.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Stands Mulraine Sedona.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
You mean she was following us the whole time?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Yeah.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
She's a tracker.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
That's why we need her right now.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
I saunter over to her.

45:50.000 --> 45:59.000
Sauntering Cooley, you approach the half-elf, half-human.

45:59.000 --> 46:07.000
Role-player Erin McGathy.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Reprising her role is Mulraine Sedona.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
And in soap operas, when I was a kid, my mom used to watch Guiding Light.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
And in soap operas, I don't know if they still do this,

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
but because they shoot one every day, and so you can't avoid,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
like sometimes a main character gets really sick.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Yeah.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
And they have no choice.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
So they very often, like a guy will go,

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
like, well, where's Clifford? And then, like, this guy that you've been watching for 25 years

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
as Clifford comes in, but it's a totally different guy wearing the same sweater.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
And then this voiceover would just come in and go,

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
the part of Clifford Johnson will be played by Daniel Piloff.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
And they would just move right along.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
It was the coolest thing in the world.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
Daniel Piloff was a goodie, though.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
Hello.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Mulraine.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Sorry.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I forgot that you were with us,

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
or that you disappeared the last chapter of our campaign.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
We were good.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
We had a good time.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
It's quite all right. I was on a different adventure.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Really? You have different ones?

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Tell us about it. What happened?

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
Well, I joined a different campaign.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
What were their names?

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Their names were Surrey Cruz,

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
and Jemima Syrupsalot.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
And there were legs covered in eyes.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
There, too.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And there's a lake of fire.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Are you lying to us right now?

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Yes.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Making up names.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You just followed us and fell on.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
You just been tagging along like a stray dog.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I've been in the branches.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Adventure.

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
Well, look, as fate would have it, we have a use for you.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
Chris, you fate.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
My dad's missing.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
He didn't tell anybody where he went.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
He left in the worst part of the night.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
The dead of night.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I don't know how tracking works.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I don't know if you need to find a broken branch.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
I bet Mulray and Sedona knows exactly how tracking works.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I do.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I use these skills.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Describe them briefly.

48:17.000 --> 48:28.000
I regard the forest for signs of Buttsalot's father.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
But you were in an encampment in the plains and rolling hills.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
I was.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm such a liar.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
I use my sense of smell.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
But now I'm present, right?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
You are present.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
That's true.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
She's good.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
You attract your own presence.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
I look to the ground.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.000
Using your keen sense of smell, you detect the distinct aroma of Buttsalot warriors.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
There are butts this way.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
All right, well, lead the way.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
I lead the way.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
They lead out the door.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
The smells do.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Let's follow these smells.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I open the door.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
Because I'm a gentleman.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Thank you.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Your token is accepted gratefully.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
Well, you wouldn't notice that.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
I did.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
You did, but these guys are pretty quiet about it.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
My journal has turned everyone into a petty 15-year-old.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
A sad, existential, self-involved mutterer.

49:40.000 --> 49:47.000
Hey, why are you talking? Was wit necessary or unavoidable?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Unavoidable.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Unavoidable.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Oh, sorry.

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
I didn't detect unavoidable wit.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Oh, yeah.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Hoisted by your own petard, Sharpie.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Yeah.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
We're going to take a quick break from the D&D game.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
Because I cast a pallor over the evening with my journals.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
Raise your hand if you were my biggest fan in the world.

50:13.000 --> 50:22.000
Second to Adam, who thinks maybe, really, you have a super claim.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
You really, really adored me.

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
You felt like I was really a magnificent human being.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
And now they don't?

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
I wanted to ask him if it changed because of the journals.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
It was great.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Thanks, girlfriend.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
I like you more after your journal.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Okay.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
All right.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Hey, Seuss, right?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Yeah.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
All right.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Hey, Seuss says you like me more.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Sorry, I had to know.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
I'll edit it out.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Just concerned.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
I liked you more.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Okay.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Now everyone likes me less because I care.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
I don't know.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Yeah.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I told you I'm the same guy.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
I care what people think.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
That's the thing.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
You really are the same guy.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
We don't change, as Tolstoy said.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Identity doesn't only change that much.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
I still think women that have sex with me are bad people.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
And they all go insane afterwards.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
My goodness, we don't have sex.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
I'm too busy journaling.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Hey, guys, we're having sex right now.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
All right.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
For what?

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
No, I'm kidding.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
I'm totally kidding.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
You're doing it wrong.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
Pressing play on this Spencer DVR.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
You step out of red camp.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
You are an outside of red camp.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Now.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It is evening.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
You can't see far in the rolling hills.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Still got a track on those smells.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
You lose track of the smells.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Oh, shit.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
That track, all it did was get us out.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I examine the ground.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
You examine the ground and see several pairs of tracks.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It looks like they've been attempted to be covered up.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
But your keen eyes see through the illusion.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
I suggest that we follow the tracks that are most Buttsalot-like..

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
You suggest successfully.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Let's follow these.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
All right.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
We have torches.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Yeah.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
We better light them up, gentlemen.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Lighting your torches.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
You shed light on the path.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
It's just to keep, you know, like...

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
The Spencer suddenly hate this?

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
I'm so awkward, you guys.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Not true.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Let's follow the footprints.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I created a vortex of raw emotion.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Spencer's not immune.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
We're all feeling very adolescent.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
I just come here to hate myself every week.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
Like a sand dune shaped by the malevolent monotony.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
As many shapes as I intend to create on this sand.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
I know the tide will nexerably come.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Oh, my God.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
I was 15 too, you guys.

53:09.000 --> 53:17.000
I wish I could have found you and had you do punch-up on my journal.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
What was the character?

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
The guy with the bandana was Maxwell Artfall.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
We got to meet that guy along his campaign at some point.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
Spencer, can we draw that character up at some point?

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You know, he might have met us tragically.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
I believe I heard he drowned in pussy.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It was, you know, it was terrible.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
His rope of apathy could not get him.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
It's only so long.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
His sort of charm couldn't strike enough pussy off.

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
I heard he drove away in a corvette.

53:52.000 --> 54:02.000
The new 2050 Corvette with Bizaphone.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
I examine our surroundings about it, Spencer.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
You fail to see the footprints that Mulraine Sedona has noticed with your key.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Are we following the footprints?

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
Let's follow those crudely covered up footprints.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Throwing caution to the winds.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
You follow the footprints.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
They head south.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
East, west.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
There we go. South, west.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
What's happening tonight, Spencer?

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
I'm just sick.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I'm going to say that every day will be awesome.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
You were sick last week, you said.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I know. That's my thing now.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Are you in love?

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
Did you eat some bad dice?

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
Have you been licking your dice again?

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
Did you roll a number two earlier?

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
I did roll a number two.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
It's a nice joke.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
And a poop joke.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Sorry, Spencer.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
We are concerned about your health.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
Spencer, is it an actual ailment?

55:04.000 --> 55:13.000
I think I just have terrible anxiety crossed with steadily poisoning my body with processed and fast foods.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
It just combines to make me feel terrible all the time.

55:17.000 --> 55:23.000
I know. I'm really good at faking.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
You're like a plus 15 at faking, aren't you?

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Yeah.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Sorry, Spencer.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I'm looking at my character sheet.

55:30.000 --> 55:36.000
I noticed that you said that I'm 111 pounds and I've never been happier.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I said I'm 111 pounds.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah, but you're a dude.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Yeah, I think six pounds of that is penis.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Yeah, even lighter.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Anyway, we follow the tracks.

55:46.000 --> 55:54.000
Following the tracks to the southeast, you make very little progress.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
You track about a mile and a half before losing the trail.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
It seems like it either veers to the southeast or the southwest, but you're not sure which.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
The southeast, you can see mountains in the distance.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
The southwest, you can't make much out.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Shit.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Let's go towards the mountains, you guys.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Right?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Of course.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Come on.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Well, he's going to meet with dwarves, right?

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Yes.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
And dwarves like being taller.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
They'll do anything to...

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
They're going to be in the mountains.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Acting all tall.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I was going to say, I think they live in mountains.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Did they?

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Well, probably.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I mean, Lord of the Rings much.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
Anachronism as much?

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Well, I mean, I'm speaking as...

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Okay.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Let's go to the mountains.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
Let's head towards the mountains.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
The mountains.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
You hike for what seems like hours.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
Hey, Sharpie, you know, we've got a lot of downtime on this hike toward the mountains.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Let's do a walk and talk.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
Do you want to make a journal entry while we're on the way?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Curse of the Earth.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
It mocks my footsteps.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
I'm so perfect.

57:02.000 --> 57:09.000
I wish I could find a woman who only laughs when I'm really funny.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
Then I would give her my penis.

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
She would love it, for I am seventeen.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Nice.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Weird.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
But nice.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Be comforted.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Sorry.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Take it back.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
How long until we need to camp?

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
It's nighttime.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
You've been walking for a good five or six hours in the evening.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
I mean, you could make camp or you could press on.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
You don't know where these tracks lead, so there's not really a good timing to it.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
I think let's take a little break and let's play a game.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
Like a board game or a word game or something like that.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Sure, that's a great idea.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Yeah?

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I mean, does anybody know any games we could play?

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Well, what about like a role-playing game?

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Role-playing?

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
All right.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
What's that one where technology meets magic?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Shadow Run.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Can I be Jim Nightblade?

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
I don't see how this is constructed.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
A little too close to home there, Sharpie.

58:15.000 --> 58:22.000
It's very clever and very expressive, but ultimately I think it's going to get like a 1.7 and a Thursday at best.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
I fear for its future.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I think it should just...

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
What's the worst thing that would happen?

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I'm going to fire you off the show?

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Not this one.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Not this one.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
This is Harmontown.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
I created this.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
You created Sarah Silverman and Community too.

58:43.000 --> 58:49.000
Yeah, but this time I put Harmon right in the title.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
Like there's no way.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
What if we pretended we were a family?

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
I know I'm a man, but what if I was the mommy?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
But what if you were the daddy?

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
What if you were the uncle?

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
I probably would go into a berserk rage.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
It might actually help me to get through some of these issues.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I'm feeling really like ineffective right now.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I'm trying to track my dad.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
I left him in the first place because I didn't feel like I was enough of a man.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Now I can't even find the guy.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Do you have any stories about your dad?

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
You can tell us where we're camped at.

59:24.000 --> 59:32.000
Hey, he hit me with a magic belt.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
What sort of magic was it?

59:35.000 --> 59:43.000
It was a plus three against asses.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Oh, sweetheart.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Thanks, Mulraine.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
But it's not sensitivity that I need.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
It's to give my shit together.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Shit, shit, shit.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I'm such a fuck up.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
No, too hard on yourself.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
There's got to be a better way to track them than just conventional means.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Wandering in random directions, looking for smells.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
This is my dad.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I use...

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
If you've tried enough, you've helped enough.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But I must have something better than this.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
The father-son bond is what will lead me to him.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I take my mage dagger and I make a tiny, painless cut on my hand.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I haven't had a dream in a long time.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I hold my fist out by the torchlight and I squeeze a little drop of blood onto the dirt of my feet.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And I say...

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Ayaaaahhhhhh...

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Well, divination isn't your strong suit, but you do get the sense that he's to the southeast.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I said that.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
He's by the mountains, you guys, to the southwest.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
What?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.480
The mountains are to the southwest.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:19.120
So I avoided getting lost with my hand cutting and fake Arabic Jewish stuff.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120
Assuming you were right.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120
What time of day is it Spencer?

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.120
It is evening.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.320
It's like early, like 2, 4 a.m.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.000
We use our torches and we go to the southeast.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.400
I say extinguish the torches and travel out of the cover of night, safer to travel without

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400
lights at night, right?

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.960
Look, I'm a barbarian gnome.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.080
You are incredibly convincing in your arguments.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.240
The others are one over to your side immediately.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.240
Alright.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.560
We extinguish our torches.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.560
Extinguishing your torches.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:58.160
You stumble around in the dark, slowly but surely you head to the southeast before the

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.160
break of dawn.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:09.400
I examine our surroundings now.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.840
You see off in the distance smoke rising as if from some sort of encampment or small

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840
village.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840
Sharpie?

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840
I say we hide.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840
I'm kidding.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840
Let's head towards the encampment.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840
Look man, I was going through your journal last night while you were sleeping.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.840
Don't read it.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:31.760
You left them out, man.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.840
You're going to find out how smart I am.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.480
You talk a lot of trash when you're a 16-year-old, man.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.840
Well, I went through some shit.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.040
No one ever understood me.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.440
My roots punctured the earth but never drank freely.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440
I know, Sharpie.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.920
There was a passage that really moved me when you talked to your current self and you got

01:02:52.920 --> 01:03:00.480
to date exactly right and you wished that you would start acting like an adult.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.840
You assumed that you already would be and here you are just hiding in a bush for the

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.560
rest of your life.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:14.560
The 15-year-old hid in that journal and got hit by a magic bell.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.920
He got hit by a magic bell.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.040
Let's let that spell loose.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.560
All right, you're right.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:30.080
You could cut the tension with a knife or a stick or anything with a finger.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.720
You know what?

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.120
All that having been said, I think we head toward the encampment.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.880
Triumphantly, you raise yourself from the bushes.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.800
They enjoy progress.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.920
I feel like hitting play more than pause.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.280
I just meant we're left-wingers.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.920
We run to be encampment.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.680
Running to the encampment, you detect the unmistakable aroma of noll hide.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.840
We smell it.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.840
You smell it.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.280
I smell it.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.360
I love it.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.360
Nulls are bad.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360
I don't know.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.360
I just love smelling things.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:22.360
All right, I think this session of D&D has been bringing Adam Goldberg up on stage of

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360
D&D sessions.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.360
I think we had a no-window.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.760
You mean exciting and illuminating?

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:40.880
Which you probably set up camp and pause it and not do anything.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.800
You don't have to camp before you pause.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.440
You could pause before action.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.840
It's like a cliffhanger.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:52.480
I start to jump up into the air, freeze frame, a Toyota commercial frame.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.960
Is it like a drop bridge?

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.480
I can start charging across.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.960
Did I do it bad?

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.360
It's not you, narcissist.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360
It's me.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360
It's not you.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360
It's me.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.360
It's me.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360
No, it's not you.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360
It's not me.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360
Not everything's you.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360
The only person who's not blaming himself is Jeff.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.360
Really, I think it's him.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:15.360
I don't know what he did wrong, but maybe he wasn't supportive enough of my journal.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360
I love your journal.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360
I've been very supportive of you.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.360
I think it's these guys with the matching jackets on the front.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360
Don't throw the audience at them.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360
They're not matching.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360
They're just brown.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360
One's leather.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.360
One's like a kind of a Nailani kind of canvas business.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.360
They look great.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:36.360
Yeah, I see a CPS jacket and the other guy's got like a Nagahide thing going on.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360
I was just kidding.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.360
I made fun of it because I love it.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.360
But what happened is, I said last week in a drunken D&D playing Stupor, I was like,

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.360
oh, we should not play anymore because I wanted you to get your friend or your famous friend

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360
to come and play with us.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.360
And then we couldn't bag him as a guest.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.360
So then Spencer was like, is he coming?

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360
No, sorry.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.360
So now we're walking on a path for a whole week.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.360
It's my fault.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.360
The whole thing is my fault.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.360
I may have been an asshole when I was 16, but I have become a person who knows how to

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360
over-apologize.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:24.360
That is a coping mechanism that I have spent 30 years developing in place of math.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.360
It was fine.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360
Good job, everybody.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.360
Well, thank you, Spencer.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.360
Let's thank Erin McGathy, Aaron.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.360
Thank you very much, Aaron.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:41.360
Spencer, stay put because I personally am concerned about this growing anxiety of yours.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.360
Yeah, let's just talk to Spencer like a human being for a change.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.360
Spencer, let's learn more about him.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.360
Will your anxiety permit you to come up on stage and sit in this chair and grab the

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.360
mic so the audience can see?

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.360
Oh, yeah.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.360
I'll do that.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.360
All right.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360
Spencer, everyone.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.360
Do you need a drink?

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.360
Do you want a drink?

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.360
No, no.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.360
Okay.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.360
Spencer, what's going on, man?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.360
I'm worried about you.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.360
Last week, you said you weren't feeling well, but then you said it was anxiety.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.360
Are you agoraphobic?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:15.360
No, I'm just weird.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.360
But you've been so like, everyone that I know that's heard the podcasts or people that come

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.360
to the show, it's pretty unanimous that people really enjoy you in the show and they love

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.360
what you do.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360
Do you not feel welcome here?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360
Oh, I love it.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.360
That's why I come here.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.860
But it's like, I'm just anxious.

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.800
It doesn't make sense.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.360
It's not like there's things that are happening that are like making me anxious.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.360
It's like I'm anxious and that's making me feel weird about things that are happening.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.360
I've had that.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.700
Because of this or because of other things?

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.700
Because of Harmontown?

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700
Probably.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.260
I mean, I don't know.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.760
This is new.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760
It's not regular.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.960
It's a cause of stress, both good and bad.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.360
I mean, it just does that.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.360
Anxiety is a thing that happens.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.360
I got respiratory alkalosis.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.860
All of a sudden, my body was breathing wrong.

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:04.860
I didn't even know it.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:09.360
I was getting lightheaded and it was because I enjoyed the San Diego Zoo or something.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.360
I don't know.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.860
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:18.360
It's just your brain will turn anything around you into the anxious stuff.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.360
Are you feeling anxious right now?

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:25.860
Kind of, like now that you just brought it up.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.860
What if I really focus hard on it right now?

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.860
What if I really call it the high relief?

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:30.860
Just my anxiety?

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.860
Yeah.

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.360
Well, I think I'm defiantly pressing it down now.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360
I don't know.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.860
Well, I hope you feel safer because I feel safer having you up here on stage.

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.360
I think you create a very calming blanket in Harmontown.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.360
You're very good at what you do.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.860
Well, I'm glad if that changes, let me know.

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.860
I'll gracefully take my exit.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:56.860
If that happens, if I'm good, it's fine, you guys.

01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.860
I think you're better at what you do than Dan or I are at whatever it is we do.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:05.360
I think you get up here and actually get up and do a specific job quite well.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.860
Luckily, you've defined it for me, so.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.860
Yeah, so our jobs are undefined.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.860
We have plenty of right to be anxious.

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.360
Do you like Dream Pop, Spencer?

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.360
Yeah, yeah, no.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.360
I saw that Dino tweet.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:20.860
I do.

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.860
I enjoy Dream Pop.

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.360
I found out what kind of music I like.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.360
It's called Dream Pop.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.360
What is that?

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.360
It's kind of a synth-y aesthetic, typically melancholy emotionally,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.860
but kind of has more tone than melody sometimes.

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:39.860
I would say Mazzy Star would be like a Dream Pop playlist item.

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.860
Enos.

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:45.860
M83, particularly fond of.

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:48.860
I'd have to Wikipedia to find out the rest.

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:57.360
Does anybody have any on their phone or iPod or something we can play?

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.360
I don't think it would be.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.360
I'm just curious.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.860
I think the mood is already a two-dream poppy right now.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:09.860
We would need something more bluegrass-y to bring the show to the station.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:18.360
Is there anybody here tonight that feels like they're going through a particularly troubling period in their life?

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.860
Somebody that has a terrible problem?

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.860
Hey, Seuss' hand is already going up.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:23.860
Sorry.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.860
Sorry.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.860
It's alright.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:26.860
Hey, Seuss.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.860
Can you come up here and talk about it a little bit?

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.860
Hey, Seuss.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:38.860
Spencer will take his judging master seat.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.860
Hey, Seuss will come up.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.860
Hey, Seuss, I remember it was in the front row, I think, or second row.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:52.860
The night we interviewed everyone of all races, and he was one of the Latino people.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.860
No, I know you didn't come up.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.860
I wasn't here.

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:56.860
What?

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.860
That was the one week I missed.

01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.860
Pretty racist.

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.860
Wow.

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:04.860
Different Latino.

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.860
It's okay.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:07.860
Different Hey, Seuss.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.860
I swear to God there was a Hey, Seuss here.

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:10.860
We all look the same.

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.860
Jose, Hey, Seuss, Pedro.

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.860
I mean, it's recorded, I remember his name was Hey, Seuss, and I remember your name was

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.860
Hey, Seuss, so I made that connection.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.860
That's called racism.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.860
Or Alzheimer's.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.860
As an ambassador of Mexican people, I forgive you.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.860
Thank you.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.860
So, Nate, what's your name?

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.860
Julieta came up.

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.860
You weren't here?

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.860
No, I was here.

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.860
That's what I'm talking about.

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.860
Julieta, never mind, don't.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.860
Oh, Julieta came up a different night when we interviewed.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:39.860
Yeah.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.860
It was a different night.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.860
I'm off the hook.

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:43.860
I'm not racist.

01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.860
I'm just, yeah, I just have Alzheimer's.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:51.860
See, you experience it, but I like catalog it sort of in my mind.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.860
Oh, that's episode four.

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.860
That's episode 14.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:54.860
Yeah.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:57.860
All right, so what's the problem?

01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:02.860
It's one of those things I feel are kind of like things I'm not allowed to complain about.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.860
I have a great job.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:05.860
I get paid.

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.860
Brown people problems.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.860
Yeah, exactly.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:15.860
I feel like most people that are like 40-year-olds, Mexicans that are like outside Home Depot

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:20.860
waiting for a job, hopefully they'll like work 12 hours and then maybe get like 30 bucks.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860
But I have a steady job.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.860
I get paid $10 an hour.

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.860
I mean, it's a lot of work.

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.860
It's a lot of time.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.860
I hate it, even though it's meaningful.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.860
You know, I told you about it, SpaceX, the drilling holes in the spaceship parts.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.860
Bullshit.

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.860
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.860
You work at a spaceship?

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860
Yes.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.860
For real.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:41.860
It's no joke.

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.860
Tell them about it.

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.860
Oh, it's meaningful.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.860
I just, I don't like it.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.860
It's a lot of time.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.860
I spend a lot of the time listening to your show.

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.860
While you're working on a spaceship?

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:55.860
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.860
Like welding an X-wing onto an X-wing fighter?

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.860
What is the real image of what you do?

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.860
Is this the ship that's going to take us to the moon?

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:05.860
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.860
You're building the Harmontownship?

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:13.860
Yeah, I probably will if I continue on to this thing.

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:17.860
But let them know that you're not saying these things because you're schizophrenic.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.860
You actually have a job at where?

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.860
SpaceX, you can, I don't know.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.860
It's like a private space company, right?

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:31.860
I don't want to talk up because what you say is way more interesting than what I can say.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860
Well, I'll edit it out.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.860
You work on a spaceship.

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:35.860
That's way more interesting.

01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:39.860
And this is one of the most boring episodes of Harmontown in recorded history.

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:40.860
No, no.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:45.860
I mean, like the first episode, it was really like, I was immediately hooked because it's like, oh, whatever.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.860
I'm looking at all these podcasts.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.860
There are a lot of good ones.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.860
And then you, the first episode, you're talking about how much it sucked to be fired.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.860
I was like, whoa, like you're a really personal revelatory.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:00.860
Like this first, the first thing I heard from you and I was impressed.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:05.860
I started slowly, it became my favorite thing in the whole world.

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.860
Well, I'm honored and flattered.

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.860
But okay, so let's go.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:16.860
So you're, you're feeling unsatisfactory, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction in your job.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:23.860
Raise your hand if you're like in a creative, productive, media artsy kind of thing.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.860
Like, no?

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:27.860
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.860
And you want that career to progress, right?

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:30.860
And it's just everyone.

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:37.860
Wait, so what did you, so, wait, are you, are you saying you're creative, but you've ended up in a scientific kind of cul-de-sac in your career?

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.860
Or are you saying?

01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:43.860
Well, just, yeah, I mean, I don't, because I'm complete, I have no reason for myself to doubt.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:58.860
To be really risky, I just read a Tumblr entry that, that, I guess I'll just say, you, you believe your mom didn't love you.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.860
And, uh, yeah, yeah.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.860
Yeah, I make that joke for, well, I mean, I think my parents are a little reptilian.

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.860
A reptilian?

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:10.860
Like, kind of, like, you know, I don't, I don't, I mean, they say they love me all the time.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.860
I just don't really, I'm not really, I don't really feel that, that's probably my fault.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.860
I'm, maybe I'm the reptile.

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:21.860
I've also diagnosed myself with Aspergers and Bipolarism and anything that comes down the pike.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.860
Because it could be broken inside me.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.860
But anyways, sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.860
But, but, you're actually, did you bring that up because you feel like your mom didn't love you?

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.860
No, no, no, not at all.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.860
I feel like I have no excuse to have all this self-doubt.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.860
Oh, God, I don't either.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.860
Are you kidding?

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:45.860
No, I grew up in a fucking beautiful little neighborhood in a lower middle class suburb of Milwaukee,

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:51.860
and we played kick the can and, and, and, and, and partook of the nectar of the, of the pear trees.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:54.860
I don't know much about wildlife.

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:56.860
My point is I took advantage of it.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.860
I took advantage, we threw rocks at cars and ran away.

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.860
We caused trouble for the fuck of it because we lived in Eden, you know.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:07.860
It's like tied ropes across the street to, to try to cause accidents.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.860
And people would get out of their cars and go, what the fuck are you doing?

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.860
And we'd go, like, run away.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.860
Because that's what juveniles are doing.

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:16.860
Like they're trying.

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.860
There, there, there's two, there's not enough pain in their life.

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:23.860
I was looking at photos today and read it of what's going on in Syria.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.860
It's just blowing my mind.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:30.860
What it was particularly blowing my mind is that I was looking at pictures of it and it was functioning as entertainment.

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:35.860
I wasn't, you know, we use that word to, to, to usually mean like, haha, this is so fun.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.860
But, but you can also be being entertained by like, holy shit, that's crazy.

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:44.860
Like, which is what I was doing, looking at these pictures of like people's feet giving like, you know, all fucked up.

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.860
And like, like, like just, like everyone pointing guns at us, holes in cement walls at each other.

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:52.860
I can't tell who the good guys, the bad guys are, who they think, who, who's fighting who.

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:59.860
It's, it's, those guys are not like, you know, they're, they, they get to complain all they want, but they don't have time.

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.860
They're not doing it.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:04.860
They're like, they're like, where's my gun? Where's my bullets? Where's Fred?

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.860
Oh, he's dead.

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.860
Okay. Where's Steve then? You know, they move on.

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.860
They, they're self-actualized, but we don't want, that's not the solution.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.860
We don't want to live that life.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:18.860
You know, yeah, the people who get to sit around and whine and have first world problems, like, yeah.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.860
Well, that's most of North America.

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.860
Yeah.

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.860
It's the whole first world, you might say.

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:30.860
But, but, but we also, you know, I mean, we, we, we, we, there's guilt that comes with that, but the guilt doesn't really get you a lot of places,

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.860
except for, I think it's a-

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.860
The Harmontown.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:34.860
To-

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.860
It's, it's a hard time.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.860
Anyways, that was all to say, like, whatever, you don't have to, you've done enough,

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:45.860
kind of, what do you call it, disclaiming of whatever your complaints are.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.860
So imagine that everyone forgives you.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.860
Imagine that everyone, that no one's going to be muttering into their coffee cup.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.860
Then that guy got up and he, he should be grateful, but he's not, blah, blah, blah.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.860
Like, what's your pettiest complaint?

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.860
I told you, my gardener's doing something wrong.

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.860
You know, I, I have, I've chapped lips.

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.860
It's ruined my day.

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.860
Like, what's your, what's your, what do you wish?

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.860
It was true that isn't her.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:16.860
It's all the time I'm spending drilling holes into stuff that I could be in a room with

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:20.860
funny, awesome people making things, and I wish that was my job.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.860
I wish I could just get drunk and high and make things.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.860
Like, I've never seen an interview when you were talking about this embryo farm of, like,

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.860
all these ideas and people would just add to it, and I was so excited and, you know,

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.860
I have a Twitter account on every farm, but I don't do anything on it.

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.860
I just thought, anyway, the point is, it's that, I want that to be my job really soon.

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.860
When you were talking about Channel 101, and I started looking at all the Channel 101 things

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:51.860
and, oh shit, the, you know, it's just the, the jealousy of other people that in high

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.860
school, I, I thought that my dream was a little too grandiose, and I was like, no,

01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:01.860
I'm not going to be a great actor, blah, blah, but then like a dozen or so of my friends in

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:06.860
the same class focused and struggled, and they succeeded.

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.860
They're doing what they love.

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.860
They're traveling around the world doing this stuff, and I...

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:12.860
They're creatives?

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:13.860
Yeah, they're creators.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.860
Actors, writers.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.860
They're creatives, actors, writers, blah, blah, blah.

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:17.860
I'm not saying they're there.

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:21.860
And you made a sensible, practical decision to go down like an engineering road.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:28.860
It's so, it's so literary, or like, that you're not doing a creative thing, as far as

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.860
you're concerned, but what you're doing is drilling holes in spaceships.

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:38.860
Well, yeah, you're the kind of, you're the, you're the mechanic of space flights.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:44.860
Well, that was interesting for like three months or two months, and now I'm just, I'm still

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:45.860
there.

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.860
You're feeling kind of like, like potential regret.

01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.860
You're going like, oh, when they all, when they all put their lives on the line for their

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.860
art and their craft, meaning that they ate ramen noodles, and you know, they, you took

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.860
a more sensible path.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.860
So now your reward is you're drilling these holes, and you're thinking about Tony, who,

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.860
who may or may not be fucking Natalie Portman, or whatever it is that he's doing, whatever

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:03.860
the fantasy is.

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.860
Oh, who's fucking?

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.860
Or just having a good time.

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.860
I don't, I don't mean to make it sound shallow, the fantasy.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.860
I mean, because she's deep.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:20.860
Um, the, the, so, so, I, I, well, I have, I have good news for you.

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:28.860
The amount of time that creatives spend doing nothing, even remotely creative, is like almost

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.860
equal to the amount of time that non creatives do.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.860
Well, I know, I, I did spend four years doing nothing at all.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.860
Like I could have spent that time writing, but I, I didn't.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860
Yeah.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.860
But I, well, I mean, so, I mean, I guess what I'm saying is it's not too late.

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.860
Yeah.

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:41.860
You didn't miss anything.

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.860
Yeah.

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:45.860
And you're worried that, I think your concern might be that you would have to quit your

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.860
job because you can't, you can't drill a hole in the spaceship at the same time as you

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.860
write on a metal and notepad.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.860
Uh, uh, what if a pickle, uh, uh, uh, met a big foot?

01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:01.860
Um, but, but I, I just, I just did that at the same time as I was supposed to be entertaining

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:07.860
people, uh, which is, and for a lot of these people, this show has become like me drilling

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:08.860
holes in the spaceships.

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:15.860
Uh, but, but it becomes monotonous and quiet and, uh, uh, there's a lot of sweat involved.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.860
Bringing boring people up to talk like me.

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:20.860
No, no, I think this is, this is, this is more interesting.

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:25.860
I look at the, uh, the, the mutual anxiety association going on.

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.860
Like I, I assume like, uh, as soon as you come up here, you seem so self assured.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:32.860
Like, like, uh, you give me a patch from the spaceship you're working on.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.860
You seem like you got your shit together.

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.860
Dan, I, we all assume has a shit together.

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.860
Spencer comes up here and nails it every time.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.860
And it's just so funny to me that they're like to look at you people and people don't

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.860
assume that you guys haven't got it all together.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:49.860
Like you, you, you can look at people and assume that you guys have it all like laid

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:55.860
out as long as you just said so, which it's, it's very, uh, it's, uh, eliminating and

01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:01.860
crazy to like to find out that like, that you're, you know, like in a vortex of, uh,

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.860
anxiety right now.

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:03.860
It's a little deep down.

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.860
We believe in ourselves and believe we're great.

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.860
Like, you know, the journal entry, uh, you know, I believe in the whole like, yeah,

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:14.860
I was probably around a couple of thousands of years ago in some form spinning around

01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:19.860
with electrons, blah, blah, blah, and I have my past memories.

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:25.860
But, um, as, I think as a dungeon master, I hate myself.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:26.860
Make no mistake.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:27.860
Do you really?

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:28.860
I don't know.

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.860
This is becoming my favorite harm and turn ever.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:36.860
There's escape velocity in this show.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.860
Dreampop is very melancholy.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.860
Spencer and I both like it, but we do have our shit together.

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:43.860
We are happy people.

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.860
And, uh, I think that like, and Dino's like that too.

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:51.860
He listens to like Pink Floyd and like a really, really bitter, dark, sad, depressing stuff.

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:54.860
80% of my music at home is sad melancholy wallowing.

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:58.860
Because that's how we enjoy our, our, our, our great lives.

01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.860
Like we go like, oh, who would have thought?

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860
Yippee-ki-yay.

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.860
All the struggle.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.860
Everything.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:11.860
And I think that that's the, that's the feeling that people who are happy have kind of because

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.860
happy has to be in quotes and so does sad.

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.860
Because we've all met people who are kind of, who kind of enjoy being miserable.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.860
You know, it's hard to put up.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.860
We all have friends or hopefully not a lot of us are, have them as friends, but they're

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.860
like in your circle of friends.

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:28.860
You just kind of say about them like, yeah, he, he's, he's getting off on it.

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.860
He likes being, he likes his on wing.

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:35.860
Like he keeps saying that, you know, and, and, and, and like, but that's his thing.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.860
That's how he's happy.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:37.860
And I don't think that's you.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.860
I think the good news for you is you're actually on the precipice of making yourself happy because

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:46.860
what's the first thing that's going to happen before you make yourself happy?

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.860
It's not going to be you being happy.

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.860
It's going to be you not being happy.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.860
Otherwise the next thing wouldn't make any sense.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.860
So you're, you're, you're drilling holes in spaceships.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:59.860
You're, you're, you're raising your hand when someone says who feels this way or that way.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.860
You're, you're answering and calls us that.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.860
It's supposed to, well, it's easy.

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:07.860
It's fucking like, yeah, it's so is jumping off a cliff kind of.

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.860
So is, so is writing pickle meets a big foot.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.860
So is, uh,

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.860
No, no, no.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.860
The writing, the, the, okay.

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:14.860
You know, yeah.

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.860
This raising my hand and talking to you when the great role model, blah, blah, blah.

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:20.860
It's easy because it's following your bliss, so to speak.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:26.860
It's doing what you feel like you really want to do to go home and write something and actually

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:31.860
stare at the paper, like, uh, sitting in a room alone with God, I think was a good metaphor.

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860
You might have been blackout drunk.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.860
Um, a jail cell.

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:35.860
Jail cell.

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.860
Sorry.

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:37.860
Sorry.

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:38.860
But, uh, yeah.

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:39.860
Cause God rapes you when you write.

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.860
If you're really good at it.

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:44.860
It's like, it's a, it's a violent procedure.

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:45.860
Don't we all feel like that?

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:46.860
Like, I mean, I mean.

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.860
Yeah.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:48.860
Everyone feels like that.

01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:49.860
And that's why I don't have a,

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.860
I think that people would, people would come to the show and sit in the back of a comic

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.860
book, uh, uh, uh, store and listen to the show.

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.860
I think we're all kind of here for some reason or other, but the idea, I think we all have

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:02.860
great aspirations, but also I think that we're not arrogant enough to assume that the world

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.860
owes it to us.

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:07.860
You know, I think there's probably in this room, like the mind power and the creativity

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.860
to do something like absolutely stupendous.

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:11.860
It's, it's, it's really interesting.

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.860
It's like, like, like a town, like a colony.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.860
Like, yeah, like to sort of like form some colony, but like, like that's really like

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:22.860
from my vantage point, looking at Dan, Jesus, and Spencer and looking at like the brain

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:27.860
power and the sensitivity and the, uh, and the sensibilities, like it's very like it's

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.860
moving to me.

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.860
It's like I'm, I'm kind of choking up over here.

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:31.860
It's, it's very cool.

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:35.860
Well, let's do an experiment just because there is such a Baptist revival happening.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.860
And, uh, you know, the, the, the, you know, God forbid that, that anyone leave and go,

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:43.860
well that got a little, uh, cultish.

01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.860
Let's just commit to it.

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:50.860
We wallowed in a 15 year old's journal for a while and it brought out the 15 year old,

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.860
uh, aspirations and I think, and me, I think, I would, I would say probably in plenty of

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.860
ways.

01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.860
And there's a, there's a, uh, a melancholy kind of, uh, Morrissey vibe going on in here,

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.860
but kind of a groovy way.

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.860
All right.

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.860
People of Harmontown, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and the answer is going

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:13.860
to be Jesus at the top of your lungs.

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.860
Who has the power to create?

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:17.860
Jesus!

01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:21.860
Who has the power to make the earth a different shape?

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.860
Jesus!

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.860
Who is so entitled to happiness?

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.860
Wait.

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:37.860
I couldn't, I don't blame you, sir, because I kind of, I lost track of my thought.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:40.860
Who is so entitled to happiness?

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:41.860
Wait.

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:48.860
That, that, that he's, uh, uh, uh, uh, did, you know what, I'm making the problem worse

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.860
because it's making it.

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.860
Who has a dick the size of Montana?

01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.860
Jesus!

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.860
Who's dick is made of ink?

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:56.860
Jesus!

01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.860
Who's penis is a mighty pen?

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.860
Jesus!

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:05.860
Who's dick will write life across the paper of the universe?

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:11.860
And who's dick writing will make all the women, and even me, God, that weep when they

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:12.860
read it?

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:13.860
Jesus!

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.860
Who has a recipe for buttermilk biscuits that will make you shit yourself?

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:21.860
Actually, yeah, no, not Jesus, we need to know that because we're having a...

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:28.860
Well, Rosa Parks, I just listened to a Greg Poops article where Rosa Parks had a, like,

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.860
a pancake recipe.

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.860
Oh, right, yeah.

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.860
Peanut butter?

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:32.860
Peanut butter, yeah.

01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:33.860
Yeah, the peanut butter pancakes.

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:36.860
They're supposed to be fuck-around good pancakes, yeah.

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:41.860
Not only, uh, you know, one of the Godmothers of the Civil Rights Movement, she also had

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.860
a recipe for peanut butter pancakes that will wipe you out.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.860
Yeah, but you know what?

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.860
Who would have been better at serving civil rights if he had been there than Rosa Parks?

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:51.860
Jesus!

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:54.860
Who's smarter than Einstein?

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.860
Jesus!

01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:01.860
Who's better able to do accents on the fly than Robin Williams?

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.860
Jesus!

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:03.860
Prove it.

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.860
Prove it.

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860
Prove it.

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:06.860
Prove it.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:12.580
Who could go to SeaWorld, put his head in a whale tank, and just start babbling in dolphin

01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.580
talk, and have the dolphins understand, even though they were in the wrong tank?

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:17.580
Pacers!

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.580
Alright, now, guys, give Spencer some now.

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.580
Spencer needs it most.

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.580
He's ill.

01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.580
It's become a faith-healing tense right now.

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:28.580
Oh, but there's one over here that's having problems as well!

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:30.580
I sense the pain in his beard.

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:33.580
It grows from his face, but it hasn't detached.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.580
He's holding his fears and thoughts.

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.580
What's wrong with you, young man?

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:39.580
Nothing.

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.580
Things.

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:45.580
He has things wrong with him, but I feel the power to get those things away.

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:46.580
Hallelujah.

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:51.580
I want to ask, where do those things go when they go away?

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:52.580
They go into...

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.580
Seattle.

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:54.580
Yeah, I know what's confusing.

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.580
Why would they go into Jesus?

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:59.580
Well, some of it's in Seattle.

01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:04.580
You know, to enjoy those revivals, it actually takes a lot of work, I'm realizing.

01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.580
They're not easy.

01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:06.580
No, no.

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.580
Who has the power to do a good revival?

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:10.580
And Harvard.

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:11.580
Thank you.

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.580
Thank you.

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:20.580
Now that I'm good at doing revivals, who's going to have his things go away?

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:25.580
Who could take those things and write a little script about him?

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:30.580
Maybe a modern family speck in his spare time between drilling holes with spaceships or

01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:35.580
even an original idea that would be really bad, and then he'd show it to his most trusted

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:39.580
friends, and they'd say, this is stupid, and he'd say, I know, but he'd wake up the next

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.580
day and he'd still be alive.

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.580
Shut up and tell.

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.580
I think it might be.

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:53.580
If you want to be a writer, you got to, you know, the first step is writing.

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.580
You already know that, but, you know, the...

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:56.580
Well, now I have to.

01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:57.580
Yeah, now I have to.

01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:01.580
What a lot of people can't accept is that it starts up being a really shitty writer,

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.580
and there is no way.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:06.580
It reminds me of all the stuff I deleted.

01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:08.580
Yeah, I kind of wish I could...

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:13.580
I think that's the nice thing about that thing is like, I was not a prodigy.

01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.580
That was actually pretty...

01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:18.580
Well, the embarrassing thing is like, this is pretty good, you know, like...

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:23.580
Well, there were bad things about it that got corrected over a long, long time, but

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.580
also, whatever, there's conflicting messages there.

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:29.580
One message is, it's never too late to start.

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:33.580
One message is, it could happen overnight, but not until you do it shitty for a while.

01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:36.580
Another message is, like, it takes a long time, blah, blah, blah.

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:41.580
I mean, the only things that you can control are the things that you do the next day.

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.580
So, you're drilling a hole in a spaceship.

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:47.580
You know, I hope it doesn't have to come to a big decision to either, like, quit and

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:51.580
cast your life into chaos and better, because that's not really...

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:52.580
Writing as a...

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.580
Being creative as a crew, it doesn't really earn that.

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:57.580
Like, that's just something people do because they have to do it.

01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:01.580
Like, it doesn't necessarily, like, need that as fuel.

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:06.580
You could actually conceivably, with enough concern about it, you could maybe drill some

01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:10.580
holes in some spaceships and, like, Saturday or something, like, something.

01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:12.580
Like, chip away at it.

01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:16.580
Well, now that you've built up my confidence, I've been wanting to...

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:21.580
I had a dream where I played a 16-bit video game designed by you.

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.580
And I even played the beginning.

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.580
So, that's one thing I want you to do.

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.580
I want you to make it like a flash video game.

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:27.580
You should do it.

01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.580
You know, you're better.

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.580
All right.

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.580
And that video game will be called...

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.580
Hey, Seuss!

01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.580
All right.

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.580
That's not a real eyeball grabber.

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.580
Maybe we'll put some tits on the cover.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.580
Jesus, the video game.

01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:47.580
In 16 bits.

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:51.580
Wreck it, Jesus.

01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:53.580
All right, it's Hey, Seuss, everybody.

01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:56.580
Give him a hand.

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.580
I am a drink, maybe.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.580
Spencer, do you feel any better?

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:06.580
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better, you guys.

01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:07.580
I don't get it.

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.580
Was that sarcasm or...?

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.580
I don't know.

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.580
Think of, like, the right thing.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.580
You don't feel any better is what you're saying.

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.580
No, I feel better physically.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.580
And mentally.

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:24.580
Is there anything Dan or I or the harmonians here tonight could do

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:29.580
to make you feel spiritually or psychically better tonight?

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:32.580
When you're subscribing to the podcast on iTunes

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:36.580
and writing incredible ratings, like five-star reviews,

01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:41.580
take a tall glass of Kettle One and enjoy it.

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:46.580
All right, well, everybody, listen.

01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:51.580
Keep your feet on the side of a tree.

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:55.580
Keep your hands on a dog.

01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.580
And keep your eyes looking at the stars.

01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.580
Well, one of them.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.580
Keep your other eye looking at, like, a lizard

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:05.580
that will keep inspiring you

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.580
to make your eyes able to point two different directions.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.580
Let me go back to your feet,

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.580
because I should do those up, too.

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:15.580
The first three toes are one of your feet.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.580
And, honey, 15-year-old Dan, it's time for school.

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.580
It's time for school, Dan.

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.580
You dream the whole thing.

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:26.580
I dreamt I was a 40-year-old fat man

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:28.580
with a hot girlfriend,

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:31.580
which I really care about because I'm 17,

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.580
and I know he doesn't care about,

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.580
with a bunch of people that like him

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.580
and always laugh at everything he says.

01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.580
Thank you for coming to Iron Town, everybody.

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.580
Thank you all for coming.

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:43.580
Thank you.

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.580
I'd like to thank you.

01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:47.580
Hey, sis.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.580
Spencer, everybody.

01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:50.580
One more time for Spencer Crane.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.580
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:55.580
Also, Katie Lathine, Zac McKeever, Emily Gordon,

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.580
Daniel Cramer, Dustin Marshall, Moe,

01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.580
Fathelbab, Jenny Fine, and Shahruz Shaukat.

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:03.580
One more time for the mayor of Iron Town, Dan Harmon.

01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:09.580
Don't do your neon light solution

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:16.580
for you, Jenny Do.

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:42.580
Thank you all.
