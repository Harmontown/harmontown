{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.000\nAre you ready to be the happiest you've ever been in your entire life?\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:19.000\nWelcome to Harmontown, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:28.000\nPlease welcome to stage the third Harmontown, Mr. Daniel Drake's Harmon.\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:35.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, kid in the city, fuck your momma, kid in the city, fuck your momma.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:36.000\nAlright.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:38.000\nWe gotta do a lightning fast.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:45.000\nIt's good that they, yeah, they didn't sit anybody down in the VIP, the tuba section.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:49.000\nOh really, these are more expensive down here?\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:57.000\nAlright, for podcast listeners we are in a room that, for the sake of description, it's like a beautiful,\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:04.000\nlike, kind of expensive beachwood thrust has been placed in the middle of a driver's ed class.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:14.000\nAnd there's like an orchestra pit with VIP booths that our nerdy audience could not afford to sit in.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:21.000\nWell that means I should probably, that doesn't put me out of the light, right?\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:23.000\nI'll be in the dark.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:26.000\nFor the listeners, this club has a runway.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nYeah, I just moved down the thrust.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nIt's like a runway.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nIt's like a Katy Perry concert.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:34.000\nHello Kansas City.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:39.000\nWe have a limited time here at the strip mall.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:43.000\nWe gotta, there's another show coming out next.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:47.000\nHow many of you are from Kansas City?\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:50.000\nAnd so that means the rest of you, like, traveled.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nWho drove the farthest?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:54.000\nI heard Omaha.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:55.000\nTulsa.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:56.000\nTulsa?\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:58.000\nIs Tulsa further than Omaha?\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nAll right, Tulsa's got us beat.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.000\nI realize that's a tough spot that I put you in when I'm like, who drove the furthest?\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.000\nThere's like an unspoken edge to that question.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nLike, who lives with their mom the most?\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:19.000\nBut I thank you so much, anybody, that came even five minutes, even if you walked here.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nEven if you were forced to be here.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nThank you for being here.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nEverybody eat at that dinosaur place?\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nThat's pretty badass.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:36.000\nI couldn't believe how high I forgot to get before I ate there.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:42.000\nI kept wondering, I know a lot of people probably smoke a lot of pot and go to the dinosaur place.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nA lot of people probably take mushrooms and go to the dinosaur place.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nBut I kept wondering, does everyone ever do co-care?\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:58.000\nLike an executive luncheon, does anybody meet in the bathroom there and do a bump under a stegosaurus tail?\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nHey, Dan.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nYes, Aaron?\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:29.000\nOkay, stay on that thigh.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nHalf of it is in the state of Kansas.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nHalf of your mama took down my pants.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:40.000\nSuck my dick, lick my nuts, fingered my nose, put it in my butt.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nSo I had a booger in my butt.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nIt was gross, it was gross.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nSorry.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:50.000\nSorry about that.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nYeah, thank you.\n\n03:54.000 --> 04:05.000\nI don't know if I'm supposed to be distracted by this or not, but I keep imagining the show from the perspective of the people that work here.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nYou guys don't seem like regular clients of this particular place.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:17.000\nI keep putting myself in their shoes and going, what is a podcast, what is this show, what is going on?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nThey put it on the door that it's a nationally televised podcast.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:29.000\nFunny on two levels, not televised, not just national.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:34.000\nSo they've got to be confused right now.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nCan I ask this question?\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:43.000\nI know like 60 of you bought tickets online, which I assume means 60 of you listened to the podcast.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:52.000\nHow many of you by applause are in that other category of people that wandered in here wondering what kind of comedy?\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nIt's kind of like this back wall.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:59.000\nThere's like a tear, there's like a pit, there's a pit of nerds.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:08.000\nAnd then there's a Sesame Street brick wall with comics that are doing the next show and people from Kansas City.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:13.000\nBut welcome, welcome, we welcome you. I hope you like livestock on stage.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:17.000\nThat's how we close our show.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:23.000\nSo I don't understand, is there anybody that works in that local government here that can explain how the...\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:29.000\nIsn't your city split down the middle and half of it's in one state and half of it's in the other?\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:39.000\nIs there anybody that is kind of like an expert on how that works and why that wants to come up and explain that to me?\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:46.000\nYou just hate it, you're just beleaguered by the civil war that is happening in Kansas City.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:50.000\nAll right, fine. Guess what? I don't care. I pretended to care for a second.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nI don't care that your city split down the middle between two states.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:59.000\nI grew up thinking that there were two Kansas cities, that that's why there was a Kansas City, Missouri, and a Kansas City, Kansas.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nI thought that there was actually just two places called Kansas City.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:08.000\nAnd I found out, I think today, that... oh, okay, there's a... yeah, so...\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:13.000\nAll right, so there's a lot of tension between the halves of the cities.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd what I've done is I've made the mistake of calling it one city, I should call it two.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:27.000\nYou guys are the separatists, you're the people who believe that the other Kansas City should get up and walk away.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nAnd most of you drove from Omaha, okay. No one cares.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nHow's Nebraska?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:43.000\nEverybody hates where they're from. Everybody wants to be a hero. Everybody wants to just go away and kill themselves.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:49.000\nOr rescue a family of orphans from a fire. No one wants to just be where they're from.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:55.000\nAnd nobody out in the audience is waving a giant foam finger for anything.\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:04.000\nI'm worried tonight because I was looking at my story circle for those of you who are familiar with that.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:10.000\nFor the back row, I'm only famous for making a TV show that I got fired off of.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:14.000\nAnd then just barely. Only 3 million people watch that.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nSo then I'm famous for getting fired off of it.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:25.000\nAnd then during the time that I was making it, this story circle that I had developed years ago kind of came to light like this.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nAnd I'm kind of obsessed with it, like what makes a story and stuff.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd we're doing this tour documentary about the show, about me going on the road, talking about nothing and not having an act.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:40.000\nAnd I've been placing myself on this circle.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:50.000\nAnd the truth of the matter is that on my story circle, according to my arithmetic, tonight represents a horrible death.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:56.000\nTonight is a night of horrible, like something bad is going to happen.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:00.000\nSomething bad is already happening. Yes, thank you, comics.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nI understand that compared to what you do, this is already death.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nLike that you would have already gone, okay, I did a bad job, I'm fired.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:13.000\nBut podcasting is different. It's different. It's more like NPR.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:21.000\nIt's not, you know, if 20 minutes of silence goes by, it might be captivating.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nMaybe it's not hilarious.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\nAlso, this room is more brightly lit than anywhere I've ever been in my entire life.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nIf the show goes poorly, it won't be a secret.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nEveryone's face.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:40.000\nHello, ma'am, with a beautiful spearmint scarf over there, I like that.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:44.000\nAlso the cloud tie-dye in the back, I like that. You can see all the colors.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nI'm demonstrating how bright it is.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:55.000\nWe can see the ghost of impending doom hanging over, standing in the back, shaking his head, giving a thumbs down.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:59.000\nWe can see all the way. We don't like it when we can see nothing.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nI mean, that's no good either.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:05.000\nBut anyways, what was I talking about, Erin?\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:09.000\nYou were talking about...\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nDeath, right.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:15.000\nOh, okay, death, yeah.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:20.000\nYo, yo, yo, rapping, rapping about death.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:26.000\nHold your breath, good, and go six feet under. Fuck your mama like I was a blundering.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:32.000\nLookin' where to put my dick, couldn't find a place, picked a kickery stick instead of my penis.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:37.000\nFucked your mama like Duke Zahazard's Enos. It was a character from the 80s.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nI fucked your mama like she was just another lady, but she wasn't.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:45.000\nHer ass was fine. I fucked your mama down the county line.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:51.000\nRoscoe Coltrane going, Duke, Duke, Duke, fuck his mama, Duke, Duke, Duke.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:54.000\nAlright.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nYeah.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:03.000\nFor the guys in the back who don't know what the show is, that's not part of the show.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nWe're only doing that because we're in Kansas City.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:10.000\nWe heard you like barbecue and freestyle rapping.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:15.000\nSo we're just doing it to make you comfortable. These guys are like, what's he doing? Why is he doing that?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nHe's selling out the show. Stop rapping about Enos.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:25.000\nA couple of Duke Zahazard references in there. I apologize, everyone's 25. I didn't mean to do that.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nThere was a movie, maybe you can Google it.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nDeath.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:36.000\nTonight it's going to happen. You're going to witness a transformation, hopefully.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:41.000\nI think it's going to come at the hands of Spencer, because I was thinking about it.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nWe should bring him up here.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nSpencer, can you come out?\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:48.000\nLet's bring Spencer to the stage!\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nKansas City.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nRight?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nSpencer, this is your first hair down show.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nMy first what?\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nFirst show with your hair down.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nJesus.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nParty Jesus. You're letting it loose for Kansas City.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nFat frat boy Jesus.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nGoing to die on stage.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:21.000\nFor you guys in the back, Spencer is the podcast's Dungeon Master. Sold you yet?\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nSold you yet?\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\nSound a little more marketable?\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nWe have a Dungeon Master. We play Dungeons and Dragons on the show.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:43.000\nSpencer, I'm starting to think, in accordance with my story model, he is the hero of the tour,\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:47.000\nbecause unlike me, he is actually going through changes, aren't you, Spencer?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:51.000\nYeah, yeah. I hit puberty a couple days ago.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nIt came on fast.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nYeah.\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:04.000\nBut you have been wished across a threshold by a horrible, wealthy fat guy and stuck in a tour bus that he rented, so he could go out and masturbate on stage.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:12.000\nAnd you yourself are experiencing new things and adapting and changing, and we're almost done with the tour and I haven't changed in any way.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:18.000\nSo it occurred to me this morning that I must be the villain and Spencer must be the hero, which means that Spencer must die.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nOr that I must die.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd that must either happen in Dungeons and Dragons, or it will happen just in the show.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:30.000\nSo Spencer, let me have it. Lay waste to me.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nWhat? That's not...\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:38.000\nUndo me at the seams. Tell me what my problem is. Tell me why I'm a piece of shit.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:46.000\nYou want to know what your problem is. You're so generous that you bought me a David Buster's card.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:51.000\nBut it was only for...\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nThat was the false death gone.\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:04.000\nOkay, so when you come to the ticket window, do they go, okay, your seat's in the room, but do you want it to be in the front?\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nBecause that'll cost $5 extra.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:18.000\nAnd do they offer it, or that was just offered online and you just didn't check the box that said, I would like the luxury Coke booth.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nAlright. It's such wasted space.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:27.000\nIs it possible to have just one person in each of these booths? Would that be weird?\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nLet's pick some VIPs.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nOkay, we got a VIP there.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:38.000\nWe got a little VIP music. You came to Harmontown and you thought that...\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:43.000\nWe don't want to separate couples. You look like you came here by yourself, no offense.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nAre you single and want to boot alone to watch Harmontown?\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:53.000\nWould you be willing to come up and talk to us first? We don't bully anybody at Harmontown. Can I help you up?\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:57.000\nWe don't bring people up to pick on them. What's your name, sir?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nMy name is Kyle.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nAre you one of the people that you're not familiar with the podcast?\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nOh, no. No, I'm very familiar with it.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nOh, you are? Okay.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:11.000\nNo, no, no, no. You came here by yourself?\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:15.000\nYeah, I couldn't get my wife to come after she listened.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nI should not have let her listen.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nWhat episode did your wife listen to?\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:27.000\nIt was Pittsburgh.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nIt wasn't our relationship that minute.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nNo, no, no. She might have come if she'd heard that part.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nTell us the exact point where she said...\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nShe didn't like the fucking mama raps.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nWhat's her name?\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nApril.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nApril! More like...\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nApril!\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nCheck it!\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:51.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nApril heard you don't like my show.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:57.000\nI fucked your mama and here's how it goes. What's your mom's name?\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nPat.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nI fucked your mama, Pat.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nI fucked her so hard she started to ignore.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nShe flattened her out like she was a pancake.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nFucked your...\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nFucked Pat and gave her man-cake batter.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nOn her face.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\nI fucked Pat so hard she turned it to a different race.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nShe medically altered.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nFucked her toe, my dick faltered.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nSorry, sorry.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nNo, okay, well, no, no.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nSweetie, please.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nNo, no, I said stop.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nAgain?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nSweetie, please.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:29.000\nI fucked Pat.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nI fucked Pat.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nOutro? Thanks for coming.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nNo, no, Sweetie, no.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nFor God's sake.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nWe just got to know Kyle.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nOkay.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nAll right.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nHere comes the April monster.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nWe heard the fog guard.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nAll right, Kyle.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nOh, okay.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nYeah, can you do the April monster?\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nYou hear the sounds of far-off showers.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nApril approaches.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nWith a steady foot and clever hand,\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:59.000\nyou're sure that May flowers are soon to follow.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nAll right, great.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nAll right, Kyle, why don't you sit in the VIP booth to the right?\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nThank you, Kyle.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:11.000\nI assume you should keep it clean and set up for...\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.000\nDon't make them mad.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.000\nDon't get popcorn everywhere.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:22.000\nDan, should we reserve the VIP section for people who weren't able to get their\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nfriends to come because they don't like the show?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nYes, yes, exactly.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:30.000\nIs there anyone else who had to come alone because everyone but them hates the thing?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nLet's start from the back.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nWait, no, no, no.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nIt'll be okay.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nTim.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nTim, come on up.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:46.000\nThis is Tim's song.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nAre you okay coming up and talking to us?\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nYeah.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nOkay, come on up, Tim.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nTim knows about that.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nOkay, Tim, you're from Kansas City, or...?\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nI moved here in May, so...\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nOkay.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nWhy'd you move?\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nI got a job here.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nWhere were you before that?\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nI was in college.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nOkay.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nSo you got...\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nAt Planet College?\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:10.000\nOr in a location?\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nWhere were you going to college?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nAt the University of Missouri in Columbia.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nWow.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nSo obviously...\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nTyler, I'm so sorry.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nNow I understand why you didn't say anything.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nAll right.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nYou'll live.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nIt seems like...\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nAll right.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nWe love everyone in Harmontown.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:35.000\nI'm starting to think that really giving these guys the time of their lives would just talk\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nshit about Missouri all night.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nBut you would know that I didn't mean it.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:44.000\nI would just be wandering into this conflict you're having.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\nBecause from my perspective, as the wandering hero, it's a Liliputian conflict.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nIt doesn't...\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nI don't know what it means.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nIt's like...\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:54.000\nIf it makes you guys feel better, it seems adorable.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nI do like it.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nI wish I had something like that with...\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nThe Kansas City, Missouri...\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:04.000\nThe Kansas, Missouri few does start at the Civil War, which is the favorite of Harmontown.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nOh, okay.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nYeah, I've been talking about the Civil War a lot on this tour.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nAll right, it was Ken.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nIs that it?\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nTim, that's close enough on my part.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nAll right, you want to take the VIP booth to the left?\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:16.000\nAnd please keep it clean.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nDon't...\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nWe've got Tim and Kyle, right?\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nIs there anyone else?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nAll right.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nIs there to be a VIP?\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nDo you guys feel...\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nDoes this feel nice?\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nIs it comfortable?\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nHow much more would you pay for this booth?\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nOkay, you can't put a price on it.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nWell, you didn't.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nYou didn't buy the fucking booth.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nYou guys were offered it.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:43.000\nYou cheaped out, but you're getting a taste because you came here alone.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:48.000\nIf we put a whole family in these booths, then we'd be stealing money from the venue.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:53.000\nBut because you're alone, you won't be able to share it with anybody, so it's like it didn't happen.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:59.000\nFor the listener, we've said this already, but there are four booths that seem like the only seats in the entire...\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:04.000\nYeah, but mathematically, if we take that time to put one person in each booth, then we have to leave.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nThen that's the show.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:08.000\nLike, we only have a certain amount of time up here.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nI like Tim and Kyle.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nThey're kind of like Stattler and Waldorf.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nBut so was the Hindenburg.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nAlright, so we got some buddies up here.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nThey're VIPs.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nIt's good to see VIPs at the show.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nThat's good.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nLet's see.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nAlright, who is in the most pain tonight?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:38.000\nLike the most devastating, maybe not physical, maybe emotional...\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nI just saw a woman with a shaker head now.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nAnd that's her, right?\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:48.000\nAlright, you want to come up here and share your pain?\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nOh, you just quit smoking.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nI quit smoking eight years ago. I used to smoke two packs a day.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nDo you want me to hypnotize you?\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nYeah, come on down.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:01.000\nOkay, can we find some cosmic music?\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nNo, we don't have any, do we?\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:10.000\nIs there a woman in the audience who thinks she can pull off a reasonable enya?\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:13.000\nA reasonable copyright-free...\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nThere's a guy raising his hand.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nLet's bring him up.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.000\nThis is exactly how I dressed on prom night, but I wasn't going anywhere.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nI'm Jeff's understudy.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nJeff Davis is understudy? What's your name?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nRyan.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nIt's like John Crier in Hiding Out.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nI get Matthew Broderick a lot.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nOh, Ryan, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nYeah, there's a little Crier, a little Broderick.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nAll Jeff Davis.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nAll Rock and Roll.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nOh, sorry, what's your name?\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nRyan, yeah.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nRyan, okay.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nCan we give him a special enya mic?\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nThere you go.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nAnd your name was, I forgot, already?\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nIan.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nIan?\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nOkay.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nWere you hoping that smoke would come out?\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:02.000\nAll right, we're going to, Ian, we're going to take you now, you just sit right there\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:07.000\nand just let, you're just going to, you're never going to smoke again after this, okay?\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:13.000\nOkay, I need, if there's anyone, I'm not going to hold my breath, but if anyone's controlling\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:16.000\nthe house lights, we need to bring them down a little bit.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nOkay, I didn't, yeah.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nWe're on the face of the sun and no one is paying attention to the show.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nWho works here?\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nI...\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nWe're a lot, we're Ashki kids.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nYeah, we're, all right.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nSo maybe just...\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nJust give him some hot pockets in a $5 bill.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nMaybe just, maybe just close your eyes.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.000\nAnd Ryan?\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nYeah.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:40.000\nOkay, start, start and yank, but in a copyright free way.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nOkay.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nWho can say what...\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nAll right, too many lyrics.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nToo many lyrics.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nI just need, just need like tones.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nJust like meditative tones.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nWell, maybe, may I suggest something?\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nBecause he's dressed like Jeff Davis.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nOkay.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nAnd he's dressed like his understudy.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nCan we just switch places?\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nI can be the audience volunteer.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nYeah.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nAnd I'll do some tones.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nOh, you want to control?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nOkay.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nAnd he can control.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nAll right, okay.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nAll right.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nThat's good, Erin.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nThank you.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nThat's smart thinking.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nThat's good controlling.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:15.000\nRealizing that he, of course, John Crier should be controlling,\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:18.000\nand you should be the woman.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nWell, that sounds sexist.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nThere's a chance that's to me all the time,\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nand you should be the woman.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nOf course.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nYou should be eating ice cream,\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nand you should be the woman, meaning give me a spoon.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nOkay.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nSo, John Crier, you take it easy for a second.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nGot it.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nErin, you start taking us on a cosmic journey.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nEveryone else, lower the house lights in your mind.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:40.000\nLiterally, no one is paying attention to the show.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nWe're going to help.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nLet's see.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nOh, okay.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nYeah.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nWe had some go out.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nNice.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nCool.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nAnd this is to help.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nGod damn it.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nRyan, what was your name?\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nKen.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nIan.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nIan.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nIan.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nIan.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.000\nYou are losing control of your body.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nNot in a poopy way.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nIan.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nIan.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nIan.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nIan.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nIan.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nIan.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nIan.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nIan.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nIan.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nIan.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nIan.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nIan.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nIan.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nIan.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:15.000\nIan.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nIan.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nIan.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nIan.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nIan.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nIan.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nIan.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nIan.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nIan.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nIan.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nIan.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nIan.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nIan.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nIan.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nIan.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nIan.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\nIan.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nIan.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nIan.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nIan.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nIan.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nIan.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nIan.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nIan.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nIan.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nIan.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nIan.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nIan.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nIan.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nIan.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nIan.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:46.000\nIan.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:47.000\nIan.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:48.000\nIan.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nIan.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:56.080\nto be sorry, just don't do it again. Sorry Ian, try to relax. There are scorpions crawling\n\n23:56.080 --> 24:05.080\nup your arm. The largest of them, the mother, crawls over your ear at which point the baby\n\n24:05.080 --> 24:12.340\nis on her underbelly. All eight million of them go into your inner ear canal and lay\n\n24:12.340 --> 24:21.520\neggs in your brain. That's right, baby scorpions lay eggs only in a smoker's brain. Now they're\n\n24:21.520 --> 24:29.680\nhatching Ian, your brain is all scorpions. You return to earth, craving nicotine, bent\n\n24:29.680 --> 24:37.120\non a murderous spree, you sting your family, you sting your friends, you sting everyone.\n\n24:37.120 --> 24:47.220\nIt's a metaphor for secondhand smoke. But now Ian, now you come to a giant apple pie and\n\n24:47.220 --> 24:53.680\nyou climb inside it and you eat the whole thing because you quit smoking. And every\n\n24:53.680 --> 25:08.800\ntime you quit smoking, you get a giant apple pie. Ryan? Ian? No, Ian, sorry. Ian, there's\n\n25:08.800 --> 25:13.760\na monster truck coming up the street to the apple pie. It pulls up outside the apple\n\n25:13.760 --> 25:24.800\npie. Hulk Hogan gets out. He gives you one of his patented Hulk Hogan hand gestures. You\n\n25:24.800 --> 25:31.360\ncan tell you're cool with him now. He doesn't smoke either. Did he die? Did Hulk Hogan die?\n\n25:31.360 --> 25:35.080\nNo, he's alive. He's alive. Okay, all right. That's cool. If he died, he's a ghost. He's\n\n25:35.080 --> 25:41.840\njust involved in a scandal and a sex scandal, but he's fine. You take Hulk Hogan by the hand\n\n25:41.840 --> 25:49.720\nand you go into a field, Ian, and you play Frisbee. And he takes you to a water fountain\n\n25:49.720 --> 25:56.400\nand you drink cool, fresh, refreshing water with Hulk Hogan. And then you notice as you're\n\n25:56.400 --> 26:04.440\ndrinking that he's touching you, but you don't care because you look around and you see from\n\n26:04.440 --> 26:10.040\na nearby calendar sculpture that it's the year 2080 and homosexuality is not taboo\n\n26:10.040 --> 26:15.600\nanymore. It's a hologram statue. It's designed so that you can look at it from any angle,\n\n26:15.600 --> 26:22.000\nso it's not coincidence that you see it. It's not bad story writing on my part. It's just\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.800\nhow it works. You're in the year 2080 and Hulk Hogan is rubbing your crotch as you drink\n\n26:25.800 --> 26:33.800\ncool water. Your belly's full of apple pie and you have an orgasm. Now, wake up. Do\n\n26:33.800 --> 26:43.720\nyou want a cigarette, Ian? All right. Well, pretend he said no. You want one, but you\n\n26:43.720 --> 26:48.520\nknow that baby scorpions are going to lay eggs in your brain. All right. I'm glad I\n\n26:48.520 --> 26:52.720\ncould help, Ian. Spencer, how are we doing on time? Do we have to play Dungeons & Dragons?\n\n26:52.720 --> 26:55.320\nOh, shit. I'm sorry. I should be asking where I am.\n\n26:55.320 --> 27:04.880\nIt's 6.34. That's a time that... What you're realizing now is that we have not been up\n\n27:04.880 --> 27:11.240\nhere for very long. Usually, time goes so much faster. I don't know why.\n\n27:11.240 --> 27:18.320\nRyan, if you could have anything, what do you want? What is your dream?\n\n27:18.320 --> 27:24.760\nWhat's my dream? I actually want to... I want to do stand-up comedy and I want to do...\n\n27:24.760 --> 27:28.920\nI want to be a writer for TV, actually. That's why I'm here.\n\n27:28.920 --> 27:34.760\nDo you have a strong two minutes, Ryan? Yeah. Yeah, I could do two.\n\n27:34.760 --> 27:39.320\nDo you want to come out in the thrust and do them to an audience of Kansas City Comics?\n\n27:39.320 --> 27:48.560\nAll right. Here, I'll do you the favor. I'll give you a horrible opener so that the bar\n\n27:48.560 --> 27:56.400\nis lowered for you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nickelbackers.\n\n27:56.400 --> 28:03.640\nPlease remember, Rob Schneider will be here next week, the star of Sheeps of Heaven.\n\n28:03.640 --> 28:07.520\nAnd on all next week, it's ladies' night. All the ladies get to be ladies. You don't\n\n28:07.520 --> 28:17.840\nget anything for free. We just won't punch you. You don't have to boo that.\n\n28:17.840 --> 28:23.280\nWe're not proud of our policies here, ma'am, at Nickelbackers.\n\n28:23.280 --> 28:28.320\nNow coming to the stage, the opener for tonight's act. It's not you, Ryan. It's a different guy.\n\n28:28.320 --> 28:38.000\nSchmaggle Flangehand! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You ever notice the Chinese people are inferior?\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:43.480\nWhoa! What are they eating? Why are they eating it? Whoa!\n\n28:43.480 --> 28:50.040\nOkay, come on now. What are you talking about? Knock, knock. Who's there? Fuck you, I'm racist.\n\n28:50.040 --> 28:58.640\nWhoa! I got AIDS in my blood. I'm spraying it on the audience. Oh! It's like Gallagher,\n\n28:58.640 --> 29:05.440\nbut you got AIDS now. Whoa! Okay, well, I'd like to settle it down for a minute and tell\n\n29:05.440 --> 29:11.080\nyou about my wife, Veronica. She's struggling with breast cancer, and there's a table of\n\n29:11.080 --> 29:16.640\nt-shirts in the back. I'd really like you to buy them. Oh, thank you very much. I've\n\n29:16.640 --> 29:22.240\nreceived a note that all your cars have been stolen, and wherever they are, there's people\n\n29:22.240 --> 29:29.760\nsleeping in them. But the people sleeping in them are covered with little tiny spikes\n\n29:29.760 --> 29:36.800\nfilled with poison. So let them be, and then you'll be okay, and you just need a new car,\n\n29:36.800 --> 29:42.920\nand all your lives are ruined. Also, you have AIDS. All right, well, I guess I did pretty\n\n29:42.920 --> 29:47.280\npoorly with my stand-up act, but we're going to bring a new guy to the stage. He's going\n\n29:47.280 --> 29:54.720\nto do two strong minutes of stand-up, because he's a well-respected stand-up comic. He's\n\n29:54.720 --> 30:05.280\nperformed at clubs and colleges all over the thing of a bomb. Please welcome Ryan Solomon!\n\n30:05.280 --> 30:10.600\nHi, guys. Thanks for coming out here. You guys look great. I don't know about you guys.\n\n30:10.600 --> 30:15.160\nEvery time I see Channing Tatum in a movie, all I can think is how much better Ryan Gosling\n\n30:15.160 --> 30:21.520\nwould have been. And every time I kiss my wife, all I can think is how much better Ryan Gosling\n\n30:21.520 --> 30:26.800\nwould have been. And when I say that, people usually ask me, and by people I mean my wife,\n\n30:26.800 --> 30:30.520\nRyan, do you mean you can't help but think of how much better Ryan Gosling would have\n\n30:30.520 --> 30:35.480\nbeen at kissing you, or how much better Ryan Gosling would have been at kissing your wife?\n\n30:35.480 --> 30:42.360\nAnd the answer is either. Both. In an ideal world, my wife and I would never kiss each\n\n30:42.360 --> 30:50.040\nother. There would just be two Ryan Goslings sharing a tender embrace. Have you guys ever\n\n30:50.040 --> 30:54.320\ndone something horrible, like just so bad you just never wanted to tell anybody? No,\n\n30:54.320 --> 31:00.120\ngood. You're perfect. Thank you. Well, for the rest of you, you should do something like\n\n31:00.120 --> 31:03.520\nterrible. You just don't want to even bring up again, like you're messing around with\n\n31:03.520 --> 31:08.240\nsome friends in the woods, and you push one, and he falls, and he breaks his nose, and\n\n31:08.240 --> 31:14.560\nthere's so much blood that you just run away. That didn't happen. Or maybe like in college,\n\n31:14.560 --> 31:18.680\na bunch of girls run into your dorm room and steal a bunch of your stuff. So to get them\n\n31:18.680 --> 31:21.920\nback, you take one of the flashlights that you're buying from one of them, and you just\n\n31:21.920 --> 31:27.600\ntake a shit in it, and then you give it to her. And then like a couple of years later,\n\n31:27.600 --> 31:34.400\nyou just go ahead and marry her. Yeah, that did happen. That did happen. Seven years ago,\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:39.320\nI was going on a mission trip with a church when I was in high school, and we were going\n\n31:39.320 --> 31:45.600\nto help just some people in West Virginia. And a few months prior, a woman had tragically\n\n31:45.600 --> 31:53.680\nlost her son, her very young son, in a car accident. And the weeks before it happened,\n\n31:53.680 --> 32:00.040\nshe saw, kept saying that he saw a bunny in the yard, and his mom never saw it. And after\n\n32:00.040 --> 32:06.200\nthe horrible event, she got this package, and it was a statue of a bunny. And it wasn't,\n\n32:06.200 --> 32:09.560\nit didn't say who it was from. So she was like, very confused. She was very, she was\n\n32:09.560 --> 32:13.520\nlike, where did this come from? And while we were on the trip, after a particularly\n\n32:13.520 --> 32:19.160\nrowdy night at a pizza place, we were riding back to where we were staying, and bus stopped.\n\n32:19.160 --> 32:23.680\nAnd I was like, why? Why is the bus stopping? And it turns out there was a bunny in the\n\n32:23.680 --> 32:29.680\nmiddle of the road, and it wouldn't move. I couldn't understand why it wouldn't move.\n\n32:29.680 --> 32:34.400\nMost people on the bus understood the significance of this bunny, and this poor woman who went\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:39.280\nthrough something that no parent should ever have to go through. Most, most people on the\n\n32:39.280 --> 32:47.160\nbus realized the significance. Almost everybody knew what was going on. Some people just wanted\n\n32:47.160 --> 32:54.520\nto go back to where we were staying. Some people just all hopped up on root beer and pizza,\n\n32:54.520 --> 32:59.960\ndidn't really know what was going on, why a bunny was stopping us. Some people started\n\n32:59.960 --> 33:10.840\nto chant, or maybe one person started to chant, or more like just yell, run it over, run it\n\n33:10.840 --> 33:22.320\nover, run it. Oh, shit. Do you think she heard me? And I never looked her in the eyes again.\n\n33:22.320 --> 33:25.320\nThat was the end of the, that was the worst thing I ever did. So, thank you very much.\n\n33:25.320 --> 33:33.800\nRyan Solomon, everybody! Oh, don't forget, I'm racist. Thank you, Ryan Solomon. Could\n\n33:33.800 --> 33:44.320\nit be worse? Ryan Solomon! Keep your eyes out for that kid. You can sit in a VIP seat,\n\n33:44.320 --> 33:50.920\nRyan. Yeah, sit in a VIP booth if you want. When I was like, oh, who's going to stop the\n\n33:50.920 --> 33:58.240\nmusic? Then I realized. Spencer, tell me my biggest flaw. Take my fucking head off, man.\n\n33:58.240 --> 34:06.560\nI can't, man. You're like my hero. My shoes? Yeah, they're untied, bro. That's your flaw.\n\n34:06.560 --> 34:12.920\nIs that just the drunk lady in the back? Can we talk about Ryan really quick? You want\n\n34:12.920 --> 34:19.000\nto talk? Yeah, that is my biggest flaw. Can somebody top me off? It's a mass hysteria\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:29.000\nup here. I need more ice first, but that's fine. All right. Death is the theme of tonight's\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:37.840\nshow in Kansas City. I really liked Ryan's Ryan Gosling joke. I correct me if I'm wrong\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:43.080\naudience, but it seemed like you guys were really ready to not like anything Ryan did.\n\n34:43.080 --> 34:50.080\nNo, that's not true. They were... Oh, well, fine. That's good. No, I expected bigger\n\n34:50.080 --> 34:57.760\nlaughs. Don't make us throw Ryan under the bus. His Ryan Gosling joke worked, and then\n\n34:57.760 --> 35:02.520\nit had too many taglines, and then he had that big, long conceptual thing with the rabbit.\n\n35:02.520 --> 35:12.320\nHe lost us. Ryan, I'm standing up here fucking crucified on Golgotha. Do not let that hurt\n\n35:12.320 --> 35:19.320\nyour feelings at all. No, can we hear it again for Ryan? That was very brave and great. It\n\n35:19.320 --> 35:33.040\nwas really great. It's good. It was weird that you attacked Ryan for his jokes, Aaron.\n\n35:33.040 --> 35:37.880\nThat's not what I meant to do. I wasn't attacking Ryan. I misunderstood the audience. I'm sorry.\n\n35:37.880 --> 35:41.840\nIt's these lights, guys. I always felt most traumatized on the playground whenever people\n\n35:41.840 --> 35:46.680\nwould stick up for me. That's always when I would start to cry. I know you're my audience,\n\n35:46.680 --> 35:51.120\nso I know some of you know what it's like to get picked on on the playground. It would\n\n35:51.120 --> 35:56.440\nnever make me cry to get picked on. People bully me. They give you face washes in the\n\n35:56.440 --> 36:02.200\nsnow, swirlies in the toilet, and melvins in the hu-ha, and they just punch you and ask\n\n36:02.200 --> 36:05.080\nyou, why don't you shower? Why do you drop your pants all the way to the floor when you\n\n36:05.080 --> 36:09.800\ntake a pee at the urinal? Why are there skid marks in your underwear when you do that? Why\n\n36:09.800 --> 36:16.000\ndo you eat paste? Why do you think a glue bottle is a rocket? Why is your hair full of dandruff\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nand grease?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:21.780\nWell, I understand. Just to clarify, I wasn't sticking up for Ryan. I just wanted to give\n\n36:21.780 --> 36:23.280\nhim extra credit.\n\n36:23.280 --> 36:28.160\nBut then it would always be the people that would come up in the midst of it. Well, somebody\n\n36:28.160 --> 36:31.880\nwas picking on me because that would just make me gird my loins. I would just go, okay,\n\n36:31.880 --> 36:35.080\nthis is the way life is. I'm going to put the shields up. I'm going to be a porcupine.\n\n36:35.080 --> 36:39.280\nI'm going to, like, this pain. I'll get numb to it. Then some well-meaning fucker would\n\n36:39.280 --> 36:44.040\ncome up and go like, hey, leave him alone, man, just because he's all fucked up and dirty\n\n36:44.040 --> 36:49.120\nand greasy and shitty and doesn't fit. He doesn't have to be a normal person for you\n\n36:49.120 --> 36:54.960\nto like him, okay? Maybe he's special. Maybe he's so fucked up that something really weird\n\n36:54.960 --> 37:02.360\nabout him is good. You don't know. Maybe some really specific situation will happen, like\n\n37:02.360 --> 37:08.600\na flood of chemicals that only freaks can breathe. Maybe bat creatures will attack that\n\n37:08.600 --> 37:15.760\nhave a weird-shaped face that is vulnerable to fucking gross stinky nerds. And then he'll\n\n37:15.760 --> 37:21.560\nbe a hero then. And then I would always start crying because that's the guy that likes me.\n\n37:21.560 --> 37:26.720\nLike sticking up for me. And then when I would start crying, and then the nerd protector\n\n37:26.720 --> 37:31.640\nwould go like, you know, come on, so you know he's crying. You're a bad person. Don't pick\n\n37:31.640 --> 37:35.160\non people. You shouldn't pick on people that are gross, stinky, shitty nerds.\n\n37:35.160 --> 37:40.520\nWell, Ryan, just so you know, that's not what I was doing. Now it's kind of what Dan's doing\n\n37:40.520 --> 37:46.280\nbecause he qualified it that way. But I was just offering you more applause.\n\n37:46.280 --> 37:52.280\nRyan, you and I are fucking square. Also, Erin, I was just kidding. I didn't think you\n\n37:52.280 --> 37:57.360\nwere doing anything wrong. Jesus Christ, have we learned one thing in Kansas City? If not,\n\n37:57.360 --> 38:05.280\nwe almost go through a valley of darkness. Beef, beef, a valley of beef. I've got VIPs\n\n38:05.280 --> 38:07.240\nup here now. I can't remember which or which.\n\n38:07.240 --> 38:10.720\nYeah, can we check in with our Wallace and Gromit?\n\n38:10.720 --> 38:11.720\nTim?\n\n38:11.720 --> 38:12.720\nKyle?\n\n38:12.720 --> 38:13.720\nTim.\n\n38:13.720 --> 38:14.720\nRyan.\n\n38:14.720 --> 38:15.720\nKyle, Ryan.\n\n38:15.720 --> 38:21.640\nHow come people can't be named like banana, like Terrier? Like you can't have a code name\n\n38:21.640 --> 38:26.080\nor something. Like, you know, like G.I. Joe, like if you had a flamethrower on your back,\n\n38:26.080 --> 38:30.960\nyour name was barbecue, you know, like, like if you had skis, your name wasn't Christmas\n\n38:30.960 --> 38:31.960\ntree.\n\n38:31.960 --> 38:32.960\nDan, you have a rap about this, right?\n\n38:32.960 --> 38:33.960\nUh-huh. Yes.\n\n38:33.960 --> 38:39.760\nG.I. Joe had really clear names. He never had to tell men from games who just looked\n\n38:39.760 --> 38:44.600\nat their hat and that's what they were. If they were fat, their name was Raymond Burr.\n\n38:44.600 --> 38:52.080\nPerry Mason. Fuck you. Jarza Cason. Fuck you. Keep thinking about April and Pat. I fucked\n\n38:52.080 --> 38:59.360\nApril and then I fucked Pat. Fucked Pat and made April watch. You listening, April? Fucking\n\n38:59.360 --> 39:09.920\nApril, you unsupportive wife. April. Listen to me, April. I do this shit for free, April.\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:14.440\nNo one charges for it. Your husband came down here and you thought he was going to have\n\n39:14.440 --> 39:18.720\na bad time. He's sitting in the fucking VIP slut booth.\n\n39:18.720 --> 39:23.560\nCan we, can we, can we hear more about why she didn't, why she didn't like it?\n\n39:23.560 --> 39:28.600\nHe could get high licking that tabletop. That is, that's where Tim Allen sits when he comes\n\n39:28.600 --> 39:33.160\ndown. Like, you know that if you ran your finger on the underside of that table and rubbed\n\n39:33.160 --> 39:38.920\nyour gums, you, you, you go in for dental surgery for half price. Like, he is in the\n\n39:38.920 --> 39:44.440\nVIP booth, April. You drove him here. You drove him away. If he comes home tonight, you're\n\n39:44.440 --> 39:52.680\nlucky. And it's because he's a Harmontown listener that he'll stay faithful to you April.\n\n39:52.680 --> 39:57.920\nBecause he's a nerd and he knows what it's like to be like me and Ryan, be unappreciated.\n\n39:57.920 --> 40:03.520\nAnd, and, and so he's going to, he's going to have a moment of compassion as, as all\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:06.920\nthese fellow Harmontown fans. And there's a lot of good looking chicks out here in the\n\n40:06.920 --> 40:14.720\naudience tonight. And they're going to be all over. Is it, is it Kyle? I can't, okay.\n\n40:14.720 --> 40:19.520\nDan, that is, that is an interesting phenomenon. I talked to a few people before the show who\n\n40:19.520 --> 40:23.840\nwere either here with their partners or had come without them who had said like, I try\n\n40:23.840 --> 40:27.040\nto get my girlfriend to come, but she wouldn't come or I try to get my boyfriend to come.\n\n40:27.040 --> 40:31.400\nWhat do you, where do you stand on that? Like you and I kind of like the same things, but\n\n40:31.400 --> 40:35.040\nI would absolutely, I think, I think it's a very supportive thing to say, go ahead,\n\n40:35.040 --> 40:38.160\ngo to the show, but I'm not going to go because that's not my cup of tea. I think you're\n\n40:38.160 --> 40:44.920\nfine, April. Your mom also, I think it's fine. Let's, let's call her who she is, Pat. I think,\n\n40:44.920 --> 40:50.120\nI think she's amazing. Is there anyone in the audience who, who has fallen in love over\n\n40:50.120 --> 40:54.840\nHarmontown? Yeah, has anybody like, uh, anybody, anybody\n\n40:54.840 --> 40:58.920\nIt's wishful thinking. The, the, the, the face that I received after that question.\n\n40:58.920 --> 41:04.200\nYeah. Yeah. That's kind of fishing for something. You can't blame yourself for it. All right.\n\n41:04.200 --> 41:09.480\nSo let's get back to April's mom, Pat. Uh, so, uh, where, where, where, where, where\n\n41:09.480 --> 41:16.760\nis Pat from? Um, probably Missouri, central Missouri, right in the middle of the fucking\n\n41:16.760 --> 41:28.560\nthe death star, that piece of shit state. Show me more like, don't show me. I don't want\n\n41:28.560 --> 41:36.200\nto see it. Keep that fridge door closed, Missouri. How weird that your state is a barely mispronounced\n\n41:36.200 --> 41:46.000\nmisery. What a coincidence. You sons of bitches. Dan, one of our closest friends is from Missouri.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:51.800\nWho? Kimber, Kimber Hall, my, my, uh, my closest friend, my roommate. I'm just trying to get\n\n41:51.800 --> 41:56.840\nthese guys on my side. It's fine, but you're uniting them via hatred. I don't think they\n\n41:56.840 --> 42:00.760\nwant that. They're smarter than that. Uh, play it, play it, play the, play the country\n\n42:00.760 --> 42:03.840\nsong. I'm going to sing a country song about Missouri sucking.\n\n42:09.840 --> 42:20.320\nAll right. Hip stop and a boot, boot, lock, ring, ring. I do, do, not even I'll do. Well,\n\n42:20.320 --> 42:30.000\nmy name is John Missouri. I'm a shit eating son of a fucker. I went to my house and never\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:36.320\nhoped for supper because I eat dogs and dirt and cigarettes and I wear peanut butter for\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:46.400\na hat. I'm a big dumb fucking asshole piece of shit and my wife's name is Pat. I'm Kyle's\n\n42:46.400 --> 42:55.400\nfather. Hold on. Let's go. I lost my place. Sorry. Deep, dumb, deep, dumb, a doob, a dumb\n\n42:55.400 --> 43:05.640\ndoob. Here we go. Second verse. I'm Kyle's father. My wife's name is Pat. I gave birth\n\n43:05.640 --> 43:14.080\nto Kyle. My good effects stopped at that. I've never done anything good. I live in a\n\n43:14.080 --> 43:24.320\npile of leaves. I'm a big piece of fucking shit. I'm from Missouri. It's got no right\n\n43:24.320 --> 43:34.520\nto have half of Kansas City. Just leave your garbage on the lawn. I got three feet and\n\n43:34.520 --> 43:45.200\nhalf a hand. I got Russell Brand on the Tivo because I like his style. I'm a big piece\n\n43:45.200 --> 43:52.680\nof fucking mother fucking shit from Missouri. I hate Missouri. I mean, I love it and I'm\n\n43:52.680 --> 43:59.880\na piece of shit. Sorry. All right. We can do anything together now.\n\n43:59.880 --> 44:07.440\nIt's almost time for D&D, but I'm so curious to hear from somebody who's a hardcore Kansas\n\n44:07.440 --> 44:11.520\nloyal, well, bowl. Are you from Missouri? I just want someone to say what they hate\n\n44:11.520 --> 44:15.840\nabout Missouri. No, no, no, no. We have better. We have a Missouri. Are you willing to come\n\n44:15.840 --> 44:22.440\nup? Please, no one kill him after the show. No, no, nobody's going to kill him. Oh, thank\n\n44:22.440 --> 44:28.720\nyou. Thank you. Is that a, where's a, I know Amanda's one of the servers. Where's a, is\n\n44:28.720 --> 44:33.000\nthat you? Oh, okay. Cause you did, I have face blindness and you changed your hair before\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:38.760\nthe show. Amanda and the other servers, don't forget to tip them. I sometimes believe it\n\n44:38.760 --> 44:47.240\nor not, people forget to do that. It also seems weird that people would, would forget\n\n44:47.240 --> 44:51.480\nthat you always hear people say, don't forget. So they must forget occasionally. I'm basing\n\n44:51.480 --> 44:54.920\nit on that alone. Hello, sir. What's your name?\n\n44:54.920 --> 45:00.600\nDarren. Darren, the human being from Missouri. He's a human being. How dare you.\n\n45:00.600 --> 45:05.640\nDon't boo him. Don't boo, don't. Actually, actually, the song that you sang was, was\n\n45:05.640 --> 45:13.280\nfairly accurate. See, he's a self loathing. His, his, his, his pulse beats. It's, it's\n\n45:13.280 --> 45:15.040\nDarren. Yeah, Darren.\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:20.640\nDarren, we have the same name. Why, why does everyone pick on you on Missouri? I don't\n\n45:20.640 --> 45:25.520\nknow. I think it's cause we have a better baseball team. Is it the same thing in Missouri?\n\n45:25.520 --> 45:30.240\nDo you guys pick on Kansas? Yeah. Well, yeah. We're on one side of Missouri. They're on\n\n45:30.240 --> 45:33.960\nthe other side. What divides you? Is it a river? I mean, I, I know it's hatred, but\n\n45:33.960 --> 45:40.640\nis there a river between what's that? A river of hate. Okay. I think you said river of paint.\n\n45:40.640 --> 45:44.080\nIt was like, okay, wait, is there, is that like an industrial thing? Like there's, this\n\n45:44.080 --> 45:49.640\nfuckers from Missouri, they make paint and then they put it into the river. You tell\n\n45:49.640 --> 45:54.000\nme, so it's a, it's a geologically, geographically, it's a river that separates the two parts\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:57.400\nof the city. Pretty much. I don't understand why they're both the same city then. What,\n\n45:57.400 --> 46:01.160\nand I'm, they, they, they're saying the same thing. What, what the hell happened? What,\n\n46:01.160 --> 46:08.000\nwhat is going on? I had, I had no idea. I, I failed geography and all that stuff. I'm\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:11.160\nthe wrong person to ask about that. All right. Well, I don't, okay. I'm not going to get\n\n46:11.160 --> 46:18.480\nany answers here tonight. We should just stick with the, all right. Somebody's calling out\n\n46:18.480 --> 46:23.720\nsomething that's sports related. Hey, Aaron, let's do a, no, he's, he's, oh no, no, it's\n\n46:23.720 --> 46:27.400\nokay. Thank you for coming out. He's excusing himself off the stage. Oh, Darren's excusing\n\n46:27.400 --> 46:31.720\nhimself. Well, Darren, did you, wait, Darren, Darren, wait, we can't let you go right away.\n\n46:31.720 --> 46:37.920\nThis is how thick this conflict is. I want to know, I want to know from Darren what his,\n\n46:37.920 --> 46:43.760\nwhat his, what is your, can you tell us like a wish that you have, a big ambition or anything\n\n46:43.760 --> 46:52.240\nlike that? I, I wanted to hear a second season of the, the werewolf teenager show that we\n\n46:52.240 --> 46:57.080\ndid in Charlotte. Yeah. All right. We'll beat that you Missouri fucker. That's not going\n\n46:57.080 --> 47:03.120\nto make any sense. What's, what's a personal wish of yours besides Missouri and Kansas getting\n\n47:03.120 --> 47:09.040\nalong besides fucking Pat, which all of us, we all want to do that. Are you listening\n\n47:09.040 --> 47:18.000\nApril? Yeah, I, I really, I, I have none. So, oh, I'm a really happy person. Darren,\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:22.000\nshe's just sticking up for it. Is there anyone, Darren, is there anyone who you love who has\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:27.280\na dream? Libby Huey over there has a dream. Yeah, which, which is her dream? What's lovey's\n\n47:27.280 --> 47:33.080\ndream? I think she wants to be a musician. We've been dating for five years and I, I\n\n47:33.080 --> 47:36.360\nliterally know nothing about her. All right. Okay. All right. Let's, let, let, let's thank\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:39.120\nDarren and we're going to do it. We're going to do a quick movie for Darren. We're going\n\n47:39.120 --> 47:44.880\nto, we're going to create a movie for him. Aaron, I want you to play Libby Huey in, in\n\n47:44.880 --> 47:49.480\nthe Darren and Libby story about, about two star cross lovers from different sides of\n\n47:49.480 --> 48:03.320\nKansas City. I'd like you to play Darren. A tale of two sides of the same city.\n\n48:03.320 --> 48:15.960\nWhat's that sound from outside my shitty Missouri apartment? I'm going to go out and\n\n48:15.960 --> 48:22.760\ncheck it out. Whoa. Almost fell in the river. That's right outside my door. Excuse me, young\n\n48:22.760 --> 48:30.160\nlady. I'm sorry. I'm just Darren. I was just in my apartment, just wanting nothing. And\n\n48:30.160 --> 48:36.840\nI, I, I couldn't help but overhear this, this, this sound. What is, what's going on?\n\n48:36.840 --> 48:45.920\nI, I'm playing the guitar. Oh, musician. Well, I want to be. I'd love to hear some more,\n\n48:45.920 --> 48:54.200\nbut this damn river lies between us. Would you, would you meet me at the bridge where\n\n48:54.200 --> 49:02.160\nthere's that, that, that, that dinosaur cafe in Kansas City? Well, what if we met right\n\n49:02.160 --> 49:07.080\nin the middle of the bridge? You know, we're neither of us were in either part of the city.\n\n49:07.080 --> 49:11.440\nAll right. I, I can do that. I just don't speak too loudly or my family will kill me\n\n49:11.440 --> 49:24.720\nand cut out my brain. Okay. Three hours later. I'm not sure how the, the, the, it works that\n\n49:24.720 --> 49:36.800\nhere we are in the middle of the bridge. Hey, I never touched a Kansas City girls face.\n\n49:36.800 --> 49:44.080\nI mean, a Kansas girls face. I always touch Kansas City. We're both from Kansas City.\n\n49:44.080 --> 49:48.960\nI don't know if you can. My, my family told me that if a Missourin ever touched my face\n\n49:48.960 --> 50:06.960\nthat my skin would melt and turn into an army if Nazis would destroy the planet. Can I touch\n\n50:06.960 --> 50:33.800\nit? Should I feel you? Yes, I should. When you smile and I smile, when you laugh, I laugh.\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:48.480\nOh, my God, Oh my God.\n\n50:48.480 --> 50:55.440\nThis is a Understood Police. You were in violation of the non Mes Simpson nation Treaty Between\n\n50:55.440 --> 51:01.120\nKansas and Missouri. Please stop interpreting with that inferior Missouri woman and get\n\n51:01.120 --> 51:07.880\nback to your home. I'm sorry, I'm a helicopter pilot. I get confused because I often cross\n\n51:07.880 --> 51:13.600\nbetween the things. I'll explain later, but just know that you guys are forbidden to do\n\n51:13.600 --> 51:23.160\nwhat you're doing. Run! Run! We have to go to Omaha. Go through this sewer. It'll take\n\n51:23.160 --> 51:38.000\nus straight there. Oh, God. Oh, shit, Omaha. Oh, where everything is mutual. I kind of\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:44.480\nset myself up there, didn't I? Hey, I should let you know now, I have five years in me.\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:50.880\nWhat does that mean? Look, there was a prophecy. I read it on a plate when I was 15 years old\n\n51:50.880 --> 51:54.840\nthat said that I would meet a man from the other side of the river. We would start dating\n\n51:54.840 --> 52:00.320\nand then we would stop after five years and we would go to a comedy show and then one\n\n52:00.320 --> 52:10.000\nof us would eat the other's face. Five years from now? It was a long plate. Yes, five years\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:19.800\nfrom now. Libby, I wouldn't eat your face. Really? But what if I ate your face? What\n\n52:19.800 --> 52:49.720\nif I ate your face? Put your blood out of place. You won't eat milk.\n\n52:49.720 --> 53:00.480\nAre you gonna say me? I was gonna say milk. You're fucking weird. I can't do this relationship\n\n53:00.480 --> 53:09.120\nanymore. Open up in there. It's the International Omaha Police Department. We know you're in\n\n53:09.120 --> 53:16.040\nthere. Intermingling with Kansas and Missouri people. We're coming in with our special futuristic\n\n53:16.040 --> 53:24.960\nOmaha bathroom rams. Put them on laser setting. I don't even know who this bitch is. I'm\n\n53:24.960 --> 53:39.280\nout of here. 20 years later in Kansas City, maximum security, future prison. Libby, I've\n\n53:39.280 --> 53:51.800\ngot good news. You're up for parole. Oh, you gave birth. No, this is Sarah's. No, I didn't\n\n53:51.800 --> 53:56.000\ngive birth because I've been without my one two love this whole time, but thanks for rubbing\n\n53:56.000 --> 54:00.840\nin it. Well, you've got a big awakening in for you. You know that in the time you've\n\n54:00.840 --> 54:07.240\nbeen incarcerated, the laws have changed. The river's dried up. The laws can never change.\n\n54:07.240 --> 54:11.720\nThere's no more river, Libby. Kansas and Missouri can never get a law. There's no more river.\n\n54:11.720 --> 54:17.480\nIt's gone. There's no more water. There's no more river. All the cities are united now.\n\n54:17.480 --> 54:24.400\nEast and West, New Hampshire, St. Louis and Minneapolis are the same thing now. It's called\n\n54:24.400 --> 54:32.120\nSt. Louis. St. Louis. You geography genius. Thank you for letting me know. I say go out\n\n54:32.120 --> 54:39.640\nthere and go to that man that betrayed you and left you because it seems like an ending.\n\n54:39.640 --> 54:48.520\nMaybe not a good one. I'm going to find him. You never close your eyes when I crawl through\n\n54:48.520 --> 55:01.760\nweeds and jump over fences. And? Darren. Darren. Darren. I'm behind you. What? No one's behind\n\n55:01.760 --> 55:10.200\nyou in front of anyone anymore. It's post-Riverdom. I've been behind you the whole time. I went\n\n55:10.200 --> 55:18.080\nto prison too. You did? I was your parole officer. Well, that's fucked up. Why didn't\n\n55:18.080 --> 55:22.480\nyou say something? I didn't want you to get mad at me for taking a job at the place where\n\n55:22.480 --> 55:26.920\nyou were imprisoned. I always knew that you loved me as someone who didn't want to do\n\n55:26.920 --> 55:36.360\nanything. I got you this guitar. It's made of shoes and corn. I love shoes, so I'll\n\n55:36.360 --> 55:57.680\nforget everything you just said. I just want to have a happy ending in eight years. Because\n\n55:57.680 --> 56:18.280\nmisery and Kansas are the same. Oh, Erin, what a great movie. You guys understand, right?\n\n56:18.280 --> 56:26.400\nYou get it. Yeah. Spencer, how did you feel about that? It was good, but I liked your\n\n56:26.400 --> 56:34.080\nlyrics. There was a deleted scene in that movie where Kyle's wife's April's mother's\n\n56:34.080 --> 56:43.720\npat took like a million dicks in her face. You hear that, April? Your mother had to be\n\n56:43.720 --> 56:51.200\ncut out of the movie because it was too dirty when she was in it. No, but be fair. She only\n\n56:51.200 --> 56:57.400\ntook a million dicks because she already has a million dicks. She wanted friends for her\n\n56:57.400 --> 57:01.120\ndicks already. The owner of the club was giving us the light, and I automatically assumed\n\n57:01.120 --> 57:07.400\nit was like a camcorder. I was like, oh, the show's going better. He's taping us. I automatically\n\n57:07.400 --> 57:21.120\nassumed it's time for Dungeons and Dragons. All right, when we last met, Jesus, are you\n\n57:21.120 --> 57:25.680\nokay? Yeah, you don't give me any time to set up beforehand. You just randomly cue me\n\n57:25.680 --> 57:29.800\nand start the music. Hey, do you see me dying up here, motherfucker? Well, you could have\n\n57:29.800 --> 57:33.440\nsaid something. We're fighting. You and I are fighting. You want to fight right now?\n\n57:33.440 --> 57:41.000\nYeah, I don't think we should play Dungeons and Dragons. I'm sorry, Spencer. Now we've\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:45.640\nmade up and we've atoned. There, my sense of story structure is appeased. That's it.\n\n57:45.640 --> 57:50.160\nThat's all we need. All right. Yeah. Sometimes it's a shitty movie. Last time we met, our\n\n57:50.160 --> 57:55.120\nheroes had been journeying in the belly of the beast. No, I don't, I don't, I don't think\n\n57:55.120 --> 57:59.360\nthat's it. Okay, all right. I think I've got to say something. Should I keep going, guys?\n\n57:59.360 --> 58:06.840\nNo, I, I have something to say. Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden. I, you know, Spencer and\n\n58:06.840 --> 58:13.040\nI have been doing merch this whole time. Yeah. And Spencer has been very thoughtful and very\n\n58:13.040 --> 58:20.560\nkind and very attentive. What do you mean attentive? I just mean he's sensitive to the way I feel\n\n58:20.560 --> 58:29.840\nand he really sees me. Like he really sees like your crotch and stuff? No, not yet. I\n\n58:29.840 --> 58:39.560\nmean, I just, this is crazy. I'm just saying he's, he's, he's, he's very kind and sensitive.\n\n58:39.560 --> 58:45.040\nAnd you know, you've, you've been a bit of a bully. And I think that, that maybe over\n\n58:45.040 --> 58:51.720\nthe course of this trip, Spencer and I have become close. All right. Well, that's fine.\n\n58:51.720 --> 58:56.160\nCan I, we only have like six minutes left. Yeah. Okay. All right. Sorry. Pause. J.K.\n\n58:56.160 --> 59:02.160\nAll right. Here we go. I don't even know. You guys are in a fish. All right. Feel our\n\n59:02.160 --> 59:07.160\ncharacter. You rejoined and entered a large cavity after fighting a mucousy spider slime\n\n59:07.160 --> 59:15.520\nand several spindly limb lightning creatures. You defeated them. You were left in the long.\n\n59:15.520 --> 59:19.320\nDo you want characters right now? Should we just go? Like we could just go. Let's just\n\n59:19.320 --> 59:23.200\ngo freestyle. Yeah. Freestyle it. All right. If there's a spell I should cast. Tell me.\n\n59:23.200 --> 59:30.280\nOkay. So what, what did you do? Well, that just sounds deadly. What did you say, Ian?\n\n59:30.280 --> 59:38.560\nHe said a roll of a thousand dicks. Oh yeah. Pat. Yeah. There were a thousand dicks involved.\n\n59:38.560 --> 59:46.160\nI was definitely talking about Pat. Yeah. April's mom. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, I mean,\n\n59:46.160 --> 59:51.600\nhonestly, now we have two minutes left. That's all right. Just go smoke a cigarette. You're,\n\n59:51.600 --> 59:56.600\nyou're killing us. Oh no. No, don't really, don't really. That's not. You put so much\n\n59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.160\nwork into that. I quit eight years ago. I was smoking two packs a day. I don't even fucking\n\n01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:05.160\nthink about it. It gets so easy. He really doesn't. I've never seen him. It gets so easy.\n\n01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.120\nDon't worry more about it. All right. If you recall, you killed those things. You're now\n\n01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.680\nin a lung and you started, uh, you, you set some smoke to make it cough. Right. All right.\n\n01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.920\nSo now we're like what we're like almost out of the fish or the lung spasming. Right. Right.\n\n01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.680\nWe wait as the lung spasms and spasms. So violently, it threatens to shake apart. You\n\n01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.600\nget the sensation that if you would only breach its membrane, it could be torn asunder very\n\n01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:40.000\nquickly. I agree. I just agree. You're just agreeing for that. Yeah. I don't have time\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:48.720\nto disagree. Yeah. What is it? There's a very, uh, pretty drunk girl. Very happy lady. She's\n\n01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.400\nenjoying it. It's a good show. Yeah. Yeah. She had a good time. Yeah. Uh, stay, stick,\n\n01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.640\nstick around for all the comics that are going on next that are sitting next to you. It'll\n\n01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.600\nbe great. Um, all right. The, uh, uh, uh, uh, we, we breach the membrane, whatever you\n\n01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.280\nsaid that we get the sense we could do. Okay. Well, uh, you do you have a sword? You don't\n\n01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.880\nhave a sword. You have a knife. I tell, I tell a quirk to, uh, uh, do it with his far\n\n01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.920\nsword. All right. I got this sword. Let me just slice through. He pulls out his sword\n\n01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.880\nand making a couple of slices across the belly of the membrane that you guys are currently\n\n01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.520\nin. It slashes open and the smoke pours out. You feel the entire creature you're surrounded\n\n01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.280\nby give a violent shutter as if it was hurt or wounded. And you feel yourself drop in\n\n01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.320\nthe sky as if the entire thing had fell down a couple hundred yards before regaining traction.\n\n01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.680\nOh, shit. You're definitely done something, but it's not dead yet. Okay. Well, probably\n\n01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.560\ngood cause we don't want to die with it. Oh, we don't want to die with that. Well, yeah,\n\n01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.440\nwe don't want to plummet to earth and explode with us in it. You know, we're giving a final\n\n01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:57.280\nviolent shutter and the entire lung you're inside of falls apart and you fall down about\n\n01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.360\n50 feet till you land on a pillowy cushion back in the room you were in before. Oh, nice.\n\n01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:08.080\nConvenient. It's like a video game. Yeah. All right. Uh, well, uh, uh, can we see that\n\n01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.680\nthat that village from here that the things you can see you're in a green room. There's\n\n01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.880\nthree holes. One of them you just came through. The other two you haven't been through back\n\n01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.040\nbehind you is a small purple door that leads back towards the village. Right. All right.\n\n01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:27.840\nWe got to go through each of these. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I really don't want to pay you\n\n01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.680\nmore attention because I have to take an asset because this would be a trip. There's a woman\n\n01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.600\nin the audience who said, have you ever taken acid before? I have. I've taken acid in mushrooms.\n\n01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:45.920\nI haven't done heroin or, uh, uh, uh, ayahuasca, but some, a fan gave us a jar of ayahuasca\n\n01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.600\nat, uh, at the show and we should go take it now and in the tour bus and, uh, and finish\n\n01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.520\nthis evening. Um, all right. We've dropped 50 feet. Well, not, not to, you guys have\n\n01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.840\nbeen great. You guys, thank you for coming to the show. You know, you've been amazing,\n\n01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.440\nbut it's, it's seven 10. We got to be off the stage in five minutes. So I don't, we should,\n\n01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.760\nwe should, let's just wrap up the Dungeons and Dragons. I roll over, I roll over on top\n\n01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.520\nof Sharpie. Okay. Nice. Good. That's very nice, isn't it? All right. Spencer, everybody.\n\n01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:25.440\nThank him for the wonderful. Thank you Spencer. Sometimes Dungeons and Dragons doesn't last\n\n01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:34.560\nthat long. Hey, Dan. So, so this, this show is, uh, probably a, uh, pivotal, pivotal.\n\n01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:43.880\nYeah. Are you drunk too? Yeah. Super. Okay. SCC singing sectionals. Is that like, is that,\n\n01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.800\nis that your cheerleading trooper? Is that what are you, are you just cheering for a\n\n01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.120\nteam of yours? She doesn't know you're talking to her. Okay. That's fine. Okay. You're a\n\n01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.240\nfire hydrant to her and vice versa. Quite all right. Uh, Dan, this is a, this, this\n\n01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:05.560\nis an important moment in the, in your story circle. Right. This is, this is what? The\n\n01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.560\ndeath? Perhaps. Do you want to queue up here? Maybe it requires something. Yeah, that's\n\n01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.200\nwhat I'm doing. Right. Right. Yeah. What have we learned in Kansas City?\n\n01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:28.000\nOoh. Ian, take it easy. Just don't smoke. Libby, keep loving your gross misery, man.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nAnd your gross misery, man. Drunk lady. Keep drinking. I've seen a beautiful city. Its\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:47.760\nname was Kansas City. As soft and creamy as a titty for me in misogyny town. Man, I'm\n\n01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:56.120\nsorry if I sucked, but really who gives a fuck? Cause the room kind of looks like a\n\n01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:06.840\nplace that you'd go to. A lot of customers survey about crackers. In a shopping mall.\n\n01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:18.080\nIn Hama town. Poop is brown. I fucked your mama. I fucked her good. I fucked your mama\n\n01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:26.200\nand she turned to wood. I shaped her into a tree and her leaves touch the sky. And then\n\n01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:36.520\nI fucked her eye and she went blind. And when she couldn't see, I told her about color.\n\n01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:43.680\nAnd what I told her, made her think twice. No more race. I fucked your mama and fixed\n\n01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:52.720\nher brain. I fucked your mama in the rain. I fucked your mama down the street.
