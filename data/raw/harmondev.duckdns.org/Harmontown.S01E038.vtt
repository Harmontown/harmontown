00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Are you ready to be the happiest you've ever been in your entire life?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Welcome to Harmontown, Harmontown is now in session.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
Please welcome to stage the third Harmontown, Mr. Daniel Drake's Harmon.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kid in the city, fuck your momma, kid in the city, fuck your momma.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Alright.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
We gotta do a lightning fast.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
It's good that they, yeah, they didn't sit anybody down in the VIP, the tuba section.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Oh really, these are more expensive down here?

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
Alright, for podcast listeners we are in a room that, for the sake of description, it's like a beautiful,

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
like, kind of expensive beachwood thrust has been placed in the middle of a driver's ed class.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
And there's like an orchestra pit with VIP booths that our nerdy audience could not afford to sit in.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
Well that means I should probably, that doesn't put me out of the light, right?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I'll be in the dark.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
For the listeners, this club has a runway.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, I just moved down the thrust.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
It's like a runway.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
It's like a Katy Perry concert.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Hello Kansas City.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
We have a limited time here at the strip mall.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
We gotta, there's another show coming out next.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
How many of you are from Kansas City?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And so that means the rest of you, like, traveled.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Who drove the farthest?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
I heard Omaha.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Tulsa.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Tulsa?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Is Tulsa further than Omaha?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
All right, Tulsa's got us beat.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I realize that's a tough spot that I put you in when I'm like, who drove the furthest?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
There's like an unspoken edge to that question.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Like, who lives with their mom the most?

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
But I thank you so much, anybody, that came even five minutes, even if you walked here.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Even if you were forced to be here.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Thank you for being here.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Everybody eat at that dinosaur place?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
That's pretty badass.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
I couldn't believe how high I forgot to get before I ate there.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
I kept wondering, I know a lot of people probably smoke a lot of pot and go to the dinosaur place.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
A lot of people probably take mushrooms and go to the dinosaur place.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
But I kept wondering, does everyone ever do co-care?

02:48.000 --> 02:58.000
Like an executive luncheon, does anybody meet in the bathroom there and do a bump under a stegosaurus tail?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hey, Dan.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, Aaron?

03:00.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay, stay on that thigh.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Half of it is in the state of Kansas.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Half of your mama took down my pants.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Suck my dick, lick my nuts, fingered my nose, put it in my butt.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So I had a booger in my butt.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
It was gross, it was gross.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Sorry.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Sorry about that.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, thank you.

03:54.000 --> 04:05.000
I don't know if I'm supposed to be distracted by this or not, but I keep imagining the show from the perspective of the people that work here.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
You guys don't seem like regular clients of this particular place.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
I keep putting myself in their shoes and going, what is a podcast, what is this show, what is going on?

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
They put it on the door that it's a nationally televised podcast.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
Funny on two levels, not televised, not just national.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
So they've got to be confused right now.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Can I ask this question?

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
I know like 60 of you bought tickets online, which I assume means 60 of you listened to the podcast.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
How many of you by applause are in that other category of people that wandered in here wondering what kind of comedy?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It's kind of like this back wall.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
There's like a tear, there's like a pit, there's a pit of nerds.

04:59.000 --> 05:08.000
And then there's a Sesame Street brick wall with comics that are doing the next show and people from Kansas City.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
But welcome, welcome, we welcome you. I hope you like livestock on stage.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
That's how we close our show.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
So I don't understand, is there anybody that works in that local government here that can explain how the...

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
Isn't your city split down the middle and half of it's in one state and half of it's in the other?

05:29.000 --> 05:39.000
Is there anybody that is kind of like an expert on how that works and why that wants to come up and explain that to me?

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
You just hate it, you're just beleaguered by the civil war that is happening in Kansas City.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
All right, fine. Guess what? I don't care. I pretended to care for a second.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I don't care that your city split down the middle between two states.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
I grew up thinking that there were two Kansas cities, that that's why there was a Kansas City, Missouri, and a Kansas City, Kansas.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
I thought that there was actually just two places called Kansas City.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
And I found out, I think today, that... oh, okay, there's a... yeah, so...

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
All right, so there's a lot of tension between the halves of the cities.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
And what I've done is I've made the mistake of calling it one city, I should call it two.

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
You guys are the separatists, you're the people who believe that the other Kansas City should get up and walk away.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
And most of you drove from Omaha, okay. No one cares.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
How's Nebraska?

06:35.000 --> 06:43.000
Everybody hates where they're from. Everybody wants to be a hero. Everybody wants to just go away and kill themselves.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Or rescue a family of orphans from a fire. No one wants to just be where they're from.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
And nobody out in the audience is waving a giant foam finger for anything.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm worried tonight because I was looking at my story circle for those of you who are familiar with that.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
For the back row, I'm only famous for making a TV show that I got fired off of.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
And then just barely. Only 3 million people watch that.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
So then I'm famous for getting fired off of it.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
And then during the time that I was making it, this story circle that I had developed years ago kind of came to light like this.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And I'm kind of obsessed with it, like what makes a story and stuff.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
And we're doing this tour documentary about the show, about me going on the road, talking about nothing and not having an act.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
And I've been placing myself on this circle.

07:40.000 --> 07:50.000
And the truth of the matter is that on my story circle, according to my arithmetic, tonight represents a horrible death.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
Tonight is a night of horrible, like something bad is going to happen.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Something bad is already happening. Yes, thank you, comics.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
I understand that compared to what you do, this is already death.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Like that you would have already gone, okay, I did a bad job, I'm fired.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
But podcasting is different. It's different. It's more like NPR.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
It's not, you know, if 20 minutes of silence goes by, it might be captivating.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Maybe it's not hilarious.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Also, this room is more brightly lit than anywhere I've ever been in my entire life.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
If the show goes poorly, it won't be a secret.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Everyone's face.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
Hello, ma'am, with a beautiful spearmint scarf over there, I like that.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Also the cloud tie-dye in the back, I like that. You can see all the colors.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I'm demonstrating how bright it is.

08:46.000 --> 08:55.000
We can see the ghost of impending doom hanging over, standing in the back, shaking his head, giving a thumbs down.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
We can see all the way. We don't like it when we can see nothing.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I mean, that's no good either.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
But anyways, what was I talking about, Erin?

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
You were talking about...

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Death, right.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Oh, okay, death, yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
Yo, yo, yo, rapping, rapping about death.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
Hold your breath, good, and go six feet under. Fuck your mama like I was a blundering.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
Lookin' where to put my dick, couldn't find a place, picked a kickery stick instead of my penis.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
Fucked your mama like Duke Zahazard's Enos. It was a character from the 80s.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
I fucked your mama like she was just another lady, but she wasn't.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Her ass was fine. I fucked your mama down the county line.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
Roscoe Coltrane going, Duke, Duke, Duke, fuck his mama, Duke, Duke, Duke.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Alright.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
For the guys in the back who don't know what the show is, that's not part of the show.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
We're only doing that because we're in Kansas City.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
We heard you like barbecue and freestyle rapping.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
So we're just doing it to make you comfortable. These guys are like, what's he doing? Why is he doing that?

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
He's selling out the show. Stop rapping about Enos.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
A couple of Duke Zahazard references in there. I apologize, everyone's 25. I didn't mean to do that.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
There was a movie, maybe you can Google it.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Death.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
Tonight it's going to happen. You're going to witness a transformation, hopefully.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
I think it's going to come at the hands of Spencer, because I was thinking about it.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
We should bring him up here.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Spencer, can you come out?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's bring Spencer to the stage!

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Kansas City.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Right?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Spencer, this is your first hair down show.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
My first what?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
First show with your hair down.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Jesus.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Party Jesus. You're letting it loose for Kansas City.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Fat frat boy Jesus.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Going to die on stage.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
For you guys in the back, Spencer is the podcast's Dungeon Master. Sold you yet?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Sold you yet?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Sound a little more marketable?

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
We have a Dungeon Master. We play Dungeons and Dragons on the show.

11:33.000 --> 11:43.000
Spencer, I'm starting to think, in accordance with my story model, he is the hero of the tour,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
because unlike me, he is actually going through changes, aren't you, Spencer?

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, yeah. I hit puberty a couple days ago.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It came on fast.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 12:04.000
But you have been wished across a threshold by a horrible, wealthy fat guy and stuck in a tour bus that he rented, so he could go out and masturbate on stage.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
And you yourself are experiencing new things and adapting and changing, and we're almost done with the tour and I haven't changed in any way.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
So it occurred to me this morning that I must be the villain and Spencer must be the hero, which means that Spencer must die.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Or that I must die.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
And that must either happen in Dungeons and Dragons, or it will happen just in the show.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
So Spencer, let me have it. Lay waste to me.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
What? That's not...

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Undo me at the seams. Tell me what my problem is. Tell me why I'm a piece of shit.

12:38.000 --> 12:46.000
You want to know what your problem is. You're so generous that you bought me a David Buster's card.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
But it was only for...

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
That was the false death gone.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
Okay, so when you come to the ticket window, do they go, okay, your seat's in the room, but do you want it to be in the front?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Because that'll cost $5 extra.

13:06.000 --> 13:18.000
And do they offer it, or that was just offered online and you just didn't check the box that said, I would like the luxury Coke booth.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Alright. It's such wasted space.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Is it possible to have just one person in each of these booths? Would that be weird?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Let's pick some VIPs.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Okay, we got a VIP there.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
We got a little VIP music. You came to Harmontown and you thought that...

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
We don't want to separate couples. You look like you came here by yourself, no offense.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Are you single and want to boot alone to watch Harmontown?

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
Would you be willing to come up and talk to us first? We don't bully anybody at Harmontown. Can I help you up?

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
We don't bring people up to pick on them. What's your name, sir?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
My name is Kyle.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Are you one of the people that you're not familiar with the podcast?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Oh, no. No, I'm very familiar with it.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Oh, you are? Okay.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
No, no, no, no. You came here by yourself?

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah, I couldn't get my wife to come after she listened.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Oh, sorry.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I should not have let her listen.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
What episode did your wife listen to?

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
It was Pittsburgh.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
It wasn't our relationship that minute.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
No, no, no. She might have come if she'd heard that part.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Tell us the exact point where she said...

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
She didn't like the fucking mama raps.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
What's her name?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
April.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
April! More like...

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
April!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Check it!

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
April heard you don't like my show.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I fucked your mama and here's how it goes. What's your mom's name?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Pat.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
I fucked your mama, Pat.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I fucked her so hard she started to ignore.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
She flattened her out like she was a pancake.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Fucked your...

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Fucked Pat and gave her man-cake batter.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
On her face.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I fucked Pat so hard she turned it to a different race.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
She medically altered.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Fucked her toe, my dick faltered.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Sorry, sorry.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
No, okay, well, no, no.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Sweetie, please.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
No, no, I said stop.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Again?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
No, no, no, no.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Sweetie, please.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I fucked Pat.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I fucked Pat.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Outro? Thanks for coming.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
No, no, Sweetie, no.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
For God's sake.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
We just got to know Kyle.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Okay.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
All right.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Here comes the April monster.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
We heard the fog guard.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
All right, Kyle.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh, okay.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah, can you do the April monster?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
You hear the sounds of far-off showers.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
April approaches.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
With a steady foot and clever hand,

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
you're sure that May flowers are soon to follow.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
All right, great.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
All right, Kyle, why don't you sit in the VIP booth to the right?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Thank you, Kyle.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
I assume you should keep it clean and set up for...

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Don't make them mad.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Don't get popcorn everywhere.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
Dan, should we reserve the VIP section for people who weren't able to get their

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
friends to come because they don't like the show?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yes, yes, exactly.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Is there anyone else who had to come alone because everyone but them hates the thing?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Let's start from the back.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Wait, no, no, no.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
It'll be okay.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
What's your name, sir?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Tim.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Tim, come on up.

16:38.000 --> 16:46.000
This is Tim's song.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Are you okay coming up and talking to us?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Okay, come on up, Tim.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Tim knows about that.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Okay, Tim, you're from Kansas City, or...?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I moved here in May, so...

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Okay.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Why'd you move?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
I got a job here.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Where were you before that?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I was in college.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Okay.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
So you got...

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
At Planet College?

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
Or in a location?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Where were you going to college?

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
At the University of Missouri in Columbia.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Wow.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
All right, all right.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
So obviously...

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Tyler, I'm so sorry.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Now I understand why you didn't say anything.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
All right.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
You'll live.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It seems like...

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
All right.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
We love everyone in Harmontown.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm starting to think that really giving these guys the time of their lives would just talk

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
shit about Missouri all night.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
But you would know that I didn't mean it.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
I would just be wandering into this conflict you're having.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Because from my perspective, as the wandering hero, it's a Liliputian conflict.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
It doesn't...

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I don't know what it means.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
It's like...

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
If it makes you guys feel better, it seems adorable.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I do like it.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I wish I had something like that with...

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
The Kansas City, Missouri...

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
The Kansas, Missouri few does start at the Civil War, which is the favorite of Harmontown.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, okay.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, I've been talking about the Civil War a lot on this tour.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
All right, it was Ken.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Is that it?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Tim, that's close enough on my part.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
All right, you want to take the VIP booth to the left?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
And please keep it clean.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Don't...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
We've got Tim and Kyle, right?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Is there anyone else?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
All right.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Is there to be a VIP?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Do you guys feel...

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Does this feel nice?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Is it comfortable?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
How much more would you pay for this booth?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Okay, you can't put a price on it.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Well, you didn't.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
You didn't buy the fucking booth.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
You guys were offered it.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
You cheaped out, but you're getting a taste because you came here alone.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
If we put a whole family in these booths, then we'd be stealing money from the venue.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
But because you're alone, you won't be able to share it with anybody, so it's like it didn't happen.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
For the listener, we've said this already, but there are four booths that seem like the only seats in the entire...

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah, but mathematically, if we take that time to put one person in each booth, then we have to leave.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Then that's the show.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Like, we only have a certain amount of time up here.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I like Tim and Kyle.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
They're kind of like Stattler and Waldorf.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
But so was the Hindenburg.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Alright, so we got some buddies up here.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
They're VIPs.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
It's good to see VIPs at the show.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
That's good.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Let's see.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Alright, who is in the most pain tonight?

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Like the most devastating, maybe not physical, maybe emotional...

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I just saw a woman with a shaker head now.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And that's her, right?

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Alright, you want to come up here and share your pain?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Oh, you just quit smoking.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
I quit smoking eight years ago. I used to smoke two packs a day.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Do you want me to hypnotize you?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah, come on down.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Okay, can we find some cosmic music?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
No, we don't have any, do we?

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
Is there a woman in the audience who thinks she can pull off a reasonable enya?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
A reasonable copyright-free...

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
There's a guy raising his hand.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Let's bring him up.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
This is exactly how I dressed on prom night, but I wasn't going anywhere.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm Jeff's understudy.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Jeff Davis is understudy? What's your name?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Ryan.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It's like John Crier in Hiding Out.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I get Matthew Broderick a lot.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Oh, Ryan, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah, there's a little Crier, a little Broderick.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
All Jeff Davis.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
All Rock and Roll.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Oh, sorry, what's your name?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Ryan, yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Ryan, okay.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Can we give him a special enya mic?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
There you go.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And your name was, I forgot, already?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Ian.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Ian?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Okay.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Were you hoping that smoke would come out?

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
All right, we're going to, Ian, we're going to take you now, you just sit right there

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
and just let, you're just going to, you're never going to smoke again after this, okay?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Okay, all right.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Okay, I need, if there's anyone, I'm not going to hold my breath, but if anyone's controlling

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
the house lights, we need to bring them down a little bit.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Okay, I didn't, yeah.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
We're on the face of the sun and no one is paying attention to the show.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Who works here?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I...

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
We're a lot, we're Ashki kids.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah, we're, all right.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
So maybe just...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Just give him some hot pockets in a $5 bill.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Maybe just, maybe just close your eyes.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
And Ryan?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Okay, start, start and yank, but in a copyright free way.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Okay.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Who can say what...

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
All right, too many lyrics.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Too many lyrics.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I just need, just need like tones.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Just like meditative tones.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Well, maybe, may I suggest something?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Because he's dressed like Jeff Davis.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Okay.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And he's dressed like his understudy.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Can we just switch places?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I can be the audience volunteer.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
And I'll do some tones.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Oh, you want to control?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Okay.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
And he can control.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
All right, okay.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
All right.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
That's good, Erin.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Thank you.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
That's smart thinking.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
That's good controlling.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Realizing that he, of course, John Crier should be controlling,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
and you should be the woman.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Well, that sounds sexist.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
There's a chance that's to me all the time,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
and you should be the woman.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Of course.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
You should be eating ice cream,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and you should be the woman, meaning give me a spoon.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Okay.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So, John Crier, you take it easy for a second.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Got it.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Erin, you start taking us on a cosmic journey.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Everyone else, lower the house lights in your mind.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Literally, no one is paying attention to the show.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
We're going to help.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Let's see.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Oh, okay.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
We had some go out.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Nice.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Cool.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
And this is to help.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
God damn it.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Ryan, what was your name?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Ken.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Ian.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Ian.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Ian.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Ian.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
You are losing control of your body.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Not in a poopy way.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Ian.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Ian.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Ian.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Ian.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Ian.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Ian.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Ian.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Ian.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Ian.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Ian.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Ian.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Ian.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Ian.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Ian.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Ian.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Ian.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Ian.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Ian.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Ian.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Ian.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Ian.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Ian.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Ian.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Ian.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Ian.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Ian.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Ian.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Ian.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Ian.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Ian.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Ian.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Ian.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Ian.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Ian.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Ian.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Ian.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Ian.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Ian.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Ian.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Ian.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Ian.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Ian.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Ian.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Ian.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Ian.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Ian.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Ian.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Ian.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Ian.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.080
to be sorry, just don't do it again. Sorry Ian, try to relax. There are scorpions crawling

23:56.080 --> 24:05.080
up your arm. The largest of them, the mother, crawls over your ear at which point the baby

24:05.080 --> 24:12.340
is on her underbelly. All eight million of them go into your inner ear canal and lay

24:12.340 --> 24:21.520
eggs in your brain. That's right, baby scorpions lay eggs only in a smoker's brain. Now they're

24:21.520 --> 24:29.680
hatching Ian, your brain is all scorpions. You return to earth, craving nicotine, bent

24:29.680 --> 24:37.120
on a murderous spree, you sting your family, you sting your friends, you sting everyone.

24:37.120 --> 24:47.220
It's a metaphor for secondhand smoke. But now Ian, now you come to a giant apple pie and

24:47.220 --> 24:53.680
you climb inside it and you eat the whole thing because you quit smoking. And every

24:53.680 --> 25:08.800
time you quit smoking, you get a giant apple pie. Ryan? Ian? No, Ian, sorry. Ian, there's

25:08.800 --> 25:13.760
a monster truck coming up the street to the apple pie. It pulls up outside the apple

25:13.760 --> 25:24.800
pie. Hulk Hogan gets out. He gives you one of his patented Hulk Hogan hand gestures. You

25:24.800 --> 25:31.360
can tell you're cool with him now. He doesn't smoke either. Did he die? Did Hulk Hogan die?

25:31.360 --> 25:35.080
No, he's alive. He's alive. Okay, all right. That's cool. If he died, he's a ghost. He's

25:35.080 --> 25:41.840
just involved in a scandal and a sex scandal, but he's fine. You take Hulk Hogan by the hand

25:41.840 --> 25:49.720
and you go into a field, Ian, and you play Frisbee. And he takes you to a water fountain

25:49.720 --> 25:56.400
and you drink cool, fresh, refreshing water with Hulk Hogan. And then you notice as you're

25:56.400 --> 26:04.440
drinking that he's touching you, but you don't care because you look around and you see from

26:04.440 --> 26:10.040
a nearby calendar sculpture that it's the year 2080 and homosexuality is not taboo

26:10.040 --> 26:15.600
anymore. It's a hologram statue. It's designed so that you can look at it from any angle,

26:15.600 --> 26:22.000
so it's not coincidence that you see it. It's not bad story writing on my part. It's just

26:22.000 --> 26:25.800
how it works. You're in the year 2080 and Hulk Hogan is rubbing your crotch as you drink

26:25.800 --> 26:33.800
cool water. Your belly's full of apple pie and you have an orgasm. Now, wake up. Do

26:33.800 --> 26:43.720
you want a cigarette, Ian? All right. Well, pretend he said no. You want one, but you

26:43.720 --> 26:48.520
know that baby scorpions are going to lay eggs in your brain. All right. I'm glad I

26:48.520 --> 26:52.720
could help, Ian. Spencer, how are we doing on time? Do we have to play Dungeons & Dragons?

26:52.720 --> 26:55.320
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I should be asking where I am.

26:55.320 --> 27:04.880
It's 6.34. That's a time that... What you're realizing now is that we have not been up

27:04.880 --> 27:11.240
here for very long. Usually, time goes so much faster. I don't know why.

27:11.240 --> 27:18.320
Ryan, if you could have anything, what do you want? What is your dream?

27:18.320 --> 27:24.760
What's my dream? I actually want to... I want to do stand-up comedy and I want to do...

27:24.760 --> 27:28.920
I want to be a writer for TV, actually. That's why I'm here.

27:28.920 --> 27:34.760
Do you have a strong two minutes, Ryan? Yeah. Yeah, I could do two.

27:34.760 --> 27:39.320
Do you want to come out in the thrust and do them to an audience of Kansas City Comics?

27:39.320 --> 27:48.560
All right. Here, I'll do you the favor. I'll give you a horrible opener so that the bar

27:48.560 --> 27:56.400
is lowered for you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nickelbackers.

27:56.400 --> 28:03.640
Please remember, Rob Schneider will be here next week, the star of Sheeps of Heaven.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.520
And on all next week, it's ladies' night. All the ladies get to be ladies. You don't

28:07.520 --> 28:17.840
get anything for free. We just won't punch you. You don't have to boo that.

28:17.840 --> 28:23.280
We're not proud of our policies here, ma'am, at Nickelbackers.

28:23.280 --> 28:28.320
Now coming to the stage, the opener for tonight's act. It's not you, Ryan. It's a different guy.

28:28.320 --> 28:38.000
Schmaggle Flangehand! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You ever notice the Chinese people are inferior?

28:38.000 --> 28:43.480
Whoa! What are they eating? Why are they eating it? Whoa!

28:43.480 --> 28:50.040
Okay, come on now. What are you talking about? Knock, knock. Who's there? Fuck you, I'm racist.

28:50.040 --> 28:58.640
Whoa! I got AIDS in my blood. I'm spraying it on the audience. Oh! It's like Gallagher,

28:58.640 --> 29:05.440
but you got AIDS now. Whoa! Okay, well, I'd like to settle it down for a minute and tell

29:05.440 --> 29:11.080
you about my wife, Veronica. She's struggling with breast cancer, and there's a table of

29:11.080 --> 29:16.640
t-shirts in the back. I'd really like you to buy them. Oh, thank you very much. I've

29:16.640 --> 29:22.240
received a note that all your cars have been stolen, and wherever they are, there's people

29:22.240 --> 29:29.760
sleeping in them. But the people sleeping in them are covered with little tiny spikes

29:29.760 --> 29:36.800
filled with poison. So let them be, and then you'll be okay, and you just need a new car,

29:36.800 --> 29:42.920
and all your lives are ruined. Also, you have AIDS. All right, well, I guess I did pretty

29:42.920 --> 29:47.280
poorly with my stand-up act, but we're going to bring a new guy to the stage. He's going

29:47.280 --> 29:54.720
to do two strong minutes of stand-up, because he's a well-respected stand-up comic. He's

29:54.720 --> 30:05.280
performed at clubs and colleges all over the thing of a bomb. Please welcome Ryan Solomon!

30:05.280 --> 30:10.600
Hi, guys. Thanks for coming out here. You guys look great. I don't know about you guys.

30:10.600 --> 30:15.160
Every time I see Channing Tatum in a movie, all I can think is how much better Ryan Gosling

30:15.160 --> 30:21.520
would have been. And every time I kiss my wife, all I can think is how much better Ryan Gosling

30:21.520 --> 30:26.800
would have been. And when I say that, people usually ask me, and by people I mean my wife,

30:26.800 --> 30:30.520
Ryan, do you mean you can't help but think of how much better Ryan Gosling would have

30:30.520 --> 30:35.480
been at kissing you, or how much better Ryan Gosling would have been at kissing your wife?

30:35.480 --> 30:42.360
And the answer is either. Both. In an ideal world, my wife and I would never kiss each

30:42.360 --> 30:50.040
other. There would just be two Ryan Goslings sharing a tender embrace. Have you guys ever

30:50.040 --> 30:54.320
done something horrible, like just so bad you just never wanted to tell anybody? No,

30:54.320 --> 31:00.120
good. You're perfect. Thank you. Well, for the rest of you, you should do something like

31:00.120 --> 31:03.520
terrible. You just don't want to even bring up again, like you're messing around with

31:03.520 --> 31:08.240
some friends in the woods, and you push one, and he falls, and he breaks his nose, and

31:08.240 --> 31:14.560
there's so much blood that you just run away. That didn't happen. Or maybe like in college,

31:14.560 --> 31:18.680
a bunch of girls run into your dorm room and steal a bunch of your stuff. So to get them

31:18.680 --> 31:21.920
back, you take one of the flashlights that you're buying from one of them, and you just

31:21.920 --> 31:27.600
take a shit in it, and then you give it to her. And then like a couple of years later,

31:27.600 --> 31:34.400
you just go ahead and marry her. Yeah, that did happen. That did happen. Seven years ago,

31:34.400 --> 31:39.320
I was going on a mission trip with a church when I was in high school, and we were going

31:39.320 --> 31:45.600
to help just some people in West Virginia. And a few months prior, a woman had tragically

31:45.600 --> 31:53.680
lost her son, her very young son, in a car accident. And the weeks before it happened,

31:53.680 --> 32:00.040
she saw, kept saying that he saw a bunny in the yard, and his mom never saw it. And after

32:00.040 --> 32:06.200
the horrible event, she got this package, and it was a statue of a bunny. And it wasn't,

32:06.200 --> 32:09.560
it didn't say who it was from. So she was like, very confused. She was very, she was

32:09.560 --> 32:13.520
like, where did this come from? And while we were on the trip, after a particularly

32:13.520 --> 32:19.160
rowdy night at a pizza place, we were riding back to where we were staying, and bus stopped.

32:19.160 --> 32:23.680
And I was like, why? Why is the bus stopping? And it turns out there was a bunny in the

32:23.680 --> 32:29.680
middle of the road, and it wouldn't move. I couldn't understand why it wouldn't move.

32:29.680 --> 32:34.400
Most people on the bus understood the significance of this bunny, and this poor woman who went

32:34.400 --> 32:39.280
through something that no parent should ever have to go through. Most, most people on the

32:39.280 --> 32:47.160
bus realized the significance. Almost everybody knew what was going on. Some people just wanted

32:47.160 --> 32:54.520
to go back to where we were staying. Some people just all hopped up on root beer and pizza,

32:54.520 --> 32:59.960
didn't really know what was going on, why a bunny was stopping us. Some people started

32:59.960 --> 33:10.840
to chant, or maybe one person started to chant, or more like just yell, run it over, run it

33:10.840 --> 33:22.320
over, run it. Oh, shit. Do you think she heard me? And I never looked her in the eyes again.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.320
That was the end of the, that was the worst thing I ever did. So, thank you very much.

33:25.320 --> 33:33.800
Ryan Solomon, everybody! Oh, don't forget, I'm racist. Thank you, Ryan Solomon. Could

33:33.800 --> 33:44.320
it be worse? Ryan Solomon! Keep your eyes out for that kid. You can sit in a VIP seat,

33:44.320 --> 33:50.920
Ryan. Yeah, sit in a VIP booth if you want. When I was like, oh, who's going to stop the

33:50.920 --> 33:58.240
music? Then I realized. Spencer, tell me my biggest flaw. Take my fucking head off, man.

33:58.240 --> 34:06.560
I can't, man. You're like my hero. My shoes? Yeah, they're untied, bro. That's your flaw.

34:06.560 --> 34:12.920
Is that just the drunk lady in the back? Can we talk about Ryan really quick? You want

34:12.920 --> 34:19.000
to talk? Yeah, that is my biggest flaw. Can somebody top me off? It's a mass hysteria

34:19.000 --> 34:29.000
up here. I need more ice first, but that's fine. All right. Death is the theme of tonight's

34:29.000 --> 34:37.840
show in Kansas City. I really liked Ryan's Ryan Gosling joke. I correct me if I'm wrong

34:37.840 --> 34:43.080
audience, but it seemed like you guys were really ready to not like anything Ryan did.

34:43.080 --> 34:50.080
No, that's not true. They were... Oh, well, fine. That's good. No, I expected bigger

34:50.080 --> 34:57.760
laughs. Don't make us throw Ryan under the bus. His Ryan Gosling joke worked, and then

34:57.760 --> 35:02.520
it had too many taglines, and then he had that big, long conceptual thing with the rabbit.

35:02.520 --> 35:12.320
He lost us. Ryan, I'm standing up here fucking crucified on Golgotha. Do not let that hurt

35:12.320 --> 35:19.320
your feelings at all. No, can we hear it again for Ryan? That was very brave and great. It

35:19.320 --> 35:33.040
was really great. It's good. It was weird that you attacked Ryan for his jokes, Aaron.

35:33.040 --> 35:37.880
That's not what I meant to do. I wasn't attacking Ryan. I misunderstood the audience. I'm sorry.

35:37.880 --> 35:41.840
It's these lights, guys. I always felt most traumatized on the playground whenever people

35:41.840 --> 35:46.680
would stick up for me. That's always when I would start to cry. I know you're my audience,

35:46.680 --> 35:51.120
so I know some of you know what it's like to get picked on on the playground. It would

35:51.120 --> 35:56.440
never make me cry to get picked on. People bully me. They give you face washes in the

35:56.440 --> 36:02.200
snow, swirlies in the toilet, and melvins in the hu-ha, and they just punch you and ask

36:02.200 --> 36:05.080
you, why don't you shower? Why do you drop your pants all the way to the floor when you

36:05.080 --> 36:09.800
take a pee at the urinal? Why are there skid marks in your underwear when you do that? Why

36:09.800 --> 36:16.000
do you eat paste? Why do you think a glue bottle is a rocket? Why is your hair full of dandruff

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
and grease?

36:17.000 --> 36:21.780
Well, I understand. Just to clarify, I wasn't sticking up for Ryan. I just wanted to give

36:21.780 --> 36:23.280
him extra credit.

36:23.280 --> 36:28.160
But then it would always be the people that would come up in the midst of it. Well, somebody

36:28.160 --> 36:31.880
was picking on me because that would just make me gird my loins. I would just go, okay,

36:31.880 --> 36:35.080
this is the way life is. I'm going to put the shields up. I'm going to be a porcupine.

36:35.080 --> 36:39.280
I'm going to, like, this pain. I'll get numb to it. Then some well-meaning fucker would

36:39.280 --> 36:44.040
come up and go like, hey, leave him alone, man, just because he's all fucked up and dirty

36:44.040 --> 36:49.120
and greasy and shitty and doesn't fit. He doesn't have to be a normal person for you

36:49.120 --> 36:54.960
to like him, okay? Maybe he's special. Maybe he's so fucked up that something really weird

36:54.960 --> 37:02.360
about him is good. You don't know. Maybe some really specific situation will happen, like

37:02.360 --> 37:08.600
a flood of chemicals that only freaks can breathe. Maybe bat creatures will attack that

37:08.600 --> 37:15.760
have a weird-shaped face that is vulnerable to fucking gross stinky nerds. And then he'll

37:15.760 --> 37:21.560
be a hero then. And then I would always start crying because that's the guy that likes me.

37:21.560 --> 37:26.720
Like sticking up for me. And then when I would start crying, and then the nerd protector

37:26.720 --> 37:31.640
would go like, you know, come on, so you know he's crying. You're a bad person. Don't pick

37:31.640 --> 37:35.160
on people. You shouldn't pick on people that are gross, stinky, shitty nerds.

37:35.160 --> 37:40.520
Well, Ryan, just so you know, that's not what I was doing. Now it's kind of what Dan's doing

37:40.520 --> 37:46.280
because he qualified it that way. But I was just offering you more applause.

37:46.280 --> 37:52.280
Ryan, you and I are fucking square. Also, Erin, I was just kidding. I didn't think you

37:52.280 --> 37:57.360
were doing anything wrong. Jesus Christ, have we learned one thing in Kansas City? If not,

37:57.360 --> 38:05.280
we almost go through a valley of darkness. Beef, beef, a valley of beef. I've got VIPs

38:05.280 --> 38:07.240
up here now. I can't remember which or which.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.720
Yeah, can we check in with our Wallace and Gromit?

38:10.720 --> 38:11.720
Tim?

38:11.720 --> 38:12.720
Kyle?

38:12.720 --> 38:13.720
Tim.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
Ryan.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.720
Kyle, Ryan.

38:15.720 --> 38:21.640
How come people can't be named like banana, like Terrier? Like you can't have a code name

38:21.640 --> 38:26.080
or something. Like, you know, like G.I. Joe, like if you had a flamethrower on your back,

38:26.080 --> 38:30.960
your name was barbecue, you know, like, like if you had skis, your name wasn't Christmas

38:30.960 --> 38:31.960
tree.

38:31.960 --> 38:32.960
Dan, you have a rap about this, right?

38:32.960 --> 38:33.960
Uh-huh. Yes.

38:33.960 --> 38:39.760
G.I. Joe had really clear names. He never had to tell men from games who just looked

38:39.760 --> 38:44.600
at their hat and that's what they were. If they were fat, their name was Raymond Burr.

38:44.600 --> 38:52.080
Perry Mason. Fuck you. Jarza Cason. Fuck you. Keep thinking about April and Pat. I fucked

38:52.080 --> 38:59.360
April and then I fucked Pat. Fucked Pat and made April watch. You listening, April? Fucking

38:59.360 --> 39:09.920
April, you unsupportive wife. April. Listen to me, April. I do this shit for free, April.

39:09.920 --> 39:14.440
No one charges for it. Your husband came down here and you thought he was going to have

39:14.440 --> 39:18.720
a bad time. He's sitting in the fucking VIP slut booth.

39:18.720 --> 39:23.560
Can we, can we, can we hear more about why she didn't, why she didn't like it?

39:23.560 --> 39:28.600
He could get high licking that tabletop. That is, that's where Tim Allen sits when he comes

39:28.600 --> 39:33.160
down. Like, you know that if you ran your finger on the underside of that table and rubbed

39:33.160 --> 39:38.920
your gums, you, you, you go in for dental surgery for half price. Like, he is in the

39:38.920 --> 39:44.440
VIP booth, April. You drove him here. You drove him away. If he comes home tonight, you're

39:44.440 --> 39:52.680
lucky. And it's because he's a Harmontown listener that he'll stay faithful to you April.

39:52.680 --> 39:57.920
Because he's a nerd and he knows what it's like to be like me and Ryan, be unappreciated.

39:57.920 --> 40:03.520
And, and, and so he's going to, he's going to have a moment of compassion as, as all

40:03.520 --> 40:06.920
these fellow Harmontown fans. And there's a lot of good looking chicks out here in the

40:06.920 --> 40:14.720
audience tonight. And they're going to be all over. Is it, is it Kyle? I can't, okay.

40:14.720 --> 40:19.520
Dan, that is, that is an interesting phenomenon. I talked to a few people before the show who

40:19.520 --> 40:23.840
were either here with their partners or had come without them who had said like, I try

40:23.840 --> 40:27.040
to get my girlfriend to come, but she wouldn't come or I try to get my boyfriend to come.

40:27.040 --> 40:31.400
What do you, where do you stand on that? Like you and I kind of like the same things, but

40:31.400 --> 40:35.040
I would absolutely, I think, I think it's a very supportive thing to say, go ahead,

40:35.040 --> 40:38.160
go to the show, but I'm not going to go because that's not my cup of tea. I think you're

40:38.160 --> 40:44.920
fine, April. Your mom also, I think it's fine. Let's, let's call her who she is, Pat. I think,

40:44.920 --> 40:50.120
I think she's amazing. Is there anyone in the audience who, who has fallen in love over

40:50.120 --> 40:54.840
Harmontown? Yeah, has anybody like, uh, anybody, anybody

40:54.840 --> 40:58.920
It's wishful thinking. The, the, the, the face that I received after that question.

40:58.920 --> 41:04.200
Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of fishing for something. You can't blame yourself for it. All right.

41:04.200 --> 41:09.480
So let's get back to April's mom, Pat. Uh, so, uh, where, where, where, where, where

41:09.480 --> 41:16.760
is Pat from? Um, probably Missouri, central Missouri, right in the middle of the fucking

41:16.760 --> 41:28.560
the death star, that piece of shit state. Show me more like, don't show me. I don't want

41:28.560 --> 41:36.200
to see it. Keep that fridge door closed, Missouri. How weird that your state is a barely mispronounced

41:36.200 --> 41:46.000
misery. What a coincidence. You sons of bitches. Dan, one of our closest friends is from Missouri.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.800
Who? Kimber, Kimber Hall, my, my, uh, my closest friend, my roommate. I'm just trying to get

41:51.800 --> 41:56.840
these guys on my side. It's fine, but you're uniting them via hatred. I don't think they

41:56.840 --> 42:00.760
want that. They're smarter than that. Uh, play it, play it, play the, play the country

42:00.760 --> 42:03.840
song. I'm going to sing a country song about Missouri sucking.

42:09.840 --> 42:20.320
All right. Hip stop and a boot, boot, lock, ring, ring. I do, do, not even I'll do. Well,

42:20.320 --> 42:30.000
my name is John Missouri. I'm a shit eating son of a fucker. I went to my house and never

42:30.000 --> 42:36.320
hoped for supper because I eat dogs and dirt and cigarettes and I wear peanut butter for

42:36.320 --> 42:46.400
a hat. I'm a big dumb fucking asshole piece of shit and my wife's name is Pat. I'm Kyle's

42:46.400 --> 42:55.400
father. Hold on. Let's go. I lost my place. Sorry. Deep, dumb, deep, dumb, a doob, a dumb

42:55.400 --> 43:05.640
doob. Here we go. Second verse. I'm Kyle's father. My wife's name is Pat. I gave birth

43:05.640 --> 43:14.080
to Kyle. My good effects stopped at that. I've never done anything good. I live in a

43:14.080 --> 43:24.320
pile of leaves. I'm a big piece of fucking shit. I'm from Missouri. It's got no right

43:24.320 --> 43:34.520
to have half of Kansas City. Just leave your garbage on the lawn. I got three feet and

43:34.520 --> 43:45.200
half a hand. I got Russell Brand on the Tivo because I like his style. I'm a big piece

43:45.200 --> 43:52.680
of fucking mother fucking shit from Missouri. I hate Missouri. I mean, I love it and I'm

43:52.680 --> 43:59.880
a piece of shit. Sorry. All right. We can do anything together now.

43:59.880 --> 44:07.440
It's almost time for D&D, but I'm so curious to hear from somebody who's a hardcore Kansas

44:07.440 --> 44:11.520
loyal, well, bowl. Are you from Missouri? I just want someone to say what they hate

44:11.520 --> 44:15.840
about Missouri. No, no, no, no. We have better. We have a Missouri. Are you willing to come

44:15.840 --> 44:22.440
up? Please, no one kill him after the show. No, no, nobody's going to kill him. Oh, thank

44:22.440 --> 44:28.720
you. Thank you. Is that a, where's a, I know Amanda's one of the servers. Where's a, is

44:28.720 --> 44:33.000
that you? Oh, okay. Cause you did, I have face blindness and you changed your hair before

44:33.000 --> 44:38.760
the show. Amanda and the other servers, don't forget to tip them. I sometimes believe it

44:38.760 --> 44:47.240
or not, people forget to do that. It also seems weird that people would, would forget

44:47.240 --> 44:51.480
that you always hear people say, don't forget. So they must forget occasionally. I'm basing

44:51.480 --> 44:54.920
it on that alone. Hello, sir. What's your name?

44:54.920 --> 45:00.600
Darren. Darren, the human being from Missouri. He's a human being. How dare you.

45:00.600 --> 45:05.640
Don't boo him. Don't boo, don't. Actually, actually, the song that you sang was, was

45:05.640 --> 45:13.280
fairly accurate. See, he's a self loathing. His, his, his, his pulse beats. It's, it's

45:13.280 --> 45:15.040
Darren. Yeah, Darren.

45:15.040 --> 45:20.640
Darren, we have the same name. Why, why does everyone pick on you on Missouri? I don't

45:20.640 --> 45:25.520
know. I think it's cause we have a better baseball team. Is it the same thing in Missouri?

45:25.520 --> 45:30.240
Do you guys pick on Kansas? Yeah. Well, yeah. We're on one side of Missouri. They're on

45:30.240 --> 45:33.960
the other side. What divides you? Is it a river? I mean, I, I know it's hatred, but

45:33.960 --> 45:40.640
is there a river between what's that? A river of hate. Okay. I think you said river of paint.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.080
It was like, okay, wait, is there, is that like an industrial thing? Like there's, this

45:44.080 --> 45:49.640
fuckers from Missouri, they make paint and then they put it into the river. You tell

45:49.640 --> 45:54.000
me, so it's a, it's a geologically, geographically, it's a river that separates the two parts

45:54.000 --> 45:57.400
of the city. Pretty much. I don't understand why they're both the same city then. What,

45:57.400 --> 46:01.160
and I'm, they, they, they're saying the same thing. What, what the hell happened? What,

46:01.160 --> 46:08.000
what is going on? I had, I had no idea. I, I failed geography and all that stuff. I'm

46:08.000 --> 46:11.160
the wrong person to ask about that. All right. Well, I don't, okay. I'm not going to get

46:11.160 --> 46:18.480
any answers here tonight. We should just stick with the, all right. Somebody's calling out

46:18.480 --> 46:23.720
something that's sports related. Hey, Aaron, let's do a, no, he's, he's, oh no, no, it's

46:23.720 --> 46:27.400
okay. Thank you for coming out. He's excusing himself off the stage. Oh, Darren's excusing

46:27.400 --> 46:31.720
himself. Well, Darren, did you, wait, Darren, Darren, wait, we can't let you go right away.

46:31.720 --> 46:37.920
This is how thick this conflict is. I want to know, I want to know from Darren what his,

46:37.920 --> 46:43.760
what his, what is your, can you tell us like a wish that you have, a big ambition or anything

46:43.760 --> 46:52.240
like that? I, I wanted to hear a second season of the, the werewolf teenager show that we

46:52.240 --> 46:57.080
did in Charlotte. Yeah. All right. We'll beat that you Missouri fucker. That's not going

46:57.080 --> 47:03.120
to make any sense. What's, what's a personal wish of yours besides Missouri and Kansas getting

47:03.120 --> 47:09.040
along besides fucking Pat, which all of us, we all want to do that. Are you listening

47:09.040 --> 47:18.000
April? Yeah, I, I really, I, I have none. So, oh, I'm a really happy person. Darren,

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
she's just sticking up for it. Is there anyone, Darren, is there anyone who you love who has

47:22.000 --> 47:27.280
a dream? Libby Huey over there has a dream. Yeah, which, which is her dream? What's lovey's

47:27.280 --> 47:33.080
dream? I think she wants to be a musician. We've been dating for five years and I, I

47:33.080 --> 47:36.360
literally know nothing about her. All right. Okay. All right. Let's, let, let, let's thank

47:36.360 --> 47:39.120
Darren and we're going to do it. We're going to do a quick movie for Darren. We're going

47:39.120 --> 47:44.880
to, we're going to create a movie for him. Aaron, I want you to play Libby Huey in, in

47:44.880 --> 47:49.480
the Darren and Libby story about, about two star cross lovers from different sides of

47:49.480 --> 48:03.320
Kansas City. I'd like you to play Darren. A tale of two sides of the same city.

48:03.320 --> 48:15.960
What's that sound from outside my shitty Missouri apartment? I'm going to go out and

48:15.960 --> 48:22.760
check it out. Whoa. Almost fell in the river. That's right outside my door. Excuse me, young

48:22.760 --> 48:30.160
lady. I'm sorry. I'm just Darren. I was just in my apartment, just wanting nothing. And

48:30.160 --> 48:36.840
I, I, I couldn't help but overhear this, this, this sound. What is, what's going on?

48:36.840 --> 48:45.920
I, I'm playing the guitar. Oh, musician. Well, I want to be. I'd love to hear some more,

48:45.920 --> 48:54.200
but this damn river lies between us. Would you, would you meet me at the bridge where

48:54.200 --> 49:02.160
there's that, that, that, that dinosaur cafe in Kansas City? Well, what if we met right

49:02.160 --> 49:07.080
in the middle of the bridge? You know, we're neither of us were in either part of the city.

49:07.080 --> 49:11.440
All right. I, I can do that. I just don't speak too loudly or my family will kill me

49:11.440 --> 49:24.720
and cut out my brain. Okay. Three hours later. I'm not sure how the, the, the, it works that

49:24.720 --> 49:36.800
here we are in the middle of the bridge. Hey, I never touched a Kansas City girls face.

49:36.800 --> 49:44.080
I mean, a Kansas girls face. I always touch Kansas City. We're both from Kansas City.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.960
I don't know if you can. My, my family told me that if a Missourin ever touched my face

49:48.960 --> 50:06.960
that my skin would melt and turn into an army if Nazis would destroy the planet. Can I touch

50:06.960 --> 50:33.800
it? Should I feel you? Yes, I should. When you smile and I smile, when you laugh, I laugh.

50:33.800 --> 50:48.480
Oh, my God, Oh my God.

50:48.480 --> 50:55.440
This is a Understood Police. You were in violation of the non Mes Simpson nation Treaty Between

50:55.440 --> 51:01.120
Kansas and Missouri. Please stop interpreting with that inferior Missouri woman and get

51:01.120 --> 51:07.880
back to your home. I'm sorry, I'm a helicopter pilot. I get confused because I often cross

51:07.880 --> 51:13.600
between the things. I'll explain later, but just know that you guys are forbidden to do

51:13.600 --> 51:23.160
what you're doing. Run! Run! We have to go to Omaha. Go through this sewer. It'll take

51:23.160 --> 51:38.000
us straight there. Oh, God. Oh, shit, Omaha. Oh, where everything is mutual. I kind of

51:38.000 --> 51:44.480
set myself up there, didn't I? Hey, I should let you know now, I have five years in me.

51:44.480 --> 51:50.880
What does that mean? Look, there was a prophecy. I read it on a plate when I was 15 years old

51:50.880 --> 51:54.840
that said that I would meet a man from the other side of the river. We would start dating

51:54.840 --> 52:00.320
and then we would stop after five years and we would go to a comedy show and then one

52:00.320 --> 52:10.000
of us would eat the other's face. Five years from now? It was a long plate. Yes, five years

52:10.000 --> 52:19.800
from now. Libby, I wouldn't eat your face. Really? But what if I ate your face? What

52:19.800 --> 52:49.720
if I ate your face? Put your blood out of place. You won't eat milk.

52:49.720 --> 53:00.480
Are you gonna say me? I was gonna say milk. You're fucking weird. I can't do this relationship

53:00.480 --> 53:09.120
anymore. Open up in there. It's the International Omaha Police Department. We know you're in

53:09.120 --> 53:16.040
there. Intermingling with Kansas and Missouri people. We're coming in with our special futuristic

53:16.040 --> 53:24.960
Omaha bathroom rams. Put them on laser setting. I don't even know who this bitch is. I'm

53:24.960 --> 53:39.280
out of here. 20 years later in Kansas City, maximum security, future prison. Libby, I've

53:39.280 --> 53:51.800
got good news. You're up for parole. Oh, you gave birth. No, this is Sarah's. No, I didn't

53:51.800 --> 53:56.000
give birth because I've been without my one two love this whole time, but thanks for rubbing

53:56.000 --> 54:00.840
in it. Well, you've got a big awakening in for you. You know that in the time you've

54:00.840 --> 54:07.240
been incarcerated, the laws have changed. The river's dried up. The laws can never change.

54:07.240 --> 54:11.720
There's no more river, Libby. Kansas and Missouri can never get a law. There's no more river.

54:11.720 --> 54:17.480
It's gone. There's no more water. There's no more river. All the cities are united now.

54:17.480 --> 54:24.400
East and West, New Hampshire, St. Louis and Minneapolis are the same thing now. It's called

54:24.400 --> 54:32.120
St. Louis. St. Louis. You geography genius. Thank you for letting me know. I say go out

54:32.120 --> 54:39.640
there and go to that man that betrayed you and left you because it seems like an ending.

54:39.640 --> 54:48.520
Maybe not a good one. I'm going to find him. You never close your eyes when I crawl through

54:48.520 --> 55:01.760
weeds and jump over fences. And? Darren. Darren. Darren. I'm behind you. What? No one's behind

55:01.760 --> 55:10.200
you in front of anyone anymore. It's post-Riverdom. I've been behind you the whole time. I went

55:10.200 --> 55:18.080
to prison too. You did? I was your parole officer. Well, that's fucked up. Why didn't

55:18.080 --> 55:22.480
you say something? I didn't want you to get mad at me for taking a job at the place where

55:22.480 --> 55:26.920
you were imprisoned. I always knew that you loved me as someone who didn't want to do

55:26.920 --> 55:36.360
anything. I got you this guitar. It's made of shoes and corn. I love shoes, so I'll

55:36.360 --> 55:57.680
forget everything you just said. I just want to have a happy ending in eight years. Because

55:57.680 --> 56:18.280
misery and Kansas are the same. Oh, Erin, what a great movie. You guys understand, right?

56:18.280 --> 56:26.400
You get it. Yeah. Spencer, how did you feel about that? It was good, but I liked your

56:26.400 --> 56:34.080
lyrics. There was a deleted scene in that movie where Kyle's wife's April's mother's

56:34.080 --> 56:43.720
pat took like a million dicks in her face. You hear that, April? Your mother had to be

56:43.720 --> 56:51.200
cut out of the movie because it was too dirty when she was in it. No, but be fair. She only

56:51.200 --> 56:57.400
took a million dicks because she already has a million dicks. She wanted friends for her

56:57.400 --> 57:01.120
dicks already. The owner of the club was giving us the light, and I automatically assumed

57:01.120 --> 57:07.400
it was like a camcorder. I was like, oh, the show's going better. He's taping us. I automatically

57:07.400 --> 57:21.120
assumed it's time for Dungeons and Dragons. All right, when we last met, Jesus, are you

57:21.120 --> 57:25.680
okay? Yeah, you don't give me any time to set up beforehand. You just randomly cue me

57:25.680 --> 57:29.800
and start the music. Hey, do you see me dying up here, motherfucker? Well, you could have

57:29.800 --> 57:33.440
said something. We're fighting. You and I are fighting. You want to fight right now?

57:33.440 --> 57:41.000
Yeah, I don't think we should play Dungeons and Dragons. I'm sorry, Spencer. Now we've

57:41.000 --> 57:45.640
made up and we've atoned. There, my sense of story structure is appeased. That's it.

57:45.640 --> 57:50.160
That's all we need. All right. Yeah. Sometimes it's a shitty movie. Last time we met, our

57:50.160 --> 57:55.120
heroes had been journeying in the belly of the beast. No, I don't, I don't, I don't think

57:55.120 --> 57:59.360
that's it. Okay, all right. I think I've got to say something. Should I keep going, guys?

57:59.360 --> 58:06.840
No, I, I have something to say. Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden. I, you know, Spencer and

58:06.840 --> 58:13.040
I have been doing merch this whole time. Yeah. And Spencer has been very thoughtful and very

58:13.040 --> 58:20.560
kind and very attentive. What do you mean attentive? I just mean he's sensitive to the way I feel

58:20.560 --> 58:29.840
and he really sees me. Like he really sees like your crotch and stuff? No, not yet. I

58:29.840 --> 58:39.560
mean, I just, this is crazy. I'm just saying he's, he's, he's, he's very kind and sensitive.

58:39.560 --> 58:45.040
And you know, you've, you've been a bit of a bully. And I think that, that maybe over

58:45.040 --> 58:51.720
the course of this trip, Spencer and I have become close. All right. Well, that's fine.

58:51.720 --> 58:56.160
Can I, we only have like six minutes left. Yeah. Okay. All right. Sorry. Pause. J.K.

58:56.160 --> 59:02.160
All right. Here we go. I don't even know. You guys are in a fish. All right. Feel our

59:02.160 --> 59:07.160
character. You rejoined and entered a large cavity after fighting a mucousy spider slime

59:07.160 --> 59:15.520
and several spindly limb lightning creatures. You defeated them. You were left in the long.

59:15.520 --> 59:19.320
Do you want characters right now? Should we just go? Like we could just go. Let's just

59:19.320 --> 59:23.200
go freestyle. Yeah. Freestyle it. All right. If there's a spell I should cast. Tell me.

59:23.200 --> 59:30.280
Okay. So what, what did you do? Well, that just sounds deadly. What did you say, Ian?

59:30.280 --> 59:38.560
He said a roll of a thousand dicks. Oh yeah. Pat. Yeah. There were a thousand dicks involved.

59:38.560 --> 59:46.160
I was definitely talking about Pat. Yeah. April's mom. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, I mean,

59:46.160 --> 59:51.600
honestly, now we have two minutes left. That's all right. Just go smoke a cigarette. You're,

59:51.600 --> 59:56.600
you're killing us. Oh no. No, don't really, don't really. That's not. You put so much

59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.160
work into that. I quit eight years ago. I was smoking two packs a day. I don't even fucking

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:05.160
think about it. It gets so easy. He really doesn't. I've never seen him. It gets so easy.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.120
Don't worry more about it. All right. If you recall, you killed those things. You're now

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.680
in a lung and you started, uh, you, you set some smoke to make it cough. Right. All right.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.920
So now we're like what we're like almost out of the fish or the lung spasming. Right. Right.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.680
We wait as the lung spasms and spasms. So violently, it threatens to shake apart. You

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.600
get the sensation that if you would only breach its membrane, it could be torn asunder very

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:40.000
quickly. I agree. I just agree. You're just agreeing for that. Yeah. I don't have time

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:48.720
to disagree. Yeah. What is it? There's a very, uh, pretty drunk girl. Very happy lady. She's

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.400
enjoying it. It's a good show. Yeah. Yeah. She had a good time. Yeah. Uh, stay, stick,

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.640
stick around for all the comics that are going on next that are sitting next to you. It'll

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.600
be great. Um, all right. The, uh, uh, uh, uh, we, we breach the membrane, whatever you

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.280
said that we get the sense we could do. Okay. Well, uh, you do you have a sword? You don't

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.880
have a sword. You have a knife. I tell, I tell a quirk to, uh, uh, do it with his far

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.920
sword. All right. I got this sword. Let me just slice through. He pulls out his sword

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.880
and making a couple of slices across the belly of the membrane that you guys are currently

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.520
in. It slashes open and the smoke pours out. You feel the entire creature you're surrounded

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.280
by give a violent shutter as if it was hurt or wounded. And you feel yourself drop in

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.320
the sky as if the entire thing had fell down a couple hundred yards before regaining traction.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.680
Oh, shit. You're definitely done something, but it's not dead yet. Okay. Well, probably

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.560
good cause we don't want to die with it. Oh, we don't want to die with that. Well, yeah,

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.440
we don't want to plummet to earth and explode with us in it. You know, we're giving a final

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:57.280
violent shutter and the entire lung you're inside of falls apart and you fall down about

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.360
50 feet till you land on a pillowy cushion back in the room you were in before. Oh, nice.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:08.080
Convenient. It's like a video game. Yeah. All right. Uh, well, uh, uh, can we see that

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.680
that that village from here that the things you can see you're in a green room. There's

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.880
three holes. One of them you just came through. The other two you haven't been through back

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.040
behind you is a small purple door that leads back towards the village. Right. All right.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:27.840
We got to go through each of these. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I really don't want to pay you

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.680
more attention because I have to take an asset because this would be a trip. There's a woman

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.600
in the audience who said, have you ever taken acid before? I have. I've taken acid in mushrooms.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:45.920
I haven't done heroin or, uh, uh, uh, ayahuasca, but some, a fan gave us a jar of ayahuasca

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.600
at, uh, at the show and we should go take it now and in the tour bus and, uh, and finish

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.520
this evening. Um, all right. We've dropped 50 feet. Well, not, not to, you guys have

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.840
been great. You guys, thank you for coming to the show. You know, you've been amazing,

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.440
but it's, it's seven 10. We got to be off the stage in five minutes. So I don't, we should,

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.760
we should, let's just wrap up the Dungeons and Dragons. I roll over, I roll over on top

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.520
of Sharpie. Okay. Nice. Good. That's very nice, isn't it? All right. Spencer, everybody.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:25.440
Thank him for the wonderful. Thank you Spencer. Sometimes Dungeons and Dragons doesn't last

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:34.560
that long. Hey, Dan. So, so this, this show is, uh, probably a, uh, pivotal, pivotal.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:43.880
Yeah. Are you drunk too? Yeah. Super. Okay. SCC singing sectionals. Is that like, is that,

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.800
is that your cheerleading trooper? Is that what are you, are you just cheering for a

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.120
team of yours? She doesn't know you're talking to her. Okay. That's fine. Okay. You're a

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.240
fire hydrant to her and vice versa. Quite all right. Uh, Dan, this is a, this, this

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:05.560
is an important moment in the, in your story circle. Right. This is, this is what? The

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.560
death? Perhaps. Do you want to queue up here? Maybe it requires something. Yeah, that's

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.200
what I'm doing. Right. Right. Yeah. What have we learned in Kansas City?

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:28.000
Ooh. Ian, take it easy. Just don't smoke. Libby, keep loving your gross misery, man.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And your gross misery, man. Drunk lady. Keep drinking. I've seen a beautiful city. Its

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:47.760
name was Kansas City. As soft and creamy as a titty for me in misogyny town. Man, I'm

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:56.120
sorry if I sucked, but really who gives a fuck? Cause the room kind of looks like a

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:06.840
place that you'd go to. A lot of customers survey about crackers. In a shopping mall.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:18.080
In Hama town. Poop is brown. I fucked your mama. I fucked her good. I fucked your mama

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:26.200
and she turned to wood. I shaped her into a tree and her leaves touch the sky. And then

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:36.520
I fucked her eye and she went blind. And when she couldn't see, I told her about color.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:43.680
And what I told her, made her think twice. No more race. I fucked your mama and fixed

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:52.720
her brain. I fucked your mama in the rain. I fucked your mama down the street. I fucked

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.560
your mama with my podcast meet. And every town that I go to now, I'm gonna tell them

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:06.680
about your mama and fuck her like cows. It's not a reflection of who you are. You should

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:16.440
all get a brand new car. You get a car. You get a car. You also get a car. Everybody that

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.840
looks under their seat and finds gum gets a car. Just don't ask us about it. Ask the

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:27.680
manager of the club and we'll be gone. We'll be on the front lawn. We'll be going. Tell

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.320
them to break it down. If you've bought stuff, I'll sign it over there. That's the way you

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:39.640
go. Don't go down those stairs because that's the next audience for the next show. They'll

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:45.640
beat you up. I think we already know that my audience is nerds and everyone out there

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:53.800
is stronger and better and has more money for these booths in the front. And April, you're

01:06:53.800 --> 01:07:03.600
a country. I just wanted to put in the British sense and the British sense. They use that

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:10.640
word. Okay. Yo. Hey everybody. Thank you for coming to Harmontown. You have all been

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.840
great mostly. It's been awesome. You guys are wonderful. Please say hi after the show.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:22.440
Yeah. Yeah. Fuck your mama and I'll see you later. Fuck your mama like an alligator.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:29.320
Go out the back and tip your waitstaff. Fuck your mama so hard. She was a giraffe. I made

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:36.640
her neck so long. She couldn't handle it. Fuck your mama like a candle. Got lit. Lit in

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.960
the back saying get off the stage. You're giving us a heart attack. We've got to clean

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:47.800
off the tables. Got to get the shit out. Got to go. Got to fuck your mouth. Here for

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:59.680
you. Hi everybody. Ryan for doing his turn. Tim. Tim. Yeah. Tim. Everybody. Tim. Yeah.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:08.840
Come on down to Harmontown. Ian for quitting smoking. Libby and Darren. He's yellow. Come

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:15.080
on down to Harmontown. Yo. You got to settle your bills. You got to eat all your hot wings.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:20.800
I hope you got your fill. I thank Erin McGathy and Spencer the DM. I fucked your mama so

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:26.800
hard. She stopped peeing. I gave her a UTI. Jammed her up. Fucked your mama so hard.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.120
She turned into a Labrador pup. Changed her. Changed her fur. Changed her face. Changed

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:38.320
her species. Changed her race. See you in back. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:45.320
for coming. God bless you. Thank you for the name of the club.
