of a wild card and I'm like I can't plug my phone in I'm like is it upside down

02:21.200 --> 02:26.440
what's happening yeah I only have two things I'm excited about the pretzel

02:26.440 --> 02:33.520
bacon king and the new phenomenon that is with the pretzel bacon king I what

02:33.520 --> 02:37.640
whatever you get the idea there is a it's it's a goddamn Burger King burger

02:37.640 --> 02:44.160
looks like on the pretzel bun I'm just I I want to rob a bank I don't have to but

02:44.160 --> 02:48.440
I don't eat fast food but that thing looks really good damn it pretzel bun like

02:48.440 --> 02:53.280
first of all big pretzel bun guy is there anybody who's like like anti

02:53.280 --> 02:56.840
pretzel bun like if you're on a plane and they come by with the basket they're

02:56.840 --> 02:59.240
like what kind of bun do you want and there's a pretzel bun in there is

02:59.240 --> 03:14.480
anybody like first of all fuck that shit I'm a I have a gluten allergy but so I

03:14.480 --> 03:19.360
can't eat pretzel bread but I or any bread do you actually have a gluten

03:19.360 --> 03:26.600
allergy yeah I'm celiac oh shit when did that happen like apparently like when

03:26.600 --> 03:32.840
I was born again I don't know how's that working out for me not good I hate it

03:32.840 --> 03:40.800
because apparently I love his own Tyler Jordan dialogue I can't put pretzel

03:40.800 --> 03:47.200
breads the shit yeah it's great so but I'm saying for the first time in my life

03:47.200 --> 03:52.400
I'm jealous of you can I put my phone here yeah you could sit here if you want

03:52.400 --> 04:01.160
no I just want you didn't invite me out I was saving you like a piece of shit I

04:01.160 --> 04:05.640
was saving you we got I told the audience we got too much show we got Robbie

04:05.640 --> 04:11.400
Robbie how you doing Robbie you have a mic you know there's mics everywhere yeah

04:11.400 --> 04:14.240
I'm doing good things all right good to see you all right we're all checked in the

04:14.240 --> 04:17.320
only other thing I'm excited about is just the growing phenomenon of the

04:17.320 --> 04:24.920
people tweeting videos of guys sleeping in their Tesla's on the freeway what

04:24.920 --> 04:28.960
everybody keeps driving by these guys are just like not it off behind their

04:28.960 --> 04:32.040
wheel of their Tesla and what I love about it is like though it's like well

04:32.040 --> 04:35.600
that's amazing like I don't blame those people for taking the video I don't blame

04:35.600 --> 04:39.120
them for posting it they're like here's something you don't see every day sign of

04:39.120 --> 04:43.680
the times this is fucking dude it's just a sleep in his car on the freeway what I

04:43.680 --> 04:49.000
find amazing is like you go down the rabbit hole of the the response that it

04:49.000 --> 04:53.320
evokes and it's hilarious to me that's like you have to have a war over whether

04:53.320 --> 04:59.480
this sleepy Tesla guy is a sign of it's everything is zero some like so the

04:59.480 --> 05:04.480
first people to be like oh real great yeah just what we need like more fucking

05:04.480 --> 05:10.960
bullshit on the freeway and then other people be like oh no looks like a pretty

05:10.960 --> 05:22.800
good fucking beta test to me think the car might stop maybe wake him up what

05:22.800 --> 05:28.240
what the fuck did you do today and people just go to war they're going to war

05:28.240 --> 05:32.240
over a fucking blender like this is like like like you can't find middle ground

05:32.240 --> 05:37.760
here the March of Time ain't gonna stop cars gonna drive cars gonna drive the

05:37.760 --> 05:43.200
guy shouldn't be asleep the guy should not be asleep behind the wheel I'm gonna

05:43.200 --> 05:48.640
tell you as a Tesla owner I have spent what the amount of time I am willing to

05:48.640 --> 05:55.680
be behind the wheel with my eyes closed has spiked dramatically the reason is

05:55.680 --> 06:00.680
because formerly when you're knowing that you're in a car that will

06:00.680 --> 06:07.320
absolutely stop sooner than your foot would stop if anything in front of it

06:07.320 --> 06:10.680
Jesus fucking Christ

06:14.120 --> 06:21.800
yes guys please welcome our guest for tonight well Robbie folks is here he's

gonna he's also our guest for tonight do you want to

06:27.800 --> 06:33.200
should he play because well I don't know I think well yeah I don't put Robbie

06:33.200 --> 06:36.280
on the spot but what instead of me playing one of my stupid little like

06:36.280 --> 06:41.600
like clips of music do you want to play our guest on Robbie like kind of like

06:41.600 --> 06:47.280

07:02.600 --> 07:12.800
the only show that's better than anything I've ever done he's both a

07:12.800 --> 07:21.680
mentor and a friend and a enemy whoa I just threw that in because it seems more

07:21.680 --> 07:30.360
Spanish please welcome Mitch Hurwitz

07:37.360 --> 07:44.160
hello Mitch sorry I was back there waiting for Rob's introduction so yeah

07:44.160 --> 07:48.640
yeah like that ever gonna happen yeah what a bummer it is that he got short

07:48.640 --> 07:54.960
shrift huh no I'm just really sad when Rob doesn't get what's due him on this

07:54.960 --> 08:02.720
show thanks for coming Emmy winner Mitch please come on did I wreck it no

08:02.720 --> 08:15.560
no no did you get the bread basket that we sent over the I was listening no

08:15.560 --> 08:20.280
fair listening here's what's wrong with the pretzel bread can I controversial

08:20.280 --> 08:24.840
and you know it's a difficult time now to go out on a limb like this but it can

08:24.840 --> 08:30.560
be dry right you can you can have a pretzel like a bun on a burger and it

08:30.560 --> 08:39.160
can be too dry okay wow shots fired all right I've never experienced a pretzel

08:39.160 --> 08:44.240
bun too dry they're normally buttery and soft well I don't know you know maybe

08:44.240 --> 08:48.040
I'm on the private flights and they don't give you the good ones or something I

08:48.040 --> 08:54.400
don't oh shit see why is your arrest of development private airline giving you

08:54.400 --> 08:59.440
dry pretzel well it was a bad investment no no it was a it was a fucked up and I

08:59.440 --> 09:05.520
kind of thought the show's gonna go forever and you know it's like I'm

09:05.520 --> 09:09.000
starting a streaming network and now it's like another bad investment it's like

09:09.000 --> 09:13.520
of all times you started working at Netflix all this time and then you went

09:13.520 --> 09:17.280
and started I want to start with because they've had such great luck with it right

09:17.280 --> 09:22.760
thought you know and then and I thought you know what's not out there and I

09:22.760 --> 09:27.200
thought well like add well there's too much content right so this is there's

09:27.200 --> 09:33.840
not a lot of content now and it's got two tiers oh yeah it's good like

09:33.840 --> 09:39.320
advertising is four dollars a month okay and then like more advertising is like

09:39.320 --> 09:44.680
six dollars a month that sounds like our our business model yeah yeah it's good

09:44.680 --> 09:48.560
which is why we're ending the show soon yeah because it's it's not it doesn't

09:48.560 --> 09:52.200
make any sense yeah we'd love to have you do nothing on it at some point it was

09:52.200 --> 09:57.440
we're not into content that's not our thing what if you generated over at

09:57.440 --> 10:01.320
Netflix did they give you like an overall deal I was real jealous I did I did have

10:01.320 --> 10:07.360
an overall deal and there wasn't much to be jealous about I mean there was it was

10:07.360 --> 10:11.960
nice to be able to use the pool whenever I wanted the Netflix pool the shape

10:11.960 --> 10:17.320
just seems to not like I get it it has to be an end but yeah like that doesn't

10:17.320 --> 10:22.360
help with swimming like yeah yeah no it's great they do a lot of things this

10:22.360 --> 10:26.880
spa is great and their restaurants obviously are worth it but I did a

10:26.880 --> 10:30.440
couple things over there and then I spent a lot of time bringing back a rest of

10:30.440 --> 10:36.960
development and and then ruin that decision but I won't why did you read

10:36.960 --> 10:41.480
that decision no I did he won't get into it I won't get into it he won't get

10:41.480 --> 10:45.600
into it in this story no but he's listening to this just tell us why you

10:45.600 --> 10:49.960

really post-op scat that's a great name for a scat singer woke scat I got no

12:44.880 --> 12:51.360
right to make a sound that isn't very restrained and coming through a sphincter

12:51.360 --> 12:57.360
of privilege to pretend let's enjoy white privilege while we have it I know

12:57.360 --> 13:00.480
like oh that's the thing I don't understand why white people get so

13:00.480 --> 13:05.440
excited about it we haven't been enjoying our privilege enough we've been

13:05.440 --> 13:08.960
privileged we just haven't enjoyed it the white privilege here's the thing that

13:08.960 --> 13:13.680
white people don't understand when they're when you're told that you have

13:13.680 --> 13:19.440
privilege you're socialized to understand that precedes shit getting

13:19.440 --> 13:23.840
taken from you right yeah society doesn't work by those rules like people can

13:23.840 --> 13:28.720
just say hey you've got privilege and you can be like thanks and you don't have

13:28.720 --> 13:34.680
to do shit you don't even have to thank them I was I was driving next to a cop

13:34.680 --> 13:40.360
over here for a while and I noticed that well first I noticed I was trying to be

13:40.360 --> 13:44.280
a very good citizen you know that thing where the cops is next to you and you're

13:44.280 --> 13:49.080
just trying to show that you're here no I would let this guy go yeah I'm not like

13:49.080 --> 13:52.880
why there's no you know you can be a nice shoplifting and then I really did

13:52.880 --> 13:56.760
think like like no fuck it you know this is a good opportunity for white

13:56.760 --> 14:00.640
privilege like let me be a little bit of an asshole and see what happens and you

14:00.640 --> 14:04.920
know so I pretended I was on the phone just saying like are you fucking kidding

14:04.920 --> 14:14.600
me look over the cop that part's not true but I really did but I really did

14:14.600 --> 14:19.720
notice like why am I my best behavior here yeah everything you're reading is

14:19.720 --> 14:26.880
the yeah I once told the cop to go fuck himself and I like that's if that's not

14:26.880 --> 14:34.360
white privilege then nothing is yeah yeah I one time picked up I was walking my

14:34.360 --> 14:40.040
dog and in our neighborhood the police have okay alright excuse me that's how

14:40.040 --> 14:46.760
it works this is the aftershocks this is the aftershocks no the guy got a nickel

14:46.760 --> 14:50.120
put in one so he's gonna keep doing that until he pukes and falls over and then

14:50.120 --> 14:54.840
it's like no no no go on go on go on if you can find it within you just please

14:54.840 --> 14:59.440
shut up it no matter how much that attempts you to keep talking like you

14:59.440 --> 15:03.240
got it is you're in a different zone than the rest of us there's like a bunch

15:03.240 --> 15:07.560
of people that paid money to be at the show this isn't Andrew Yang rally where

15:07.560 --> 15:16.080
everybody just screams their heads off it's the wrong take care of it go go on

15:16.080 --> 15:22.760
Rob I told a rando with with nothing to contribute that he shouldn't talk so

15:22.760 --> 15:29.680
now makes make this count so I'm walking my dog I'm walking my dog in our

15:29.680 --> 15:34.640
neighborhood the police have been killing civilians okay right and so I'm

15:34.640 --> 15:39.280
walking the dog I'm walking the dog and you know it's like sometimes when they

15:39.280 --> 15:43.880
they bring out like the the garbage you know it's sitting there and you're

15:43.880 --> 15:47.400
walking the dog you get the bag of shit you're like oh bonus I don't have to sure

15:47.400 --> 15:51.040
I don't have to turn the corner I can just put it right there you know and I'm

15:51.040 --> 15:55.320
walking I'm walking I'm walking and I miss it and then I go oh I should turn

15:55.320 --> 16:00.480
around and throw the dog shit away and as I was turning around and putting my

16:00.480 --> 16:07.120
arm up a police car with the window open go by at the same time so it looked

16:07.120 --> 16:12.400
like and forgive me for the people who don't have the visual of this so it looks

16:12.400 --> 16:19.680
like me like going like if you're the cop I'm like oh my god so it just because

16:19.680 --> 16:24.120
it just I was walking this way and then I do a sharp turn with my hand up with a

16:24.120 --> 16:27.400
bag and you know in our neighborhood somebody had a towel in his hand and

16:27.400 --> 16:31.520
got his face blowing off yeah you gotta turn that into like a blue lives matter

16:31.520 --> 16:40.320
yes and the cop and the cop like went like this oh my god I could have been

16:40.320 --> 16:43.280
killed right you could have been killed I that's basically what happened to that

16:43.280 --> 16:49.520
guy right totally the same thing damn it sir it's like front row raise your hand

16:49.520 --> 16:54.760
who's the guy he can't okay he raises his hand yeah but leg is gonna go up but

16:54.760 --> 16:59.560
stop it I'll come over there and come for you I don't think it's gonna go up

16:59.560 --> 17:04.960
no I know I look I know you guys don't get along but I don't think that his

17:04.960 --> 17:08.600
brain controls his arm and his leg at the same time well I'm just thinking like

17:08.600 --> 17:11.640
what it's like it's like the three stooges when they're plumbers you know

17:11.640 --> 17:16.000
like if you flush the toilet the shower goes I'm just isn't that why if you were

17:16.000 --> 17:20.080
in an audience and you're not supposed to talk you'd be like I'm talking I mean

17:20.080 --> 17:24.000
it's possible it's that thing that people like now that our show is dying

17:24.000 --> 17:27.600
and we're gonna be done soon I think people just want to be Adam Goldberg

17:27.600 --> 17:33.040
for like like at the buzzer what if I can be like the like the last person

17:33.040 --> 17:37.680
that the whole crowd hated and and we all learn that person's name I don't think

17:37.680 --> 17:42.440
that wasn't the case it's certainly going to be the case now yeah I don't

17:42.440 --> 17:45.760
think that guy fits in that category no I think he's not he's not going actually

17:45.760 --> 17:51.280
I work in data processing he's going like volume up change the channel

17:51.280 --> 17:57.000
discovery like he's not here right now he belongs home and he's here he's got a

17:57.000 --> 18:00.920
backpack full of explosives we're all gonna die well I think we're this we're

18:00.920 --> 18:05.120
not all gonna die most of us are gonna die that's really smart otherwise that's

18:05.120 --> 18:08.160
against the law right you can't you can't say we're all gonna die yeah you

18:08.160 --> 18:12.680
know legally I can only say that some of us yeah you can say you can say there's

18:12.680 --> 18:15.920
a small fire and you know then people some people would leave but you can't

18:15.920 --> 18:24.680
say there's a that's what's gonna happen every four minutes it's gonna get like

18:24.680 --> 18:30.040
oh it's like great all right why are you on his side here's a thing here's a

27:41.400 --> 27:44.120
about I heard you have a new track for us that it's kind of like more of a

27:44.120 --> 27:48.200
country tip yeah kind of a bluegrass yeah kind of if you don't think that's a

27:48.200 --> 27:52.640
double beat yeah but this is more of a bluegrass thing which is people don't

27:52.640 --> 27:58.280
think that's your wheelhouse but but sure yeah what's this one called the road

27:58.280 --> 28:13.640
to tea well I've been personal all my life and I've been eating peas with a

28:13.640 --> 28:22.480
knife I've had spoons and forks in my jeans but I don't know if you know what

28:22.480 --> 28:35.920
I mean it ain't personal it's business it ain't through what it seems it ain't

28:35.920 --> 28:47.320
personal it's business down from a shoes up into the crap in my inseam

28:47.320 --> 28:55.920
wow mr. T that's very good mr. T like I'm not like I don't know about measures

28:55.920 --> 29:00.600
and kind of it sounds like a man kind of waiting for you to fight hang it yeah

29:00.600 --> 29:06.880
I appreciate that thank you Robbie for trying to wait for me and figure it out

29:06.880 --> 29:13.840
but your big mistake was I ain't gonna figure it out I'm a wanderer you know

29:13.840 --> 29:20.080
I'm just like looking at your fingers being like damn let's do this all right

29:20.080 --> 29:26.240
come on all right that's enough look it's an elevator coming down I buy iced tea

29:27.120 --> 29:33.400
you were great you started to cross a threshold bye it was good you know he

29:33.400 --> 29:37.520
just kind of like Irish exited he just yeah yeah but it was great to have iced

29:37.520 --> 29:41.160
tea on the show now it's great it's always great I think he knew more about

29:41.160 --> 29:45.080
measurement than he was leading on you know because I think like inseam that

29:45.080 --> 29:51.560
matters that's that's everything in a in a man's pant yeah you know in the

29:51.560 --> 29:55.440
movies there was like the inseam is like an illusion to like your dick being big

29:55.440 --> 30:00.640
is that a real thing like what is the issue up the tape measure goes from

30:00.640 --> 30:05.880
your like your ankle up to your crotch and your dick size doesn't change your

30:05.880 --> 30:11.600
inseam right no no it shouldn't right it shouldn't yeah has yours changed recently

30:11.600 --> 30:16.720
no okay then you're fine I say in the movies they're always like oh the

30:16.720 --> 30:20.040
inseam because like there's a kind of swollen crotch which is not a good

30:20.040 --> 30:24.520
thing and it you want to be sure you don't have that right yeah you'll need

30:24.520 --> 30:29.480
some of that powder in movies it's always like the you know these horny

30:29.480 --> 30:38.840
Italian tailors yeah check it out your shit yeah take out your your your crotch

30:41.640 --> 30:45.120
you should do a show called checking out your crotch and it but it'd be like

30:45.120 --> 30:50.880
Schitt's Creek and like crotch would be the name of the town because that's very

30:50.880 --> 30:56.600
popular now do you still want to do stuff Mitch sure yeah I do I don't do

30:56.600 --> 31:01.160
really yeah I'll do some of your stuff oh go ahead yeah do you want you what you

31:01.160 --> 31:05.240
want some of my ideas do you have any like Schitt's Creek type things I have

31:05.240 --> 31:09.140
like what do I have like what I was gonna do a show called mother fuckers

31:09.140 --> 31:14.560
which is this woman who they called mother and her last name is fuckers oh and

31:14.560 --> 31:18.400
so she's the mother fuckers oh that's cool and that way you can say it on TV and

31:18.400 --> 31:23.720
stuff you know I have like five ideas that are Groundhog Day meets something

31:23.720 --> 31:30.560
yeah I know I'm is that okay I'm doing I'm doing Russian doll meets Groundhog Day

31:30.560 --> 31:38.240
so I don't know maybe it's too close I said have you did you watch anything I

31:38.240 --> 31:41.040
hate it when people ask me this but only because the answer is kind of always

31:41.040 --> 31:45.040
embarrassingly no but I have been watching successionly oh my god do you

31:45.040 --> 31:48.200
like succession yeah and you know why is succession is brilliant I mean if you

31:48.200 --> 31:52.800
haven't discovered succession yet you haven't and I went into it a little bit

31:52.800 --> 31:57.760
like defensive very because it was I've been told you know it's kind of like the

31:57.760 --> 32:01.080
characters there's even like a Tobias there's like for kids and all this stuff

32:01.080 --> 32:07.720
and so I kind of it is very blue thing yeah but it's so much funnier than

32:07.720 --> 32:11.360
arrested development I mean it really is like it won on every point and now I'm

32:11.360 --> 32:14.960
just a fan I'm a complete there's no competition obviously yeah but I can see

32:14.960 --> 32:18.480
how people would be like tweeting you and going like who I looked at bitter when

32:18.480 --> 32:24.080
it was you know like I get that but no it's inspired and and I even like the

32:24.080 --> 32:27.040
thing at the end where the author you know I haven't done one of those shows

32:27.040 --> 32:31.680
where at the end you get to talk about the scenes you know like at the end of

32:31.680 --> 32:34.960
like Game of Thrones I don't I never it's like you get it absorbed in the

32:34.960 --> 32:38.440
story and then someone says you know when we wrote that scene with the dragon

32:38.440 --> 32:44.400
you're like ah fuck none of it happened yeah I don't watch those I can't

32:44.400 --> 32:47.640
mention people watching those yeah no it's it kind of takes the fun out of

32:47.640 --> 32:50.480
me yeah because it's like oh there's Arya Stark but she's like drinking a diet

32:50.480 --> 32:54.840
coke and she's like oh yeah she didn't want to do that scene she don't she

32:54.840 --> 32:58.400
don't want to kiss him she's like here's the three takes where I like jumped in

32:58.400 --> 33:01.800
the air with the knife but then I landed on a cat like like like what this is

33:01.800 --> 33:05.840
awful why are you doing this to me I thought you were real it's like the

33:05.840 --> 33:09.000
network you say well we're all adults right I mean we all know this is

33:09.000 --> 33:19.560
bullshit you know the real heroes are the fucking ugly people that had to

33:19.560 --> 33:24.600
write this shit that's a game of Thrones you want to meet a fucking dragon

33:24.600 --> 33:30.720
meet Benjamin the writers PA he's a fucking Harry character I just want to

33:30.720 --> 33:34.520
do one of those and I want to like really seriously talk about the show it's

33:34.520 --> 33:38.680
just like the most ridiculous show and then just say well that's it's really

33:38.680 --> 33:46.000
about loss we were getting at we wanted to do we wanted to explore loss and

33:46.000 --> 33:52.800
that's why we had his penis showing when he bent over like that the performance

33:52.800 --> 33:57.640
is the casting and succession are great I got it really is like I Cody was

33:57.640 --> 34:02.160
watching it just for for her own purposes and so that's that's the only

34:02.160 --> 34:06.240
way I'm ever gonna get like hooked into a show because I'm so lazy and I still

34:06.240 --> 34:09.040
have talked endlessly about like I don't know what it is that keeps me away

34:09.040 --> 34:14.560
from watching shit but it's like Cody's got the laptop open it starts with me

34:14.560 --> 34:20.040
hearing dialogue and I'm so jaded I'm like was that supposed to be funny I

34:20.040 --> 34:25.480
don't know what is it a dramedy or a tragic comma do do but do but do like

34:25.480 --> 34:30.280
whatever whatever pick a lane I just sort of like I just I just have this

34:30.280 --> 34:35.880
jaded like membrane and then gradually things will land and I'll be like well

34:35.880 --> 34:40.400
what's going on over there like is that a musical montage with those housewives

34:40.400 --> 34:45.000
and why why won't he show up on time to the party and then you just get drawn

34:45.000 --> 34:50.640
in and Cody made fun of me because I was like I was like this shows boring at

34:50.640 --> 34:53.440
one point I almost don't want to say that out loud because it makes me sound like

34:53.440 --> 34:57.160
such a fucking douche but I was like but it is that's how good the show is is

34:57.160 --> 35:01.000
because it was probably like a couple hours later when I'm like I got work to

35:01.000 --> 35:05.240
do and I was like come on what's the next episode she's like oh the boring show

35:05.240 --> 35:10.600
and I'm like all right you got yeah fucking like it's riveting I I don't

35:10.600 --> 35:15.840
know yeah it's it that that's riveting it doesn't go where you expect it to go

35:15.840 --> 35:20.800
the characters are more nuanced it's just predictable enough yep to actually be

35:20.800 --> 35:25.720
that's what I really like about it is that it doesn't try to purposely it

35:25.720 --> 35:30.520
doesn't engage in like a hot rod unpredictability it actually gives you

35:30.520 --> 35:34.520
perfect but this guy's a junkie he's gonna do it fucking junkies do and you

35:34.520 --> 35:38.080
know how that's gonna end up the way you think it is and but it's like the

35:38.080 --> 35:43.200
details are lateral enough that there's a confidence in the well and it's they

35:43.200 --> 35:47.680
there is that thing that we don't often get to do in comedy where you leave some

35:47.680 --> 35:51.520
things unexplained you know we in comedy it's all about you explain everything

35:51.520 --> 35:58.160
you want everybody to get every joke and and that oh wait yeah he's just I feel

35:58.160 --> 36:03.520
like Rob left he's getting to that age there's like he has to he has to go

36:03.520 --> 36:09.640
every I think that's why it's wise that you didn't introduce him because because

36:09.640 --> 36:19.160
what for yeah but anyway yeah they get to you get to like look into the

36:19.160 --> 36:24.080
characters eyes you know is she upset what she is she relieved is I mean it

36:24.080 --> 36:28.400
really is it's spectacular yes good you kind of love I felt the way about

36:28.400 --> 36:31.640
Game of Thrones too it's I like I like good dramas that were like serialized

36:31.640 --> 36:35.360
because you like you you get to pick a character you go like that person's the

36:35.360 --> 36:39.200
best all these other people annoy me and then you're like okay well that person I

36:39.200 --> 36:42.680
also understand and it kind of settles in like Velcro and you're like like

36:42.680 --> 36:46.040
slowly they're just like I love all these fucking assholes and like you kind of

36:46.040 --> 36:49.600
like you're watching a soap opera it's great I wanted to do a show I did a show

36:49.600 --> 36:53.240
actually did four episodes of a show called everything's relative and the

36:53.240 --> 36:58.520
conceit which NBC didn't quite let me do was gonna be that every episode another

36:58.520 --> 37:02.440
character basically thinks the shows about them you know like they're the

37:02.440 --> 37:06.440
normal person like the Michael Bluth basically so that you know it started

37:06.440 --> 37:10.040
off with like the the white kid it was 35 but then the next episode was like the

37:10.040 --> 37:14.520
mom is just all the mom's point of view and and they kind of do that in a way we

37:14.520 --> 37:17.160
never got to do the project we were gonna do together which I think we could

37:17.160 --> 37:21.000
just open source now because I'm retired no no let's do it all right I have a

37:21.000 --> 37:25.840
way to do it but not at Netflix no back in there no I think we should do it on

37:25.840 --> 37:30.640
my streaming was it called my streaming platform could could frankly stand a

37:30.640 --> 37:33.520
little content you don't have a streaming platform do you ever start a

37:33.520 --> 37:38.440
streaming but I'm starting a streaming platform I'm gonna it's got two tears I

37:38.440 --> 37:41.560
feel like I mentioned this but the cool thing is it's just your last name so you

37:41.560 --> 37:45.400
don't need to make up a Silicon Valley no it's not it's not it's not it's not

37:45.400 --> 37:52.440
it's called netmitch no it's it's it's media master plus

37:52.440 --> 37:57.840
well that's not what you think that's refreshingly Brian Heimer and if we're

37:57.840 --> 38:02.760
not like violating some sort of like please no this all this all publicity

38:02.760 --> 38:06.960
for what I need as many name what's the name of your show and what's the premise

38:06.960 --> 38:10.560
like you give me the elevator pitch it's not a show it's a platform okay that's

38:10.560 --> 38:15.440
already your way off all right all right I thought you guys had a media master

38:15.440 --> 38:24.400
plus that oh that show yeah that show media master plus the show is a platform

38:24.760 --> 38:30.220
that's I'm doing two tears you got to get that in there what what's two two

38:30.220 --> 38:37.960
two two tears of power power power it's getting a little into content which

38:37.960 --> 38:42.680
we're trying to avoid but I okay is there any content or is it just you

38:42.680 --> 38:48.320
talking about the platform it's well one of the things I wanted to do is I

38:48.320 --> 38:53.320
want to harness people's webcams and then they're basically it's almost like a

38:53.320 --> 38:58.360
mirror there's a show that's the show like you you see your own life right you

38:58.360 --> 39:05.680
don't but it's not flipped like a mirror and that's the key difference it's how

39:05.680 --> 39:12.440
when they're at their ads two difference here the second here is that you get to

39:12.440 --> 39:17.320
watch yourself and there's yeah yeah it's it's like you're gonna love it and

39:17.320 --> 39:22.400
and you're the first streaming platform is not content based no content no

39:22.400 --> 39:28.360
content no I think people are burnt out on content it's time that you that

39:28.360 --> 39:33.760
yours your own self is enough well I think it is although we are in a deal

39:33.760 --> 39:37.000
with Schitt's Creek oh we'll be honest we're trying to we're trying to go

39:37.000 --> 39:41.360
downstream of that a little bit and then we have something called head up your

39:41.360 --> 39:47.000
asses right the your ass family oh the your ass family you can say it you can

39:47.000 --> 39:51.880
say it on TV because it's their name that's crazy those honestly when I was

39:51.880 --> 39:55.760
watching the Emmys they're like Schitt's Creek like oh my god

39:55.760 --> 40:00.200
Schitt's Creek on the Emmys that's fantastic it is a hilarious show by the

40:00.200 --> 40:08.040
way I don't mean to be it says it's a dog it's it's wait what a well it's a

40:08.040 --> 40:17.360
dog it's a dog I'm gonna miss this show yeah no I'm not but our idea was it's

40:17.360 --> 40:22.160
multi-dimensional we were gonna do we're gonna team up we're still gonna do it I

40:22.160 --> 40:26.000
have a way to do it you sure you want to tell them but your way to do it is your

40:26.000 --> 40:29.840
joke no that's not a way that's not the way to do it it would not be good for

40:29.840 --> 40:36.560
media master plus right we wouldn't run it on that okay but I don't want to do

40:36.560 --> 40:41.440
it on Netflix cuz I want back I wouldn't be on it okay yeah I know back end what

40:41.440 --> 40:49.640
like CBS all-access nice NBC Perview this is CBS is all-access like there's no

40:49.640 --> 40:54.120
when they say no to there's not like some institutional racism or something

40:54.120 --> 40:58.160
where it's like no you're Korean you can't get this channel it's all-access yeah

40:58.160 --> 41:01.440
I think that yeah that I think that's not they're still they still hate Koreans

41:01.440 --> 41:05.920
on that video it's like yes but everyone's allowed to watch yeah that's

41:05.920 --> 41:12.120
great that's really so big of them yeah see CBS all-access CBS everybody can

41:12.120 --> 41:19.040
watch why that'll work that'll are you are you have a deal there are you are

41:19.040 --> 41:24.080
you exclusive there I'm working with your buddy Ron on a thing yeah on how access

41:24.080 --> 41:28.640
Ron Harry way it's very very nice you always have to go I'm working at CBS then

41:28.640 --> 41:34.360
you pause and you go all-access people are so relieved they're like oh my god

41:34.360 --> 41:38.880
finally bisexuals can watch CBS you know I mean it's not like you don't have to

41:38.880 --> 41:44.720
pass any fucking test like anybody's welcome I do I will say CBS being like

41:44.720 --> 41:50.320
you I think that they're playing at the smartest cuz I was part of CISO which

41:50.320 --> 41:55.960
was NBC's half-hearted attempt to like they're like oh we see where this is

41:55.960 --> 41:59.360
going the world's gonna be mini-netflixes and so they put a little bit of money

41:59.360 --> 42:04.640
into this thing CISO and we created Harmon quest for them and a lot of

42:04.640 --> 42:09.280
shows created for them under the you took all of CISO's money as I heard it

42:09.280 --> 42:17.200
that's that was the word that got we took all of it we rolled a 20 but I

42:17.200 --> 42:20.480
think CBS is being the smartest about it because they're basically like here's

42:20.480 --> 42:25.920
our platform on the web CBS all-access all-access is simultaneously like

42:25.920 --> 42:31.160
unignorable but it's also like just sort of like it's just it means nothing so

42:31.160 --> 42:34.640
they're there I there I think they sat there went like well what are we gonna

42:34.640 --> 42:38.200
do eventually the thing with the antennas no one's gonna watch it

42:38.200 --> 42:41.120
anywhere right they're like so we can't call this thing snap crackle dippled

42:41.120 --> 42:45.160
apple like we can't like go all in on that and have a compete with like the

42:45.160 --> 42:50.080
real thing it's like just call it CBS with a ramp because it's got CBS all

42:50.080 --> 42:56.480
aboard and then it's like everyone gets a board and it's like CBS psych burp

42:56.480 --> 43:01.720
welcome just kidding we're Netflix that's right it's like hey we don't want

43:01.720 --> 43:06.280
any trouble we were just CBS all-access yeah like there's nothing it's not

43:06.280 --> 43:11.080
CBS platinum plus shadow master but also in the CBS television they produce for

43:11.080 --> 43:15.520
everybody so you could go exactly you could go what is the Hurwitz Harmon project

43:15.520 --> 43:18.520
you guys talking about you guys it wouldn't be for you I don't think you

43:18.520 --> 43:22.360
would appreciate outside the demo you're outside the millennial thing it's like

43:22.360 --> 43:30.160
it's like give me the elevator pitch on your guys because it's all abbreviation

43:30.160 --> 43:33.400
it's all just initials do you guys already have a millennial you have an opening

43:33.400 --> 43:37.400
theme song we have a theme song why don't we just sing the theme song and I feel

43:37.400 --> 43:40.120
like it gives away too much I think you guys remember the Beverly

43:40.120 --> 43:43.440
Hillbillies like the whole conceit yeah but you're okay yeah I was like you would

43:43.440 --> 43:46.440
watch the main tunnel and you go like okay that's enough I've had enough story

43:46.440 --> 43:49.320
yeah yeah

43:53.040 --> 44:05.600
two garbage men found a genie who worked in sanitation as well as the

44:05.600 --> 44:16.320
garbage men but the garbage genie had thrown away half of its wishes but the

44:16.320 --> 44:23.000
two garbage men didn't care because they were happy delivering garbage so now

44:23.000 --> 44:36.800
the three of them are a family delivering wishes that other people throw away and

44:36.800 --> 44:49.120
the genie is dying a painful death that Western medicine can't treat yet so it's

44:49.120 --> 44:58.120
got some heart too but one of the garbage men is withholding his final wish

44:58.120 --> 45:10.360
which he could use to cure the genie but he wants to fuck her it's what that's

45:10.360 --> 45:22.760
why and that's why that's why delivering garbage and wishes misunderstanding

45:22.760 --> 45:32.320
the very concept of what garbage men do they don't live garbage hashtag rape

45:32.320 --> 45:43.040
culture that's not only Millennials only is the title yeah partial access it's on

45:43.040 --> 45:49.240
CBS partial access partial access CBS is racially motivated let a little known

45:49.240 --> 45:57.520
race partial access it's actually just for it's on CBS no audio and it's a lot

45:57.520 --> 46:00.960
of people got like oh is it right it's racially it's but it's like moon raker

46:00.960 --> 46:04.720
it's like the the the only people I can watch CBS partial access it's like it's

46:04.720 --> 46:08.920
selecting people from each racial group on earth their logo happens in moon

46:08.920 --> 46:14.120
raker I don't remember that from moon raker it's like a super colony of people

46:14.120 --> 46:18.880
you know they're like you want you want like there's like three people of every

46:18.880 --> 46:22.880
part of earth life that you're gonna they're gonna CBS is gonna start a

46:22.880 --> 46:28.120
super colony with you know we if we were a we're gonna be gene splicing at some

46:28.120 --> 46:32.400
point and we will be able to do that we will be able to decide what qualities

46:32.400 --> 46:37.680
we should have are and you can imagine how badly this will go well people will

46:37.680 --> 46:41.160
be able to say to parents because you know it's like the GI Bill and student

46:41.160 --> 46:43.640
loans and things it's gonna go in a direction where people go like so you

46:43.640 --> 46:48.040
want to have a kid which by the way shame on you like well we'll be we'll be

46:48.040 --> 46:52.760
trained to be like oh such a horrible person this time and day like I want to

46:52.760 --> 46:56.640
have a kid and it'll be like like yeah I want an SUV and the doctor I'll sit you

46:56.640 --> 47:00.760
down and go so here's the different packages this one yeah if you agree that

47:00.760 --> 47:06.800
your kid will be super into anime for seven years the Japanese government is

47:06.800 --> 47:13.840
willing to give you $10,000 for diapers which is a pretty pretty big carrot if

47:13.840 --> 47:17.520
your kid has an affinity for Apple products or is willing to work in the

47:17.520 --> 47:21.520
stock room like like for five years everything will be a broke their life

47:21.520 --> 47:28.640
will be broken yeah I think well I also think that if we'd gotten this a while

47:28.640 --> 47:32.640
ago like the mistakes we would have made we would have probably gotten rid of

47:32.640 --> 47:36.240
fear right I mean I think about like what people's biggest problems are usually

47:36.240 --> 47:41.240
fear-based so we would have gotten rid of that we'd all be dead yeah that's what

47:41.240 --> 47:46.240
you need right now more fearless people yeah we can do about that shame to let's

47:46.240 --> 47:50.680
dial that shame down a little bit I've encountered too many shameful people on

47:50.680 --> 47:56.160
the internet nowadays you know I post a picture of my fiance why is the 15 year

47:56.160 --> 48:02.000
old that leaves a comment have to be so shame driven come on kid don't be afraid

48:02.000 --> 48:05.400
to say whatever the fuck you want to an adult that could beat the piss out of

48:05.400 --> 48:11.600
you go ahead let it rip after all your username is a string of fucking dollar

48:11.600 --> 48:21.680

48:24.160 --> 48:32.160
Robbie and the Nazis oh look who's back Karen I'll go ahead and join us speaking

48:32.160 --> 48:38.240
of not fucking cold up here you know it's how freezing it is did you just take

48:38.240 --> 48:43.520
a bath what did you do what did you were you I took a pee and then I sat down we

48:43.520 --> 48:51.360
can do that we can just go we can just yeah the show's done nothing nothing

48:51.360 --> 48:55.360
matters anymore nothing matters Rob aren't you weren't you gonna do like kind

48:55.360 --> 49:03.280
of a soulful solo song about how nothing matters anymore sure he doesn't care

49:03.280 --> 49:14.120
it doesn't matter

49:14.120 --> 49:37.600
nothing matters when I go take a pee I don't even flush when I'm finished I let

49:37.600 --> 49:55.240
it mellow in smells like spinach cuz I ate some yesterday nothing matters

49:55.240 --> 50:09.480
nothing matters my pee smells like spinach you like it I don't hold my

50:09.480 --> 50:24.640
nose when I urinate yes that's where it pays off thank you that's that's what we've

50:24.640 --> 50:32.480
been waiting for yeah I came back on stage cuz I need some help and luckily

50:32.480 --> 50:39.560
that was completely off Mike and the paying customers won't hear it Robbie well

50:39.560 --> 50:45.040
we did a gig in New York together with with Dino and Stephen Colbert and Louis

50:45.040 --> 50:49.680
CK and Tina Fey and a bunch of people's and everybody was freaked out that you

50:49.680 --> 50:54.600
were there because I was even even more uncomfortable on that stage than I am on

50:54.600 --> 51:02.000
this one but Tina before the show she's like and I'd never met I met Tina once

51:02.000 --> 51:05.360
but I'd never met Stephen Colbert and they're like Robbie Fox is gonna be here

51:05.360 --> 51:09.160
and they were nervous about being on a stage with you like because they I don't

51:09.160 --> 51:12.120
think that's true what you're saying no it is true that good I mean it's true

51:12.120 --> 51:17.560
cuz I heard them say that and Tina said that she used to get guitar lessons from

51:17.560 --> 51:22.720
you back in the Chicago Second City days and they all took lessons from you

51:22.720 --> 51:26.800
because it was like getting a free Robbie Fox concert wow they didn't want

51:26.800 --> 51:35.440
to learn does that piss you off it was frustrating yes like I would have charged

51:35.440 --> 51:45.880
more wait Tina Tina sniffs out a deal she knows what you did a duet

51:45.880 --> 51:50.200
together was it like a Johnny and June song or gosh I'm trying to remember I

51:50.200 --> 51:55.000
think it might have been success by Loretta Lynn okay yeah that was it

51:55.000 --> 51:59.560
yeah and she can really sing yeah she's a good singer right yeah you guys were

51:59.560 --> 52:03.000
fantastic together but she told me before the show and I again I only met her

52:03.000 --> 52:06.160
briefly once that she's like I'm having a freaking freak out right now because I

52:06.160 --> 52:10.240
have to go up in stage and sing with with Robbie Fox you know I did a I don't

52:10.240 --> 52:14.120
know if this stories of interest or not she had a birthday party one time she

52:14.120 --> 52:17.840
was turning 40 and she asked me to or no she didn't her husband asked me to Jeff

52:17.840 --> 52:25.600
asked me to come play and it was a surprise for her and I and so so what's

52:25.600 --> 52:32.360
the story here well once one story is that I thought I didn't know what would

52:32.360 --> 52:37.200
be like right it's in a rock club and I didn't know would it be like her parents

52:37.200 --> 52:41.140
or would it be comedians or what would it be and it was basically just Rob

52:41.140 --> 52:47.040
Schneider sitting in a rocking right Rob Schneider was there and Melanie

52:47.040 --> 52:53.200
Hutzel they were all there that's a joke for three people but no it's like an

52:53.200 --> 52:58.960
office party basically a 30 rock office like the cast and the and the and the

52:58.960 --> 53:02.040
producers and stuff were there they were like 40 people there you know in a club

53:02.040 --> 53:07.520
that holds 600 people and they were milling around and Tina sat on a couch

53:07.520 --> 53:13.400
kind of in the middle and watched me play and everybody else ignored me I was

53:13.400 --> 53:17.120
with like a seven-piece band making a lot of noise and I prepared some special

53:17.120 --> 53:22.280
material and I think this is mildly interesting I've never told this story

53:22.280 --> 53:27.280
before but I thought I was preparing this stuff and I thought it was too a

53:27.280 --> 53:32.760
complimentary of Tina I wrote a song about Tina and about our old days in

53:32.760 --> 53:37.280
Chicago and this and that and was feeling really kind of corny and positive

53:37.280 --> 53:41.440
and I'm two minutes into this song I thought well I'll do a joke in here so

53:41.440 --> 53:49.960
the song was a Tina whoa whoa whoa Tina anyway I put in a line about Tina

53:49.960 --> 53:56.760
you're faultless in my book then I go date night I'll overlook like that date

53:56.760 --> 54:03.640
night was a terrible movie that she was in just to explain that and so I got to

54:03.640 --> 54:08.280
this joke and like the crowd was kind of like enjoying it up to that point like

54:08.280 --> 54:13.440
it was about Tina and it was positive and then it just turned the whole mood of

54:13.440 --> 54:22.440
the room really on because they probably all worked on the film yeah it was a

54:22.440 --> 54:29.000
total miscalculation it was a total miscalculation and I even I apologize to

54:29.000 --> 54:32.400
her afterwards because I thought I'd kind of ruined a moment and she said oh no

54:32.400 --> 54:37.560
that's she said I expected you to insult me because it's you she said they're

54:37.560 --> 54:44.120
just all scared of me she said she's kind of intense like I my brief

54:44.120 --> 54:48.560
encounters with her like she really is like like to meet her is to have been

54:48.560 --> 55:02.200
met pretty hard that's great but I she she's only she was your Jeff you you're

55:02.200 --> 55:06.440
funny motherfucker and then she just meant she turned around and walked away I

55:06.440 --> 55:10.200
thought that that would that was that's meeting Tina for me she just like she

55:10.200 --> 55:14.320
just nails you and the fucking bones out you didn't even get a chance to just

55:14.320 --> 55:17.440
kick her in the balls over the date night thing

55:17.440 --> 55:28.920
right after that sounds amazing I would think is it is it must be harder well

55:28.920 --> 55:32.600
maybe it's not but is it harder to play for a small audience than a large audience

55:32.600 --> 55:38.840
of one audience one too yeah it's kind of daunting I don't know what it's like

55:38.840 --> 55:46.400
to play for a large audience maybe I was in Chicago and I asked Dino like what's

55:46.400 --> 55:49.800
what's something cool doing something cool to do in Chicago and he goes you

55:49.800 --> 55:53.240
should go is it the hideout or the hideaway the hideout the hideout which is

55:53.240 --> 55:56.000
what's what part of town in Chicago is that it doesn't really have a name but

55:56.000 --> 55:59.600
it's on the near north side it's kind of buck town or no it doesn't even have a

55:59.600 --> 56:11.280
name okay it's just it's by a is it Jamestown free more guesses lo ho it was

56:11.280 --> 56:18.120
by a rubbish tip and some debris and that is correct yeah and I went in there

56:18.120 --> 56:22.120
and saw the show and I texted my brother Bill and I was like dude like you

56:22.120 --> 56:24.600
would fucking freak out right now there's this guy named Robbie Fox playing

56:24.600 --> 56:29.280
he's playing like bluegrass country folky stuff and I texted my brother and he

56:29.280 --> 56:34.840
texted back and he goes I have every one of his records and I put you I met you

56:34.840 --> 56:38.000
after the show I said I know Dino Stamatopolous my brother is on the phone

56:38.000 --> 56:41.720
right now and you got in the phone and you insulted me to my brother you said

56:41.720 --> 56:47.240
I like you more than your brother your brother's a piece of shit I said you were

56:47.240 --> 56:54.880
terrible and date night I remember you see you got one go-to the date night of

56:54.880 --> 57:00.720
M.C. he thinks everybody was on date night would you be honest with us if your

57:00.720 --> 57:05.880
name was fake because it seems like such a richly musician name Robbie folks like

57:05.880 --> 57:10.200
I would be like if somebody said hey the handyman's coming over to fix the sink

57:10.200 --> 57:13.280
his name is Robbie folks I'd be like well what the hell's he's fixing my sink

57:13.280 --> 57:19.200
for give that guy a guitar really I I've never encountered that point of view

57:19.200 --> 57:25.640
but well I wouldn't do you I guess if it's your real name is what you're

57:25.640 --> 57:29.120
telling me it's my real name yeah I wouldn't have chosen it to be a country

57:29.120 --> 57:35.760
singer I would I don't know what did your mom not like Robert so Rob's name is

57:35.760 --> 57:40.520
also Robbie that was my dad and yes you're right yeah is it Robbie on your

57:40.520 --> 57:43.800
birth certificate Robbie no it's Robert

57:43.800 --> 57:52.440
Robbie at his birth certificate how does that feel Robbie Schrab Robbie tell him

57:52.440 --> 57:57.600
why tell him why because my mom when she was pregnant there were a lot of

57:57.600 --> 58:05.240
restaurants being made and he thought because his mom's a Flintstone yeah this

58:05.240 --> 58:10.600
is back this is back in the was causing restaurant boom the outdoors were

58:10.600 --> 58:16.760
becoming in and she said she said you know well one day my son might grow up

58:16.760 --> 58:22.920
and and he'll own a restaurant not be a hunter-gatherer like we are yeah he can

58:22.920 --> 58:27.120
own a restaurant and he could call it Robbie's restaurant like I couldn't do

58:27.120 --> 58:31.600
that my name was Timothy right it'd be like if everyone was still foraging she

58:31.600 --> 58:36.360
would have named you Frank yeah nobody would eat at Roberts

58:36.360 --> 58:41.880
restaurant and no one knows Robert has ever gone by Robbie so it's really good

58:41.880 --> 58:47.880
thinking what when did you leave the south Robbie not you Robbie Robbie

58:47.880 --> 58:54.320
Robbie folks Roberts I left it when I was 17 Jeff yeah yeah and I do you have

58:54.320 --> 58:57.520
any connections back there still or is it oh yeah like high school friends that

58:57.520 --> 59:01.880
have grown old and hideous looking that's not a lot of people not family

59:01.880 --> 59:06.440
families are no more yeah nobody there my folks moved to Mexico and yeah

59:06.440 --> 59:10.040
everybody's gone I'm not pipping out to sing this but there's a song if you want

59:10.040 --> 59:12.640
to listen to it it's called that's where I'm from that I was one of my favorite

59:12.640 --> 59:16.920
songs by Robbie it's a it's a beautiful song about about like you're not

59:16.920 --> 59:21.520
country but you are country because you came from country yeah I mean my wife we

59:21.520 --> 59:25.000
moved to the suburbs and we got this house that we almost sort of couldn't

59:25.000 --> 59:29.040
afford and I thought as fancy neighborhood for people like us and then I

59:29.040 --> 59:33.120
found out that like all those people came from you know crib death Iowa or

59:33.120 --> 59:42.120
somewhere like that you know where the town is is crib death is that why because

59:42.120 --> 59:45.200
I thought this was so unusual I've heard that side why it has that bridge by

59:45.200 --> 59:50.560
Vincent Price yes that's just him where he talks about can we hear us about

59:50.560 --> 59:54.000
suddenly infant death syndrome play a couple verses and let's hear the

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
Vincent yeah yeah way gets to that because I forgot the Vincent Price doesn't

59:59.000 --> 01:00:10.360
doesn't doesn't kind of a you can't do Vincent you don't hear he's just playing

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:19.680
good well yeah but well he can do it surprise the tingler he's out there

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:30.200
tingling well I didn't mean to and I was just throwing in I was like oh and

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.280
isn't the bridge by Vincent Price which I guess is me saying like oh yeah play

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.800
that thing that's really valuable to you and mean something to you and I'll fuck

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.800
it up in the middle that's my with my famous Vincent Price impression

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.320
Millennials you're gonna sing it Robbie give it Dan given the boom mics we can

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.120

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.000
much of me on this show oh no how about a Vincent Price introduces you and then

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.640
you do the song that's how you do it and that's what he would do that's how you do

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:05.560
it that's like that's how we get this out commercial Vincent Price is hosting

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:26.520

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:32.200
spiders we did so much fucking coke that a thousand ghosts reaped my soul but

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:45.040
this next musician my heart's not in it his heart wasn't in it anyways the 13

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:52.840
ghosts of Scooby-Doo presents Robbie folks playing what's the name of the

01:02:52.840 --> 01:03:02.880
song again that's where I'm ghost oh sorry no that's where I'm from back in the

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:11.000
driveway the end of the work day and how fast that world disappears like a

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:21.560
ghost a fresh lawn a pine tree I don't know if I want to do this I don't I don't

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry start over if you want to do this what you do not

gonna keep doing I'm not gonna keep doing this is this is his favorite song

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:40.800
and you're taking a shit here a man climbs as high as he can but his heart

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:54.080
belongs where it began I can see in my mind's eye a shack on a hillside and a

01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:06.800
mean billy goat on a chain and dad do in battle with dirt hard as gravel and

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:19.040
summers the crops never came we'd shoot down a pheasant in flight and sing

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:30.040
songs about Jesus all night and that's where I'm from where time passes slower

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:40.840
that's where I'm from where it's just man no sir you can't tell I'm country just

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:55.880
you look closer it's deep in my blood two cars a pitted fence that's where I've

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:20.840
come dirt roads and double wise that's where I'm from

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:30.480
night school on a fast track and no calls to look back that place put a scar on

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:43.240
my soul and I swore my young ones would never know hunger now the good life is

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:57.200
all they know well I've watched them grow now I see one thing separates them

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:09.040
from me and that's where I'm from where time passes slower that's where I'm

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:20.520
where it's just man no sir you can't tell I'm country just you look closer it's

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:37.400
deep in my blood two cars a white collar neck tie that's where I've come half

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:47.800
naked in the moonshine yeah that's where I'm from

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:19.600
if you've ever heard Hank Williams sing brother you know the whole blessed thing

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:29.840
because that's where I'm from where time passes slower that's where I'm from

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:41.360
where it's just man no sir you can't tell I'm country just you look closer well

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:57.800
it's deep in my blood a long way down a hard road that's where I've come some

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:05.720
place I can't go home to that's where I'm from

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:41.000
thank you Ravi oh wait rich I want it makes I want to take guitar lessons from

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.280

01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.600
mom too and yeah just records after that you know I would say yeah who do you

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:08.760
listen to oh you know the people that I like when I was young you know I think

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.600
a lot of them really I still like them a lot of them is what I'm trying to say

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.760
and that's like Doc Watson and John Hartford and then later on when I broke

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.400
from my parents taste a little bit you know the Beatles and obvious stuff like

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:34.960
that I guess I don't I don't know that I know Doc Watson obviously yes what is

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:41.080
that where are you at now creatively and or an answer in any way you want like

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.440
in your in your life now like I don't know what your path has been from youth

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.440
to and how you've gauged that with like your relationship with other people

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.480
hearing your music and things like where are you where are we finding you

01:09:52.480 --> 01:10:02.400
right now are you are you pursuing your own bliss at the expense of pleasing

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.400
other people or is it the opposite are you like I don't know it's a bad

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.320
question I guess I'm just always curious with musicians like you're clearly a

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:17.040
very authentic like confident guy and I'm wondering like have you been on his

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.280
journey of like oh what's your what's your relationship with what you do are

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.240
you do you go home at night and like putter in a in a dark room and like

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.920
play things into a into a little hard drive and only listen to them yourself

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:38.160
and then cut your forearm a little bit or would you like another Grammy or or

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.120
are you like is there it's like a British guy that comes over and goes

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:47.360
how about me baby what are you doing baby we need another hit it's gotta have a hook

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.000
well it's got that I mean I love where you're from and all that business

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.240
Jesus Christ give him another fucking syringe from the fucking old-timey

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:05.080
country shit come on baby comfortably now get up we got a tour to do blimey

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:13.360
that's a great question dad see I'm not a bad interviewer people say you're a

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.840
bad interviewer but that was a perfect question I was like I'm like Charlie Rose

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.320
but well I was gonna say without the sexual harassment but I'm like Charlie

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:40.560
Rose yeah you're exactly Charlie Rose yes or no question you moved out to LA

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.480
with Donna your wife and because she's you know pursuing stuff out here too I'm

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.960
tagging along with her you know but you gig all the time you're on tour

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.760
constantly yeah I'm out a lot and yeah I haven't really like found a slot to fit

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:57.600
in here yet but we've only been here a few months so but what was the record

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.440
that was the Grammy nominee oh it's a upland stories it's about three years

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:07.680
old and the song and you also nominated for the for a track too right oh yeah the

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.440
track was called Alabama night yeah I was a win I didn't win okay I lost two

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:21.800
Grammys I've technically lost every Grammy you were up against them like so

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.840
like some cool stuff but like like just the fact that somebody found I'm a

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.040
pretty small I have a real small audience so it's just cool to be included in

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.440
that yeah yeah like I've seen you play like when you do when you come to LA

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.520
back when you saw in Chicago you play McCabe's which is like an awesome music

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:47.600
store in like Santa Monica Santa Monica and you're funnier than all the comics

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.680
that I know and the music and you also just pick like people that play I saw

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.000
you play the troubadour and it was a gig that you played the troubadour my

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.760
brother and I came but the headliner was some like like some young teeny

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.560
bopper band and I texted you afterwards and and I was like those people couldn't

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:11.200
follow you because like you and a bunch of kind of old dudes playing like

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:17.160
bluegrass right cooled it and you text me back follow that mother fuckers because

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.360
they couldn't fucking follow it because I you pick like like local musicians and

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.880
stuff and everybody just fucking after this so this ends in December this

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:31.080
podcast yeah so could we have a podcast where you just compliment me yes that's

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:38.200
what is it here's a more here's a more refined question I want to know everybody

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:44.320
you want to use the restroom curious about with musicians in general and I'm

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.560
sure all their answers are different but I'm just because at the end of the

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.600
pipeline we hear songs they're two minutes three minutes four minutes they

01:13:52.600 --> 01:14:02.880
have five minutes all right six minutes seven minutes eight minutes nine

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.960
minutes I'm curious about the process of like the relationship with like what

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.800
the end product is like does a musician or you yourself like what do you is it

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.600
like God ask a question ask him a question I think what I think what

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:25.800
is asking no I think what it I will say like my friend Jim Valio it says talent

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.680
is the thing you can't do and so like I'm speaking for Daniel but like for me

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.360
like I listen to that I just it boggles my mind I don't know how you could do it

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.400
and how you could write it that's why I wonder like how do you what how do you

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.840
define like when something becomes a song like do you do you do you go are

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.360
you like sitting in bed and you're watching Succession on HBO and then

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.120
you're like very good thing fuck I got a song in my I got to go down I only got

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.000
two hours left to finish this song just acting like if I stop asking the

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.840
question you're gonna have just a fountain question yeah I'm working on it

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:08.040
man here's my question I got a question for you because it's so your work has

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.880
got to be so self-motivated you know and like I sort of even chose in TV because

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:21.000
you have yeah wait it's that modern dance oh shit dance having a heart attack

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.400
what is he doing what is going on

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.920
he's having a stroke what the fucking no I think I know I think I know what Dan

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:45.400
is asking I can't believe but so I've chosen a field where there's always a

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.800
gun to my head seriously and do you just do you you don't have that answer the

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:55.160
question Robbie do you how often do you write songs how often do you write

01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:05.960
songs how often your race that's a song Robbie write a song Robbie write a

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:21.280
song okay that's you that's a Harmontown second yeah not often enough he did

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.080
leave his phone though yeah oh good there's a good chance Tina Fey's numbers a good

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.920
bit that he left he actually left but that's that's it's hard to question

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.920
somebody out of the room I mean I even for like wait did he really leave what's

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:43.120
good I hope no I'm kidding I would have want to be subjected to that yeah a

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:50.320
culture was created during the question of like Robbie come back it's hard to

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:58.680
explain to the listener what Dan did in that moment it was it was almost like it

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.280
was almost like a man dancing with a strobe light over it's I know we saw

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.800
moments of poses and emotions were definitely coming through it's very

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.120
emotional it's what the evil teacher does in fairly odd parents when he says

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:21.880
fairy god yeah I'd had some of that it has some of that I haven't seen that he

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:28.960
does these poses various ones all right so I think you should go ahead continue

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.840
the question I mean I because well why not why not finish the question well

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.120
now I'm just curious what difference this is what I want to know from musicians

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:45.920
all the time is like when like how does the like how does the brick that that is

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:50.480
a song like how does it get generated like what do you mean by the break like

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.920
when does he know he's done or when does he know he's onto something do they

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.400
generate music by the yard and then do they like cut here and there and go like

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:02.360
okay there's a song or do they like generate it in a pile or do they is it

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:08.800
like a baby like it's like three minutes of oh you know if I could if I can

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:16.680
answer for Robbie I think you're gonna have to no I think I do think there's

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.880
difference between playing music and writing music because it takes three

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.800
minutes to play three minutes of music right okay I follow you right where it's

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.120
what we do usually takes a lot longer right it's like improv you know like you

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.360
know how long it takes to make six minutes of improv six minutes right but

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.560
writing a song is a whole different thing I mean do you wait for inspiration

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:43.200
or do you use yeah exactly start ask him that if he comes I'm not like a great

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.040
question do you wait for inspiration or do you just approach it like okay I'm

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.720
gonna see what comes out of me yeah I know it's a great question God I wonder

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:59.360
why Rob why do you look so pissed what's that Rob looks very pissed no I'm just this fucking chair sucks

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:08.320
okay hurts if you sit here long enough right right sorry I'm sorry what there's

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:14.360
no back support there's no back support okay cool all right so if I don't so

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.600
like we will we'll we'll we're making a renewed vow to work on our joint project

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.120
yeah I think it's a great idea we'll go we'll I have an idea for it you have an

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:31.920
idea for it well I'm not an idea but I don't have an idea for it no I my ideas

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.720
is to make it a period piece which I'll talk to you about like 80s no like

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:46.360
menstruation like no no no no like like yeah like 80s or did you what was the

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.800
first show you worked on was your own show right yeah you didn't ever did

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.280
multi cam I never you worked on the golden girls that was here I did which I

01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.800
started binging and it's like it's such an amazing like it was a it was good

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.560
learning experience did we talk about when you were on the show we did we have

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:10.240
the conversation where it was like how how needless it was that Sophia was

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.200
originally portrayed as like having had a stroke and that's the justification for

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.400
why she was talking about that but that was the justification there was so much

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.760
energy put into like but your mom look she had a stroke it destroyed the part

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.280
of her brain that censors her speech so she's a really old lady that just says

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.800
whatever she wants as if that needed a medical justification the one character

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.280
you're explaining the personality as opposed to like and then be Arthur's

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:41.120
character well you know her singulum occipital lobes fire in conjunction with

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:46.000
her make a lesson she's an American tingling generating extra estrogen

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.560
or getting a tripping down early on an enormous rate yeah well hey what you

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.760
agree that it would be a bad idea every personality explained through

01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:01.400
chemistry every golden girl yeah yeah that was that was although I will say at

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:05.360
the time it was not a cool show to be it was great to be on that show it was

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.440
amazing learning experience and I guess I started at the end of season

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:15.280
four no end of season five and then I was on it through the end because in

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.680
binging it it seems like I felt like you could feel the show get worse no because

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:25.040
it kind of I mean it did you know what happens if you start using the tricks of

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.200
the trade well there was what I felt like I perceived was a really solid first

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.040
season that was undoubtedly probably a show that people probably didn't put a

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:37.160
lot behind well now and that Susan Harris created and she was and is a

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:43.160
genius and it was like it just ran Sam Harris efficient then you could sense

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.160
the beginning of the second season the second season premiere began with like

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.480
the fucking ferrets and the cages in the garage or whatever and it was it was as

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.480
if like the floodgates had opened like alright congratulations you got season

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:00.560
two now here's the thing we got so-and-so coming in he used to show run no

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.680
actually that was not the case I think it was at believe it or I was like it

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:07.640
premiered at number one it was just one of those weird things nobody had programmed

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.840
to older people and and nobody had programmed successfully on Saturday

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.200
night I guess since like Mary Teller Moore or something and it just it became

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.720
number one in the country it was a huge thing although it wasn't a hip show so I

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.280
I you know I didn't walk off of there with like a great like the guys who were

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.360
on Cheers and that kind of right but but it was it was incredible and even just

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:32.560
just being able to see you know these four amazing actresses naked was I know

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.680
that was back when you were allowed to this like oh my god you're expected to

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:44.560
yeah it was their duty it was a show of respect but what was the what was the

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.520
tone like on set it was in season four like was there they were I think you

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.560
make it to season four you're allowed for I think the actors are allowed to

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.840
actually all hate each other and but I don't think I mean I think Betty you know

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.680
played to the crowd and everything and and and B was you know they didn't get

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.360
along great they were opposite I always thought there were opposites in the sense

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.440
that B was kind of scary on the outside but so sweet on the inside and you know

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:14.800
Betty is so sweet on the outside and a little scary she she fucking put Chevy's

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.760
nuts in a vice when she was on community like I really it was I don't really have

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:24.000
like a wonderful anecdote about that but it was like it was more honestly it's

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.600
more credit to Chevy because I think Chevy like he was it was more about him

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:33.880
respecting her so much that it was very easy right to kind of wither him yeah

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.480
it was something like she just met him and she was like she said something like

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.520
I've heard about you and I but that's okay or something just some bit that was

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.360
sort of like and he was like what and everyone's like laughing at him and you

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.600
could see him be like goddamn yeah that sounds like her she's she was very

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.200
direct and yet you know because she's sort of fearless and she yeah that was

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.960
always at you know also be Arthur had to do all her scenes with Estelle Estelle

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.080
had memory problems which we later found out was was deeper than that and so be

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:08.400
would have to do her scenes 20 30 times so she was just in a bad mood yeah and

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.200
also there was well I'm not gonna tell that story because you make up a

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:22.000
different story yes okay no there that's I'll tell everybody off the air but

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.640
no it was I remember when I met Betty I said said though they want me to tell

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.760
you they're doing a they're doing a layout upstairs and she said oh yes

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.720
and someone took pictures and I just looked at her confused you know I mean

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.640
she's just she's saucy she was always big yeah there's a layout like you know

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.360
area I was fucking upstairs was I think her her point of view okay yeah yeah she

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.800
told it much better but that's amazing you did not have to go through that

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.720
because it was that was a great experience but a lot of the other shows

01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.160
I was on was not I mean it was I didn't it just you know you're not doing your

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.360
voice yeah that's I suffered for that entirely that's the thing is like if I

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.960
could do it all over again I spent so many years like just writing kind of in

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.080
vain I guess it's easy to say because I know now that all the things that I wrote

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.880
in between you know it's like they didn't go anywhere anyway so I may as

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:23.200
well have been in someone else's writer's room but it God DM I suffered as a

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.520
showrunner because I went from I was in it I was an officer and I was never an

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.320
unlisted man right well that I mean that's true but I think I think when you

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.640
have a strong point of view it's show running is a whole other thing I mean

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.840
it really is it's like it's like being a chef and then someone saying okay now

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.680
we've got a hundred of these to make right but understanding that if you have

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.000
10 people that cost a total of a million dollars of the studio's money and

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.640
they're there to help you and that you can't actually offend them by saying

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.320
for instance I think we can beat this joke just things that I had to learn

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:59.080
yeah yeah slowly and that had I come up as a staff writer I could have been like

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:04.000
on point season one and well I mean possibly I would say like the best

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.800
thing for people who want to write and that kind of thing you know it's gonna

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.280
sound counterintuitive but I do think when you're in those jobs and you're

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.280
coming up it's you want to be of service you want to be of support you know and I

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.440
think it is a bad impulse even though I had it say well when do I get my voice

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.520
out there when do I do my thing I do think the experience is support someone

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.160
yeah and and I it does give you a different perspective when you're in

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.200
that job and and sometimes not a better perspective because you're upset when

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.400
people aren't supporting you but that that's the skill yeah you don't what

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.400
well there's a your primary instinct is what kind of hack would I be if I told

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.320
another writer that what they had written for me was not good enough for me

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:49.560
all of your training as a supposedly amazing writer tells you that's what a

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.480
shitty writer would do like you don't tell it's uncomfortable when you're

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.320
working to create a field and there's a lot of people working together it's

01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.880
it's hard to it's hard to be direct about that stuff and someone recently said

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.240
to me I was in a room and I said oh that's funny when somebody pitched

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.200
something and another writer said that means it's not funny and I realized

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.280
it's true I've just done that for so long yeah and then hope this

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:27.920
conversation changes and then I go no wrong answers yeah yeah when wolf come

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:35.760
on all right the people but yeah it is it's just interesting to me that that

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.920
could be a form of selfishness when you believe that you're doing it how much

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.440
not communicating with other people like you think you can think that that makes

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:51.560
you not abusive for instance not it makes you but you right if you're being

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.360
direct is better being honest better other doesn't feel like it if you're like

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.960
if you close your office door and are just like I'll just do it and they're

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.280
like you close the office door it's like that's a form of abuse to a like

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:08.720
person that's like but I don't know what I did wrong the other revelation of

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.560
that kind of job and I know a lot of people here are pursuing that kind of

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.760
career is that you're working your way up you're trying to find your thing you're

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.480
trying to be funnier what if you're in comedy you try to get your pilot bait and

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.680
that kind of thing and then finally you do and you've got all these employees and

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.280
you just have no preparation to have people work for you it's just not part

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.240
of what you've been planning you haven't been thinking I'm gonna be a manager of

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.560
people I'm gonna worry about their time off I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure that

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.520
their feelings are okay it's just not there and oh and by the way I can't wait

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.520
to read all their shit because that's why I became a writer I love reading yeah

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.040
and you have to kind of make the shift that it's I mean it sounds corny but

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.560
that it's a privilege like you have to realize you know and it took me a while

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.400
to realize like this is a real benefit that I get to have people that count on

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.840
me they're happy but at first it's a it's an imposition would you put a shock

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:08.840
collar on your dog no do you know what part of my dog like a because they're

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:14.480
they're parts that would be vibration and sound collars well are you what

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:21.440
what behavior are you trying to modify barking no you're just gonna terrorize

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.160
your dog you're not gonna teach the dog to not bark you're just gonna tear

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.600
Amazon reviews say that's not there you go then do whatever you want I think

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.640
you're supposed to praise them when they're not barking so yeah constantly

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:42.720
praise them and then when they park just be quiet Harvey I think that shit I think

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.920
a lot of people's dogs do yeah yeah that's one of the main things that talks

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.120
to you when they're when they're not just hanging out being dogs they're

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.520
barking right yeah Harvey seems to be I think that he's I think that the new

01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:02.600
house being bigger and empty I think he's just he's he's barking more and more

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:08.160
and it's almost like how we've talked more since Robbie left right and they've

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:15.040
talked about it like the dog is doing you a favor it's got a bigger space to

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:23.680
protect so anytime it sees anything that is foreign or dangerous oh shit it's

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:28.440
alerting it so they love this point you're making yeah they love this point

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.080
you're making you're right it is it's an he's protecting the family yeah

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:41.520
Robbie and I just made love in the green room what you forgot your phone Tina

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:51.880
called yeah she does not appreciate the dick pic that Rob sent Dan do you know

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.720
any country songs that you can sing or any folk songs I mean we have an

01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:00.840
opportunity here for like we you can sing whatever you want oh my god this

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:07.880
guy is still in here yeah country songs like existing country song also

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:11.920
hilariously I probably the sales might have been down on this but Robbie made

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:18.280
like how many years ago did you make the Michael Jackson cover album what you

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:22.720
made a Michael Jackson cover it's all covers and he's your your your version

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.160
of man in the mirror is fucking outrageous it's really good but now

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.360
probably not so big on the charts well it's good to take it from him you know

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.320
it's like let's do different versions of all this stuff and then we could

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.840
disassociate it with Michael Jackson that could be good go go out and check it

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:44.840
out what's the record called it's called happy it is are you a Willie Nelson

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:50.800
fan sure yeah I mean who would say no no fuck Willie Nelson but like yeah Willie

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:57.120
Nelson reminds me of my parents getting along like it was like a like when they

01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.480
weren't fighting they would they would put on a Willie Nelson album and then you

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.640
know Southern Comfort on the rocks and a fireplace going and it was like Willie

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:11.960
Nelson so I guess those are the only country songs that I like like which one

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.720
do you think you know some of the words blue eyes I know I know some well is it

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:19.680
you pushing for that because you're like your fingers are can't wait to because

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.000
I know that one that one I don't know your babies I'm like like well there's

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.360
there's the two cowboy ones mom like I think it's like the two that are the

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:34.800
urban urban cowboy right now electric horseman soundtrack Robert Robert

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.600
Redford and Jane Fonda that's just a camel mama's don't let your babies grow

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.640
up to be cowboys and then what's the other one that's cowboys looking back on

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:46.560
there I don't know I think it's like a little Willie Nelson soundtrack like red

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.840
head strangers on but there's what's the other cowboy Willie Nelson song where

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:56.000
it's like there's another one that's like cowboys fucking what'd you say

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.240
poncho lefty no I feel like it's like almost like you hear this titles and

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.000
you're kind of like didn't you already do that song it's like one's like mama's

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.600
don't let your god damn it there's another one that's like cowboys do this

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:13.280
or that and they don't do that and the cowboy rulebook yeah I think that's what

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:19.840
it is the cowboy rulebook yeah why don't why don't we write the cowboy rulebook

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.840
song right now okay but I'll have Willie Nelson you're gonna listen brings you

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:29.640
the cowboy rulebook these are the rules of the cowboy

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:47.440
cowboys never wear blue jeans whoa after Labor Day when there's rattlesnakes

01:33:47.440 --> 01:34:01.320
born cowboys never drink whiskey outside a saloon with no Wi-Fi because they

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:17.920
never want any forlornness these are the rules for cowboys these are the rules

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:26.560
every cowboy you yeah never never has the rules yeah no you got the idea

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:38.400
cowboys are always riding around with the horsey if two cowboys meet the one

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:52.160
on the left has to dance that's not the end if three cowboys join up in a

01:34:52.160 --> 01:35:01.480
market they have to have a quorum if there's 11 cowboys or less there can

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:16.240
only be three pants any carpet a cowboy walks on is now magic that means it can

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:27.160
lift up to four cowboys in its weight if you go to a restaurant with more than

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:38.760
seven or cowboys you have to give the cowboy to your right half your plate

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:50.480
okay cowboys these are the rules these are the cowboy rules these are the

01:35:50.480 --> 01:36:02.080
rules the cowboys have to follow boys when the cowboys come home they got a

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:20.240
rule book but cowboys always follow I think that's I think that's the I hope

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.200
Willie Nelson doesn't hear that because I'll think I was doing here as in

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:36.200
Ford or David Duchovny so when you write a song like that down Dan do you what's

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.000
your process down when you're a musician you're writing a song like that

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.400
first I'll hear something in the shower like is the radio on and they'll be

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.320
like no that's my heart

01:36:48.320 --> 01:37:00.360
a lot of songs like oh I found a great title of a song and I'm gonna write the

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.560
song around that title like do you ever do that like the dude you think of like

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.640
oh that should be a song that phrase that I heard I just thought I've ever heard

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:18.440
like Schitt's Creek yeah absolutely yeah right yeah that's I think that's the that yeah that's the country way it's

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.820
start with a hook with a title and I kind of work around that that's just like

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:34.160
TV writing in a way is it I want this episode to be called an evening to

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.300
remember that's often like an NBC mid-season show kind of thing it was

01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:45.360
every you could expect like six shows that were like swipe to the left okay

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:53.580
that's six and that's the hip show yeah it was always like sex sexting OMG but

01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:56.080
you can't complain about it because you never know which one of those is gonna

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:00.560
be like because there's always something on the air that's like 83 reasons my

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:06.440
daughter's my uncle in the future I like how did that what they didn't expect that

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:11.680
to go more than 11 there's like yeah here we are back up plan just no wrong

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:19.080
answers in TV do you do you here's no wrong answers do you do you give

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.680
yourself an assignment or do you just wait to see what comes to you do you

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.440
will you say like all right this weekend I really want to at least put something

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:31.080
down well to be honest I don't like writing that well it's not fun you know

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.360
so same page I'll wait for a reason you know with you dad no yeah what do you

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.560
have to you have to make your own reason in television you don't have to you

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.280
have a you know you got a deadline but well maybe once in a while somebody will

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:46.400
throw me a project or something but yeah usually it's like it's time to do

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:54.600
another record you know so you got to write the record hard it's hard I got a

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:59.400
project for you Robbie folks it's an app called cord bot I use it to make my own

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.720
songs while I work out and you can hit this button and it goes song-o-matic and

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.640
it gives you a four what do they call measures you're like what is what called

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.040
bars it for it is bar bars is probably what it is and then you hit the thing and

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:26.400
then it goes like C major F major those are great chords E flat a big C major

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:34.120
fan a minor what do you think about that are you scared like John Henry was

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:41.080
your little scared aren't you yeah it's like this there's a little Robbie folks

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:45.480
in my phone you're like what's happening yeah what is this witchcraft was it

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:52.680
Robbie plays it see see it away this is because you can you can have this the

01:39:52.680 --> 01:40:22.000
phone doesn't own this it made it up that's yeah that's two I tell you it

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.600
really seems to work it's a great song now you're just you're not helping Rob

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:35.000
that's not helping Robbie was like why is that that's vandalism what you're

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.720
doing like we like you're like distracting him you're like 4chan

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:48.040
then you're the 4chan of this song yeah I want to see you what keep going down

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:54.640
Dan Rob Robbie keep going well I did no not Rob shop yeah probation but that's

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.120
the real world when you write a song there's always someone who's trying to

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.880
get in there and ruin it for you that's you see you it prepares you yeah that's

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.560
what I do yeah it's always there's always gonna be a counter to create a song

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.960
with a legendary song the song Robbie your song fuck this town is that based

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.360
on actual like like autobiography of being in Nashville yeah it is Jeff fuck

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:20.040
this town we were driving along and like people I see town in Nashville like

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.080
it's kind of a folksy saying it's a city you know they're always saying this

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.400
town and we're driving along a bunch of songwriters and in the 90s wherever

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.080
somebody goes oh it's a five-year town national we gotta wait be patient it's a

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.760
five-year town somebody goes well the town is really and I was in the back I

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:41.560
said like hey fuck this town so that's a good song title it is yeah wait fuck it

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.600
in the end fuck it up and fuck it end to end fucking end to end yeah yeah fuck it

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.120
up and down up and down that's very punk rock so what is the given given that

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.600
the attitude but it sometimes you do have to get angry well that's true I

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.960
mean I really like a question I have a country Western is like what what are

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.920
the things that demarcate because we there's been controversies lately where

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:08.320
it's like a hip-hop guy like the content of his rap was like him riding on a

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.540
horse or whatever and then they were like oh that's not eligible for what

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:17.200
ever it's like what is the I'm assuming the answer is it's not definitive but

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.920
like in your mind what makes the difference between the genres of music

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.880
like what is country Western that separates it is it about musical like

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.920
seriously yeah like is it an engineering answer what is what is the

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:35.760
definition of country Western I agree like it obviously we hear it you can

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.800
tell you're mocking my question so that's why yeah so I'll tell you what I

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.160
think I I think I'm a little bit divorced from what's been going on in

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:47.920
country music for the last oath 25 35 years I'm not real up on it but I think

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.760
it's like still connected to what it was in the sense that it's kitchen sink

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.760
songs it's like universal subjects it's like you know it's like

01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:00.280
microscoped down to the level of the the family and the and the you know a

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.520
couple individuals in a house trying to get along things like that and and I

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.160
think it does that better than stories about that in simple language better

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:16.560
than any other genre maybe a song of yours are like you have a lot of upbeat

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.440
happy songs but you've got some very like really lonely sad songs like for

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.600
guidance about great singing excuse me yeah everybody in country music you

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.480
have a fucking range like you can sing real high and like you got a big ass

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.960
range you can't hide your voice there's nowhere to you know you're right in

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.880
center there's a song like for listeners to go check out as a forgotten but not

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:42.040
gone that that song is sad as fuck but I love it it's really like lonesome and

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:49.120
thank you this podcast needs more compliments but you also need to be

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:55.440
kept humble with a run for your money from the algorithm oh here we go

01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:04.600
just listen to this Robbie I'll go I can add a guitar to this hold on acoustic

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.960
guitar

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:33.000
uh-oh Rob stop it no Rob Robbie folks I'm the algorithm I've come to take your

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:43.080
soul to hell you believe that your music will save you but I have a different

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:57.040
tale to tell I was born on Golgotha next to Christ with bones in my femur that's

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:11.560
where everyone has bones big deal my name is Beelzebub so that wouldn't be a

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:18.240
country song no like as an example Robbie Robbie what key is Ramam

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.440
favorite the same key you know Jeff we were doing it in E back there during the

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:29.560
hiatus if you know it you y'all know Merle Haggard nope one person went who

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:37.080
Merle Haggard yeah he's just it's song called Ramam Fever and is it okay if Mitch

01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:40.800
and I go into the green room and speak really loudly about golden girls for the

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.920
next 10 minutes well that way the audience gets it no explanation they

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:52.600
get everything or there might be a Vincent Price like like like middle

01:45:52.600 --> 01:46:01.360
section of this my hat don't hang on the same nail too long just me or you

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:09.120
fires can't stand to hear the same old song and I don't stay on one road long

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:17.160
enough the ball down in the mud cuz I've got rambling fever in my blood

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:25.800
Jeff B Davis I caught this rambling fever long ago when I first heard alone

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:34.120
some whistle blow if someone ever said I gave a damn what they damn sure told

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:44.760
you wrong I've had a rambling fever all along everyone join in Ramam one guy

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:58.840
fever yeah I can't be measured by the grease Ramam Fever ain't no kind of cure

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:08.240
for my disease well there's times I'd like to bed down on a sofa and let some

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:18.360
pretty lady rub my back and spend the early morning drinking coffee dreaming

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:33.360
about when I'll be coming back and I'll never get too old to get around I want

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:41.480
to die beside the highway and right away like some old highlight oh and rest
