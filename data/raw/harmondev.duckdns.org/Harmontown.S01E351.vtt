it's a difficult time now to go out on a limb like this but it can\n\n08:24.840 --> 08:30.560\nbe dry right you can you can have a pretzel like a bun on a burger and it\n\n08:30.560 --> 08:39.160\ncan

it's like I'm\n\n09:05.520 --> 09:09.000\nstarting a streaming network and now it's like another bad investment it's like\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.520\nof all times you started working at Netflix all this time and then you went\n\n09:13.520 --> 09:17.280\nand started I want to start with because they've had such great luck with it right\n\n09:17.280 --> 09:22.760\nthought you know and then and I thought you know what's not out there and I\n\n09:22.760 --> 09:27.200\nthought well like add well there's too much content right so this is there's\n\n09:27.200 --> 09:33.840\nnot a lot of content now and it's got two tiers oh yeah it's good like\n\n09:33.840 --> 09:39.320\nadvertising is four dollars a month okay and then like more advertising is like\n\n09:39.320 --> 09:44.680\nsix dollars a month that sounds like our our business model yeah yeah it's good\n\n09:44.680 --> 09:48.560\nwhich is why we're ending the show soon yeah because it's it's not it doesn't\n\n09:48.560 --> 09:52.200\nmake any sense yeah we'd love to have you do nothing on it at some point it was\n\n09:52.200 --> 09:57.440\nwe're not into content that's not our thing what if you generated over at\n\n09:57.440 --> 10:01.320\nNetflix did they give you like an overall deal I was real jealous I did I did have\n\n10:01.320 --> 10:07.360\nan overall deal and there wasn't much to be jealous about I mean there was it was\n\n10:07.360 --> 10:11.960\nnice to be able to use the pool whenever I wanted the Netflix pool the shape\n\n10:11.960 --> 10:17.320\njust seems to not like I get it it has to be an end but yeah like that doesn't\n\n10:17.320 --> 10:22.360\nhelp with swimming like yeah yeah no it's great they do a lot of things this\n\n10:22.360 --> 10:26.880\nspa is great and their restaurants obviously are worth it but I did a\n\n10:26.880 --> 10:30.440\ncouple things over there and then I spent a lot of time bringing back a rest of\n\n10:30.440 --> 10:36.960\ndevelopment and

here yeah everything you're reading is\n\n14:19.720 --> 14:26.880\nthe yeah I once told the cop to go fuck himself and I like that's if that's not\n\n14:26.880 --> 14:34.360\nwhite privilege then nothing is yeah yeah I one time picked up I was walking my\n\n14:34.360 --> 14:40.040\ndog and in our neighborhood the police have okay alright excuse me that's how\n\n14:40.040 --> 14:46.760\nit

killing civilians okay right and so I'm\n\n15:34.640 --> 15:39.280\nwalking the dog I'm walking the dog and you know it's like sometimes when they\n\n15:39.280 --> 15:43.880\nthey bring out like the the garbage you know it's sitting there and you're\n\n15:43.880 --> 15:47.400\nwalking the dog you get the bag of shit you're like oh bonus I don't have to sure\n\n15:47.400 --> 15:51.040\nI don't have to turn the corner I can just put it right there you know and I'm\n\n15:51.040 --> 15:55.320\nwalking I'm walking I'm walking and I miss it and then I go oh I should turn\n\n15:55.320 --> 16:00.480\naround and throw the dog shit away and as I was turning around and putting my\n\n16:00.480 --> 16:07.120\narm up a police car with the window open go by at the same time so it looked\n\n16:07.120 --> 16:12.400\nlike and forgive me for the people who don't have the visual of this so it looks\n\n16:12.400 --> 16:19.680\nlike me like going like if you're the cop I'm like oh my god so it just because\n\n16:19.680 --> 16:24.120\nit just I was walking this way and then I do a sharp turn with my hand up with a\n\n16:24.120 --> 16:27.400\nbag and you know in our neighborhood somebody had a towel in his hand and\n\n16:27.400 --> 16:31.520\ngot his face blowing off yeah you gotta turn that into like a blue lives matter\n\n16:31.520 --> 16:40.320\nyes and the cop and the cop like went like this oh my god I could have been\n\n16:40.320 --> 16:43.280\nkilled right you could have been killed I that's basically what happened to that\n\n16:43.280 --> 16:49.520\nguy right totally the same thing damn it sir it's like front row raise your hand\n\n16:49.520 --> 16:54.760\nwho's the guy he can't okay he raises his hand yeah but leg is gonna go up but\n\n16:54.760 -->

his\n\n17:04.960 --> 17:08.600\nbrain controls his arm and his leg at the same time well I'm just thinking like\n\n17:08.600 --> 17:11.640\nwhat it's like it's like the three stooges when they're plumbers you know\n\n17:11.640 --> 17:16.000\nlike if you flush the toilet the shower goes I'm just isn't that why if you were\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.080\nin an audience and you're not supposed to talk you'd be like I'm talking I mean\n\n17:20.080 --> 17:24.000\nit's possible it's that thing that people like now that our show is dying\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.600\nand we're gonna be done soon I think people just want to be Adam Goldberg\n\n17:27.600 --> 17:33.040\nfor like like at the buzzer what if I can be like the like the last person\n\n17:33.040 --> 17:37.680\nthat the whole crowd hated

have\n\n31:05.240 --> 31:09.140\nlike what do I have like what I was gonna do a show called mother fuckers\n\n31:09.140 --> 31:14.560\nwhich is this woman who they called mother and her last name is fuckers oh and\n\n31:14.560 --> 31:18.400\nso she's the mother fuckers oh that's cool and that way you can say it on TV and\n\n31:18.400 --> 31:23.720\nstuff you know I have like five ideas that are Groundhog Day meets something\n\n31:23.720 --> 31:30.560\nyeah I know I'm is that okay I'm doing I'm doing Russian doll meets Groundhog Day\n\n31:30.560 --> 31:38.240\nso I don't know maybe it's too close I said have you did you watch anything I\n\n31:38.240 --> 31:41.040\nhate it when people ask me this but only because the answer is kind of always\n\n31:41.040 --> 31:45.040\nembarrassingly no but I have been watching successionly oh my god do you\n\n31:45.040 --> 31:48.200\nlike succession yeah and you know why is succession is brilliant I mean if you\n\n31:48.200 --> 31:52.800\nhaven't discovered succession yet you haven't and I went into it a little bit\n\n31:52.800 --> 31:57.760\nlike defensive very because it was I've been told you know it's kind of like the\n\n31:57.760 --> 32:01.080\ncharacters there's even like a Tobias there's like for kids and all this stuff\n\n32:01.080 --> 32:07.720\nand so I kind of it is very blue thing yeah but it's so much funnier than\n\n32:07.720 --> 32:11.360\narrested development I mean it really is like it won on every point and now I'm\n\n32:11.360 --> 32:14.960\njust a fan I'm a complete there's no competition obviously yeah but I can see\n\n32:14.960 --> 32:18.480\nhow people would be like tweeting you and going like who I looked at bitter when\n\n32:18.480 --> 32:24.080\nit was you know like I get that but no it's inspired and and I even like the\n\n32:24.080 --> 32:27.040\nthing at the end where the author you know I haven't done one of those shows\n\n32:27.040 --> 32:31.680\nwhere at the end you get to talk about the scenes you know like at the end of\n\n32:31.680 --> 32:34.960\nlike Game of Thrones I don't I never it's like you get it absorbed in the\n\n32:34.960 --> 32:38.440\nstory and then someone says you know when we wrote that scene with the dragon\n\n32:38.440 --> 32:44.400\nyou're like ah fuck none of it happened yeah I don't watch those I can't\n\n32:44.400 --> 32:47.640\nmention people watching those yeah no it's it kind of takes the fun out of\n\n32:47.640 --> 32:50.480\nme yeah because it's like oh there's Arya Stark but she's like drinking a diet\n\n32:50.480 --> 32:54.840\ncoke and she's like oh yeah she didn't want to do that scene she don't she\n\n32:54.840 --> 32:58.400\ndon't want to kiss him she's like here's the three takes where I like jumped in\n\n32:58.400 --> 33:01.800\nthe air with the knife but then I landed on a cat like like like what this is\n\n33:01.800 --> 33:05.840\nawful why are you doing this to me I thought you were real it's like the\n\n33:05.840 --> 33:09.000\nnetwork you say well we're all adults right I mean we all know this is\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:19.560\nbullshit you know the real heroes are the fucking ugly people that had to\n\n33:19.560 --> 33:24.600\nwrite this shit that's a game of Thrones you want to meet a fucking dragon\n\n33:24.600 --> 33:30.720\nmeet Benjamin the writers PA he's a fucking Harry character I just want to\n\n33:30.720 --> 33:34.520\ndo one of those and I want to like really seriously talk about the show it's\n\n33:34.520 --> 33:38.680\njust like the most ridiculous show and then just say well that's it's really\n\n33:38.680 --> 33:46.000\nabout loss we were getting at we wanted to do we wanted to explore loss and\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:52.800\nthat's why we had his penis showing when he bent over like that the performance\n\n33:52.800 --> 33:57.640\nis the casting and succession are great I got it really is like I Cody was\n\n33:57.640 --> 34:02.160\nwatching it just for for her own purposes and so that's that's the only\n\n34:02.160 --> 34:06.240\nway I'm ever gonna get like hooked into a show because I'm so lazy and I still\n\n34:06.240 --> 34:09.040\nhave talked endlessly about like I don't know what it is that keeps me away\n\n34:09.040 --> 34:14.560\nfrom watching shit but it's like Cody's got the laptop open it starts with me\n\n34:14.560 --> 34:20.040\nhearing dialogue and I'm so jaded I'm like was that supposed to be funny I\n\n34:20.040 --> 34:25.480\ndon't know what is it a dramedy or a tragic comma do do but do but do like\n\n34:25.480 --> 34:30.280\nwhatever whatever pick a lane I just sort of like I just I just have this\n\n34:30.280 --> 34:35.880\njaded like membrane and then gradually things will land and I'll be like well\n\n34:35.880 --> 34:40.400\nwhat's going on over there like is that a musical montage with those housewives\n\n34:40.400 --> 34:45.000\nand why why won't he show up on time to the party and then you just get drawn\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:50.640\nin and Cody made fun of me because I was like I was like this shows boring at\n\n34:50.640 --> 34:53.440\none point I almost don't want to say that out loud because it makes me sound like\n\n34:53.440 --> 34:57.160\nsuch a fucking douche but I was like but it is that's how good the show is is\n\n34:57.160 --> 35:01.000\nbecause it was probably like a couple hours later when I'm like I got work to\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:05.240\ndo and I was like come on what's the next episode she's like oh the boring show\n\n35:05.240 --> 35:10.600\nand I'm like all right you got yeah fucking like it's riveting I I don't\n\n35:10.600 --> 35:15.840\nknow yeah it's it that that's riveting it doesn't go where you expect it to go\n\n35:15.840 --> 35:20.800\nthe characters are more nuanced it's just predictable enough yep to actually be\n\n35:20.800 --> 35:25.720\nthat's what I really like about it is that it doesn't try to purposely it\n\n35:25.720 --> 35:30.520\ndoesn't engage in like a hot rod unpredictability it actually gives you\n\n35:30.520 --> 35:34.520\nperfect but this guy's a junkie he's gonna do it fucking junkies do and you\n\n35:34.520 --> 35:38.080\nknow how that's gonna end up the way you think it is and but it's like the\n\n35:38.080 --> 35:43.200\ndetails are lateral enough that there's a confidence in the well and it's they\n\n35:43.200 --> 35:47.680\nthere is that thing that we don't often get to do in comedy where you leave some\n\n35:47.680 --> 35:51.520\nthings unexplained you know we in comedy it's all about you explain everything\n\n35:51.520 --> 35:58.160\nyou want everybody to get every joke and and that oh wait yeah he's just I feel\n\n35:58.160 --> 36:03.520\nlike Rob left he's getting to that age there's like he has to he has to go\n\n36:03.520 --> 36:09.640\nevery I think that's why it's wise that you didn't introduce him because because\n\n36:09.640 --> 36:19.160\nwhat for yeah but anyway yeah they get to you get to like look into the\n\n36:19.160 --> 36:24.080\ncharacters eyes you know is she upset what she is she relieved is I mean it\n\n36:24.080 --> 36:28.400\nreally is it's spectacular yes good you kind of love I felt the way about\n\n36:28.400 --> 36:31.640\nGame of Thrones too it's I like I like good dramas that were like serialized\n\n36:31.640 --> 36:35.360\nbecause you like you you get to pick a character you go like that person's the\n\n36:35.360 --> 36:39.200\nbest all these other people annoy me and then you're like okay well that person I\n\n36:39.200 --> 36:42.680\nalso understand and it kind of settles in like Velcro and you're like like\n\n36:42.680 --> 36:46.040\nslowly they're just like I love all these fucking assholes and like you kind of\n\n36:46.040 --> 36:49.600\nlike you're watching a soap opera it's great I wanted to do a show I did a show\n\n36:49.600 --> 36:53.240\nactually did four episodes of a show called everything's relative and the\n\n36:53.240 --> 36:58.520\nconceit which NBC didn't quite let me do was gonna be that every episode another\n\n36:58.520 --> 37:02.440\ncharacter basically thinks the shows about them you know like they're the\n\n37:02.440 --> 37:06.440\nnormal person like the Michael Bluth basically so that you know it started\n\n37:06.440 --> 37:10.040\noff with like the the white kid it was 35 but then the next episode was like the\n\n37:10.040 --> 37:14.520\nmom is just all the mom's point of view and and they kind of do that in a way we\n\n37:14.520 --> 37:17.160\nnever got to do the project we were gonna do together which I think we could\n\n37:17.160 --> 37:21.000\njust open source now because I'm retired no no let's do it all right I have a\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.840\nway to do it but not at Netflix no back in there no I think we should do it on\n\n37:25.840 --> 37:30.640\nmy streaming was it called my streaming platform could could frankly stand a\n\n37:30.640 --> 37:33.520\nlittle content you don't have a streaming platform do you ever start a\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:38.440\nstreaming but I'm starting a streaming platform I'm gonna it's got two tears I\n\n37:38.440 --> 37:41.560\nfeel like I mentioned this but the cool thing is it's just your last name so you\n\n37:41.560 --> 37:45.400\ndon't need to make up a Silicon Valley no it's not it's not it's not it's not\n\n37:45.400 --> 37:52.440\nit's called netmitch no it's it's it's media master plus\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:57.840\nwell that's not what you think that's refreshingly Brian Heimer and if we're\n\n37:57.840 --> 38:02.760\nnot like violating some sort of like please no this all this all publicity\n\n38:02.760 --> 38:06.960\nfor what I need as many name what's the name of your show and what's the premise\n\n38:06.960 --> 38:10.560\nlike you give me the elevator pitch it's not a show it's a platform okay that's\n\n38:10.560 --> 38:15.440\nalready your way off all right all right I thought you guys had a media master\n\n38:15.440 --> 38:24.400\nplus that oh that show yeah that show media master plus the show is a platform\n\n38:24.760 --> 38:30.220\nthat's I'm doing two tears you got to get that in there what what's two two\n\n38:30.220 --> 38:37.960\ntwo two tears of power power power it's getting a little into content which\n\n38:37.960 --> 38:42.680\nwe're trying to avoid but I okay is there any content or is it just you\n\n38:42.680 --> 38:48.320\ntalking about the platform it's well one of the things I wanted to do is I\n\n38:48.320 --> 38:53.320\nwant to harness people's webcams and then they're basically it's almost like a\n\n38:53.320 --> 38:58.360\nmirror there's a show that's the show like you you see your own life right you\n\n38:58.360 --> 39:05.680\ndon't but it's not flipped like a mirror and that's the key difference it's how\n\n39:05.680 --> 39:12.440\nwhen they're at their ads two difference here the second here is that you get to\n\n39:12.440 --> 39:17.320\nwatch yourself and there's yeah yeah it's it's like you're gonna love it and\n\n39:17.320 --> 39:22.400\nand you're the first streaming platform is not content based no content no\n\n39:22.400 --> 39:28.360\ncontent no I think people are burnt out on content it's time that you that\n\n39:28.360 --> 39:33.760\nyours your own self is enough well I think it is although we are in a deal\n\n39:33.760 --> 39:37.000\nwith Schitt's Creek oh we'll be honest we're trying to we're trying to go\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:41.360\ndownstream of that a little bit and then we have something called head up your\n\n39:41.360 --> 39:47.000\nasses right the your ass family oh the your ass family you can say it you can\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:51.880\nsay it on TV because it's their name that's crazy those honestly when I was\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:55.760\nwatching the Emmys they're like Schitt's Creek like oh my god\n\n39:55.760 --> 40:00.200\nSchitt's Creek on the Emmys that's fantastic it is a hilarious show by the\n\n40:00.200 --> 40:08.040\nway I don't mean to be it says it's a dog it's it's wait what a well it's a\n\n40:08.040 --> 40:17.360\ndog it's a dog I'm gonna miss this show yeah no I'm not but our idea was it's\n\n40:17.360 --> 40:22.160\nmulti-dimensional we were gonna do we're gonna team up we're still gonna do it I\n\n40:22.160 --> 40:26.000\nhave a way to do it you sure you want to tell them but your way to do it is your\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:29.840\njoke no that's not a way that's not the way to do it it would not be good for\n\n40:29.840 --> 40:36.560\nmedia master plus right we wouldn't run it on that okay but I don't want to do\n\n40:36.560 --> 40:41.440\nit on Netflix cuz I want back I wouldn't be on it okay yeah I know back end what\n\n40:41.440 --> 40:49.640\nlike CBS all-access nice NBC Perview this is CBS is all-access like there's no\n\n40:49.640 --> 40:54.120\nwhen they say no to there's not like some institutional racism or something\n\n40:54.120 --> 40:58.160\nwhere it's like no you're Korean you can't get this channel it's all-access yeah\n\n40:58.160 --> 41:01.440\nI think that yeah that I think that's not they're still they still hate Koreans\n\n41:01.440 --> 41:05.920\non that video it's like yes but everyone's allowed to watch yeah that's\n\n41:05.920 --> 41:12.120\ngreat that's really so big of them yeah see CBS all-access CBS everybody can\n\n41:12.120 --> 41:19.040\nwatch why that'll work that'll are you are you have a deal there are you are\n\n41:19.040 --> 41:24.080\nyou exclusive there I'm working with your buddy Ron on a thing yeah on how access\n\n41:24.080 --> 41:28.640\nRon Harry way it's very very nice you always have to go I'm working at CBS then\n\n41:28.640 --> 41:34.360\nyou pause and you go all-access people are so relieved they're like oh my god\n\n41:34.360 --> 41:38.880\nfinally bisexuals can watch CBS you know I mean it's not like you don't have to\n\n41:38.880 --> 41:44.720\npass any fucking test like anybody's welcome I do I will say CBS being like\n\n41:44.720 --> 41:50.320\nyou I think that they're playing at the smartest cuz I was part of CISO which\n\n41:50.320 --> 41:55.960\nwas NBC's half-hearted attempt to like they're like oh we see where this is\n\n41:55.960 --> 41:59.360\ngoing the world's gonna be mini-netflixes and so they put a little bit of money\n\n41:59.360 --> 42:04.640\ninto this thing CISO and we created Harmon quest for them and a lot of\n\n42:04.640 --> 42:09.280\nshows created for them under the you took all of CISO's money as I heard it\n\n42:09.280 --> 42:17.200\nthat's that was the word that got we took all of it we rolled a 20 but I\n\n42:17.200 --> 42:20.480\nthink CBS is being the smartest about it because they're basically like here's\n\n42:20.480 --> 42:25.920\nour platform on the web CBS all-access all-access is simultaneously like\n\n42:25.920 --> 42:31.160\nunignorable but it's also like just sort of like it's just it means nothing so\n\n42:31.160 --> 42:34.640\nthey're there I there I think they sat there went like well what are we gonna\n\n42:34.640 --> 42:38.200\ndo eventually the thing with the antennas no one's gonna watch it\n\n42:38.200 --> 42:41.120\nanywhere right they're like so we can't call this thing snap crackle dippled\n\n42:41.120 --> 42:45.160\napple like we can't like go all in on that and have a compete with like the\n\n42:45.160 --> 42:50.080\nreal thing it's like just call it CBS with a ramp because it's got CBS all\n\n42:50.080 --> 42:56.480\naboard and then it's like everyone gets a board and it's like CBS psych burp\n\n42:56.480 --> 43:01.720\nwelcome just kidding we're Netflix that's right it's like hey we don't want\n\n43:01.720 --> 43:06.280\nany trouble we were just CBS all-access yeah like there's nothing it's not\n\n43:06.280 --> 43:11.080\nCBS platinum plus shadow master but also in the CBS television they produce for\n\n43:11.080 --> 43:15.520\neverybody so you could go exactly you could go what is the Hurwitz Harmon project\n\n43:15.520 --> 43:18.520\nyou guys talking about you guys it wouldn't be for you I don't think you\n\n43:18.520 --> 43:22.360\nwould appreciate outside the demo you're outside the millennial thing it's like\n\n43:22.360 --> 43:30.160\nit's like give me the elevator pitch on your guys because it's all abbreviation\n\n43:30.160 --> 43:33.400\nit's all just initials do you guys already have a millennial you have an opening\n\n43:33.400 --> 43:37.400\ntheme song we have a theme song why don't we just sing the theme song and I feel\n\n43:37.400 --> 43:40.120\nlike it gives away too much I think you guys remember the Beverly\n\n43:40.120 --> 43:43.440\nHillbillies like the whole conceit yeah but you're okay yeah I was like you would\n\n43:43.440 --> 43:46.440\nwatch the main tunnel and you go like okay that's enough I've had enough story\n\n43:46.440 --> 43:49.320\nyeah yeah\n\n43:53.040 --> 44:05.600\ntwo garbage men found a genie who worked in sanitation as well as the\n\n44:05.600 --> 44:16.320\ngarbage men but the garbage genie had thrown away half of its wishes but the\n\n44:16.320 --> 44:23.000\ntwo garbage men didn't care because they were happy delivering garbage so now\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:36.800\nthe three of them are a family delivering wishes that other people throw away and\n\n44:36.800 --> 44:49.120\nthe genie is dying a painful death that Western medicine can't treat yet so it's\n\n44:49.120 --> 44:58.120\ngot some heart too but one of the garbage men is withholding his final wish\n\n44:58.120 --> 45:10.360\nwhich he could use to cure the genie but he wants to fuck her it's what that's\n\n45:10.360 --> 45:22.760\nwhy and that's why that's why delivering garbage and wishes misunderstanding\n\n45:22.760 --> 45:32.320\nthe very concept of what garbage men do they don't live garbage hashtag rape\n\n45:32.320 --> 45:43.040\nculture that's not only Millennials only is the title yeah partial access it's on\n\n45:43.040 --> 45:49.240\nCBS partial access partial access CBS is racially motivated let a little known\n\n45:49.240 --> 45:57.520\nrace partial access it's actually just for it's on CBS no audio and it's a lot\n\n45:57.520 --> 46:00.960\nof people got like oh is it right it's racially it's but it's like moon raker\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:04.720\nit's like the the the only people I can watch CBS partial access it's like it's\n\n46:04.720 --> 46:08.920\nselecting people from each racial group on earth their logo happens in moon\n\n46:08.920 --> 46:14.120\nraker I don't remember that from moon raker it's like a super colony of people\n\n46:14.120 --> 46:18.880\nyou know they're like you want you want like there's like three people of every\n\n46:18.880 --> 46:22.880\npart of earth life that you're gonna they're gonna CBS is gonna start a\n\n46:22.880 --> 46:28.120\nsuper colony with you know we if we were a we're gonna be gene splicing at some\n\n46:28.120 --> 46:32.400\npoint and we will be able to do that we will be able to decide what qualities\n\n46:32.400 --> 46:37.680\nwe should have are and you can imagine how badly this will go well people will\n\n46:37.680 --> 46:41.160\nbe able to say to parents because you know it's like the GI Bill and student\n\n46:41.160 --> 46:43.640\nloans and things it's gonna go in a direction where people go like so you\n\n46:43.640 --> 46:48.040\nwant to have a kid which by the way shame on you like well we'll be we'll be\n\n46:48.040 --> 46:52.760\ntrained to be like oh such a horrible person this time and day like I want to\n\n46:52.760 --> 46:56.640\nhave a kid and it'll be like like yeah I want an SUV and the doctor I'll sit you\n\n46:56.640 --> 47:00.760\ndown and go so here's the different packages this one yeah if you agree that\n\n47:00.760 --> 47:06.800\nyour kid will be super into anime for seven years the Japanese government is\n\n47:06.800 --> 47:13.840\nwilling to give you $10,000 for diapers which is a pretty pretty big carrot if\n\n47:13.840 --> 47:17.520\nyour kid has an affinity for Apple products or is willing to work in the\n\n47:17.520 --> 47:21.520\nstock room like like for five years everything will be a broke their life\n\n47:21.520 --> 47:28.640\nwill be broken yeah I think well I also think that if we'd gotten this a while\n\n47:28.640 --> 47:32.640\nago like the mistakes we would have made we would have probably gotten rid of\n\n47:32.640 --> 47:36.240\nfear right I mean I think about like what people's biggest problems are usually\n\n47:36.240 --> 47:41.240\nfear-based so we would have gotten rid of that we'd all be dead yeah that's what\n\n47:41.240 --> 47:46.240\nyou need right now more fearless people yeah we can do about that shame to let's\n\n47:46.240 --> 47:50.680\ndial that shame down a little bit I've encountered too many shameful people on\n\n47:50.680 -->

paying customers won't hear it Robbie well\n\n50:39.560 --> 50:45.040\nwe did a gig in New York together with with Dino and Stephen Colbert and Louis\n\n50:45.040 --> 50:49.680\nCK and Tina Fey and a bunch of people's and everybody was freaked out that you\n\n50:49.680 --> 50:54.600\nwere there because I was even even more uncomfortable on that stage than I am on\n\n50:54.600 --> 51:02.000\nthis

51:09.160\nand they were nervous about being on a stage with you like because they I don't\n\n51:09.160 --> 51:12.120\nthink that's true what you're saying no it is true that good I mean it's true\n\n51:12.120 --> 51:17.560\ncuz I heard them say that and Tina said that she used to get guitar lessons from\n\n51:17.560 --> 51:22.720\nyou back in the Chicago Second City days and they all took lessons from you\n\n51:22.720 --> 51:26.800\nbecause it was like getting a free Robbie Fox concert wow they didn't want\n\n51:26.800 --> 51:35.440\nto learn does that piss you off it was frustrating yes like I would have charged\n\n51:35.440 --> 51:45.880\nmore wait Tina Tina sniffs out a deal she knows what you did a duet\n\n51:45.880 --> 51:50.200\ntogether was it like a Johnny and June song or gosh I'm trying to remember I\n\n51:50.200 --> 51:55.000\nthink it might have been success by Loretta Lynn okay yeah that was it\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:59.560\nyeah and she can really sing yeah she's a good singer right yeah you guys were\n\n51:59.560 --> 52:03.000\nfantastic together but she told me before the show and I again I only met her\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:06.160\nbriefly once that she's like I'm having a freaking freak out right now because I\n\n52:06.160 --> 52:10.240\nhave to go up in stage and sing with with Robbie Fox you know I did a I don't\n\n52:10.240 --> 52:14.120\nknow if this stories of interest or not she had a birthday party one time she\n\n52:14.120 --> 52:17.840\nwas turning 40 and she asked me to or no she didn't her husband asked me to Jeff\n\n52:17.840 --> 52:25.600\nasked me to come play and it was a surprise for her and I and so so what's\n\n52:25.600 --> 52:32.360\nthe story here well once one story is that I thought I didn't know what would\n\n52:32.360 --> 52:37.200\nbe like right it's in a rock club and I didn't know would it be like her parents\n\n52:37.200 --> 52:41.140\nor would it be comedians or what would it be and it was basically just Rob\n\n52:41.140 --> 52:47.040\nSchneider sitting in a rocking right Rob Schneider was there and Melanie\n\n52:47.040 --> 52:53.200\nHutzel they were all there that's a joke for three people but no it's like an\n\n52:53.200 --> 52:58.960\noffice party basically a 30 rock office like the cast and the and the and the\n\n52:58.960 --> 53:02.040\nproducers and stuff were there they were like 40 people there you know in a club\n\n53:02.040 --> 53:07.520\nthat holds 600 people and they were milling around and Tina sat on a couch\n\n53:07.520 --> 53:13.400\nkind of in the middle and watched me play and everybody else ignored me I was\n\n53:13.400 --> 53:17.120\nwith like a seven-piece band making a lot of noise and I prepared some special\n\n53:17.120 --> 53:22.280\nmaterial and I think this is mildly interesting I've never told this story\n\n53:22.280 --> 53:27.280\nbefore but I thought I was preparing this stuff and I thought it was too a\n\n53:27.280 --> 53:32.760\ncomplimentary of Tina I wrote a song about Tina and about our old days in\n\n53:32.760 --> 53:37.280\nChicago and this and that and was feeling really kind of corny and positive\n\n53:37.280 --> 53:41.440\nand I'm two minutes into this song I thought well I'll do a joke in here so\n\n53:41.440 --> 53:49.960\nthe song was a Tina whoa whoa whoa Tina anyway I put in a line about Tina\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:56.760\nyou're faultless in my book then I go date night I'll overlook like that date\n\n53:56.760 --> 54:03.640\nnight was a terrible movie that she was in just to explain that and so I got to\n\n54:03.640 --> 54:08.280\nthis joke and like the crowd was kind of like enjoying it up to that point like\n\n54:08.280 --> 54:13.440\nit was about Tina and it was positive and then it just turned the whole mood of\n\n54:13.440 --> 54:22.440\nthe room really on because they probably all worked on the film yeah it was a\n\n54:22.440 --> 54:29.000\ntotal miscalculation it was a total miscalculation and I even I apologize to\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:32.400\nher afterwards because I thought I'd kind of ruined a moment and she said oh no\n\n54:32.400 --> 54:37.560\nthat's she said I expected you to insult me because it's you she said they're\n\n54:37.560 --> 54:44.120\njust all scared of me she said she's kind of intense like I my brief\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:48.560\nencounters with her like she really is like like to meet her is to have been\n\n54:48.560 --> 55:02.200\nmet pretty hard that's great but I she she's only she was your Jeff you you're\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:06.440\nfunny motherfucker and then she just meant she turned around and walked away I\n\n55:06.440 --> 55:10.200\nthought that that would that was that's meeting Tina for me she just like she\n\n55:10.200 --> 55:14.320\njust nails you and the fucking bones out you didn't even get a chance to just\n\n55:14.320 --> 55:17.440\nkick her in the balls over the date night thing\n\n55:17.440 --> 55:28.920\nright after that sounds amazing I would think is it is it must be harder well\n\n55:28.920 --> 55:32.600\nmaybe it's not but is it harder to play for a small audience than a large audience\n\n55:32.600 --> 55:38.840\nof one audience one too yeah it's kind of daunting I don't know what it's like\n\n55:38.840 --> 55:46.400\nto play for a large audience maybe I was in Chicago and I asked Dino like what's\n\n55:46.400 --> 55:49.800\nwhat's something cool doing something cool to do in Chicago and he goes you\n\n55:49.800 --> 55:53.240\nshould go is it the hideout or the hideaway the hideout the hideout which is\n\n55:53.240 --> 55:56.000\nwhat's what part of town in Chicago is that it doesn't really have a name but\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:59.600\nit's on the near north side it's kind of buck town or no it doesn't even have a\n\n55:59.600 --> 56:11.280\nname okay it's just it's by a is it Jamestown free more guesses lo ho it was\n\n56:11.280 --> 56:18.120\nby a rubbish tip and some debris and that is correct yeah and I went in there\n\n56:18.120 --> 56:22.120\nand saw the show and I texted my brother Bill and I was like dude like you\n\n56:22.120 --> 56:24.600\nwould fucking freak out right now there's this guy named Robbie Fox playing\n\n56:24.600 --> 56:29.280\nhe's playing like bluegrass country folky stuff and I texted my brother and he\n\n56:29.280 --> 56:34.840\ntexted back and he goes I have every one of his records and I put you I met you\n\n56:34.840 --> 56:38.000\nafter the show I said I know Dino Stamatopolous my brother is on the phone\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:41.720\nright now and you got in the phone and you insulted me to my brother you said\n\n56:41.720 --> 56:47.240\nI like you more than your brother your brother's a piece of shit I said you were\n\n56:47.240 --> 56:54.880\nterrible and date night I remember you see you got one go-to the date night of\n\n56:54.880 --> 57:00.720\nM.C. he thinks everybody was on date night would you be honest with us if your\n\n57:00.720 --> 57:05.880\nname was fake because it seems like such a richly musician name Robbie folks like\n\n57:05.880 --> 57:10.200\nI would be like if somebody said hey the handyman's coming over to fix the sink\n\n57:10.200 --> 57:13.280\nhis name is Robbie folks I'd be like well what the hell's he's fixing my sink\n\n57:13.280 --> 57:19.200\nfor give that guy a guitar really I I've never encountered that point of view\n\n57:19.200 --> 57:25.640\nbut well I wouldn't do you I guess if it's your real name is what you're\n\n57:25.640 --> 57:29.120\ntelling me it's my real name yeah I wouldn't have chosen it to be a country\n\n57:29.120 --> 57:35.760\nsinger I would I don't know what did your mom not like Robert so Rob's name is\n\n57:35.760 --> 57:40.520\nalso Robbie that was my dad and yes you're right yeah is it Robbie on your\n\n57:40.520 --> 57:43.800\nbirth certificate Robbie no it's Robert\n\n57:43.800 --> 57:52.440\nRobbie at his birth certificate how does that feel Robbie Schrab Robbie tell him\n\n57:52.440 --> 57:57.600\nwhy tell him why because my mom when she was pregnant there were a lot of\n\n57:57.600 --> 58:05.240\nrestaurants being made and he thought because his mom's a Flintstone yeah this\n\n58:05.240 --> 58:10.600\nis back this is back in the was causing restaurant boom the outdoors were\n\n58:10.600 --> 58:16.760\nbecoming in and she said she said you know well one day my son might grow up\n\n58:16.760 --> 58:22.920\nand and he'll own a restaurant not be a hunter-gatherer like we are yeah he can\n\n58:22.920 --> 58:27.120\nown a restaurant and he could call it Robbie's restaurant like I couldn't do\n\n58:27.120 --> 58:31.600\nthat my name was Timothy right it'd be like if everyone was still foraging she\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:36.360\nwould have named you Frank yeah nobody would eat at Roberts\n\n58:36.360 --> 58:41.880\nrestaurant and no one knows Robert has ever gone by Robbie so it's really good\n\n58:41.880 --> 58:47.880\nthinking what when did you leave the south Robbie not you Robbie Robbie\n\n58:47.880 --> 58:54.320\nRobbie folks Roberts

01:12:02.440\nthat was the Grammy nominee oh it's a upland stories it's about three years\n\n01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:07.680\nold and the song and you also nominated for the for a track too right oh yeah the\n\n01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.440\ntrack was called Alabama night yeah I was a win I didn't win okay I lost two\n\n01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:21.800\nGrammys I've technically lost every Grammy you were up against them like so\n\n01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.840\nlike some cool stuff but like like just the fact that somebody found I'm a\n\n01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.040\npretty small I have a real small audience so it's just cool to be included in\n\n01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.440\nthat yeah yeah like I've seen you play like when you do when you come to LA\n\n01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.520\nback when you saw in Chicago you play McCabe's which is like an awesome music\n\n01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:47.600\nstore in like Santa Monica Santa Monica and you're funnier than all the comics\n\n01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.680\nthat I know and the music and you also just pick like people that play I saw\n\n01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.000\nyou play the troubadour and it was a gig that you played the troubadour my\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.760\nbrother and I came but the headliner was some like like some young teeny\n\n01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.560\nbopper band and I texted you afterwards and and I was like those people couldn't\n\n01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:11.200\nfollow you because like you and a bunch of kind of old dudes playing like\n\n01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:17.160\nbluegrass right cooled it and you text me back follow that mother fuckers because\n\n01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.360\nthey couldn't fucking follow it because I you pick like like local musicians and\n\n01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.880\nstuff and everybody just fucking after this so this ends in December this\n\n01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:31.080\npodcast yeah so could we have a podcast where you just compliment me yes that's\n\n01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:38.200\nwhat is it here's a more here's a more refined question I want to know everybody\n\n01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:44.320\nyou want to use the restroom curious about with musicians in general and I'm\n\n01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.560\nsure all their answers are different but I'm just because at the end of the\n\n01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.600\npipeline we hear songs they're two minutes three minutes four minutes they\n\n01:13:52.600 --> 01:14:02.880\nhave five minutes all right six minutes seven minutes eight minutes nine\n\n01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.960\nminutes I'm curious about the process of like the relationship with like what\n\n01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.800\nthe end product is like does a musician or you yourself like what do you is it\n\n01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.600\nlike God ask a question ask him a question I think what I think what\n\n01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:25.800\nis asking no I think what it I will say like my friend Jim Valio it says talent\n\n01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.680\nis the thing you can't do and so like I'm speaking for Daniel but like for me\n\n01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.360\nlike I listen to that I just it boggles my mind I don't know how you could do it\n\n01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.400\nand how you could write it that's why I wonder like how do you what how do you\n\n01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.840\ndefine like when something becomes a song like do you do you do you go are\n\n01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.360\nyou like sitting in bed and you're watching Succession on HBO and then\n\n01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.120\nyou're like very good thing fuck I got a song in my I got to go down I only got\n\n01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.000\ntwo hours left to finish this song just acting like if I stop asking the\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.840\nquestion you're gonna have just a fountain question yeah I'm working on it\n\n01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:08.040\nman here's my question I got a question for you because it's so your work has\n\n01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.880\ngot to be so self-motivated you know and like I sort of even chose in TV because\n\n01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:21.000\nyou have yeah wait it's that modern dance oh shit dance having a heart attack\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.400\nwhat is he doing what is going on\n\n01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.920\nhe's having a stroke what the fucking no I think I know I think I know what Dan\n\n01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:45.400\nis asking I can't believe but so I've chosen a field where there's always a\n\n01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.800\ngun to my head seriously and do you just do you you don't have that answer the\n\n01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:55.160\nquestion Robbie do you how often do you write songs how often do you write\n\n01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:05.960\nsongs how often your race that's a song Robbie write a song Robbie write a\n\n01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:21.280\nsong okay that's you that's a Harmontown second yeah not often enough he did\n\n01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.080\nleave his phone though yeah oh good there's a good chance Tina Fey's numbers a good\n\n01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.920\nbit that he left he actually left but that's that's it's hard to question\n\n01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.920\nsomebody out of the room I mean I even for like wait did he really leave what's\n\n01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:43.120\ngood I hope no I'm kidding I would have want to be subjected to that yeah a\n\n01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:50.320\nculture was created during the question of like Robbie come back it's hard to\n\n01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:58.680\nexplain to the listener what Dan did in that moment it was it was almost like it\n\n01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.280\nwas almost like a man dancing with a strobe light over it's I know we saw\n\n01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.800\nmoments of poses and emotions were definitely coming through it's very\n\n01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.120\nemotional it's what the evil teacher does in fairly odd parents when he says\n\n01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:21.880\nfairy god yeah I'd had some of that it has some of that I haven't seen that he\n\n01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:28.960\ndoes these poses various ones all right so I think you should go ahead continue\n\n01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.840\nthe question I mean I because well why not why not finish the question well\n\n01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.120\nnow I'm just curious what difference this is what I want to know from musicians\n\n01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:45.920\nall the time is like when like how does the like how does the brick that that is\n\n01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:50.480\na song like how does it get generated like what do you mean by the break like\n\n01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.920\nwhen does he know he's done or when does he know he's onto something do they\n\n01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.400\ngenerate music by the yard and then do they like cut here and there and go like\n\n01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:02.360\nokay there's a song or do they like generate it in a pile or do they is it\n\n01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:08.800\nlike a baby like it's like three minutes of oh you know if I could if I can\n\n01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:16.680\nanswer for Robbie I think you're gonna have to no I think I do think there's\n\n01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.880\ndifference between playing music and writing music because it takes three\n\n01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.800\nminutes to play three minutes of music right okay I follow you right where it's\n\n01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.120\nwhat we do usually takes a lot longer right it's like improv you know like you\n\n01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.360\nknow how long it takes to make six minutes of improv six minutes right but\n\n01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.560\nwriting a song is a whole different thing I mean do you wait for inspiration\n\n01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:43.200\nor do you use yeah exactly start ask him that if he comes I'm not like a great\n\n01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.040\nquestion do you wait for inspiration or do you just approach it like okay I'm\n\n01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.720\ngonna see what comes out of me yeah I know it's a great question God I wonder\n\n01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:59.360\nwhy Rob why do you look so pissed what's that Rob looks very pissed no I'm just this fucking chair sucks\n\n01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:08.320\nokay hurts if you sit here long enough right right sorry I'm sorry what there's\n\n01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:14.360\nno back support there's no back support okay cool all right so if I don't so\n\n01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.600\nlike we will we'll we'll we're making a renewed vow to work on our joint project\n\n01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.120\nyeah I think it's a great idea we'll go we'll I have an idea for it you have an\n\n01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:31.920\nidea for it well I'm not an idea but I don't have an idea for it no I my ideas\n\n01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.720\nis to make it a period piece which I'll talk to you about like 80s no like\n\n01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:46.360\nmenstruation like no no no no like like yeah like 80s or did you what was the\n\n01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.800\nfirst show you worked on was your own show right yeah you didn't ever did\n\n01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.280\nmulti cam I never you worked on the golden girls that was here I did which I\n\n01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.800\nstarted binging and it's like it's such an amazing like it was a it was good\n\n01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.560\nlearning experience did we talk about when you were on the show we did we have\n\n01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:10.240\nthe conversation where it was like how how needless it was that Sophia was\n\n01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.200\noriginally portrayed as like having had a stroke and that's the justification for\n\n01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.400\nwhy she was talking about that but that was the justification there was so much\n\n01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.760\nenergy put into like but your mom look she had a stroke it destroyed the part\n\n01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.280\nof her brain that censors her speech so she's a really old lady that just says\n\n01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.800\nwhatever she wants as if that needed a medical justification the one character\n\n01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.280\nyou're explaining the personality as opposed to like and then be Arthur's\n\n01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:41.120\ncharacter well you know her singulum occipital lobes fire in conjunction with\n\n01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:46.000\nher make a lesson she's an American tingling generating extra estrogen\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.560\nor getting a tripping down early on an enormous rate yeah well hey what you\n\n01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.760\nagree that it would be a bad idea every personality explained through\n\n01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:01.400\nchemistry every golden girl yeah yeah that was that was although I will say at\n\n01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:05.360\nthe time it was not a cool show to be it was great to be on that show it was\n\n01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.440\namazing learning experience and I guess I started at the end of season\n\n01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:15.280\nfour no end of season five and then I was on it through the end because in\n\n01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.680\nbinging it it seems like I felt like you could feel the show get worse no because\n\n01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:25.040\nit kind of I mean it did you know what happens if you start using the tricks of\n\n01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.200\nthe trade well there was what I felt like I perceived was a really solid first\n\n01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.040\nseason that was undoubtedly probably a show that people probably didn't put a\n\n01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:37.160\nlot behind well now and that Susan Harris created and she was and is a\n\n01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:43.160\ngenius and it was like it just ran Sam Harris efficient then you could sense\n\n01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.160\nthe beginning of the second season the second season premiere began with like\n\n01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.480\nthe fucking ferrets and the cages in the garage or whatever and it was it was as\n\n01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.480\nif like the floodgates had opened like alright congratulations you got season\n\n01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:00.560\ntwo now here's the thing we got so-and-so coming in he used to show run no\n\n01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.680\nactually that was not the case I think it was at believe it or I was like it\n\n01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:07.640\npremiered at number one it was just one of those weird things nobody had programmed\n\n01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.840\nto older people and and nobody had programmed successfully on Saturday\n\n01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.200\nnight I guess since like Mary Teller Moore or something and it just it became\n\n01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.720\nnumber one in the country it was a huge thing although it wasn't a hip show so I\n\n01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.280\nI you know I didn't walk off of there with like a great like the guys who were\n\n01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.360\non Cheers and that kind of right but but it was it was incredible and even just\n\n01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:32.560\njust being able to see you know these four amazing actresses naked was I know\n\n01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.680\nthat was back when you were allowed to this like oh my god you're expected to\n\n01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:44.560\nyeah it was their duty it was a show of respect but what was the what was the\n\n01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.520\ntone like on set it was in season four like was there they were I think you\n\n01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.560\nmake it to season four you're allowed for I think the actors are allowed to\n\n01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.840\nactually all hate each other and but I don't think I mean I think Betty you know\n\n01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.680\nplayed to the crowd and everything and and and B was you know they didn't get\n\n01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.360\nalong great they were opposite I always thought there were opposites in the sense\n\n01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.440\nthat B was kind of scary on the outside but so sweet on the inside and you know\n\n01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:14.800\nBetty is so sweet on the outside and a little scary she she fucking put Chevy's\n\n01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.760\nnuts in a vice when she was on community like I really it was I don't really have\n\n01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:24.000\nlike a wonderful anecdote about that but it was like it was more honestly it's\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.600\nmore credit to Chevy because I think Chevy like he was it was more about him\n\n01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:33.880\nrespecting her so much that it was very easy right to kind of wither him yeah\n\n01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.480\nit was something like she just met him and she was like she said something like\n\n01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.520\nI've heard about you and I but that's okay or something just some bit that was\n\n01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.360\nsort of like and he was like what and everyone's like laughing at him and you\n\n01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.600\ncould see him be like goddamn yeah that sounds like her she's she was very\n\n01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.200\ndirect and yet you know because she's sort of fearless and she yeah that was\n\n01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.960\nalways at you know also be Arthur had to do all her scenes with Estelle Estelle\n\n01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.080\nhad memory problems which we later found out was was deeper than that and so be\n\n01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:08.400\nwould have to do her scenes 20 30 times so she was just in a bad mood yeah and\n\n01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.200\nalso there was well I'm not gonna tell that story because you make up a\n\n01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:22.000\ndifferent story yes okay no there that's I'll tell everybody off the air but\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.640\nno it was I remember when I met Betty I said said though they want me to tell\n\n01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.760\nyou they're doing a they're doing a layout upstairs and she said oh yes\n\n01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.720\nand someone took pictures and I just looked at her confused you know I mean\n\n01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.640\nshe's just she's saucy she was always big yeah there's a layout like you know\n\n01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.360\narea I was fucking upstairs was I think her her point of view okay yeah yeah she\n\n01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.800\ntold it much better but that's amazing you did not have to go through that\n\n01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.720\nbecause it was that was a great experience but a lot of the other shows\n\n01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.160\nI was on was not I mean it was I didn't it just you know you're not doing your\n\n01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.360\nvoice yeah that's I suffered for that entirely that's the thing is like if I\n\n01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.960\ncould do it all over again I spent so many years like just writing kind of in\n\n01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.080\nvain I guess it's easy to say because I know now that all the things that I wrote\n\n01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.880\nin between you know it's like they didn't go anywhere anyway so I may as\n\n01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:23.200\nwell have been in someone else's writer's room but it God DM I suffered as a\n\n01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.520\nshowrunner because I went from I was in it I was an officer and I was never an\n\n01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.320\nunlisted man right well that I mean that's true but I think I think when you\n\n01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.640\nhave a strong point of view it's show running is a whole other thing I mean\n\n01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.840\nit really is it's like it's like being a chef and then someone saying okay now\n\n01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.680\nwe've got a hundred of these to make right but understanding that if you have\n\n01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.000\n10 people that cost a total of a million dollars of the studio's money and\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.640\nthey're there to help you and that you can't actually offend them by saying\n\n01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.320\nfor instance I think we can beat this joke just things that I had to learn\n\n01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:59.080\nyeah yeah slowly and that had I come up as a staff writer I could have been like\n\n01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:04.000\non point season one and well I mean possibly I would say like the best\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.800\nthing for people who want to write and that kind of thing you know it's gonna\n\n01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.280\nsound counterintuitive but I do think when you're in those jobs and you're\n\n01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.280\ncoming up it's you want to be of service you want to be of support you know and I\n\n01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.440\nthink it is a bad impulse even though I had it say well when do I get my voice\n\n01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.520\nout there when do I do my thing I do think the experience is support someone\n\n01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.160\nyeah and and I it does give you a different perspective when you're in\n\n01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.200\nthat job and and sometimes not a better perspective because you're upset when\n\n01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.400\npeople aren't supporting you but that that's the skill yeah you don't what\n\n01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.400\nwell there's a your primary instinct is what kind of hack would I be if I told\n\n01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.320\nanother writer that what they had written for me was not good enough for me\n\n01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:49.560\nall of your training as a supposedly amazing writer tells you that's what a\n\n01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.480\nshitty writer would do like you don't tell it's uncomfortable when you're\n\n01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.320\nworking to create a field and there's a lot of people working together it's\n\n01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.880\nit's hard to it's hard to be direct about that stuff and someone recently said\n\n01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.240\nto me I was in a room and I said oh that's funny when somebody pitched\n\n01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.200\nsomething and another writer said that means it's not funny and I realized\n\n01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.280\nit's true I've just done that for so long yeah and then hope this\n\n01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:27.920\nconversation changes and then I go no wrong answers yeah yeah when wolf come\n\n01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:35.760\non all right the people but yeah it is it's just interesting to me that that\n\n01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.920\ncould be a form of selfishness when you believe that you're doing it how much\n\n01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.440\nnot communicating with other people like you think you can think that that makes\n\n01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:51.560\nyou not abusive for instance not it makes you but you right if you're being\n\n01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.360\ndirect is better being honest better other doesn't feel like it if you're like\n\n01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.960\nif you close your office door and are just like I'll just do it and they're\n\n01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.280\nlike you close the office door it's like that's a form of abuse to a like\n\n01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:08.720\nperson that's like but I don't know what I did wrong the other revelation of\n\n01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.560\nthat kind of job and I know a lot of people here are pursuing that kind of\n\n01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.760\ncareer is that you're working your way up you're trying to find your thing you're\n\n01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.480\ntrying to be funnier what if you're in comedy you try to get your pilot bait and\n\n01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.680\nthat kind of thing and then finally you do and you've got all these employees and\n\n01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.280\nyou just have no preparation to have people work for you it's just not part\n\n01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.240\nof what you've been planning you haven't been thinking I'm gonna be a manager of\n\n01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.560\npeople I'm gonna worry about their time off I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure that\n\n01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.520\ntheir feelings are okay it's just not there and oh and by the way I can't wait\n\n01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.520\nto read all their shit because that's why I became a writer I love reading yeah\n\n01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.040\nand you have to kind of make the shift that it's I mean it sounds corny but\n\n01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.560\nthat it's a privilege like you have to realize you know and it took me a while\n\n01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.400\nto realize like this is a real benefit that I get to have people that count on\n\n01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.840\nme they're happy but at first it's a it's an imposition would you put a shock\n\n01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:08.840\ncollar on your dog no do you know what part of my dog like a because they're\n\n01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:14.480\nthey're parts that would be vibration and sound collars well are you what\n\n01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:21.440\nwhat behavior are you trying to modify barking no you're just gonna terrorize\n\n01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.160\nyour dog you're not gonna teach the dog to not bark you're just gonna tear\n\n01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.600\nAmazon reviews say that's not there you go then do whatever you want I think\n\n01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.640\nyou're supposed to praise them when they're not barking so yeah constantly\n\n01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:42.720\npraise them and then when they park just be quiet Harvey I think that shit I think\n\n01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.920\na lot of people's dogs do yeah yeah that's one of the main things that talks\n\n01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.120\nto you when they're when they're not just hanging out being dogs they're\n\n01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.520\nbarking right yeah Harvey seems to be I think that he's I think that the new\n\n01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:02.600\nhouse being bigger and empty I think he's just he's he's barking more and more\n\n01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:08.160\nand it's almost like how we've talked more since Robbie left right and they've\n\n01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:15.040\ntalked about it like the dog is doing you a favor it's got a bigger space to\n\n01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:23.680\nprotect so anytime it sees anything that is foreign or dangerous oh shit it's\n\n01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:28.440\nalerting it so they love this point you're making yeah they love this point\n\n01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.080\nyou're making you're right it is it's an he's protecting the family yeah\n\n01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:41.520\nRobbie and I just made love in the green room what you forgot your phone Tina\n\n01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:51.880\ncalled yeah she does not appreciate the dick pic that Rob sent Dan do you know\n\n01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.720\nany country songs that you can sing or any folk songs I mean we have an\n\n01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:00.840\nopportunity here for like we you can sing whatever you want oh my god this\n\n01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:07.880\nguy is still in here yeah country songs like existing country song also\n\n01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:11.920\nhilariously I probably the sales might have been down on this but Robbie made\n\n01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:18.280\nlike how many years ago did you make the Michael Jackson cover album what you\n\n01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:22.720\nmade a Michael Jackson cover it's all covers and he's your your your version\n\n01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.160\nof man in the mirror is fucking outrageous it's really good but now\n\n01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.360\nprobably not so big on the charts well it's good to take it from him you know\n\n01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.320\nit's like let's do different versions of all this stuff and then we could\n\n01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.840\ndisassociate it with Michael Jackson that could be good go go out and check it\n\n01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:44.840\nout what's the record called it's called happy it is are you a Willie Nelson\n\n01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:50.800\nfan sure yeah I mean who would say no no fuck Willie Nelson but like yeah Willie\n\n01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:57.120\nNelson reminds me of my parents getting along like it was like a like when they\n\n01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.480\nweren't fighting they would they would put on a Willie Nelson album and then you\n\n01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.640\nknow Southern Comfort on the rocks and a fireplace going and it was like Willie\n\n01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:11.960\nNelson so I guess those are the only country songs that I like like which one\n\n01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.720\ndo you think you know some of the words blue eyes I know I know some well is it\n\n01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:19.680\nyou pushing for that because you're like your fingers are can't wait to because\n\n01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.000\nI know that one that one I don't know your babies I'm like like well there's\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.360\nthere's the two cowboy ones mom like I think it's like the two that are the\n\n01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:34.800\nurban urban cowboy right now electric horseman soundtrack Robert Robert\n\n01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.600\nRedford and Jane Fonda that's just a camel mama's don't let your babies grow\n\n01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.640\nup to be cowboys and then what's the other one that's cowboys looking back on\n\n01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:46.560\nthere I don't know I think it's like a little Willie Nelson soundtrack like red\n\n01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.840\nhead strangers on but there's what's the other cowboy Willie Nelson song where\n\n01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:56.000\nit's like there's another one that's like cowboys fucking what'd you say\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.240\nponcho lefty no I feel like it's like almost like you hear this titles and\n\n01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.000\nyou're kind of like didn't you already do that song it's like one's like mama's\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.600\ndon't let your god damn it there's another one that's like cowboys do this\n\n01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:13.280\nor that and they don't do that and the cowboy rulebook yeah I think that's what\n\n01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:19.840\nit is the cowboy rulebook yeah why don't why don't we write the cowboy rulebook\n\n01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.840\nsong right now okay but I'll have Willie Nelson you're gonna listen brings you\n\n01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:29.640\nthe cowboy rulebook these are the rules of the cowboy\n\n01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:47.440\ncowboys never wear blue jeans whoa after Labor Day when there's rattlesnakes\n\n01:33:47.440 --> 01:34:01.320\nborn cowboys never drink whiskey outside a saloon with no Wi-Fi because they\n\n01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:17.920\nnever want any forlornness these are the rules for cowboys these are the rules\n\n01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:26.560\nevery cowboy you yeah never never has the rules yeah no you got the idea\n\n01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:38.400\ncowboys are always riding around with the horsey if two cowboys meet the one\n\n01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:52.160\non the left has to dance that's not the end if three cowboys join up in a\n\n01:34:52.160 --> 01:35:01.480\nmarket they have to have a quorum if there's 11 cowboys or less there can\n\n01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:16.240\nonly be three pants any carpet a cowboy walks on is now magic that means it can\n\n01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:27.160\nlift up to four cowboys in its weight if you go to a restaurant with more than\n\n01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:38.760\nseven or cowboys you have to give the cowboy to your right half your plate\n\n01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:50.480\nokay cowboys these are the rules these are the cowboy rules these are the\n\n01:35:50.480 --> 01:36:02.080\nrules the cowboys have to follow boys when the cowboys come home they got a\n\n01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:20.240\nrule book but cowboys always follow I think that's I think that's the I hope\n\n01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.200\nWillie Nelson doesn't hear that because I'll think I was doing here as in\n\n01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:36.200\nFord or David Duchovny so when you write a song like that down Dan do you what's\n\n01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.000\nyour process down when you're a musician you're writing a song like that\n\n01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.400\nfirst I'll hear something in the shower like is the radio on and they'll be\n\n01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.320\nlike no that's my heart\n\n01:36:48.320 --> 01:37:00.360\na lot of songs like oh I found a great title of a song and I'm gonna write the\n\n01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.560\nsong around that title like do you ever do that like the dude you think of like\n\n01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.640\noh that should be a song that phrase that I heard I just thought I've ever heard\n\n01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:18.440\nlike Schitt's Creek yeah absolutely yeah right yeah that's I think that's the that yeah that's the country way it's\n\n01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.820\nstart with a hook with a title and I kind of work around that that's just like\n\n01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:34.160\nTV writing in a way is it I want this episode to be called an evening to\n\n01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.300\nremember that's often like an NBC mid-season show kind of thing it was\n\n01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:45.360\nevery you could expect like six shows that were like swipe to the left okay\n\n01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:53.580\nthat's six and that's the hip show yeah it was always like sex sexting OMG but\n\n01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:56.080\nyou can't complain about it because you never know which one of those is gonna\n\n01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:00.560\nbe like because there's always something on the air that's like 83 reasons my\n\n01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:06.440\ndaughter's my uncle in the future I like how did that what they didn't expect that\n\n01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:11.680\nto go more than 11 there's like yeah here we are back up plan just no wrong\n\n01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:19.080\nanswers in TV do you do you here's no wrong answers do you do you give\n\n01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.680\nyourself an assignment or do you just wait to see what comes to you do you\n\n01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.440\nwill you say like all right this weekend I really want to at least put something\n\n01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:31.080\ndown well to be honest I don't like writing that well it's not fun you know\n\n01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.360\nso same page I'll wait for a reason you know with you dad no yeah what do you\n\n01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.560\nhave to you have to make your own reason in television you don't have to you\n\n01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.280\nhave a you know you got a deadline but well maybe once in a while somebody will\n\n01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:46.400\nthrow me a project or something but yeah usually it's like it's time to do\n\n01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:54.600\nanother record you know so you got to write the record hard it's hard I got a\n\n01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:59.400\nproject for you Robbie folks it's an app called cord bot I use it to make my own\n\n01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.720\nsongs while I work out and you can hit this button and it goes song-o-matic and\n\n01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.640\nit gives you a four what do they call measures you're like what is what called\n\n01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.040\nbars it for it is bar bars is probably what it is and then you hit the thing and\n\n01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:26.400\nthen it goes like C major F major those are great chords E flat a big C major\n\n01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:34.120\nfan a minor what do you think about that are you scared like John Henry

it made it up that's yeah that's two I tell you it\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.600\nreally seems to work it's a great song now you're just you're not helping Rob\n\n01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:35.000\nthat's not helping Robbie was like why is that that's vandalism what you're\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.720\ndoing like we like you're like distracting him you're like

shop yeah probation but that's\n\n01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.120\nthe real world when you write a song there's always someone who's trying to\n\n01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.880\nget in there and ruin it for you that's you see you it prepares you yeah that's\n\n01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.560\nwhat I do yeah it's always there's always gonna be a counter to create a song\n\n01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.960\nwith a legendary song the song Robbie your song fuck this town is that based\n\n01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.360\non actual like like autobiography of being in Nashville yeah it is Jeff fuck\n\n01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:20.040\nthis town we were driving along and like people I see town in Nashville like\n\n01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.080\nit's kind of a folksy saying it's a city you know they're always saying this\n\n01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.400\ntown and we're driving along a bunch of songwriters and in the 90s wherever\n\n01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.080\nsomebody goes oh it's a five-year town national we gotta wait be patient it's a\n\n01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.760\nfive-year town somebody goes well the town is really and I was in the back I\n\n01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:41.560\nsaid like hey fuck this town so that's a good song title it is yeah wait fuck it\n\n01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.600\nin the end fuck it up and fuck it end to end fucking end to end yeah yeah fuck it\n\n01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.120\nup and down up and down that's very punk rock so what is the given given that\n\n01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.600\nthe attitude but it sometimes you do have to get angry well that's true I\n\n01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.960\nmean I really like a question I have a country Western is like what what are\n\n01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.920\nthe things that demarcate because we there's been controversies lately where\n\n01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:08.320\nit's like a hip-hop guy like the content of his rap was like him riding on a\n\n01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.540\nhorse or whatever and then they were like oh that's not eligible for what\n\n01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:17.200\never it's like what is the I'm assuming the answer is it's not definitive but\n\n01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.920\nlike in your mind what makes the difference between the genres of music\n\n01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.880\nlike what is country Western that separates it is it about musical like\n\n01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.920\nseriously yeah like is it an engineering answer what is what is the\n\n01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:35.760\ndefinition of country Western I agree like it obviously we hear it you can\n\n01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.800\ntell you're mocking my question so that's why yeah so I'll tell you what I\n\n01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.160\nthink I I think I'm a little bit divorced from what's been going on in\n\n01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:47.920\ncountry music for the last oath 25 35 years I'm not real up on it but I think\n\n01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.760\nit's like still connected to what it was in the sense that it's kitchen sink\n\n01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.760\nsongs it's like universal subjects it's like you know it's like\n\n01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:00.280\nmicroscoped down to the level of the the family and the and the you know a\n\n01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.520\ncouple individuals in a house trying to get along things like that and and I\n\n01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.160\nthink it does that better than stories about that in simple language better\n\n01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:16.560\nthan any other genre maybe a song of yours are like you have a lot of upbeat\n\n01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.440\nhappy songs but you've got some very like really lonely sad songs like for\n\n01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.600\nguidance about great singing excuse me yeah everybody in country music you\n\n01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.480\nhave a fucking range like you can sing real high and like you got a big ass\n\n01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.960\nrange you can't hide your voice there's nowhere to you know you're right in\n\n01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.880\ncenter there's a song like for listeners to go check out as a forgotten but not\n\n01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:42.040\ngone that that song is sad as fuck but I love it it's really like lonesome and\n\n01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:49.120\nthank you this podcast needs more compliments but you also need to
