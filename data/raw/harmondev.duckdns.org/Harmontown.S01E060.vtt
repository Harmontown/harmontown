Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hollywood, California, and the world-famous Meltdown comics.

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
And the even more famous Meltdown Theater with a vodka and ice are brought with great and long.

00:32.000 --> 01:00.000
Harmon Town is in session one more time. Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
I watch season four.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
Jake, Sinora, Jake, Sinora.

01:16.000 --> 01:25.000
I guess I already knew this, but apparently I'm quite a genius.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
Not a fan?

01:32.000 --> 01:45.000
I think I feel pretty comfortable expressing any kind of, not my cup of tea about it, because this has been expressed a thousand times over.

01:45.000 --> 02:02.000
It's obviously not somebody doing what they do and trying really hard to make people happy. It is very much like an impression and an unflattering one.

02:02.000 --> 02:22.000
It's just 13 episodes. I feel like I'm going back to work tomorrow morning and I just feel like, do I talk like that?

02:22.000 --> 02:32.000
It's weird to think about the fork in the road before one in this situation, a situation which is very unique.

02:32.000 --> 02:53.000
The weird thing that keeps eating at me is there's a system in place that's winning, because I would have had too much leverage, too much power, too much salary as would have a lot of writers coming into season four.

02:53.000 --> 03:10.000
They replaced us with two guys, didn't know what they were getting into, went to Comic-Con, saw what was going on, people dressed as spacemen and bananas and shit, and going, holy shit, I cut myself every night and watch community, and they went, fuck.

03:10.000 --> 03:24.000
They tried their best and I think that was the best idea, not the best idea as it turns out, but the most admirable kind of impulse was like, let's not let these people down.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
If there's anything else we do, let's not let these people down.

03:29.000 --> 03:40.000
Now you go back and I go, okay, well, watching that season, it's like I have such an impulse to just do the show that they probably got hired to do.

03:40.000 --> 03:54.000
They could have just done a sitcom set at a community college and people would have gone like, what about paintball? What the fuck? What about chicken fingers?

03:54.000 --> 04:03.000
But then five episodes later, regular people would have been like, oh, this is a pleasant little show set at a community college, and they would have beaten me.

04:03.000 --> 04:13.000
The system would have won. I would have just crawled in her bridge and pooped in a bucket and just died, which is my worst nightmare.

04:13.000 --> 04:26.000
That's why I came to L.A. is because that's how I felt in high school. That's how I felt in my parents' house. My whole life is just me trying to get people to stop going gross.

04:26.000 --> 04:38.000
Just trying to trick them into liking me. It's just like, look, Joel McHale's saying something funny and it surprises me.

04:38.000 --> 04:53.000
But the weird thing is, you go back and it's not like writers fighting other writers is the fucking American dream in the eyes of Sony.

04:53.000 --> 05:03.000
That is what they want. They want creative people rewriting each other. They want creative people replacing each other. They want us interchangeable.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
They want us, they want to think about writing the way they think about the guy on assembly line 24 that puts the final screw in the fucking PlayStation.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
They want to think about us all that way. And I shouldn't even say they because it's an it. It's a fucking machine.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
There's not a single person that works at that corporation that isn't also thought of like that by the fucking Skynet.

05:24.000 --> 05:36.000
Like all of them, even the people that you go, oh, that douchebag, that fucking idiot, that vice president of fucking what's it, the head up his ass, dick, shit, fucking, fuckface, international.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
So I can't wait for him to get fired. They're just going to replace him with someone else.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
There's some other fucking prep school, frat ass fucking dipshit. The system just wants us all just fucking not being human.

05:50.000 --> 06:03.000
But they accidentally, you know, in the quest for to recoup their investment, they made a TV show that with a bunch of actors that make people really happy.

06:03.000 --> 06:14.000
And we got 13 more episodes. And it's like, you know, I like the idea that we've laced the opiates with just a little bit of activation, a little bit of humanity.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
And like when you watch that show, you'll maybe go out and make a show of your own or something like that.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Do you feel pretty confident in your ability to go in there and like, you know, slam dunk this next season?

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
No, no, I don't feel confident in my ability to slam dunk anything.

06:32.000 --> 06:44.000
Because I'll measure that, you know, slam dunking by my own standards. So the basket's always going to be one inch higher than I can jump because I have a weird complex about that.

06:44.000 --> 06:53.000
I want to do the best I can. But I mean, I think that, well, how does it work coming out of that season that clearly is different than it was when you were there?

06:53.000 --> 07:02.000
Like, tonally, like, your fans are going to be recognized that you're back. They're going to hear that tone again, hopefully, right?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And that will be a breath of fresh air.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah, they're going to feel my loving kisses, yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
But it won't be in the form of a fucking matrix spoof.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Like, I'm back! Look at the wire! Like, I won't...

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
That's not what I ever...

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
You should do the wire. You should do a wire spoof right out of the back.

07:24.000 --> 07:33.000
I mean, I was just, boy, man, watching those characters without me there is not fucking cool, man.

07:33.000 --> 07:43.000
It's like, just flipping through Instagram, just watching your girlfriend just blow a million...

07:43.000 --> 07:52.000
It's the worst. It is, like, all the comments underneath it. People going, like, well, season three kind of sucks. How do you know this wouldn't happen anyway?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Fuck you, fuck you!

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
Like, if on Facebook, like, if your girlfriend was with a new guy and it's like, you know, sometimes, like, Joanna and Dean are in a relationship and there's a heart icon.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
And then, like, one of your friends is like, thumbs up! Detroit likes this!

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
Like, hey, come on! Don't even trip, dawg.

08:16.000 --> 08:28.000
Alright. I left a voicemail. You guys know, you live in L.A., so you probably know this legend.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Bill Murray doesn't have, like, representation. He just has this 800 number at a voicemail line.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
So I left a voicemail for him while I was watching season four. I called him and left a voicemail.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
What did you say?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I just said, call me back.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Wait a minute. You had to preamble it with who you were.

08:45.000 --> 08:58.000
I said, my name is Dan Harmon. I created an NBC show called Community. I would like to talk to you as soon as possible about the possibility of you...

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Did you stutter that much?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Probably, yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
I didn't want to, like, try too hard or try to not try too hard, too hard.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
So I just, it probably just sounded like a robot.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
But I was just, like, today on a plane with Joel Murray, his brother, the youngest Murray,

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
and he was saying that Bill has recently done a TV guest on Something.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
And before that, it was Silver Spoon or Different Strokes. That's how long it was.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Silver Spoon was the movie that Silver Spoon was based on.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Family Ties.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Was it Family Ties?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
It was the alcoholic brother who ruined a corporation.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Is that right?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Adam Goldberg, everybody.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Adam Goldberg.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I mean, we can't verify if he's right or wrong yet.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Adam Goldberg for the sociopathic win.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I don't know.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
For the kill.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
He's Machiavellian. He doesn't care.

09:54.000 --> 10:02.000
He contributed, and I sneak out into the night, and then we'll all be like, what? There's no show called Family Ties.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
But he'll be up to his neck and puss.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
To his neck and puss.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So I left a voicemail for Bill Murray. Is there anything?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
But do you know what happens next? What's pursuant to that?

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
Bill Murray calls me back, and we hang out.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Does he have somebody call you back? Do you know how that works?

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
No. I think he's like this weird, mysterious man.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I don't know. I mean, ask the guys that made Zombieland.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I think they just called his number and left a message, I assume.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I don't know.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
I think he just calls you back and goes like, hey, it's Bill Murray.

10:47.000 --> 10:55.000
I don't know. I know it's not going to happen to me, but it's like, I think it was a healthy exercise because I was watching the Jeff Meets His Father episode.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Of course, I always wanted Jeff's father to be Bill Murray.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
I kept putting off the meeting between Jeff and his father because I kept hoping that somehow fate would allow for that.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
To be the case, I named him Jeff Winger. His last name was Winger after Bill Murray's character in Stripes.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
I just always thought that Jeff Winger's dad would be Bill Murray.

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
But there's something awesome about having any all of those preconceived notions kind of ripped away from you.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It's exciting.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
How much for that fuck, Jeff?

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
There's something awesome about being held down and watching your family get raped at a beach.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
It's liberating.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
It makes you focus on what's important.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
Happy Father's Day, by the way, everybody.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Did you call your dad today?

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, I called my dad. Erin was calling her dad, so I had nothing to do.

11:56.000 --> 12:07.000
My dad, one of the coolest things about him is that he knows how to do a quick surgical Father's Day call.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
He's wanting to get off the phone as soon as I am, no sooner, no later.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
Erin's dad will just hang up on her, which is a weird fantasy we all have.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
I wish my dad wanted to talk less, but her dad is like...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Because she goes on and on?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
No, I'm sure she does.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
Erin's dad, by her report, has this weird phone behavior that is similar to people in TV and movies.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It's the way they never say goodbye or hello.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
They just go, okay, well, I'll see you then.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
And he just hangs up on her all the time.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
You can ask her about it later.

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
My dad, because it is Father's Day, I talk so much sometimes when I'm talking to a microphone,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
because a hamster that knows which lever gives him a treat.

12:56.000 --> 13:06.000
I know that my parents were 70s hands-on parents, and I know that it's such a fucking button you can push to make people go,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
oh, that's so cool, your dad hit you once.

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
And I think all of our parents, we're dicks, and the thing about being a parent is that it's a thankless fucking job.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
If you're doing it right, it's thankless.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
I think everybody in LA and everybody in our generation probably is starting to realize that there's an epidemic

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
among generation acts of parents who try to be their kid's best friend,

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
try to be perfect, and we're all seeing how those kids are turning out.

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
Parenting, when you atone with the father, as Joseph Campbell would say, you become an impersonal cosmic force.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
You make it sunny, you make it rain.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
The kid is never really going to do anything but complain when it's raining and do nothing when the sun is shining,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
and your best reward is that they grow up into a human being and they go out in the world,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
and they're not, you know, we're human beings.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
How often do you, in the midst of your awesomeness, do you stop and go,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
good thing my parents were born?

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
You're all about yourself, and you're on your own little adventure,

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
and your parents at best are like, you know, you remember fond things about the warm little cuddly memories,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
or them just hitting you with a belt.

14:18.000 --> 14:30.000
But my dad, I will say, because it takes too much longer and it's not as easy to say,

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
like, holy shit, my dad was awesome, like in very, very specific ways.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
Your father, if you're lucky enough to have one, like, is the first guy you meet.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
He is your male role model.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
That means that the way that he treats women is, it's not necessarily how you're going to treat women,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
but it is the first instance of a man treating a woman some way that you witness.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
And I think I owe all of my fights with Aaron to kind of like the fact that I found a woman

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
that has a semi-compatible understanding of how a man and a woman fight constantly.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
And we enact these dramas and all this stuff.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
But if you go to enough therapy, you can wipe that out, you can recondition yourself.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
As I've always said, Hitler's dad didn't kill 12 million Jews,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and if Hitler had a son, he wouldn't kill 3 million.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
It doesn't work that way.

15:23.000 --> 15:31.000
It's just, you know, anyone can be different from how they were raised or who they were raised by.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
But the stuff that works, like, because there's no reason for you to overcome it,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
that's the stuff that really counts.

15:39.000 --> 15:47.000
I think my dad's, like, the coolest thing about him was he was just a self-made man.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
And he just, and he never, he wasn't like Rodney Dangerfield and Taddy Shack.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
It wasn't like, fuck you, society.

15:56.000 --> 16:08.000
He was so low-born, my dad, that he never even got the cockiness to do it out of spite.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
He only just, like, knew that no one would ever help you unless you helped yourself.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
And every time, you know, every piece of wisdom I ever got from him,

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
while I watched him earn the money that we used to buy our food,

16:23.000 --> 16:31.000
it was all the messaging that went into my brain about what a man's role is in this world

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
and within his family was very, very strong positive messaging

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
because my dad was a bootstrapper.

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
And just, like, died in the wool, fuck rich people, fuck kissing ass.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
My dad said, I interviewed him for a sixth grade project.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
I was like, interview your dad, and ask him 10 questions or something.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
And I asked, I was a little sixth grade journalist,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
and I interviewed him in the basement where he would hide and make stained glass

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
and try to forget about how much his dad hit him.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
And I, you know, he would always wear this V-neck Hanes t-shirt

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
with a Sharpie pen, like, clipped to the collar

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
because he would, you know, he would just take the Sharpie pen

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
and, like, mark it all over the place.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
I know that I'm also famous for sticking the Sharpie pen up my ass.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's really not related, I don't think.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
It smells like origin story.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
It's certainly in the hands of a Christopher Nolan,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
like, this is starting to come together, yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
But my dad, I remember my dad sitting behind this desk in this dark basement

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
while I sat there and tried to fulfill the obligations

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
of this elementary school interview project.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
And I said, what's your advice to young people?

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
And my dad said, don't kiss anyone's ass.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Don't do it.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
For the rest of your life, everyone will always tell you,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
pick your battles, kiss a little bit of ass,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
and then you get to stop kissing ass later.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
It's a lie. They all just want their ass kissed.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
They think that if they tell you that,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
they're going to get to kiss less ass, too.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
It's all garbage. It's all bullshit.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
You have to just do everything yourself.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
That's pretty spicy stuff for a sixth grade project.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, but he didn't, you know, in that regard, he didn't...

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
He wasn't kissing your sixth grade teacher's ass.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
He wasn't kissing my ass. He wasn't talking down to me.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
He wasn't, like, sugarcoating it.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
He's talking to another little guy.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I think in a lot of ways my dad was, you know,

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
like, I can clearly see sometimes when I talk to his biological mom about his childhood,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
you think about your dad as a child.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Like, that's the atonement with the father,

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
when you realize that your dad was once an animal out there

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
trying to figure things out.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I remember talking to his mom about...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
She told me this story about how my dad

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
and the trailer part they grew up in.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
He loved money because they didn't have any.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
He didn't love it like Scrooge McDuck loves it.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
He loved it like the monkeys in 2001 love a monolith.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
He'd have, like, six single dollars,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
and he'd keep them in a coffee can,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
and he would iron them and wash them

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
and stack them up and count them,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
and he kept them in a coffee can

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
and then had a special spot where he buried them

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
because he wouldn't keep them in the trailer where he lived

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
because that was less safe than burying it like an animal

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
because of the guys his mom would bring home.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
So he had buried treasure.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And then at some point, I think someone got wise

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
and probably saw him.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
I think I told my dad the story and my dad was like,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
no, that was that fucking guy.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
My dad knew who dug up his coffee can.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And my dad was all...

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
His mom was telling me this story when I was in my 20s

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
and I was like, holy shit, my dad was like a little guy

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
with a coffee can of dollars that got taken from him.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
He was bullied. He was up against all odds.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
My dad survived the polio epidemic.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
He walks with... One of his legs is withered

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
because so many of his peers,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
they got wiped out in this epidemic in the 50s.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
But he survived it, but it cost him a bunch of muscle tissue

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
in one of his legs.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
He's this kind of burly guy with these Popeye forearms

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
and this big red mustache and he walks with this limp.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And the limp somehow always made him more foreboding

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
than if he walked like a regular guy.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
What was your phone call like today?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It was dumb, boring.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Fuck that guy.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
No, no, no.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
No, it's just, it's terse, you know?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
My dad and I...

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Like, I remember...

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
I remember being in my 20s

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
and being back in Milwaukee for some reason

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
and my...

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
I took a tour with my dad of this facility.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Here's the thing about my dad.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
My dad was the video duplication king of the Midwest.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
He started out mopping floors at a film lab in Milwaukee

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
and it was sort of like the Boogie Nights thing.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
There was this new thing called VHS that started happening

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
and my dad told his boss, like,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I think that VHS is going to probably make a lot of this stuff obsolete.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
All of this, like, film duplication that we're doing,

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
these slides that we're making for people who have cooking instruction videos

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
or whatever, like...

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So, and his boss was like,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
eh, come on, you know, whatever, like celluloid.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
Who will ever defeat that for the transmission of information?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
And my dad started his own company,

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
which meant that he took two VCRs and hooked them together in my bedroom

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
and duplicated a tape ten times for one client

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
that needed, like, a how-to-make-bread video duplicated or something.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Got enough money to buy two more VCRs

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
and then he rented a small office space and had two racks of VCRs

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
and was siphoning clients off of this company that he used to work for

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
because they're all going, oh, shit, VHS, this is where we're going.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
And so my dad started that, wrote that way,

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
started his own business, like, ended up having, like, 50 employees

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
and a big building and making his own, you know, VHS tapes

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
and, like, a part of the building, like, really just, like, did it, you know,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
like, took that business to its peak, sold it to his biggest competitor

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
who was, like, the video king of America,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
and then, just as DVDs came along.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
So there was a guy that worked for my dad

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
who started his own business after my dad sold his.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
He had a DVD duplication facility.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
And I was back in Milwaukee and I walked around with my dad

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
and this guy, who was basically my age,

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
but he was this guy that had worked for my dad for years

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
and the guy was showing him the DVD duplication facility

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
that he had created, this little ragamuffin, kind of, like, six-employee kind of operation

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
and my dad was looking around and he got the whole tour and he went,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
huh, yeah, it's a pretty good operation you got going here.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
And the guy said, yeah, I learned from the best

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
and I fucking, my eyes involuntarily started squirting water

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
and my heart, like, it's called crying, then.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Look, water is leaking from their eyes.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
It's called tears. It is a symbol of their weakness.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Ming the merciless.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
Because I realized, oh shit, God, this guy that came home at 10 p.m. every night,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
he was fathering people that it was easier to father.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
It was basing it on, like, what do you do?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
And do you do it well?

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
You didn't cry because you were proud of your father.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
You cried because you were, like, he had other surrogate children?

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
I cried because I suddenly, I just did this flood of realization.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
It was like, when you're a kid and your dad goes to work

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
and your dad works that hard,

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
you think of work as being a beetle juice void outside the door

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
where there's sand worms and time doesn't exist out there.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
And in that moment, I suddenly, it was like a sitcom epiphany

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
where it was like, oh no, work was family.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Work was young men who looked up to him

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
and who were, he was able to connect with

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
because they weren't his sons.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
And they looked at him as an important man

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
and tried to impress him and regarded his favor as worthwhile,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
whereas he had a much more complicated, messy relationship

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
with the guy that was generated from one of his loads.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
How are we ever going to have that traditional father-son relationship

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
when work was what meant everything to him?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
And then cut to him coming to LA for the first time

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
and it was back when Channel 101 had just gotten a pilot on VH1

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
and we were all hanging out in a bar, all these Channel 101 kids.

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
And my dad, I walked him out to his car after he spent that time.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
You met him that night at the bar.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And it was like, we were just celebrating the fact that, oh god, we got,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
we're going to do a sketch show that's based on Channel 101.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
We've been doing this thing for no money forever

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
and now we're going to do a couple episodes of this thing

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
on this basic cable show and station.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
And then we went out to the car and my dad was like,

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I can't remember what he said.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
He's like, oh, that's pretty impressive.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Got a lot of people in there and they look up to you a lot.

26:11.000 --> 26:19.000
And I was like, yeah, well, I mean, I just wanted to be you.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
That's all I understand a man to be.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
And I just hugged him.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
When you asked the question, how was the phone call for Father's Day,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
it was like, it's nothing.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Have you eaten any deviled eggs lately?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Yes, I have.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
They're good.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
They're so deviled.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I got to go buy.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
It's not even like there's a well of emotion pushing against the dam.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
It's just like, it's never, that's not the channel through which

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
my admiration for him, my connection with him is ever going to exist.

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
That unconditional weird mammalian love where it's just like,

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
oh, my dad took the fishes, showed me how to throw a ball.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
My dad was crippled.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
He didn't know how to throw a ball.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
He was a nerd like me.

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
But it's technical.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
There's so much love there, so much importance, so much aberration,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
but it's going through channels on the circuit board

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
that are not designed to carry that signal.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
You're putting hugs through a fucking fiber-optic wire,

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
but the stuff is getting through there, and then sometimes it's, I don't know.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
How old is he now?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
30.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
He also invented time travel.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I buried the lead on this.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I don't know, he's probably 60.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm a bad son, I don't know.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I don't know what color his eyes are, I don't know.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
My dad, he was the super dad, he was 40 or 41 when he had me.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
I've always known him, he just looked like George Clooney

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
with salt and pepper hair, and he could throw.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
He taught me how to throw a fucking curveball

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
when you weren't allowed to in Little League,

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
because it was bad for your arm, which is why my right arm is no range of movement.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I can scratch the back of my head with my left arm,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
and my right arm doesn't do anything,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
because I could throw a wicked breaking ball as a child.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
They found out that throwing balls is bad for kids' arms?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
They said that you're not allowed to throw curveballs

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
because it's a really unnatural movement on your shoulder and elbows and stuff.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
I played tennis and stuff, but also he could fix anything, do anything.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
He was like Monpojo, he moved west from Nebraska,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
and I was just in Nebraska two days ago,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
50 miles away from the Davis farm where he was born in between two towns,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
and they really moved during the Dust Bowl,

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
and he farmed beans and hops and whatever grew,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
and he went to Oregon, then came down to California,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
and then by the time he was a teenager, he had hit a car,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
and he went to the Korean War and then came back,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and he was like this really groovy Californian guy,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
but he could build and do anything.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
He's like a fuck-off artist.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
He could draw or paint, sculpt, anything with his hands he can do,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
engineering of any sort.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
If a horse nearby was winning, and he goes,

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
the horse is giving birth, I'll be right back.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
He's the guy that could do it.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
If the captain and the navigator and the copilot all had bad fish,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and the plane's going down,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
the fuselage of the plane would instinctively look at my dad,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
and go, that's our man.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
And he's 80 years old, but he came and saw a show

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
in Vegas with Drew Carey and the Hooseline gang,

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
and he's white hair, kind of a turtleneck and a jacket,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and he's kind of swallowing looking,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
and we just had a conversation,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
that were younger than me, my age, older than me, his age,

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
kept crossing the casino to come up to him and say,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
excuse me, I'm sorry, we have to tell you,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
you're the most debonair man we've ever seen in our life.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And he doesn't have a big mouth.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I talk too much. My dad doesn't.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
He just sits there, and looks like he could land the plane,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
and he's the fucking best.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I've met, for the podcast listeners,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
this is probably an oversimplified,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
but just so you have a visual,

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
like Jeff's dad, kind of like J. Peterman from Seinfeld.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
But we were kids, we were in Maui on a vacation,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
and someone yelled on the beach like,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
there's a woman out there, she's drowning.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
There's an old lady that got swept up in the curtains.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
She was just floating out there.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
There was a dead woman out there,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
and I just remember that moment,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
or if people just look around,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
what are we gonna do?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And then, before you can even look back,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
my dad is out there, and he pulls her in,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and he's giving her CPR, she was dead.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
It was like, there was no helping it.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
But it was just like, my memory of my dad is like,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
he could fucking do anything.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
If this room caught fire, we'd all sit here and go,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
oh Jesus Christ, we're gonna die.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
But if my dad were in the room,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
and you hadn't seen him yet,

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
so there he is. And my dad would look around,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
and he would stick his tongue out slightly.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
His tongue would go out a little bit,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
and that meant, I'll fix it.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
And I told my dad years ago,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
he's a stoic, he's working class,

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
he's a hard worker, and he's not really emotional.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
My mom is really emotional, I'm more her emotionally.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
I cry watching you talk about your dad right now.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I'm the first one to cry.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
My dad is very stoic, but not in a tough, fast way.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
He keeps it in.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
And I told him one time, I wrote him a big card

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
to say how much I love him, and I'm gonna start crying.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I warn you already.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I'll try not to, but I wrote him this big card,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
it's like, no fuck, this is stupid.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I'll just call him, so I called him up,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
and told him how much I loved him, how much I looked up to him.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And he was like, what?

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
I was like, dad, all I do is brag about you.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I listen to my friends' stories.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
And I was a booger-eating turd monster.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I was two, I was two years old.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
I didn't have the word power.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
You were back then a booger-eating turd monster.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Now you're a hero.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I told him, I said, compared to my friends' dads,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
you heard these stories, these conflicts,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
and these battles, and the distance and stuff.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I said, if I grow up to be like half,

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
or like a third of the man, a third of the father,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
if I had a third of your work ethic,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I'd be the coolest person in the world,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
like currently, like other than you.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
I could smash a third of the pus.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Oh, yeah.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
My dad got drunk one time, were you there?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
We went out and had drinks one time,

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
and my dad lived near Laguna Beach,

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
and Dan and I went there, and I had to take a stupid business call,

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
and I came back in, and they were like best friends.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
And my dad had a couple beers, and started telling a story

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
about the sexiest, like, getting laid story of all time.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I'd never heard it before, but the thing is,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I'd never been out with the boys,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
it was just me and like, usually family stuff.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
But he told this amazing story,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
and you also know that that's not the beginning of it.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Like, he clearly is a...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I told my dad, like, we're getting less...

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
He's a professional pus masher.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
Like, the Davises are getting less cool.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I'm the least cool, David.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
My brother's better than me.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
On the Mayan calendar, it's, yeah,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
the seventh world, it's like...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Well, I went to Nebraska, and I'm meeting people,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
and you walk down the street, and these people,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
they kind of walk tall, and they're very sweet,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
and they're very nice, and they're very focused,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
and they seem to enjoy their lives out there,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
in a way that, like, if you go to a restaurant here in LA,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
people don't like what they're doing.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
They've got to be something else.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
They're not a waitress. They're not a fucking actor.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
They're like, I don't do commercials.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I'm a film actor!

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Everybody's bigger than what they're currently doing,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
so nobody's ever fucking pleased with themselves.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And that's a good thing, too.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Ambition can be good, it can be bad,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
but it was really cool, like, being 50 miles away

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
from where my dad was born.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
My grandma told me a story, because my grandma was the coolest.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
She died, like, when she was 87, I think,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
and the smartest, funniest,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and just tough as fucking nails,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
and never had a sniffle in her life

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
until she was so old that she just, you know,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
like, I'm just going to slowly fall asleep

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
and die with a smile on my face.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
And she was the coolest.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
And she said, she made these beans.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
She made red beans.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
And I would go to her house, and the guy was broke.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I was in high school and college, had no money.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
And I would go there, and she'd always have this big-ass kettle

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
of beans in the fridge, and it was the most delicious

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
thing I'd ever had in my life since I was a baby.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I loved it, and she'd always make it for me.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And one day she's looking at me, and she's like,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
you really like those beans?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
This is my favorite thing in the world.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
And she goes, it's so funny.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It's like, I feel so bad about that.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
It's like, when I was, when your father was a little boy,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
we were, you know, we were,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
like in the dust bowl, and we were traveling,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
just our tenement farmers.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
That's all we had.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
All you had was food that you could dry and

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
put a little water on and make something out of.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
She's really good at making beans delicious.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
And he's like, we ate beans for breakfast,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
lunch, and dinner, and your father

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
loved them every meal.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
And he would come in, and he would sing a little song.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
And he would go, cuckoo beans, cuckoo beans,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
cuckoo beans, and he would do a little jig in the kitchen.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
And she would, like, cry.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Because she's like, you should be having meat.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Like, you should be eating something.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And if there was ever a chicken,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
if it was in August, that was Thanksgiving.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Because there was not going to be a chicken.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And so she's like, and she's like,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
my grandma was too old and too cool and too

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
way too stoic to start crying about that.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
She's like, yeah, I felt like a bad mom.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Like, because, you know, I couldn't believe

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
your dad liked beans that much.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
I was like, well, you fucking make really good beans.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
N-word?

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
Yeah, I want to, I actually want to,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I want to keep the touching Father's Day

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
theme going with a special guest

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
in a minute. But I also want to,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I just kind of like,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
someone did a sarcastic wolf whistle.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Ooh, Father's Day

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
episode.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
This thing's really heatin' up.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
They think Chevy Chase is coming out.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And by the way, I think it's like a,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I think it's like a post-25 thing,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
not to make a sweep, because it's like

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
a post-25 thing, not to make a sweeping

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
generalization, but I think probably this

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
audience being your demographic, people are coming

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
out on a Sunday night to a comic book store to watch

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Fat Guy that got fired and blah, blah, blah.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
Like, you're cussing on that age

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
when you're going to start

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
getting melodramatic about your parents.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
And it doesn't, I mean, honestly,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
like, I, nobody, like,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
you're allowed to think they're assholes.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Like, it's not, nothing drove me more nuts

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
than people I would complain about my family

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
and people go, yeah, but that's your family.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
That's all you've got.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I'd be like, fuck you.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Like, fuck you and

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
fuck them.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
You're better than my family because I'm allowed

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
to walk away from you and I'm going to do that

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
now because you just told me to love my family.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Like, there's

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
25-year-olds, were there

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
spankings?

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
There were, no?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
50-50?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
An eruption of, yeah, yes, as a nose.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I mean, as a...

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
There was fucking corporal punishment when we were kids.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I don't, like, now, like, you see kids,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I was on a, when I flew out through this gig,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
we were in first class and there was a woman in front

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
with a two-year-old child who's going to have

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
the ear-popping thing and the child's going to be miserable.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And we all know that. And so no one's going to be a bad,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
no one's going to go, oh, jeez,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
kid in first class, man, man, man.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Because it's small enough plain, it's going to be a crying kid no matter what.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
But the kid wasn't the problem.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
The mother was a piece of garbage.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And she was up and down and haranguing the flight staff

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
and apologizing to everybody about her kid.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
It's like, the kids, the kids too,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
you're an asshole, you're a bad mom.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And then we found out when they all got up at the end of it,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
the father and the older daughter were sitting right behind them

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
and never said a word.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
They just played it cool.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
And let this poor woman run around. I was like,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I wanted to punch me and everybody, it was the worst.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I remember flying as a kid,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I didn't cry because I knew if I did,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I would be on the fucking wing.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Like, there was, you did not,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
you were not allowed to be an asshole kid

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
when spanking was like,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
like legit.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Alright, so we have a son

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
that we've adopted here in Harmontown.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I like to think so.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
His name is Spencer, he's our Dungeon Master,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
he's our boy.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
But you know, he has a real father

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
as well, who is here tonight.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
And I was hoping he could come up

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
and we could have a little chat with him.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Andy, are you willing to come up?

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
This is Spencer's dad.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Grab, yeah.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
The father of our Dungeon Master,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Spencer Crittenden, Andy Crittenden, everybody.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
So you are,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
you are the creator

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
of the creator of,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
of Worlds.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Oh yes, I,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I did create him with a load

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
and he's so awesome.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
Worlds,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
grossest callback.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
It's amazing how little men

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
have to endure at the actual

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
inception, you know, like that.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
It's so funny because like,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
yeah, I mean, it's not so funny

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
that it's certainly not new territory

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
to tread, but it's like,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
but how much more seriously

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
we take it.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
And I don't think,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I don't think we shouldn't take it seriously.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I, I, I find,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I think that,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
like, especially when I started getting

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
into Joseph Campbell and stuff, like, like,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
the theme that kept flying off

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
of these pages to me was like, oh,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
we have lost the father-son

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
axis.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
We have, we have lost this, this, this power

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
because like, if a,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
if a father loves his son,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
fuck loves, like if a father

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
and son respect each other,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
that, that like

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
line of power, like, that you see

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
in Star Wars and stuff,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
even when the dad is a piece of

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
shit, the, the,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
it's so much more powerful than any system.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
And, and I think

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
that, I don't, I don't believe

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
in conspiracies, I don't think anybody's ever

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
deliberately done anything because I don't think any human being is smart enough

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
to do it. I think systems are smarter at doing what

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
systems do. I think systems

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
are in the process of,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
of completely, like,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
dissolving the father-son bond.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I think that, like, like, that we

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
regard much the same as that we go,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
like, oh, those towers blew up,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
like, who are those guys? Well, there are a bunch of guys

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
that could put funny things in their head, they believe

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
in God, they, oh, they think that God's going to give

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
them a snake when they die.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Everybody go to City Bank and go to

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Toys R Us and just play, play cool.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Like, we're, we,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
things that are

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
mythical and powerful and

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
special that don't have anything to do with a

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
dollar-changing hands, like

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
this system that is driven by

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
dollars-changing hands is, like,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
like, jumping on it and

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
corroding it. And that's why

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
every prom night, every, every son,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
you know, has a drunken

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
fucking wrestling match with his dad on the kitchen floor

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
because when he was

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
13, they didn't go out in the woods and

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
get circumcised on a tree stump.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Your thoughts, Spencer's dad?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Your thoughts, Spencer's dad?

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Your thoughts, Spencer's dad?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Well,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
just, just a couple thoughts about

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
his birth, if I might.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And he'll probably

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
kill me for this later, but since he brought up

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
circumcision,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
the, uh,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
when, when he was

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
born,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
he was

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
a, he was a really

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
large baby and,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
uh,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
he came out, and this was my second child,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
he came out with, like, a beard.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
No.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
A giant red testicles.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
I mean,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
these things were, like, like the size

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
of your heart. They were so big. The size of

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
my heart? Yeah, literally.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Aww, how romantic.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Which was a little bit

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
worrisome, you know.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Wait, you mean the size of an adult

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
human heart? Yeah, no, they were,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
they were like a softball.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Right. I should point out,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
so, most people in the audience don't work in the testicle

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
industry.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
The human heart is a standard unit of measure for

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
the testicle size.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Your son has three heart testicles.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
You're saying that not

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
each testicle was, was, was his own human

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
heart, the entire unit of both testicles.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Yeah, the whole sack and everything. Human heart

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
was this size.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah, so,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
the other interesting thing

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
about his birth was, um,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
his mom had a C-section,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
and so when you have another C-section,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
they don't want to cut as far.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Um, because, because of muscles

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
and everything, so they don't cut as far as

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
they did on the first C-section, and he was

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
bigger than our first son.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
And so as a result,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
he was actually

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
looking around in the world before he was

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
technically born. His head was

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
out of, out of Diane's

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
body. We got this great kind of science-fiction

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
alien baby shot.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
He's kind of just, you know,

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
you got the blood and all. This looks like

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Quacho from Total Recall.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
And he's, he's

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
just kind of looking around like,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
do I really want to come out?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
And I think

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
as we know, you know, some

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
24 years later, the answer is he probably

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
wished he had. Yeah, I know.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
He, he seems like a guy who,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
yeah, who considers all of this

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
a, a, a, a, a

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
barely tolerable interruption. Exactly.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
As he does his father, by the way.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Well, let's talk about that.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I mean, I, you know, you, you, you seem like a

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
delightful guy.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Spencer is

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
clearly a delightful guy.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
But you're his father

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
and he's your son. So, like, like,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
like what? I mean, like,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
we're in the green room and

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Spencer has that, like,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
he, he has that Spencer face,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
or Spencer lack of face on.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And you're, you're, you're sitting

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
there and you're in your sneakers and

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
you're, you're, you're, you're, you're delighted

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
and you're, you're, you're, you're funny.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Like, like, I, I'm trying, I want to

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
ask Spencer, like, like, is your dad,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
is your, is your bum that your dad's here?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Is he, is he embarrassing you? Because, like,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
kids get embarrassed by their parents,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
by default. Doesn't matter how cool they are.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Doesn't matter. Like, like, and I just,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
what's my question? I, I just,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
like, like, like, what is,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
what is it? Like, okay,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
here's my question.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I would, because

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
in my wildest dreams, I would

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
have a, if I would

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
were to have a son, I would,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I would be so relieved if the doctors

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
could show me some kind of

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
chronological sonogram and go,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
you're gonna have a Spencer.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
You know, you're gonna, he's gonna be,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
he's, he's not, he's not

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
gonna be doing pull-ups for a living.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Uh,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
he's gonna design dungeons,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
he's going to

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
be very smart and fair

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
and, and, and honest and have a high

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
IQ and, like, uh,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
uh, like, like,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
like, I would be

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
so much happier about that than if

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
they said, well, Channing Tatum

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
is gonna come out and, you know,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
he'll be great. People are gonna love him in this movie

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
and, uh, he'll be great

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
at football. Uh, but, so,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
so, and I, I, I, I kind of get

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
the vibe that you, like,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
you, but, but he's your son.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
So do you,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
is there frustration there?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Where do you...

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Well, the hardest thing about Spencer is,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
is it's hard to raise a child

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
who's twice as smart as you.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Um, you know, I mean,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
when he was, like, six or seven,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
he told us what he wanted to do for his birthday party.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
And then he proceeded

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
to organize all the kids

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
and he did, like, uh,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
he got this little Casio keyboard

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
and they wanted to play a version of musical chairs

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
and so I said, okay, let's start.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
He goes, no, dad. And he took it away from me

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
like organizing the kids

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
and doing all this stuff and, and, uh...

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Nathan will sit over there.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Yeah.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Exactly.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
The cake

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
will be shaped like a skull.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Candles emerging from its eyes

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
sockets.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Eight obelisks set a flame.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
The power

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
of my birth will be recognized.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Yeah.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
But, but he kind of had a twisted sense

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
of humor.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Don't worry about that.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
We were at the beach.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
He was in junior high and we were at the beach

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
and he got on his mind, he wanted to, uh,

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
catch a seagull.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
So, this is in Manitura somewhere.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
So how do you catch a seagull?

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Well, like any animal, you set up some food

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and so he told us what to do.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Kind of half buried himself in sand

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
and then put a towel over himself.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
And then we

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
had, like, Cheetos

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
about ten feet away leading to right

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
on top of his chest.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And, and then he waited

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
and he was very patient.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I mean, I would use a box.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
It sounds like he wanted to catch and terrify a seagull.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Well, he did.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
And, and, and I want to tell you

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
all of us humans, there's a reason

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
we have these brows here

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
because he caught the seagull

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
with the towel and wrapped it around

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
and the seagull went

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
and all Spencer could see

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
is like the seagull's throat

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
coming at his eye.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And obviously this protected his eye

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
from getting pecked out at which point

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
you realize as a parent this probably wasn't the smartest thing

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
that you could do.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
But so he caught the seagull

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
and then, then, I don't know why

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
but he had some string

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
and he tied it to his foot

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
and then he kind of flew him around like a kite

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
for the rest of the day.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Well,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
it's like

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
that scene from Game of Thrones

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
with a dragon.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Yeah, it's Spencer Joffrey.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Then you give him a crossbow

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
for his 16th birthday and

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I mean, so,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
What happened to the seagull?

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Well, we decided that

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
somebody might come along at a certain point

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
and find us after some people were

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
kind of pointing their fingers at us and stuff.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I mean, did you just let it go and hit it?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah, still got a string attached to it to this day.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Oh, probably so.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I mean, if you

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
ask Spencer a question about anything

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
it doesn't matter if you're asking about his relationship

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
with his father or the economy

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
or what we should do next week for

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
D&D or how he's feeling or what he had for lunch.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I mean, he's kind of got that

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
he's staring off

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
into space and talking like this

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
and yeah,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
yeah, my dad's here.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And it's like,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
have you ever

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I just

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
like, is it a thankless job

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
like I was describing earlier?

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Like, do you feel like, hey,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
fuck you, man, like, I'm your dad.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Like,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
be a

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
fan of mine.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Yeah, it's somewhat thankless.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
But it's hard because

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
he's right in that wheelhouse age you're talking about

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
where you see,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
you start to see a transition

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
and you know, I've been trying to get Spencer

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
to

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
move on with his life for a while.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Which he just has, he's just moved out.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Yeah, yeah, like a month ago.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I've been trying for three years but he thinks

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
he thinks it's because

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I hate him and I'm like

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
well, to me

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
the biggest value of college

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
is that you're getting out of the house

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
and learning

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
to live on your own.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
And he didn't

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
know that college he decided not to

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
because, you know, he was

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
too smart.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Well, a lot smarter than all of his teachers.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Yeah, I went to college and

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Yeah, I went to college and got a degree

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
and I say it's not all it's cracked up to be.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I dropped out, I started doing

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
getting out of your parents' house

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
was like, the thing that I needed to do

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
was go smoke two packs of cigarettes a day

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
and do stand up and drink a lot.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Like, kind of fine,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
but I don't want to get him into a roulette ball.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
You just need to get the world spinning underneath you

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
and you're just going to land somewhere

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
specific and it can't be your parents' house.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Right.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And who knows where it's going to lead.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I feel like we should get Spencer up here

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
because we need to

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
protect me.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Somebody help me!

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Somebody help me, somebody help me!

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Check, check, check, check, check,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
check, check, check, check, check, check,

50:41.000 --> 50:45.240
Check, check, check, check to the world.

50:45.240 --> 50:49.120
It's a good-looking crowd.

50:49.120 --> 50:51.000
So when did your balls, uh-

50:51.000 --> 50:54.740
Yeah, okay, I got to clear something up real quick.

50:54.740 --> 50:58.160
When I was looking around, uh, mid-birth, I wasn't like,

50:58.160 --> 50:59.960
I'm not so sure I want to come out here,

50:59.960 --> 51:05.240
I was like, hey, you guys, don't freak out.

51:05.240 --> 51:09.000
But my balls are huge.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.080
I've been watching him for nine months.

51:11.080 --> 51:17.080
I'm smart enough to know balls don't need to be this big.

51:17.080 --> 51:21.240
They went back to normal, trust me.

51:21.240 --> 51:22.240
I don't believe you.

51:22.240 --> 51:26.080
There's going to be this whole movement, like show us your scrotal certificate.

51:26.080 --> 51:30.080
Or just take your balls out.

51:30.080 --> 51:32.640
I'm behind a table.

51:32.640 --> 51:33.640
Is there anything?

51:33.640 --> 51:41.000
Meaning they're already out.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.640
I've always had my suspicions.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
Yeah, yeah.

51:43.640 --> 51:52.680
Spencer has polyhedral balls, just pointed 20 sides.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.560
You just recently moved out of your place.

51:54.560 --> 51:55.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:55.560 --> 52:00.760
You were living with your parents and now you're, and I don't know, like Spencer was

52:00.760 --> 52:03.480
working in the back of the Apple store.

52:03.480 --> 52:09.520
Now I'm bringing him on as, then this doesn't seem like a glorious upgrade, but Spencer's

52:09.520 --> 52:16.120
going to be my personal assistant as I'm working over at Community.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.320
But really I want it to be like kind of an apprenticeship because you're a creative guy

52:19.320 --> 52:23.400
and I think you have writing aspirations and certainly have writing potential.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.800
I think, I kind of trust you.

52:25.800 --> 52:32.560
Like I always have a difficulty with, like when you have an assistant, like when I was

52:32.560 --> 52:35.760
talking earlier about how my dad's in the trailer park and blah, blah, blah, don't kiss

52:35.760 --> 52:36.760
anyone's ass.

52:36.760 --> 52:39.760
Part of what comes with that is like, don't tell other people what to do.

52:39.760 --> 52:42.840
Don't be a fucking dick.

52:42.840 --> 52:47.360
You don't have it on your right, and that really gets in the way of delegating rooms

52:47.360 --> 52:51.680
full of writers and having someone get you coffee and all this stuff.

52:51.680 --> 52:54.720
You feel like you want to apologize every time you ask someone to do something, but that

52:54.720 --> 52:59.560
just makes it more uncharismatic and oftentimes you're just doing more harm than good.

52:59.560 --> 53:06.480
My point being, yeah, I mean, you're going to follow me around now, you're going to sit

53:06.480 --> 53:14.920
in the writer's room and sit there with your beard and watch me work with the writers on

53:14.920 --> 53:17.800
a community.

53:17.800 --> 53:22.900
It's a crazy trajectory because you came to Harmontown, Spencer, without telling anybody

53:22.900 --> 53:26.400
that you really felt like you should be playing D&D with Dan Harmon.

53:26.400 --> 53:31.800
Then that night, he says, anybody here, Dungeon Master, you do.

53:31.800 --> 53:36.960
You come up, you're in the show, we go on tour together, and you're a huge part of our

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
show now.

53:37.960 --> 53:43.720
We've taken him away from Andy here, he's moved out to Hollywood.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.960
But Andy was pushing that rock out the door for three years.

53:46.960 --> 53:52.560
I wish I lived where Spencer does right now, just down the street from Paramount.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.560
That's going to be perfect.

53:53.560 --> 53:54.560
Yeah.

53:54.560 --> 53:55.560
Just down the street.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.560
I'm still processing it.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.560
I guess.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.560
Wait, wait.

53:59.560 --> 54:00.560
So you've got a place.

54:00.560 --> 54:03.560
Three doors down from Paramount?

54:03.560 --> 54:05.280
Four doors.

54:05.280 --> 54:09.320
Did you foresee, did you foresee working on community like you first saw playing D&D with

54:09.320 --> 54:10.320
Dan?

54:10.320 --> 54:11.320
No, it's all just bullshit, man.

54:11.320 --> 54:12.320
It's crazy.

54:12.320 --> 54:15.400
It's, you know, Jackson is a guy who I met through Dustin.

54:15.400 --> 54:19.680
We all share similar birthdays, so we met at like a joint birthday party we had.

54:19.680 --> 54:22.960
Jackson is a guy who comes to Harmontown all the time.

54:22.960 --> 54:27.720
Yeah, and so he's a cool guy, and so we got to talking and we went to an arcade and played

54:27.720 --> 54:28.720
some video games.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.600
I mean, you know, talking, nerd stuff.

54:30.600 --> 54:35.040
This is why the moon colony is going to work, because society is going to be, instead of

54:35.040 --> 54:40.400
elections you just have shamanic coincidences.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.400
That's all it's been.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.760
And then he just, one time he was like, hey man, you should come room here.

54:44.760 --> 54:48.680
It's really cheap, and it was the first time I'd like seen any place I could move out to

54:48.680 --> 54:51.000
that was within my money.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.120
I had just gotten the job at Apple not too long ago increasing my income, but you know,

54:55.120 --> 54:58.680
still finding an affordable place was alluding me.

54:58.680 --> 55:03.360
And I've watched a lot of documentaries about cults and things, and I see where everyone

55:03.360 --> 55:06.680
gets tripped up, like cults that work.

55:06.680 --> 55:12.200
They all start with an awesome guy like me saying, hey, it's cool, man.

55:12.200 --> 55:17.000
I'm not awesome, and then everyone's like, yeah, but you are, and I'm like, all right,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.920
if you insist.

55:19.920 --> 55:23.320
And then you go and get a place like on the moon, or in Maui, or something.

55:23.320 --> 55:30.880
And the downfall is always when the old fat guy at the top that started it all starts

55:30.880 --> 55:36.800
to go, yeah, you know, and it's like, hey, you know, if you're 16 and you're a girl,

55:36.800 --> 55:41.800
you know, like, hey, ooh.

55:41.800 --> 55:49.480
And you find a rose in your pillow at night, so that means it's time for you and I to play

55:49.480 --> 55:50.480
Monopoly.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.200
Are you going to fuck Spencer?

55:52.200 --> 55:53.200
What's going on here?

55:53.200 --> 55:54.600
Where is this going?

55:54.600 --> 56:00.000
I'm making my promise to our moon colony that I will not fuck your daughters or you.

56:00.000 --> 56:07.160
I am in love with Aaron, and I will stick to the, you know, because it seems like that's

56:07.160 --> 56:11.720
the shoelace that trips every cult leader up, that when they, when they, when they, when

56:11.720 --> 56:15.440
they go like, they just can't avoid the temptation, they go like, oh, and I could really parlay

56:15.440 --> 56:17.560
this and just smash in some puss.

56:17.560 --> 56:23.400
And it's just like, it's not worth it, you know, it's, it just fucks everything up.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.400
What was that?

56:24.400 --> 56:25.880
Hey, Aaron, what was the name of that documentary?

56:25.880 --> 56:26.880
Who's that guy?

56:26.880 --> 56:27.880
The Source Family.

56:27.880 --> 56:28.880
The Source Family.

56:28.880 --> 56:29.880
Please, everyone watch.

56:29.880 --> 56:30.880
I'm not kidding.

56:30.880 --> 56:31.880
It's like laughing.

56:31.880 --> 56:43.160
Hey, it's really interesting.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.160
Aaron, just get out here.

56:44.160 --> 56:47.160
Aaron McAthe, everybody.

56:47.160 --> 56:58.080
No, no, please watch this documentary called The Source Family.

56:58.080 --> 56:59.080
It's amazing.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.880
I recommended the WikiLeaks thing.

57:00.880 --> 57:07.680
And I want to stress, I got, I got a couple of tweets from WikiLeaks impassioned people.

57:07.680 --> 57:13.800
I did not mean to imply that the documentary WikiLeaks, We Steal Secrets is somehow like

57:13.800 --> 57:15.080
the full story.

57:15.080 --> 57:22.840
I got, I got like all these tweets that were like, you know, from people that I think are

57:22.840 --> 57:27.520
probably on the right side of justice and stuff who are like, yeah, that documentary's

57:27.520 --> 57:28.520
bullshit.

57:28.520 --> 57:32.360
I always leave a third party makes a documentary about something that you're that, you know,

57:32.360 --> 57:38.040
like into the, and it's two hours long, you're going to think it should have been six hours

57:38.040 --> 57:40.920
long and should have included this and that and that and that and that.

57:40.920 --> 57:46.880
This is a two hour documentary that like tries to objectively or like, like, like concisely

57:46.880 --> 57:50.560
kind of like, like explain this like fascinating story.

57:50.560 --> 57:54.840
I never said, oh man, this is the final word on whether you should respect anything.

57:54.840 --> 57:56.080
I think systems suck.

57:56.080 --> 57:59.120
I think Julian Assange seems like an awesome fucking guy.

57:59.120 --> 58:05.480
I don't, I don't know what like how fair that documentary is in terms of how many details

58:05.480 --> 58:08.600
I've had to cut out in order to be two hours long.

58:08.600 --> 58:13.080
But anyways, I, when I recommend something, it's because it's, it's, it's like, it's

58:13.080 --> 58:15.080
interesting to watch it for two hours.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.880
So two, two more recommendations.

58:16.880 --> 58:21.800
Watch this source family documentary, it'll blow your fucking mind.

58:21.800 --> 58:24.040
It's about this cult that I've never heard of before.

58:24.040 --> 58:29.320
It's an amazing study in the, in the evolution of a cult, which is not necessarily an evil

58:29.320 --> 58:30.320
thing.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.280
Like a cult, it's just like, cults are neither good nor bad.

58:32.280 --> 58:35.520
They're just this phenomenon that spring up and happen.

58:35.520 --> 58:39.680
And, and then also we went and saw this is the end tonight at the Arclight.

58:39.680 --> 58:44.800
It's a very funny comedy movie everyone's like, I can get behind a big mainstream successful

58:44.800 --> 58:45.800
comedy movie.

58:45.800 --> 58:46.800
I was delighted by it.

58:46.800 --> 58:47.800
Go see it.

58:47.800 --> 58:48.800
Seth, Seth Rogen's back everybody.

58:48.800 --> 58:49.800
Kevin's.

58:49.800 --> 58:54.240
I felt like I was 10 years old watching Ghostbusters again.

58:54.240 --> 58:56.480
I was like, it was really, really funny.

58:56.480 --> 59:01.520
If anyone goes and sees this is the end and thinks that it's not worth your ticket price,

59:01.520 --> 59:06.880
I will, I will debate you online because I've seen a lot of shitty movies.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.880
I'm 40 years old.

59:07.880 --> 59:08.880
I'm really jaded.

59:08.880 --> 59:14.080
The last thing I'm going to enjoy is a movie about a bunch of famous yahoo's playing themselves

59:14.080 --> 59:16.080
in a screwball comedy.

59:16.080 --> 59:18.520
Like I, I, I thought it was delightful.

59:18.520 --> 59:20.520
All right.

59:20.520 --> 59:21.520
Spencer, what's your thoughts on that?

59:21.520 --> 59:22.520
Spencer, don't toe to toe with your dad.

59:22.520 --> 59:23.520
Yeah.

59:23.520 --> 59:24.520
Fight.

59:24.520 --> 59:25.520
Father's Day fight.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.520
Let's, let's clear the air.

59:26.520 --> 59:27.520
Let's clear the air right now.

59:27.520 --> 59:28.520
Okay.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.640
First of all, tell him you love him.

59:29.640 --> 59:30.640
I love you.

59:30.640 --> 59:38.640
Could we get that in more yet then?

59:38.640 --> 59:44.040
Now standing on top of a stage, Spencer is awkwardly goaded into showing affection for

59:44.040 --> 59:49.040
his paternal relatives.

59:49.040 --> 01:00:00.040
And then, uh, I, I, Spencer, you got balls as big as your heart.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.040
That's the show, right?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.040
And, and my first, that's, that's my tombstone.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:17.040
Uh, I assume your, your dad should play Kumail's character, Kumail.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040
Oh yeah.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040
That'll be awesome.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040
Yeah.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.040
Kumail, not Johnny, can't make it tonight.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.040
So.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040
Has your dad ever played D&D with you?

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040
Not to my knowledge.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.040
Oh, so this is a very special Father's Day episode.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040
It really is.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040
I did it.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:39.040
I, I really, I have a great podcast.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.640
It's just, I don't even work at it.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.840
It's just my voice, you know?

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.040
If you were to fire me, Jeff, uh, I think we would, the critics would go, something's

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040
missing, something's missing.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.040
I think something's missing.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.040
What the fuck do you think is missing?

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040
Unbelievable.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040
The outrage.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.840
Like, like, like, like, I had so much retroactive outrage, I can't talk about it.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.080
It's too uncharismatic.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.040
I just have to sit on my totally justified outrage.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:13.240
All the arguments I looked at online, I was like, well, I think season three was so shitty

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.040
that season four, it just seems like, are you fucking kidding me?

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.040
Fuck.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.040
Mother fuck you in the fucking mother fuck.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.040
Fuck you.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.040
Fuck your mother with your father.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040
Fuck you.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.040
Like, like, fuck you, man.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.040
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, you,

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.040
you, people hate me that much that they're that willing to debate the possibility that

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.040
I wasn't fuck you.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.040
Like, like, like, wow, I must be really unlikable.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040
Jesus.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.040
Well, I'd like to say, I think the key to the success of the podcast, because my wife

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:57.040
and I have discussed this, is really that your heart is as big as Spencer's balls.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.040
All right.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.040
I just got the key to the city.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:08.040
And also, I can say with almost certain lack of fear of contradiction that we have a title

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.040
for our next episode.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.040
Is it your heart is as big as Spencer's balls?

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040
Balls with big as Spencer's heart?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040
I don't know.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040
Oh, man.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:24.040
This is redundant, but you should know that everyone in the booth was crying when you were

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040
talking about your dad.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040
When I say everyone, I mean Dustin Marshall, our producer.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040
We had to cry.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:36.040
I mean, it's, well, the father son stuff is, and it's not a fake thing.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:41.040
It's like when you watch Lion King, when you read Hamlet, when you father son stuff just

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.040
like gets you, like, because there is a power there.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:52.040
I mean, like, it's almost unfair because the reason the power is there is precisely because

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.040
there's not an actual visceral connection on the level of the actual people that are

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.040
carrying the child, squeezing it out at their own peril.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:10.040
And if that child should be female, you know, the bond between, it's like us of the dangling

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:17.040
wee-wee, when you have a little wee-wee and you use your little wee-wee to make another

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.040
thing with a little wee-wee.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.040
We let us of the dangling wee-wee be your cult name.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:34.040
You know, it's like, because there is absolutely nothing, that wee-wee, that male symbol, you

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.040
know, the universal symbol for male and female, the male one is like this circle with an arrow

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040
coming out of it.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.040
I think that's so potent because it's like men are just this cursed half of the species

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.040
that have a life expectancy of, you know, what, 20 years less.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:56.040
And we lose our hair as we get older because we're riddled with this disease called testosterone.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:05.040
We don't actively create with our bodies, which life in the beginning before the development

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:13.040
of sexual reproduction, all cells were these asexual, reproducing cells.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:21.040
Like if you, all life was in the same soup and life meant creating new life.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:29.040
It meant that you were never more than one unit of life away from a thing that was actually

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.040
you in some real way.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:38.040
And then when plants were, you know, developing and trying to figure out how they could develop

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.040
faster, sexual reproduction started happening, which would carry it into a biological, what

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.040
do you call it, whatever, it was more advanced than plants.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:55.040
Like men, drones, like these things that create sperm and we just shoot it wherever we can

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040
shoot it.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:02.040
Like we kind of like walk the earth and like we're disconnected from God.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.040
And we fetishize that and we have a big murder complex about it.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:14.040
So we build skyscrapers and missiles and they could just hate yourselves and each other.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:20.040
I'm going to make a bigger hole in the world before I leave than you and I'm going to fuck

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.040
more pussy than you.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040
Because we're just nothing.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.040
It's like, I'm not saying feel sorry for men.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:36.040
It's just like, it's amazing like how we, I don't know, I lost it.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040
It's amazing.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040
Cum is amazing.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040
Happy Father's Day.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.040
May your balls be with your heart.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.040
The moralist, Dan loves cum, you guys.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040
Just take that away.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.040
I love cum.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.040
You can't throw any of it out.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.040
I love cum, Spencer's dad.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.040
Your son's coming to work for me on Monday.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.040
It's going to be great.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.040
Neverland Ranch.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.040
Alternate title, I love cum.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.040
All right.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.040
Erin, you called your dad, right?

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040
I did.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040
I called my dad.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.040
My dad actually left a Father's Day.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:16.040
My dad calls me when it's Father's Day or his birthday in the morning and leaves a voicemail.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:20.040
He left me a voicemail about Dan speaking about that father-son connection.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.040
I mean, my dad's so excited about you.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040
He wants you to be his son.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.040
So he called me asking me about you.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.040
But yeah, my dad has an adorable habit of hanging up on me, which isn't...

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.040
It's not cold.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:35.040
It's like, hey, Erin, how's it going?

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.040
Oh, it's going great.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.040
Dan and I are hanging out.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040
We're about to get dinner.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Oh, good, good, good.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
My day was good.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.040
I grilled and I hung out with a wife and I took a nap.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.040
It was a real great day.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040
And then click.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040
They're just like, hang up.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040
And they're like, yeah.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.040
Hello?

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.040
Maybe because he was in the Navy.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.040
He thinks it's like, he's just talking to the bridge.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.040
But then you say out.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:07.040
Can I play his Father's Day voicemail real quick?

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040
It's 10 seconds.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040
It's about you.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040
You can't be my phone.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.040
You know what a tight ship we run here.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.040
I hope this is nice and tidy.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.040
So anyways, yeah, sperm.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.040
All right, here we go.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.040
And my dad's also a great...

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040
He's a great guy.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.040
He's a little selfish, but he's great.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040
He's a pastor, right?

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.040
He's a pastor.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040
He's a minister.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040
He's a minister of God.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040
Yeah.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.040
He's a minister of God.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040
We were drinking a whole lot yesterday as we had to

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:42.040
because we were watching a shitty TV show all day.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.040
What season was it?

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.040
Season, season, fan fiction, heart, no heart.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040
I'm so, so sorry.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040
Remember what he said?

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.040
What Greenblatt said, we're bringing the heart back?

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.040
I'm not allowed to express it.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040
I can't do it.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.040
That's not fair.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.040
I fuck you.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.040
So we were drinking a lot right now.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.040
What heart?

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040
Where was the heart?

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040
Well, the heart.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.040
My heart.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.040
My heart is the heart.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:16.040
What about Bridget and Troy's really intimate love affair?

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.040
Did you guys see the fountain scene?

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040
The heart.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040
Love.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040
Love has never been.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.040
The heart was the size of regular baby's balls.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:34.040
The heart in that show was as moving as balls.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.040
It's a picture of balls.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040
I apologize.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040
Whatever.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
No one cares what I think about community.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040
It's no stakes.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040
No one's going to fire me from anything.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040
You're not going to fire me.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.040
You're only going to promote me if I am.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.040
Excuse me.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.040
Oh, but we were drinking and I got real emotional.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
No.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.040
We were drinking and we were talking about fathers.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.040
I've done this many times before.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:08.040
I've compared my father to Dan because he's a pastor and he has people who, he has a flock.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040
You know.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040
Right.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040
It's a whole thing.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.040
But he's also really obsessed with himself and his, how.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.040
It's not, you're not a flock.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040
You guys don't worry about that.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040
It's other people.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.040
Cut to a guy in the back that's dressed like a sheep that hangs his head and walks out.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040
All right.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.040
This is my dad's voicemail.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.040
Wait, where's the speaker?

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040
On the bottom.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040
Jesus Christ.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.040
I know I'm in trouble when Jeff Davis is telling me a technical thing.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040
All right.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.040
Here we go.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:50.040
Hey, you're in this with Dan Holland say hi.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.040
So Dan, what are you guys doing later?

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.040
It's fine.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040
I have a speaker.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:02.040
Just wanted to let you know your, your boyfriend is a fat alcoholic piece of shit and he's,

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.040
he's going to live to 48 the way he eats.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.040
It's a reference to the Chevy Chase voicemail.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040
All right.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040
Here we go.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.040
Sorry, Andy.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Hi, Aaron.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040
This is dad.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.040
I just like to give you a call.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.040
I heard that Dan got the community back again.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.040
So I just wanted to talk to you and get an update and see how y'all are doing.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.040
We'll have you.

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.040
I'll talk to you later.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.040
Bye-bye.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.040
I mean, that's his father's day voicemail.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.040
That's just a voicemail.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.040
No, I know it's just a voicemail.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.040
Aren't you supposed to be the one calling him for Father's Day?

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.040
Right?

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040
Yes.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040
Yes.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040
But you're a dad.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.040
You have to say that.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.040
By the way, you guys haven't talked about it.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:51.040
For the podcast listeners, Spencer's dad looks like, if there was a superhero called dad,

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.040
you looked like the daddest dad ever.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.040
No one's looked more dad.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Yeah, like the dad from Family Guy.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:06.040
Regular son of someone was working in the nuclear facility when an unprecedented bolt

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:11.040
of dad energies turned him into...

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.040
You have a kind face, sensible glasses, a button-up shirt.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040
That's what it's really like.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040
Do you like to garden?

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:22.040
As a friend of mine said about a kind face, the kind of face that you'd like to shat on.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040
Oh.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.040
That's just one variation.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.040
Yes, I do like to garden, actually, although I'm getting too old for it now.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.040
Vegetables, flowers?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:39.040
Well, we had a backyard which was a two-to-one ratio hill, and I spent like two years of

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.040
my life making that into a kind of a sunset garden.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.040
Since then, it's gone to seed and everything, but it was fun.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040
Right.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.040
See, and then at this point, his foes, which are the people who can't have children are

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.040
shrinking and dying as he's explaining, but that was a weird reaction.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.040
I was thinking that he was a superhero.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.040
That's a weird bit.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040
Aaron, Aaron, I'm sorry.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040
Can we hear that message again?

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.040
Because that was fascinating.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.040
I feel like I missed some of the nuance in that one.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.040
I feel like maybe we could revisit that message.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.040
I mean, maybe what we should do is listen to all of his voicemails and we kind of piece

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040
it together.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:25.040
It's meaningful to me because my dad, now my dad just talks to me about, damn, he doesn't

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.040
talk.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.040
Which is fine, but I was thinking about the father-son connection.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.040
It's true that Father's Day, I'm like, the golf clubs, I don't care.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040
I love my dad, but it's different.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.040
There's not the same thing.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.040
And then Mother's Day is, I guess Mother's Day would be more meaningful.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040
Yeah.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.040
Well, Mother's Day came first.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.040
And Father's Day, because I looked it up, because I was talking to our friend Lars from

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040
Denmark.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.540
Father's Day, there's different dates in different countries.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:01.040
If you go to the Wikipedia page, it's like a big, long, complicated list of dates.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.040
But it was an American invention.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.040
It was then just adopted, I think, throughout the globe, but on different days.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.040
Because they probably, I'm assuming that in Denmark, if we say, it has to be the third

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.040
Sunday of every June, they're like, well, that's Vaminsklingen.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.040
Vaminsklingen.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.040
You know what I do have?

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.040
Can't do it there.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.040
You know what I do have?

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.040
You know what I do have is the recording of you leaving a voicemail for Bill Murray.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040
That doesn't matter.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040
It's as unremarkable.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.040
I said, hello, Bill Murray.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040
It's Dan Harmon.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040
Give me a call.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040
3-2-3.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.040
All right.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.040
5-5-5.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.040
All right.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:41.040
So we should probably get to Dungeons & Dragons.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.040
Spencer?

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:50.040
If you would pass out the character she's to Dan, and he'll pass us along, let's get

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.040
this shit underway.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:14:01.520
Last time on Harmontown D&D, our heroes had just slain their shadows in a combat most

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:07.160
deadly on the shadowy shadow plane of Shadows, a slang which also returned the adventurers

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.680
to the material plane in the burnt down ruins of the Connie Forest.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:18.040
Just then, a brilliant emerald energy was released as the soul of growth began soul of growing

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.040
the Connie Forest back to its former glory.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.680
At the same time, quarks talking dagger exploded and the ensuing magical energy cloaked itself

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:32.480
in branches and roots and began speaking, claiming it was the soul of growth.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.040
The entity greeted the travelers and thanked them for unwittingly releasing the trapped

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.040
spirit.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.320
After arguing with a newly materialized force of nature, the gang picked a new name for the

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:49.720
Avatar of Seasons to avoid confusion, dubbing him Rudy Woodgrowth the third.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:58.920
The nature spirit gave the heroes crazy awesome nature powers before ushering them through

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.560
a tree and outside of Yellow Camp, Sharpie's father's home.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:11.560
But would it be as they expected a Father's Day reunion, or would it instead be a demon

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.880
infested nightmare?

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.560
We'll find out next.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:28.080
This is going to be the best Father's Day ever.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.360
Now who should clean their room?

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.880
Thanks Adam for the note that you left on my character sheet.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:43.520
Maybe Liberty Spikes because that's cool and feminine.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:50.160
I forgot to mention that, yeah, he put your character's hair into Liberty Spikes.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.160
That happened.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.160
That's how it works.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160
I'll just do whatever.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:03.320
That's what Adam Goldberg says at the foot of every woman's bed at 5am as he refasses

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320
his belt.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.600
I gave you Liberty Spikes.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.040
Welcome to the wonderful world.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.120
She doesn't question it because she just wants him to leave so she's like, yeah, all right.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.760
You'll find out what they are later.

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:27.360
Adam's note at the bottom of my page is, step E, I owned it, kisses Adam.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:33.600
If you recall, you got season powers, but you didn't know how to use them, so Rudy Woodgrowth

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.560
the third was like, oh, I'll teach you your powers.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.000
Well, I read here that I have the armlet of winter that I can use to call up a sleet storm

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.520
twice a day, 10 foot radius.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520
Enemies might fall down.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520
Yeah.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.520
So, yeah.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.520
They might fall down.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.520
It's shorthand.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.520
Right.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.520
Also a Final Fantasy I reference.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.520
But yeah.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.520
So.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:01.520
I can calm or intensify hail, sleet and snow.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520
Yeah.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.520
I love it.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.120
And I mean, there's no peace of mind like having that thing because even before you

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:14.680
use it twice a day, you could just say to the enemy, the way you rack a pump action shotgun,

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.520
you might fall down.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.520
And a lot of times that's more powerful than actually having to use it.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520
Absolutely.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520
Or them actually falling down.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520
It's probable that you'll be clumsy.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
Sorry.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:30.720
I've got a 10 skill modifier on Intimidate, I bet I could combine those together.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720
Yeah.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.640
He's like a pro, you know, Jeff's been playing a lot of D&D behind the scenes.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640
Yeah.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640
I'm learning, I'm figuring this shit out finally.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.640
Yeah.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.120
My armlet is the Armlet of Spring.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.640
It can summon armor of thorny vines.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640
Yeah.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640
Twice a day.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.200
You can command the vines to stop protecting you and lash out to entangle a foe.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.160
After they stop entangling, they come back.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160
That sounds pretty cool.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.160
Yeah.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.720
And I can calm and slash intensify clouds.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.720
No guys, wait for it, wait for it, I promise they're intensifying.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.720
Just let's stir up everything.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720
Clouds, comma, showers.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.720
Are you saying that you've looked at clouds from both sides now?

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.720
I don't know.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720
All right.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:20.720
So the way I remember it is we went back to my dad's camp and what was in place there

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.720
was like Admiral Darkstar had taken it over and some weird shit was going on.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.720
Yeah.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.720
We went back out and do a field to see if we could learn to use our armlets.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.720
We became the Four Seasons.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720
Yeah.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.720
And there was the music that played and that was good.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.720
So now we're in this field with Rudy Woodworth.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.720
Rudy Woodgrowth III.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.720
You named him.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.720
And some armlets that might make people fall down.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:58.720
All right, I go back in towards and examine the foes that we were facing before.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720
Okay.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:05.720
So you kind of crawl under this yellow canvas and you're inside the interior.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:12.720
It's open top so the sunlight is kind of shining down but you're situated between two kind of empty cages.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:19.720
Peering between the cages you can see kind of hordes of people that look like they're in rags kind of tied to a large turbine kind of system.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.720
So they're not a turbine, whatever.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.720
They're spinning.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.720
They're like moving it around like cattle kind of being whipped by demons.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:35.720
So the main foes you see are these three gaunt demons with these scraggly kind of tentacly like beards and they're whipping these people and they seem kind of prominent.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:48.720
And occasionally you see kind of lurking guards of these slimy slug guys that look kind of like half human monstrosities and half slugs, flesh colored sliding around on the ground in patrols.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.720
All right.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.720
Sharpie, we're here to meet your dad.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.720
Is your dad gone or is he here?

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720
Well, I mean, this is where he was.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.720
I mean, it's father's day Sharpie.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.720
Well, yeah, but I mean, you can't expect everything to sync up perfectly.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.720
I don't know.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.720
Did you hear that intro?

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.720
I know.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.720
Maybe I could use blood magic to locate my father like I did that one time.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.720
Yeah.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.720
Blood magic under special abilities because I forced it with bad improv.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.720
Yep.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.720
It works in this world.

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.720
What do they do?

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.720
You cut yourself and you meditated on the ensuing blood.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.720
Cut.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:38.720
The cosmic sounds of belt whippings.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:51.720
The blood it drops to the floor and sinks into the ground, but it kind of after sinking into the ground, it kind of comes back out and beads up and forms a kind of arrow that leads like kind of into this area.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.720
Nice.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.720
Thank you.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.720
Happy Father's Day.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.720
I told you the father said bonds bigger than any system.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.720
I go on with these guys.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720
I explain.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.720
Okay.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:13.720
I start crawling like slow and low to the ground along the direction of that arrow.

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:21.720
And I look back and I give them that kind of Vietnam hand signal where you put a hand up and you wave them forward.

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.720
And I point out to the foes and I said, we got three slug monsters.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.720
We got slug monsters in the wire.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720
Okay.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720
That happens.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720
All right.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720
I start approaching.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.720
But are we inside or outside this tent?

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.720
So if quark actually came through, I'm assuming you guys did too, but maybe you didn't.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720
As long as it felt safe.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720
Yeah.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.720
I went through.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720
There we go.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720
So are these foes?

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720
You said these foes are past foes.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.720
Like we don't need to.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.720
I don't remember.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.720
No, we saw them.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.720
We never fought them.

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.720
Oh yeah.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.720
Yeah.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720
Oh yeah.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.720
Cause you were gone.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720
So you came into this tent, right?

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720
Sorry.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.720
Sorry.

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.720
It's fine.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.720
I didn't even.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.720
It's fine.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.720
It's Father's Day.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.720
You're a daughter.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.720
Maybe one day a mother.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720
No.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:09.720
So you went, you went into this tent and you saw all these demons and then you left.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.720
And now you're coming back.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.720
I'm distracted by how sorry the audience felt for me in that moment.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.720
I don't understand.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.720
Anyway.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.720
Sorry.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720
Okay.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720
Got it.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720
I'm not explaining it twice.

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.720
No, I know.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.720
Oh, he just hung up when you fucking father styled.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.720
Yeah.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.720
Sorry.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.720
Okay.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:28.720
What's happening?

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.720
Probably demons.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720
All right.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.720
How close am I to the nearest foe?

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:39.720
So you're pretty close to like a small slithering patrol of these slug dudes.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.720
You're pretty far away from the nearest, the big beardy demon.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.720
Those guys are kind of in the very center of the camp and you're still pretty much on

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720
the periphery.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720
All right.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720
All right.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720
Don't get mad when I ask you this.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720
Where are we?

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.720
You're, you're in yellow camp.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.720
We're in the yellow camp inside the tent.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:02.720
Sensor's dad, how do you, how do you feel right now watching being on stage with your son?

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.720
Oh, it's, it's awesome.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:10.720
Especially like when he does a little smile, you know, a little kind of impish smile after,

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.720
after he just dissed you, but then he smiles to let you know he's just kidding.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:23.720
I mean, I can confidently say don't think I've ever been happier than I am.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.720
Sensor gives daggers to his dad through his eyes.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.720
For real?

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.720
My game.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.720
I lost.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:36.720
He says, dad, get the hell off of stage and stop embarrassing my bearded ass.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.720
I couldn't, not on Father's Day.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.720
I couldn't do it on Father's Day.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.720
Any other day.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.720
So, so I have a plan of attack.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.720
Can I go?

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720
Yeah.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:56.720
Well, I'm putting on the armlet of autumn, which can make me invisible.

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.720
And I'm going straight for the big ass demon in the middle.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.720
And I'm going to use my poison dagger to try and put him away.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.720
Use that poison dagger.

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.720
Now, can I ask, would that be a sneak attack?

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:19.720
Well, yeah, since I'm invisible, I guess it would have to be.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.720
There has never been a better podcast ever.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720
Dad?

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.720
Dungeon Dad Snap.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.720
There's Klaid in the back.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.720
Let's all drink it and just die and float it.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.720
Well, let me ask you this, son.

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.720
Was it a sneak attack when I drove you to McDonald's to meet your friends and you made me drop

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:47.720
you off two blocks away?

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.720
I've never done that, right?

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.720
Why couldn't you be invisible, Dad?

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.720
Son, your words are like a poison dagger sometimes.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.720
You don't realize how bad they can wound.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.720
You just dealt six hit points to my frylings.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.720
What is your father-son bonding activity?

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.720
Like, do you have something that you guys enjoy doing together?

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.720
Like, fishing or...

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:14.720
I know you guys don't play D&D together.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.720
These watch Gossip Girl.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.720
I mean, is there a show that you guys watch together?

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.720
No.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.720
Sometimes I might, when he was home and he was watching Adventure Time, I might sit down with him

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.720
and enjoy Jake and Finn.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.720
Since your dad loves you, let him in.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.720
No.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.720
No dice.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.720
This is a source of pain.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.720
I don't know why all of you are laughing.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.720
Because it's not us.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.720
Oh, my gosh.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.720
What I wouldn't give for a dad that would come to a show that I did.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:01.720
My dad asked me routinely, how is your internet talk going?

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.720
Yeah, but you don't want to listen.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.720
No, I certainly don't, no.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.720
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.720
This is great.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.720
Well, maybe you guys should, you know, model trains or like there's got to be something.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.720
You guys ever go out in the backyard, fire up the grill?

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.720
I built him a dice tower once for D&D.

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:23.720
We built it together.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.720
Oh, well, that's a thing.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.720
That's not something we do.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.720
That's one thing we did.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.720
Let me in, son.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:41.720
My heart is like a cold dungeon.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:45.720
Talk it out the only way you know, Spencer.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:51.720
You're examining my personal feelings as well as past events.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.720
Andy, are you and Spencer's mom experiencing any sort of empty nest syndrome following something?

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.720
She is.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.720
She is.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.720
Yeah.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.720
But she follows.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.720
Is she making you wear a beard?

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.720
No, she'd like for me to grow my mustache back.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.720
I got too many bomb chicka-bombs.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.720
I keep seeing glimmers of your sexuality.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.720
It's horrifying.

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.720
No, no.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.720
And glimmers of Spencer's dad's sexuality is the name of my book.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:31.720
My dad one night agreed to build a robot with me.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:38.720
And for the rest of my life, there was this half-built robot in the basement.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.720
Metaphor.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.720
And you're like, dad, can we finish this metaphor?

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:51.720
And he's like, the fact that it will never be finished is the complete metaphor.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.720
All right, so Andy as Christopher has just sneak attacked invisibly into the yellow camp.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.720
Yeah, that happened.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.720
Anyway, so yeah, you creep in unseen up on this, up on this demon dude, you know, straight up,

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:10.720
and you roll your attack, which I already rolled like five minutes ago.

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:17.720
And you strike as you do as you've done so many times.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.720
Why am I here?

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.720
Please let me out.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.720
Please release me.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.720
Dealing.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.720
24 damage.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.720
Shit.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.720
He really is Spencer's dad.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.720
Unfortunately, demons are immune to poison.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.720
Give him that.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.720
Yeah, so that happens.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.720
Spencer, before this is over, I want you both to roll a hug check.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:55.720
Save versus bonding.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.720
My dream would be for Spencer and Andy to switch places.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.720
His dad to Dungeon Master.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.720
I wouldn't work.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.720
I don't get it.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.720
This is so fascinating.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.720
I really have never been happier.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.720
I love your dad more than I love anyone in my family.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:28.720
I, through my armlet of summer, I have acquired fiery arrows.

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.720
Yeah, that's true.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:40.720
I fire a single good fiery arrow at the enemy.

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.720
Okay, so she has a plus seven on adjectives for her arrows.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.720
Just, I should remind you, if you read yourselves in the trappings

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:54.720
of your fiery armor that grants your arrows flamingness,

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.720
that would give away your position.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.720
Either way, I mean, you could still do it, but I should warn you.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:04.720
Well, I have a sack and some...

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.720
Oh.

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.720
Now, is that sack made of asbestos?

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720
Thank you.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.720
Thank you, Jerky Bill.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.720
How about cool rock bill these days?

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:15.720
It's rock bill?

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.720
Cool rock bill.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.720
Are you referring to his satin-y shirt?

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.720
I'm just trying to go with new bill.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.720
I think it's open like jasmine bill.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.720
He gave cool rocks to people, you guys.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720
Do you not remember this?

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720
Yes, yes.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.720
Bill's biggest advocate.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720
Me too.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.720
Yeah, Bill.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.720
He gave rocks to your birthday?

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.720
He gave rocks to people in the audience today.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.720
Bill, they gave me rocks.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.720
Yeah.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.720
I didn't get her rocks.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.720
It's this whole thing.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.720
Beef Jerky Bill's going to just spend some more rocks while this game happens, everybody.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:59.720
If you podcast listeners hear a strange jingle-jangle of stones slapping together gently,

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.720
like ripples through a stream.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.720
Beef Jerky Bill's wearing what can only be described as Neil Diamond's last tour shirt.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.720
It's kind of a dark, brown, coppery, satin affair with some nice cufflinks.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.720
I really like that, Bill.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.720
It's definitely like an 8,000 thread count shirt.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.720
I like this.

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.720
He's sifting to the crowd with a giant Ziploc baggie full of stones.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:27.720
I don't want to encourage you to give a tangent, but what's the deal with the stones?

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.720
What's the story?

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720
It's this whole thing.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:36.720
Normally a guy in Hollywood with a satin shirt walking around slinging rock is a whole different thing.

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:44.720
I really wish there was someone here to rival Stone Beef Jerky Bill named Sand Andrew.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720
Who? Just started handing out stories.

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.720
Wouldn't it be amazing if Beef Jerky Bill's dad was here?

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:54.720
And he just had a bag of, I don't know, like model trains.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:01.720
Can we make next week just an arbitrary specific gift night where everybody brings the crowd?

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.720
It's just like a big show.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.720
Give a pageant of gifts?

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.720
Yeah, we'll do a little show until everybody has to bring the treats.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:12.720
We'll do an episode where the theme is derailment.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.720
So that the show is not derailed.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.720
So I don't want to give away my position.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:29.720
So with my sack and my bedroll.

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:33.720
Both flammable.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:38.720
You're going to launch an attack on demons with a sack and a sleeping bag?

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.720
It'll have to be clear that I'm not doing a bed and this is how I like to play.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:48.720
We play a private D&D game.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.720
We play a private D&D game and we were trying to get 50 pounds of copper out of a mine.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:56.720
And Erin pipes in and goes, and she plays an older gentleman who's a bard.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:02.720
And she put forth the concept of taking the cheese that she has and melting it so we could slide the copper out of the mine.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:07.720
It's not that crazy.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.720
She was greasing the bottom of the sack.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.720
How much cheese did she carry?

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:17.720
I had to explain like carrying capacity to everyone and then we were like, oh, everyone can carry all the copper.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:18.720
It's fine.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.720
Right, but I still wanted to slide my copper.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:26.720
Anyway, after that night, Dan had a very serious talk with me, which was, do you care about this game?

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.720
Are you taking it seriously?

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:33.720
Absolutely.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:44.720
You're making it sound like I was yelled at you after everyone left for the cheese.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:50.720
And then he hit me with his bag of holder.

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:57.720
It's the fact that 90% of the time, you put a beard on when everyone's coming over, you put snacks out.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.720
You do everything like you host this party.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.720
Everyone comes over and plays D&D.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:08.720
But then you also, throughout the night, you're like, it seems like you're barely focused on the game and that you're not enjoying it.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.720
And I was saying to you that night, because I was saying, it seems like you're not enjoying it.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.720
I think if you sit in a chair and focus on the game, it's like that.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.720
And you were like, I just wanted to melt cheese into the thing.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.720
I was like, I'm not yelling at you over the fucking cheese thing.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.720
I love what a sassy neighborhood kid I am.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.720
I think I have it in the same way that you say that you have Asperger's.

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.720
I have adult ADHD and it's a serious thing.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:45.720
I'm just wondering if sliding your copper is some kind of sexual euphemism.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.720
I'm not going to sleep with you, Spencer's dad.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.720
I have a boyfriend and you have a wife.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:56.720
It gets so complicated.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.720
Does ADHD stand for always Dan Harmon defying?

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.720
Devoted.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.720
Well, Dan is right.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.720
I could be more focused during D&D.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.720
You're not paying attention a hell of a lot during that game.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:20.720
There's a syndrome where if you don't pay enough attention during D&D, then it's hard.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.720
Then you come sit down and it's like, you need to get immersed in the game, baby.

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.720
Shut up, shut up, lady.

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:36.720
I know, yes, she puts out a plate of baby carrots.

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.720
She sharpens pencils.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.720
I'm no stranger to the sacrifices she's making.

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.720
But I would give all that up for her to have a good time.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.720
I want her to enjoy herself during the game.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.720
I would rather just go to the Roosevelt Hotel and rent a bungalow.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.720
Let's go to the fucking Chateau Marmont and do a big bag of Coke and play Dungeons & Dragons.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.720
Have people bring shit to us.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.720
Let me die that way.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:10.720
Let there be black and white autopsy photos of me with a die in my fist.

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.720
After that conversation, I realized that I was being distracting to other people because I was distracted.

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.720
But I wasn't unhappy.

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.720
Especially me, though, because I'm your boyfriend.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.720
I don't think anyone else cares that much.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:29.720
It does come off to me that you don't really enjoy playing the actual game.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.720
The game is not something that you particularly are invested in.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.720
No, I do have a good time.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:43.720
I get distracted by hosting, which I really enjoy.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.720
I really like putting out snacks.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.720
The snacks are out.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.720
No, I know.

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:57.720
You don't have this chip in your brain that gives you joy when you're taking care of people.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.720
I get distracted by that.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.720
I get distracted by people being hungry.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.720
I also get distracted by being drunk and being like,

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.720
I've got an idea.

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.720
What if a puppy was a therapist?

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.720
I should think about this.

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:13.720
That's an actual note in my phone that I saw tonight that I was writing during D&D.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:16.720
I was like, yeah, a puppy should be a therapist.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.720
But meanwhile, we're getting our asses slashed to pieces by hobgoblins and shit.

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:27.720
To be fair, in the first couple of games when I suggested what I was really invested,

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.720
I suggested the things that I was taking very seriously.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.720
You shut me down.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.720
I felt, please don't do that.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.720
That makes me want to kill myself.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.720
How did I shut you down?

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.720
No, I'm fine.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.720
When we were talking, this is getting very specific.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.720
And Pittsburgh-y.

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.720
When we were...

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.720
Well, I'm glad we're talking about this.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:55.720
It's not a big deal.

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:59.720
But when we were giving our personal bios of our characters,

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.720
and I know what you're going to say after I say this, but I was...

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.720
I want to hear that too.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:11.720
I was giving the bio of my character Mordecai Stumpgarden.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:14.720
I was really excited to play.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.720
And in the middle of me explaining my origin story,

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:22.720
in which I said, because I wanted to have a connection with you in this story,

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.720
I said, well, and I think that, you know, because we're both...

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:28.720
This is getting real deep.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:31.720
We're both halflings in the thing.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:40.720
I suggested, I said, well, and my character and Jeff's character,

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.720
we both have a secret connection.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.720
And then I continued to explain my story.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.720
And in the middle of it, Jeff was like, are you done?

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:50.720
Is that it?

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.720
And I was like...

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.720
That's not what happens.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.720
Absolutely not what happens.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.720
Well, it was something adjacent to all your...

01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:59.720
Are you done?

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.720
Are you done? You know what I'm talking about?

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:02.720
Yeah, you said...

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.720
We have a secret connection.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.720
We have a mysterious past together.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.720
I didn't know what my character was.

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:09.720
We just picked our character.

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.720
I didn't know who I was.

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.720
And I was like, what?

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.720
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:17.720
I just threw it out there.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.720
I didn't know what it would be.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.720
I was unable to, yes and that,

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.720
because I didn't know what my fucking character was.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.720
And then you told me to stop explaining my character.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.720
And then I told you to go fuck yourself,

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.720
and I kicked you in the dick and took your wallet.

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:31.720
Oh god, I'm sorry, I was a terrible person then.

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.720
No, you're not a terrible person then.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.720
I'm sorry if you felt shut off by that.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.720
It was not my intention.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.720
It's really not a big deal.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.720
You were offering something, and I didn't know how to further that.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.720
I didn't know what was going on.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.720
This is a reference to a Dungeons & Dragons game

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.720
to which you guys are not invited.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.720
Meanwhile, that's so much more interesting now.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.720
You have been totally delightful during Dungeons & Dragons.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.720
I feel, it's more about me.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.720
I think maybe I'm an idiot,

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.720
but my ideas are, I want to make contraptions

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.720
out of the things that I have on my list,

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.720
and I want to put cheese on bags,

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.720
and maybe it's stupid.

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.720
And in the middle of my description,

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:18.720
it was made known to me that it was silly

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.720
and a little too out there.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.720
And I'm the lowest common denominator.

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.720
So...

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.720
To what?

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:31.720
Well, I have a really good time during Dungeons & Dragons.

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.720
Well, I don't think that's fair.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.720
First of all, if you want your role to be,

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.720
if what you delight in is saying,

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.720
okay, I have a sack in my inventory,

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.720
and I have an eagle in my inventory,

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:43.720
I want to put the sack over the eagle

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.720
and turn it into an eagle sack and use that to think,

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.720
people around you have a right

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.720
to look at you with their mouth open.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.720
No, totally. They do.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.720
That's part of our enjoyment of it.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.720
See, if you look around the room,

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.720
no one's going to be looking at you with their hand on their chin

01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.720
going like, go on.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.720
It's like working with Nikola Tesla.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.720
No, no, I don't care about that.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.720
I really don't care about that.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:08.720
The thing that makes me kind of shut up a little bit

01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:10.720
is that my worst nightmare is that

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.720
it feels like I'm

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.720
saying those things during our D&D game

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.720
because I am like,

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.720
well, fuck it, I'll just do whatever.

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.720
But really, I'm putting all of my

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:25.720
little brain cells

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.720
into one little package.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.720
It's not all the time.

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.720
There's been times when you're so up and down,

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.720
you're in the kitchen, you're there,

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.720
and as we're going around, we'll be in a combat thing,

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.720
and everyone kind of has to be aware

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.720
of who's where and who's holding what

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.720
and what's going on, and then it comes back to you

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.720
and it'll be a reset

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.720
because somebody's not in the room like that.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.720
Even if I get it for a second to go make a drink,

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.720
you come back in and you've missed stuff.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.720
I'm totally right, I'm sorry.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.720
You keep dropping your goddamn character shades all over the place.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.720
I just love feeling like a queen.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.720
Pick it up, Spencer's dad. I'm a queen.

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.720
Thank you.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.720
All right, come on.

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.720
All right, so you fire an arrow at the demon.

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.720
She's a fucking arrow.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.720
Everyone dies.

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.720
Shit. Happy Father's Day to me.

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.720
What were you going to do with the sack?

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.720
You brought the sack out for a reason, right?

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.720
Well, okay.

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.720
So I want to take the sack out on the federal out

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.720
because I want to make a moron dummy.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.720
So you're saying this sack

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.720
is as big as Spencer's sack?

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.720
I'm not going to sleep with you, Spencer's sack.

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.720
No matter how many times

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:35.720
you pick up those character sheets,

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.720
it's not going to happen.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:39.720
No matter how many times

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.720
you pick up those character sheets,

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.720
it's not going to happen.

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.720
You're right, I am very distracted during your game

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.720
and I'll try to be less distracted.

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.720
So I am going to...

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.720
We just want you to have fun.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.720
We want everyone there to be enjoying the game itself.

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.720
I think the audience wants to be enjoying the game itself.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:03.720
Fair enough. Look, they got rocks.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.720
Yeah, usually when they come here

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:09.720
and put their $10 down, what do they get?

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.720
Jonah Ray talking about eating pussy.

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.720
I don't know.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.720
Tonight they got a rock.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.720
They saw you cry.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.720
Yeah, I cried about my dad, you got a rock.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.720
Fuck you guys.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.720
All right, let's...

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:25.720
Let's at least work...

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.720
This shit about community.

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.720
Let's at least earn one experience point

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.720
to this fucking campaign.

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.720
You said that if I shot my fire arrow,

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.720
I would give away my position.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.720
So this is my plan.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.720
I would like to put my bedroll inside my sack.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.720
I'm not going to sleep with you, Erin.

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.720
I put my bedroll in my sack

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.720
and I put it in the corner of the room.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.720
What is the shape of the room?

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.720
Is it an octagon?

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.720
It's like a pentagon.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.720
Okay, cool.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.720
So I put it in one corner of this pentagon shape.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.720
And I also take some of my hair

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.720
and I put it...

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.720
How? How do you do that?

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:15.720
I pull it out of my head because I'm a fucking badass

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.720
and I don't give a shit.

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.720
These Liberty spikes.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.720
Adam...

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.720
You're welcome.

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.720
Oh, boy.

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.720
Adam, we are Goldberg-ing ourselves tonight.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.720
We know...

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.720
This is self Goldberg-ing.

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.720
You are alive and well on this day.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.720
This is a self Goldberg show, pre-Goldberg.

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.720
It's like acid washed jeans.

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.720
We don't need to...

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.720
I happen to have, as everyone knows,

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.720
I have a scarf around my waist that is the same color as my hair.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:45.720
And I take it off

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.720
and I throw it on top of this

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.720
bed sack inside.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.720
I...

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.720
And everyone knows that I'm fast as light.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.720
I fire

01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:57.720
my arrow

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.720
and I run away.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.720
Like, I fire it in front of my dummy.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.720
I run to another corner

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:09.720
and I'm able to...

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.720
I shape myself into, like, a slug

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.720
shape.

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.720
And I...

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.720
Let me see your character sheet.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.720
That's not on there.

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.720
That's not on there.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.720
But as, like, a...

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.720
a humanic...

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.720
As a humanoid creature, I can, like,

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:29.720
just shape my body.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.720
I'm a slug and I kind of spit up

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:33.720
on my chin and I'm like,

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:35.720
What the heck?

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.720
You're going to get us all killed again.

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.720
I don't know. They might feel sorry for us.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.720
At least melt the cheese

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.720
or we can eat.

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.720
They might just put money

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.720
at our feet and leave.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.720
So, what do I roll?

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:59.720
I roll!

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.720
Let's keep it, let's keep it going.

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:03.720
Okay.

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.720
So she does all that.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:07.720
There's an Eric Clapton playing

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.720
while we watch her do all that.

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.720
Okay.

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:17.720
Okay.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.720
To start, I rolled a 5,

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.720
a 4 and a 5.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.720
So, let that frame

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:33.720
the results.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.720
Cobbling together a quick makeshift mannequin

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.720
in an attempt to disguise

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.720
attention from yourself.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.720
You swiftly put it into position

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.720
before loosing an arrow from your bow.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.720
After that, you run

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.720
and attempt to disguise yourself

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.720
like a slug person.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.720
A humanic slug.

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.720
Your arrow goes wide,

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:55.720
plummeting to the ground

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.720
as if it were dropped.

01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.720
You take off down the hall,

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.720
but not the hall.

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.720
You just take off down the whatever

01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.720
and you get to your destination

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.720
and jump into a slug.

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:09.720
You're right near like a

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.720
kind of a detachment of slugs moving by

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.720
as if you're trying to blend in with them.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.720
Starting to realize this is not a good idea.

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.720
You're starting to realize that?

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.720
What's this being told back?

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.720
When you hear it back, it sounds weird, right?

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.720
Well, when you say it...

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.720
It wasn't that finely boned

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:33.720
gem that you thought it was.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.720
The judging master is Ricky Ricardo.

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.720
I don't want to blow anyone's mind,

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.720
but I'm starting to realize

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:43.720
I don't think it's very good at Dungeons & Dragons.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.720
There's better tools for the

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.720
ploys you're trying to pull.

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.720
It's not always a bag and a bed roll.

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:51.720
Sometimes there's like

01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.720
magical pigments.

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.720
Or yeah, major creation

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.720
involved. Who knows?

01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.720
That's some deep snow.

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.720
So what happened? Everyone believed it.

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.720
The anime?

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.720
The makeshift mannequin falls apart.

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.720
It topples the pieces because it's two things

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720
arranged near each other.

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.720
You understand, logically, it just has to be

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:13.720
a distraction. Where is this coming from?

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720
This is a magical world where maybe

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.720
a bed roll is shooting arrows.

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:19.720
Who knows?

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.720
You'd be like, oh, the bed roll

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.720
people are here.

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.720
But if you roll low,

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:27.720
that entails you do a poor job.

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.720
And your effect is as grand

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.720
as you'd hoped.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.720
So this is a sack

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.720
placed atop a bed roll.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.720
Erin, can we all get together one night and play

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:39.720
D&D Your Way?

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.720
I would love it.

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.720
As an experiment, can you play

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.720
Mulraineing tonight?

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.720
We'll make cakes and the baby

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.720
carrots and we'll all do this stuff.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.720
But we also have to do peyote.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.720
And there's no

01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.720
actual combat allowed. You get punished

01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.720
if you just have a sword in your hand

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.720
and you're stuck there.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.720
Everything has to be played

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.720
as if you're playing a 1995

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.720
DreamWorks Interactive video game.

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.720
I used the rake

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.720
to find the wallet.

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.720
I mean, really, that made my heart

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.720
so full. I hope you're not joking.

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:15.720
No, I'd love to. I actually would.

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.720
DreamWorks did some great video games in the 90s.

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:19.720
All right, Spencer's Dad, because it's Father's Day

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.720
and the show's getting, we're getting

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.720
toward that bewitching hour right now.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.720
Why don't you fire one parting shot

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.720
around the world? All right.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.720
Well, I'm going to fire two blinding

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.720
bombs. A load, if you will.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.720
In Prepper Father fashion,

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.720
he's going to fire two blinding bombs

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.720
and blame one on the dog.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.720
Yeah.

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.720
I mean, technically speaking,

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:47.720
it's not your turn.

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.720
Spencer. Spencer, roll

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.720
for a hug right now.

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.720
Roll for a father hug.

01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.720
Don't tell him what to do.

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.720
I'm going to roll for a hug and let's see

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.720
what it actually comes up with.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.720
Is it you hugging your dad or your dad hugging you?

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.720
The die result will determine that.

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.720
Okay.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.720
Trust me.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.720
That's a 15.

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.720
That's a hit.

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.720
That's a solid hit.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.720
So who hugs whom? Wrapping his arms

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.720
around his club.

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.720
Really?

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.720
I'm not going to really do it.

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.720
Finish it. Finish it.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.720
I don't know. Oh, what? Finish what?

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.720
At the end of Harmontown,

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.720
they sit staring in stunned silence,

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.720
hoping that father and son

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.720
will interact.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.720
Their hopes were

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:47.720
for nothing.

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.720
Hey,

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.720
that's me.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.720
That's who I am.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.720
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.720
We wouldn't want you any other way, Spencer.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.720
We love you.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.720
Let's hear it for Andy, Spencer's father.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:11.720
Thank you, sir.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:13.720
Hug.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.720
Hug. Hug.

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.720
Hug. Hug.

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:19.720
Hug. Hug.

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:21.720
Hug.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.720
Thank you once again.

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.720
Thank you, Erin McGathy.

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.720
We have a special D&D date

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.720
done Erin McGathy style.

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:33.720
I think the takeaway

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.720
is

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.720
be a father

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:39.720
to everyone around you,

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.720
and don't anticipate anything from them.

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.720
Your son

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.720
will be whatever kind of son he wishes to be.

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.720
But if he's your son,

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:49.720
you should be proud of him.

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.720
I thought I could rip it.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:53.720
Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.720
Happy Father's Day.

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.720
I love you, Dad.

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:13.720
I love you, Dad.
