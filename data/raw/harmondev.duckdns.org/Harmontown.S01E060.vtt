{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:22.000\nHello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hollywood, California, and the world-famous Meltdown comics.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:32.000\nAnd the even more famous Meltdown Theater with a vodka and ice are brought with great and long.\n\n00:32.000 --> 01:00.000\nHarmon Town is in session one more time. Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:07.000\nI watch season four.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:16.000\nJake, Sinora, Jake, Sinora.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:25.000\nI guess I already knew this, but apparently I'm quite a genius.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:32.000\nNot a fan?\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:45.000\nI think I feel pretty comfortable expressing any kind of, not my cup of tea about it, because this has been expressed a thousand times over.\n\n01:45.000 --> 02:02.000\nIt's obviously not somebody doing what they do and trying really hard to make people happy. It is very much like an impression and an unflattering one.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:22.000\nIt's just 13 episodes. I feel like I'm going back to work tomorrow morning and I just feel like, do I talk like that?\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:32.000\nIt's weird to think about the fork in the road before one in this situation, a situation which is very unique.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:53.000\nThe weird thing that keeps eating at me is there's a system in place that's winning, because I would have had too much leverage, too much power, too much salary as would have a lot of writers coming into season four.\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:10.000\nThey replaced us with two guys, didn't know what they were getting into, went to Comic-Con, saw what was going on, people dressed as spacemen and bananas and shit, and going, holy shit, I cut myself every night and watch community, and they went, fuck.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:24.000\nThey tried their best and I think that was the best idea, not the best idea as it turns out, but the most admirable kind of impulse was like, let's not let these people down.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:29.000\nIf there's anything else we do, let's not let these people down.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:40.000\nNow you go back and I go, okay, well, watching that season, it's like I have such an impulse to just do the show that they probably got hired to do.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:54.000\nThey could have just done a sitcom set at a community college and people would have gone like, what about paintball? What the fuck? What about chicken fingers?\n\n03:54.000 --> 04:03.000\nBut then five episodes later, regular people would have been like, oh, this is a pleasant little show set at a community college, and they would have beaten me.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:13.000\nThe system would have won. I would have just crawled in her bridge and pooped in a bucket and just died, which is my worst nightmare.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:26.000\nThat's why I came to L.A. is because that's how I felt in high school. That's how I felt in my parents' house. My whole life is just me trying to get people to stop going gross.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:38.000\nJust trying to trick them into liking me. It's just like, look, Joel McHale's saying something funny and it surprises me.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:53.000\nBut the weird thing is, you go back and it's not like writers fighting other writers is the fucking American dream in the eyes of Sony.\n\n04:53.000 --> 05:03.000\nThat is what they want. They want creative people rewriting each other. They want creative people replacing each other. They want us interchangeable.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:11.000\nThey want us, they want to think about writing the way they think about the guy on assembly line 24 that puts the final screw in the fucking PlayStation.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:18.000\nThey want to think about us all that way. And I shouldn't even say they because it's an it. It's a fucking machine.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:24.000\nThere's not a single person that works at that corporation that isn't also thought of like that by the fucking Skynet.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:36.000\nLike all of them, even the people that you go, oh, that douchebag, that fucking idiot, that vice president of fucking what's it, the head up his ass, dick, shit, fucking, fuckface, international.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:42.000\nSo I can't wait for him to get fired. They're just going to replace him with someone else.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:50.000\nThere's some other fucking prep school, frat ass fucking dipshit. The system just wants us all just fucking not being human.\n\n05:50.000 --> 06:03.000\nBut they accidentally, you know, in the quest for to recoup their investment, they made a TV show that with a bunch of actors that make people really happy.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:14.000\nAnd we got 13 more episodes. And it's like, you know, I like the idea that we've laced the opiates with just a little bit of activation, a little bit of humanity.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:21.000\nAnd like when you watch that show, you'll maybe go out and make a show of your own or something like that.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:27.000\nDo you feel pretty confident in your ability to go in there and like, you know, slam dunk this next season?\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nNo, no, I don't feel confident in my ability to slam dunk anything.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:44.000\nBecause I'll measure that, you know, slam dunking by my own standards. So the basket's always going to be one inch higher than I can jump because I have a weird complex about that.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:53.000\nI want to do the best I can. But I mean, I think that, well, how does it work coming out of that season that clearly is different than it was when you were there?\n\n06:53.000 --> 07:02.000\nLike, tonally, like, your fans are going to be recognized that you're back. They're going to hear that tone again, hopefully, right?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nAnd that will be a breath of fresh air.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nYeah, they're going to feel my loving kisses, yeah.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:11.000\nBut it won't be in the form of a fucking matrix spoof.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:17.000\nLike, I'm back! Look at the wire! Like, I won't...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nThat's not what I ever...\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nYou should do the wire. You should do a wire spoof right out of the back.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:33.000\nI mean, I was just, boy, man, watching those characters without me there is not fucking cool, man.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's like, just flipping through Instagram, just watching your girlfriend just blow a million...\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:52.000\nIt's the worst. It is, like, all the comments underneath it. People going, like, well, season three kind of sucks. How do you know this wouldn't happen anyway?\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nFuck you, fuck you!\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:04.000\nLike, if on Facebook, like, if your girlfriend was with a new guy and it's like, you know, sometimes, like, Joanna and Dean are in a relationship and there's a heart icon.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:09.000\nAnd then, like, one of your friends is like, thumbs up! Detroit likes this!\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:16.000\nLike, hey, come on! Don't even trip, dawg.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:28.000\nAlright. I left a voicemail. You guys know, you live in L.A., so you probably know this legend.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:34.000\nBill Murray doesn't have, like, representation. He just has this 800 number at a voicemail line.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:40.000\nSo I left a voicemail for him while I was watching season four. I called him and left a voicemail.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nI just said, call me back.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nWait a minute. You had to preamble it with who you were.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:58.000\nI said, my name is Dan Harmon. I created an NBC show called Community. I would like to talk to you as soon as possible about the possibility of you...\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nDid you stutter that much?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nYeah.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nProbably, yeah.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:10.000\nI didn't want to, like, try too hard or try to not try too hard, too hard.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nSo I just, it probably just sounded like a robot.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:19.000\nBut I was just, like, today on a plane with Joel Murray, his brother, the youngest Murray,\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:24.000\nand he was saying that Bill has recently done a TV guest on Something.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:30.000\nAnd before that, it was Silver Spoon or Different Strokes. That's how long it was.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nSilver Spoon was the movie that Silver Spoon was based on.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nFamily Ties.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nWas it Family Ties?\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nIt was the alcoholic brother who ruined a corporation.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nIs that right?\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nYeah.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nAdam Goldberg, everybody.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nI mean, we can't verify if he's right or wrong yet.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nAdam Goldberg for the sociopathic win.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nFor the kill.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:54.000\nHe's Machiavellian. He doesn't care.\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:02.000\nHe contributed, and I sneak out into the night, and then we'll all be like, what? There's no show called Family Ties.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:08.000\nBut he'll be up to his neck and puss.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nTo his neck and puss.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nSo I left a voicemail for Bill Murray. Is there anything?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nBut do you know what happens next? What's pursuant to that?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:25.000\nBill Murray calls me back, and we hang out.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nDoes he have somebody call you back? Do you know how that works?\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:34.000\nNo. I think he's like this weird, mysterious man.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:39.000\nI don't know. I mean, ask the guys that made Zombieland.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nI think they just called his number and left a message, I assume.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.000\nI don't know.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nI think he just calls you back and goes like, hey, it's Bill Murray.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:55.000\nI don't know. I know it's not going to happen to me, but it's like, I think it was a healthy exercise because I was watching the Jeff Meets His Father episode.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nOf course, I always wanted Jeff's father to be Bill Murray.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:05.000\nI kept putting off the meeting between Jeff and his father because I kept hoping that somehow fate would allow for that.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:11.000\nTo be the case, I named him Jeff Winger. His last name was Winger after Bill Murray's character in Stripes.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:17.000\nI just always thought that Jeff Winger's dad would be Bill Murray.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:25.000\nBut there's something awesome about having any all of those preconceived notions kind of ripped away from you.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nIt's exciting.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nHow much for that fuck, Jeff?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:34.000\nThere's something awesome about being held down and watching your family get raped at a beach.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nIt's liberating.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nIt makes you focus on what's important.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:47.000\nHappy Father's Day, by the way, everybody.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nDid you call your dad today?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:56.000\nYeah, I called my dad. Erin was calling her dad, so I had nothing to do.\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:07.000\nMy dad, one of the coolest things about him is that he knows how to do a quick surgical Father's Day call.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:12.000\nHe's wanting to get off the phone as soon as I am, no sooner, no later.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:18.000\nErin's dad will just hang up on her, which is a weird fantasy we all have.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:24.000\nI wish my dad wanted to talk less, but her dad is like...\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nBecause she goes on and on?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nNo, I'm sure she does.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:36.000\nErin's dad, by her report, has this weird phone behavior that is similar to people in TV and movies.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nIt's the way they never say goodbye or hello.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nThey just go, okay, well, I'll see you then.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.000\nAnd he just hangs up on her all the time.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nYou can ask her about it later.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:52.000\nMy dad, because it is Father's Day, I talk so much sometimes when I'm talking to a microphone,\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.000\nbecause a hamster that knows which lever gives him a treat.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:06.000\nI know that my parents were 70s hands-on parents, and I know that it's such a fucking button you can push to make people go,\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:11.000\noh, that's so cool, your dad hit you once.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:18.000\nAnd I think all of our parents, we're dicks, and the thing about being a parent is that it's a thankless fucking job.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nIf you're doing it right, it's thankless.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:27.000\nI think everybody in LA and everybody in our generation probably is starting to realize that there's an epidemic\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\namong generation acts of parents who try to be their kid's best friend,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:36.000\ntry to be perfect, and we're all seeing how those kids are turning out.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:43.000\nParenting, when you atone with the father, as Joseph Campbell would say, you become an impersonal cosmic force.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nYou make it sunny, you make it rain.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:52.000\nThe kid is never really going to do anything but complain when it's raining and do nothing when the sun is shining,\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:56.000\nand your best reward is that they grow up into a human being and they go out in the world,\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nand they're not, you know, we're human beings.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:03.000\nHow often do you, in the midst of your awesomeness, do you stop and go,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\ngood thing my parents were born?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nYou're all about yourself, and you're on your own little adventure,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:16.000\nand your parents at best are like, you know, you remember fond things about the warm little cuddly memories,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nor them just hitting you with a belt.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:30.000\nBut my dad, I will say, because it takes too much longer and it's not as easy to say,\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:36.000\nlike, holy shit, my dad was awesome, like in very, very specific ways.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:43.000\nYour father, if you're lucky enough to have one, like, is the first guy you meet.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nHe is your male role model.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:50.000\nThat means that the way that he treats women is, it's not necessarily how you're going to treat women,\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:54.000\nbut it is the first instance of a man treating a woman some way that you witness.\n\n14:54.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd I think I owe all of my fights with Aaron to kind of like the fact that I found a woman\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:07.000\nthat has a semi-compatible understanding of how a man and a woman fight constantly.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nAnd we enact these dramas and all this stuff.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:15.000\nBut if you go to enough therapy, you can wipe that out, you can recondition yourself.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nAs I've always said, Hitler's dad didn't kill 12 million Jews,\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:21.000\nand if Hitler had a son, he wouldn't kill 3 million.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:31.000\nIt's just, you know, anyone can be different from how they were raised or who they were raised by.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:37.000\nBut the stuff that works, like, because there's no reason for you to overcome it,\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nthat's the stuff that really counts.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:47.000\nI think my dad's, like, the coolest thing about him was he was just a self-made man.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:53.000\nAnd he just, and he never, he wasn't like Rodney Dangerfield and Taddy Shack.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nIt wasn't like, fuck you, society.\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:08.000\nHe was so low-born, my dad, that he never even got the cockiness to do it out of spite.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:13.000\nHe only just, like, knew that no one would ever help you unless you helped yourself.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:18.000\nAnd every time, you know, every piece of wisdom I ever got from him,\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:23.000\nwhile I watched him earn the money that we used to buy our food,\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:31.000\nit was all the messaging that went into my brain about what a man's role is in this world\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:37.000\nand within his family was very, very strong positive messaging\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nbecause my dad was a bootstrapper.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd just, like, died in the wool, fuck rich people, fuck kissing ass.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nMy dad said, I interviewed him for a sixth grade project.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:55.000\nI was like, interview your dad, and ask him 10 questions or something.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.000\nAnd I asked, I was a little sixth grade journalist,\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:01.000\nand I interviewed him in the basement where he would hide and make stained glass\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nand try to forget about how much his dad hit him.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:12.000\nAnd I, you know, he would always wear this V-neck Hanes t-shirt\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nwith a Sharpie pen, like, clipped to the collar\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:19.000\nbecause he would, you know, he would just take the Sharpie pen\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nand, like, mark it all over the place.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:25.000\nI know that I'm also famous for sticking the Sharpie pen up my ass.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nIt's really not related, I don't think.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:30.000\nIt smells like origin story.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nIt's certainly in the hands of a Christopher Nolan,\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:38.000\nlike, this is starting to come together, yeah.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nBut my dad, I remember my dad sitting behind this desk in this dark basement\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nwhile I sat there and tried to fulfill the obligations\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nof this elementary school interview project.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nAnd I said, what's your advice to young people?\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:54.000\nAnd my dad said, don't kiss anyone's ass.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nDon't do it.\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:01.000\nFor the rest of your life, everyone will always tell you,\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\npick your battles, kiss a little bit of ass,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nand then you get to stop kissing ass later.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nIt's a lie. They all just want their ass kissed.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nThey think that if they tell you that,\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nthey're going to get to kiss less ass, too.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nIt's all garbage. It's all bullshit.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:18.000\nYou have to just do everything yourself.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:22.000\nThat's pretty spicy stuff for a sixth grade project.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nYeah, but he didn't, you know, in that regard, he didn't...\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nHe wasn't kissing your sixth grade teacher's ass.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nHe wasn't kissing my ass. He wasn't talking down to me.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nHe wasn't, like, sugarcoating it.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nHe's talking to another little guy.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nI think in a lot of ways my dad was, you know,\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:43.000\nlike, I can clearly see sometimes when I talk to his biological mom about his childhood,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nyou think about your dad as a child.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nLike, that's the atonement with the father,\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:53.000\nwhen you realize that your dad was once an animal out there\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\ntrying to figure things out.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nI remember talking to his mom about...\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nShe told me this story about how my dad\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.000\nand the trailer part they grew up in.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nHe loved money because they didn't have any.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nHe didn't love it like Scrooge McDuck loves it.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:15.000\nHe loved it like the monkeys in 2001 love a monolith.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:18.000\nHe'd have, like, six single dollars,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nand he'd keep them in a coffee can,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.000\nand he would iron them and wash them\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nand stack them up and count them,\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nand he kept them in a coffee can\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nand then had a special spot where he buried them\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nbecause he wouldn't keep them in the trailer where he lived\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:37.000\nbecause that was less safe than burying it like an animal\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nbecause of the guys his mom would bring home.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:43.000\nSo he had buried treasure.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nAnd then at some point, I think someone got wise\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nand probably saw him.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:50.000\nI think I told my dad the story and my dad was like,\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nno, that was that fucking guy.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nMy dad knew who dug up his coffee can.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nAnd my dad was all...\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:01.000\nHis mom was telling me this story when I was in my 20s\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:04.000\nand I was like, holy shit, my dad was like a little guy\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:09.000\nwith a coffee can of dollars that got taken from him.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nHe was bullied. He was up against all odds.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nMy dad survived the polio epidemic.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:18.000\nHe walks with... One of his legs is withered\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nbecause so many of his peers,\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:25.000\nthey got wiped out in this epidemic in the 50s.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nBut he survived it, but it cost him a bunch of muscle tissue\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nin one of his legs.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:33.000\nHe's this kind of burly guy with these Popeye forearms\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nand this big red mustache and he walks with this limp.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nAnd the limp somehow always made him more foreboding\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nthan if he walked like a regular guy.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nWhat was your phone call like today?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nIt was dumb, boring.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nFuck that guy.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nNo, it's just, it's terse, you know?\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nMy dad and I...\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:58.000\nLike, I remember...\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:02.000\nI remember being in my 20s\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nand being back in Milwaukee for some reason\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\nand my...\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:14.000\nI took a tour with my dad of this facility.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nHere's the thing about my dad.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nMy dad was the video duplication king of the Midwest.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:24.000\nHe started out mopping floors at a film lab in Milwaukee\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:28.000\nand it was sort of like the Boogie Nights thing.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nThere was this new thing called VHS that started happening\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nand my dad told his boss, like,\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:37.000\nI think that VHS is going to probably make a lot of this stuff obsolete.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:40.000\nAll of this, like, film duplication that we're doing,\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:45.000\nthese slides that we're making for people who have cooking instruction videos\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:48.000\nor whatever, like...\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nSo, and his boss was like,\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\neh, come on, you know, whatever, like celluloid.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:58.000\nWho will ever defeat that for the transmission of information?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nAnd my dad started his own company,\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:06.000\nwhich meant that he took two VCRs and hooked them together in my bedroom\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:10.000\nand duplicated a tape ten times for one client\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:13.000\nthat needed, like, a how-to-make-bread video duplicated or something.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nGot enough money to buy two more VCRs\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:20.000\nand then he rented a small office space and had two racks of VCRs\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:25.000\nand was siphoning clients off of this company that he used to work for\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:28.000\nbecause they're all going, oh, shit, VHS, this is where we're going.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:34.000\nAnd so my dad started that, wrote that way,\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:38.000\nstarted his own business, like, ended up having, like, 50 employees\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:43.000\nand a big building and making his own, you know, VHS tapes\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:47.000\nand, like, a part of the building, like, really just, like, did it, you know,\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:51.000\nlike, took that business to its peak, sold it to his biggest competitor\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nwho was, like, the video king of America,\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nand then, just as DVDs came along.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nSo there was a guy that worked for my dad\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:07.000\nwho started his own business after my dad sold his.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:10.000\nHe had a DVD duplication facility.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:14.000\nAnd I was back in Milwaukee and I walked around with my dad\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:17.000\nand this guy, who was basically my age,\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:21.000\nbut he was this guy that had worked for my dad for years\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:25.000\nand the guy was showing him the DVD duplication facility\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:33.000\nthat he had created, this little ragamuffin, kind of, like, six-employee kind of operation\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:37.000\nand my dad was looking around and he got the whole tour and he went,\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:41.000\nhuh, yeah, it's a pretty good operation you got going here.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:44.000\nAnd the guy said, yeah, I learned from the best\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:50.000\nand I fucking, my eyes involuntarily started squirting water\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:54.000\nand my heart, like, it's called crying, then.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:58.000\nLook, water is leaking from their eyes.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:03.000\nIt's called tears. It is a symbol of their weakness.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:06.000\nMing the merciless.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:11.000\nBecause I realized, oh shit, God, this guy that came home at 10 p.m. every night,\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:15.000\nhe was fathering people that it was easier to father.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:19.000\nIt was basing it on, like, what do you do?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nAnd do you do it well?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nYou didn't cry because you were proud of your father.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:27.000\nYou cried because you were, like, he had other surrogate children?\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nI cried because I suddenly, I just did this flood of realization.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nIt was like, when you're a kid and your dad goes to work\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nand your dad works that hard,\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:41.000\nyou think of work as being a beetle juice void outside the door\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:45.000\nwhere there's sand worms and time doesn't exist out there.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:48.000\nAnd in that moment, I suddenly, it was like a sitcom epiphany\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\nwhere it was like, oh no, work was family.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:54.000\nWork was young men who looked up to him\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:58.000\nand who were, he was able to connect with\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nbecause they weren't his sons.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:05.000\nAnd they looked at him as an important man\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:11.000\nand tried to impress him and regarded his favor as worthwhile,\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nwhereas he had a much more complicated, messy relationship\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.000\nwith the guy that was generated from one of his loads.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:23.000\nHow are we ever going to have that traditional father-son relationship\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:27.000\nwhen work was what meant everything to him?\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:31.000\nAnd then cut to him coming to LA for the first time\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:35.000\nand it was back when Channel 101 had just gotten a pilot on VH1\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:39.000\nand we were all hanging out in a bar, all these Channel 101 kids.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd my dad, I walked him out to his car after he spent that time.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nYou met him that night at the bar.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:51.000\nAnd it was like, we were just celebrating the fact that, oh god, we got,\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nwe're going to do a sketch show that's based on Channel 101.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nWe've been doing this thing for no money forever\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nand now we're going to do a couple episodes of this thing\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:00.000\non this basic cable show and station.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:03.000\nAnd then we went out to the car and my dad was like,\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nI can't remember what he said.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nHe's like, oh, that's pretty impressive.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\nGot a lot of people in there and they look up to you a lot.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:19.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, well, I mean, I just wanted to be you.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:24.000\nThat's all I understand a man to be.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nAnd I just hugged him.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:33.000\nWhen you asked the question, how was the phone call for Father's Day,\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nit was like, it's nothing.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nHave you eaten any deviled eggs lately?\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nYes, I have.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nThey're good.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nThey're so deviled.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nI got to go buy.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:49.000\nIt's not even like there's a well of emotion pushing against the dam.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:55.000\nIt's just like, it's never, that's not the channel through which\n\n26:55.000 --> 27:00.000\nmy admiration for him, my connection with him is ever going to exist.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:07.000\nThat unconditional weird mammalian love where it's just like,\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:11.000\noh, my dad took the fishes, showed me how to throw a ball.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nMy dad was crippled.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nHe didn't know how to throw a ball.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nHe was a nerd like me.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:24.000\nBut it's technical.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:28.000\nThere's so much love there, so much importance, so much aberration,\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:33.000\nbut it's going through channels on the circuit board\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:36.000\nthat are not designed to carry that signal.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:41.000\nYou're putting hugs through a fucking fiber-optic wire,\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:46.000\nbut the stuff is getting through there, and then sometimes it's, I don't know.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nHow old is he now?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\n30.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nHe also invented time travel.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:55.000\nI buried the lead on this.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nI don't know, he's probably 60.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nI'm a bad son, I don't know.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:02.000\nI don't know what color his eyes are, I don't know.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:07.000\nMy dad, he was the super dad, he was 40 or 41 when he had me.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.000\nI've always known him, he just looked like George Clooney\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:13.000\nwith salt and pepper hair, and he could throw.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nHe taught me how to throw a fucking curveball\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nwhen you weren't allowed to in Little League,\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nbecause it was bad for your arm, which is why my right arm is no range of movement.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nI can scratch the back of my head with my left arm,\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nand my right arm doesn't do anything,\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nbecause I could throw a wicked breaking ball as a child.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:31.000\nThey found out that throwing balls is bad for kids' arms?\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nThey said that you're not allowed to throw curveballs\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:37.000\nbecause it's a really unnatural movement on your shoulder and elbows and stuff.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:42.000\nI played tennis and stuff, but also he could fix anything, do anything.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:45.000\nHe was like Monpojo, he moved west from Nebraska,\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nand I was just in Nebraska two days ago,\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:51.000\n50 miles away from the Davis farm where he was born in between two towns,\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:54.000\nand they really moved during the Dust Bowl,\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:58.000\nand he farmed beans and hops and whatever grew,\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nand he went to Oregon, then came down to California,\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:04.000\nand then by the time he was a teenager, he had hit a car,\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:07.000\nand he went to the Korean War and then came back,\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.000\nand he was like this really groovy Californian guy,\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nbut he could build and do anything.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nHe's like a fuck-off artist.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:19.000\nHe could draw or paint, sculpt, anything with his hands he can do,\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nengineering of any sort.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nIf a horse nearby was winning, and he goes,\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nthe horse is giving birth, I'll be right back.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nHe's the guy that could do it.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:32.000\nIf the captain and the navigator and the copilot all had bad fish,\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nand the plane's going down,\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:37.000\nthe fuselage of the plane would instinctively look at my dad,\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nand go, that's our man.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:42.000\nAnd he's 80 years old, but he came and saw a show\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:45.000\nin Vegas with Drew Carey and the Hooseline gang,\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:50.000\nand he's white hair, kind of a turtleneck and a jacket,\n\n29:50.000

And he took it away from me\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nlike organizing the kids\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nand doing all this stuff and, and, uh...\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nNathan will sit over there.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nYeah.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nExactly.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nThe cake\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nwill be shaped like a skull.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nCandles emerging from its eyes\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nsockets.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nEight obelisks set a flame.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nThe power\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nof my birth will be recognized.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nYeah.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nBut, but he kind of had a twisted sense\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nof humor.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nDon't worry about that.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nWe were at the beach.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nHe was in junior high and we were at the beach\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nand he got on his mind, he wanted to, uh,\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\ncatch a seagull.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nSo, this is in Manitura somewhere.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nSo how do you catch a seagull?\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nWell, like any animal, you set up some food\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nand so he told us what to do.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nKind of half buried himself in sand\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nand then put a towel over himself.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nAnd then we\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nhad, like, Cheetos\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nabout ten feet away leading to right\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\non top of his chest.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nAnd, and then he waited\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nand he was very patient.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nI mean, I would use a box.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nIt sounds like he wanted to catch and terrify a seagull.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nWell, he did.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nAnd, and, and I want to tell you\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nall of us humans, there's a reason\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nwe have these brows here\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nbecause he caught the seagull\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nwith the towel and wrapped it around\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nand the seagull went\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nand all Spencer could see\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nis like the seagull's throat\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\ncoming at his eye.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nAnd obviously this protected his eye\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nfrom getting pecked out at which point\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nyou realize as a parent this probably wasn't the smartest thing\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nthat you could do.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nBut so he caught the seagull\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nand then, then, I don't know why\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nbut he had some string\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nand he tied it to his foot\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nand then he kind of flew him around like a kite\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nfor the rest of the day.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nWell,\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nit's like\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nthat scene from Game of Thrones\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nwith a dragon.\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nYeah, it's Spencer Joffrey.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nThen you give him a crossbow\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nfor his 16th birthday and\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nI mean, so,\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nWait, wait, wait, no, no, no.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nWhat happened to the seagull?\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nWell, we decided that\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nsomebody might come along at a certain point\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nand find us after some people were\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nkind of pointing their fingers at us and stuff.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nI mean, did you just let it go and hit it?\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nYeah, still got a string attached to it to this day.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nOh, probably so.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nI mean, if you\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nask Spencer a question about anything\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nit doesn't matter if you're asking about his relationship\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nwith his father or the economy\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nor what we should do next week for\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nD&D or how he's feeling or what he had for lunch.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nI mean, he's kind of got that\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nhe's staring off\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\ninto space and talking like this\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nand yeah,\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nyeah, my dad's here.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nAnd it's like,\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nhave you ever\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nI just\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nlike, is it a thankless job\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nlike I was describing earlier?\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nLike, do you feel like, hey,\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nfuck you, man, like, I'm your dad.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nLike,\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nbe a\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nfan of mine.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nYeah, it's somewhat thankless.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nBut it's hard because\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nhe's right in that wheelhouse age you're talking about\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nwhere you see,\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nyou start to see a transition\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nand you know, I've been trying to get Spencer\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nto\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nmove on with his life for a while.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nWhich he just has, he's just moved out.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nYeah, yeah, like a month ago.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nI've been trying for three years but he thinks\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nhe thinks it's because\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nI hate him and I'm like\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nwell, to me\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nthe biggest value of college\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nis that you're getting out of the house\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nand learning\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nto live on your own.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nAnd he didn't\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nknow that college he decided not to\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nbecause, you know, he was\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\ntoo smart.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nWell, a lot smarter than all of his teachers.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nYeah, I went to college and\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nit's not all it's cracked up to be.\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nYeah, I went to college and got a degree\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nand I say it's not all it's cracked up to be.\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nI dropped out, I started doing\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\ngetting out of your parents' house\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nwas like, the thing that I needed to do\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nwas go smoke two packs of cigarettes a day\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nand do stand up and drink a lot.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nLike, kind of fine,\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nbut I don't want to get him into a roulette ball.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nYou just need to get the world spinning underneath you\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nand you're just going to land somewhere\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nspecific and it can't be your parents' house.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nRight.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nAnd who knows where it's going to lead.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nI feel like we should get Spencer up here\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nbecause we need to\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\nprotect me.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nSomebody help me!\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nSomebody help me, somebody help me!\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\nCheck, check, check, check, check,\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\ncheck, check, check, check, check, check,\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:45.240\nCheck, check, check, check to the world.\n\n50:45.240 --> 50:49.120\nIt's a good-looking crowd.\n\n50:49.120 --> 50:51.000\nSo when did your balls, uh-\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.740\nYeah, okay, I got to clear something up real quick.\n\n50:54.740 --> 50:58.160\nWhen I was looking around, uh, mid-birth, I wasn't like,\n\n50:58.160 --> 50:59.960\nI'm not so sure I want to come out here,\n\n50:59.960 --> 51:05.240\nI was like, hey, you guys, don't freak out.\n\n51:05.240 --> 51:09.000\nBut my balls are huge.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.080\nI've been watching him for nine months.\n\n51:11.080 --> 51:17.080\nI'm smart enough to know balls don't need to be this big.\n\n51:17.080 --> 51:21.240\nThey went back to normal, trust me.\n\n51:21.240 --> 51:22.240\nI don't believe you.\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:26.080\nThere's going to be this whole movement, like show us your scrotal certificate.\n\n51:26.080 --> 51:30.080\nOr just take your balls out.\n\n51:30.080 --> 51:32.640\nI'm behind a table.\n\n51:32.640 --> 51:33.640\nIs there anything?\n\n51:33.640 --> 51:41.000\nMeaning they're already out.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:42.640\nI've always had my suspicions.\n\n51:42.640 --> 51:43.640\nYeah, yeah.\n\n51:43.640 --> 51:52.680\nSpencer has polyhedral balls, just pointed 20 sides.\n\n51:52.680 --> 51:54.560\nYou just recently moved out of your place.\n\n51:54.560 --> 51:55.560\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n51:55.560 --> 52:00.760\nYou were living with your parents and now you're, and I don't know, like Spencer was\n\n52:00.760 --> 52:03.480\nworking in the back of the Apple store.\n\n52:03.480 --> 52:09.520\nNow I'm bringing him on as, then this doesn't seem like a glorious upgrade, but Spencer's\n\n52:09.520 --> 52:16.120\ngoing to be my personal assistant as I'm working over at Community.\n\n52:16.120 --> 52:19.320\nBut really I want it to be like kind of an apprenticeship because you're a creative guy\n\n52:19.320 --> 52:23.400\nand I think you have writing aspirations and certainly have writing potential.\n\n52:23.400 --> 52:25.800\nI think, I kind of trust you.\n\n52:25.800 --> 52:32.560\nLike I always have a difficulty with, like when you have an assistant, like when I was\n\n52:32.560 --> 52:35.760\ntalking earlier about how my dad's in the trailer park and blah, blah, blah, don't kiss\n\n52:35.760 --> 52:36.760\nanyone's ass.\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:39.760\nPart of what comes with that is like, don't tell other people what to do.\n\n52:39.760 --> 52:42.840\nDon't be a fucking dick.\n\n52:42.840 --> 52:47.360\nYou don't have it on your right, and that really gets in the way of delegating rooms\n\n52:47.360 --> 52:51.680\nfull of writers and having someone get you coffee and all this stuff.\n\n52:51.680 --> 52:54.720\nYou feel like you want to apologize every time you ask someone to do something, but that\n\n52:54.720 --> 52:59.560\njust makes it more uncharismatic and oftentimes you're just doing more harm than good.\n\n52:59.560 --> 53:06.480\nMy point being, yeah, I mean, you're going to follow me around now, you're going to sit\n\n53:06.480 --> 53:14.920\nin the writer's room and sit there with your beard and watch me work with the writers on\n\n53:14.920 --> 53:17.800\na community.\n\n53:17.800 --> 53:22.900\nIt's a crazy trajectory because you came to Harmontown, Spencer, without telling anybody\n\n53:22.900 --> 53:26.400\nthat you really felt like you should be playing D&D with Dan Harmon.\n\n53:26.400 --> 53:31.800\nThen that night, he says, anybody here, Dungeon Master, you do.\n\n53:31.800 --> 53:36.960\nYou come up, you're in the show, we go on tour together, and you're a huge part of our\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:37.960\nshow now.\n\n53:37.960 --> 53:43.720\nWe've taken him away from Andy here, he's moved out to Hollywood.\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:46.960\nBut Andy was pushing that rock out the door for three years.\n\n53:46.960 --> 53:52.560\nI wish I lived where Spencer does right now, just down the street from Paramount.\n\n53:52.560 --> 53:53.560\nThat's going to be perfect.\n\n53:53.560 --> 53:54.560\nYeah.\n\n53:54.560 --> 53:55.560\nJust down the street.\n\n53:55.560 --> 53:57.560\nI'm still processing it.\n\n53:57.560 --> 53:58.560\nI guess.\n\n53:58.560 --> 53:59.560\nWait, wait.\n\n53:59.560 --> 54:00.560\nSo you've got a place.\n\n54:00.560 --> 54:03.560\nThree doors down from Paramount?\n\n54:03.560 --> 54:05.280\nFour doors.\n\n54:05.280 --> 54:09.320\nDid you foresee, did you foresee working on community like you first saw playing D&D with\n\n54:09.320 --> 54:10.320\nDan?\n\n54:10.320 --> 54:11.320\nNo, it's all just bullshit, man.\n\n54:11.320 --> 54:12.320\nIt's crazy.\n\n54:12.320 --> 54:15.400\nIt's, you know, Jackson is a guy who I met through Dustin.\n\n54:15.400 --> 54:19.680\nWe all share similar birthdays, so we met at like a joint birthday party we had.\n\n54:19.680 --> 54:22.960\nJackson is a guy who comes to Harmontown all the time.\n\n54:22.960 --> 54:27.720\nYeah, and so he's a cool guy, and so we got to talking and we went to an arcade and played\n\n54:27.720 --> 54:28.720\nsome video games.\n\n54:28.720 --> 54:30.600\nI mean, you know, talking, nerd stuff.\n\n54:30.600 --> 54:35.040\nThis is why the moon colony is going to work, because society is going to be, instead of\n\n54:35.040 --> 54:40.400\nelections you just have shamanic coincidences.\n\n54:40.400 --> 54:41.400\nThat's all it's been.\n\n54:41.400 --> 54:44.760\nAnd then he just, one time he was like, hey man, you should come room here.\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:48.680\nIt's really cheap, and it was the first time I'd like seen any place I could move out to\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:51.000\nthat was within my money.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:55.120\nI had just gotten the job at Apple not too long ago increasing my income, but you know,\n\n54:55.120 --> 54:58.680\nstill finding an affordable place was alluding me.\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:03.360\nAnd I've watched a lot of documentaries about cults and things, and I see where everyone\n\n55:03.360 --> 55:06.680\ngets tripped up, like cults that work.\n\n55:06.680 --> 55:12.200\nThey all start with an awesome guy like me saying, hey, it's cool, man.\n\n55:12.200 --> 55:17.000\nI'm not awesome, and then everyone's like, yeah, but you are, and I'm like, all right,\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.920\nif you insist.\n\n55:19.920 --> 55:23.320\nAnd then you go and get a place like on the moon, or in Maui, or something.\n\n55:23.320 --> 55:30.880\nAnd the downfall is always when the old fat guy at the top that started it all starts\n\n55:30.880 --> 55:36.800\nto go, yeah, you know, and it's like, hey, you know, if you're 16 and you're a girl,\n\n55:36.800 --> 55:41.800\nyou know, like, hey, ooh.\n\n55:41.800 --> 55:49.480\nAnd you find a rose in your pillow at night, so that means it's time for you and I to play\n\n55:49.480 --> 55:50.480\nMonopoly.\n\n55:50.480 --> 55:52.200\nAre you going to fuck Spencer?\n\n55:52.200 --> 55:53.200\nWhat's going on here?\n\n55:53.200 --> 55:54.600\nWhere is this going?\n\n55:54.600 --> 56:00.000\nI'm making my promise to our moon colony that I will not fuck your daughters or you.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:07.160\nI am in love with Aaron, and I will stick to the, you know, because it seems like that's\n\n56:07.160 --> 56:11.720\nthe shoelace that trips every cult leader up, that when they, when they, when they, when\n\n56:11.720 --> 56:15.440\nthey go like, they just can't avoid the temptation, they go like, oh, and I could really parlay\n\n56:15.440 --> 56:17.560\nthis and just smash in some puss.\n\n56:17.560 --> 56:23.400\nAnd it's just like, it's not worth it, you know, it's, it just fucks everything up.\n\n56:23.400 --> 56:24.400\nWhat was that?\n\n56:24.400 --> 56:25.880\nHey, Aaron, what was the name of that documentary?\n\n56:25.880 --> 56:26.880\nWho's that guy?\n\n56:26.880 --> 56:27.880\nThe Source Family.\n\n56:27.880 --> 56:28.880\nThe Source Family.\n\n56:28.880 --> 56:29.880\nPlease, everyone watch.\n\n56:29.880 --> 56:30.880\nI'm not kidding.\n\n56:30.880 --> 56:31.880\nIt's like laughing.\n\n56:31.880 --> 56:43.160\nHey, it's really interesting.\n\n56:43.160 --> 56:44.160\nAaron, just get out here.\n\n56:44.160 --> 56:47.160\nAaron McAthe, everybody.\n\n56:47.160 --> 56:58.080\nNo, no, please watch this documentary called The Source Family.\n\n56:58.080 --> 56:59.080\nIt's amazing.\n\n56:59.080 --> 57:00.880\nI recommended the WikiLeaks thing.\n\n57:00.880 --> 57:07.680\nAnd I want to stress, I got, I got a couple of tweets from WikiLeaks impassioned people.\n\n57:07.680 --> 57:13.800\nI did not mean to imply that the documentary WikiLeaks, We Steal Secrets is somehow like\n\n57:13.800 --> 57:15.080\nthe full story.\n\n57:15.080 --> 57:22.840\nI got, I got like all these tweets that were like, you know, from people that I think are\n\n57:22.840 --> 57:27.520\nprobably on the right side of justice and stuff who are like, yeah, that documentary's\n\n57:27.520 --> 57:28.520\nbullshit.\n\n57:28.520 --> 57:32.360\nI always leave a third party makes a documentary about something that you're that, you know,\n\n57:32.360 --> 57:38.040\nlike into the, and it's two hours long, you're going to think it should have been six hours\n\n57:38.040 --> 57:40.920\nlong and should have included this and that and that and that and that.\n\n57:40.920 --> 57:46.880\nThis is a two hour documentary that like tries to objectively or like, like, like concisely\n\n57:46.880 --> 57:50.560\nkind of like, like explain this like fascinating story.\n\n57:50.560 --> 57:54.840\nI never said, oh man, this is the final word on whether you should respect anything.\n\n57:54.840 --> 57:56.080\nI think systems suck.\n\n57:56.080 --> 57:59.120\nI think Julian Assange seems like an awesome fucking guy.\n\n57:59.120 --> 58:05.480\nI don't, I don't know what like how fair that documentary is in terms of how many details\n\n58:05.480 --> 58:08.600\nI've had to cut out in order to be two hours long.\n\n58:08.600 --> 58:13.080\nBut anyways, I, when I recommend something, it's because it's, it's, it's like, it's\n\n58:13.080 --> 58:15.080\ninteresting to watch it for two hours.\n\n58:15.080 --> 58:16.880\nSo two, two more recommendations.\n\n58:16.880 --> 58:21.800\nWatch this source family documentary, it'll blow your fucking mind.\n\n58:21.800 --> 58:24.040\nIt's about this cult that I've never heard of before.\n\n58:24.040 --> 58:29.320\nIt's an amazing study in the, in the evolution of a cult, which is not necessarily an evil\n\n58:29.320 --> 58:30.320\nthing.\n\n58:30.320 --> 58:32.280\nLike a cult, it's just like, cults are neither good nor bad.\n\n58:32.280 --> 58:35.520\nThey're just this phenomenon that spring up and happen.\n\n58:35.520 --> 58:39.680\nAnd, and then also we went and saw this is the end tonight at the Arclight.\n\n58:39.680 --> 58:44.800\nIt's a very funny comedy movie everyone's like, I can get behind a big mainstream successful\n\n58:44.800 --> 58:45.800\ncomedy movie.\n\n58:45.800 --> 58:46.800\nI was delighted by it.\n\n58:46.800 --> 58:47.800\nGo see it.\n\n58:47.800 --> 58:48.800\nSeth, Seth Rogen's back everybody.\n\n58:48.800 --> 58:49.800\nKevin's.\n\n58:49.800 --> 58:54.240\nI felt like I was 10 years old watching Ghostbusters again.\n\n58:54.240 --> 58:56.480\nI was like, it was really, really funny.\n\n58:56.480 --> 59:01.520\nIf anyone goes and sees this is the end and thinks that it's not worth your ticket price,\n\n59:01.520 --> 59:06.880\nI will, I will debate you online because I've seen a lot of shitty movies.\n\n59:06.880 --> 59:07.880\nI'm 40 years old.\n\n59:07.880 --> 59:08.880\nI'm really jaded.\n\n59:08.880 --> 59:14.080\nThe last thing I'm going to enjoy is a movie about a bunch of famous yahoo's playing themselves\n\n59:14.080 --> 59:16.080\nin a screwball comedy.\n\n59:16.080 --> 59:18.520\nLike I, I, I thought it was delightful.\n\n59:18.520 --> 59:20.520\nAll right.\n\n59:20.520 --> 59:21.520\nSpencer, what's your thoughts on that?\n\n59:21.520 --> 59:22.520\nSpencer, don't toe to toe with your dad.\n\n59:22.520 --> 59:23.520\nYeah.\n\n59:23.520 --> 59:24.520\nFight.\n\n59:24.520 --> 59:25.520\nFather's Day fight.\n\n59:25.520 --> 59:26.520\nLet's, let's clear the air.\n\n59:26.520 --> 59:27.520\nLet's clear the air right now.\n\n59:27.520 --> 59:28.520\nOkay.\n\n59:28.520 --> 59:29.640\nFirst of all, tell him you love him.\n\n59:29.640 --> 59:30.640\nI love you.\n\n59:30.640 --> 59:38.640\nCould we get that in more yet then?\n\n59:38.640 --> 59:44.040\nNow standing on top of a stage, Spencer is awkwardly goaded into showing affection for\n\n59:44.040 --> 59:49.040\nhis paternal relatives.\n\n59:49.040 --> 01:00:00.040\nAnd then, uh, I, I, Spencer, you got balls as big as your heart.\n\n01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.040\nThat's the show, right?\n\n01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.040\nAnd, and my first, that's, that's my tombstone.\n\n01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:17.040\nUh, I assume your, your dad should play Kumail's character, Kumail.\n\n01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040\nOh yeah.\n\n01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040\nThat'll be awesome.\n\n01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040\nYeah.\n\n01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.040\nKumail, not Johnny, can't make it tonight.\n\n01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.040\nSo.\n\n01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040\nHas your dad ever played D&D with you?\n\n01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040\nNot to my knowledge.\n\n01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.040\nOh, so this is a very special Father's Day episode.\n\n01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040\nIt really is.\n\n01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040\nI did it.\n\n01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:39.040\nI, I really, I have a great podcast.\n\n01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.640\nIt's just, I don't even work at it.\n\n01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.840\nIt's just my voice, you know?\n\n01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.040\nIf you were to fire me, Jeff, uh, I think we would, the critics would go, something's\n\n01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040\nmissing, something's missing.\n\n01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.040\nI think something's missing.\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.040\nWhat the fuck do you think is missing?\n\n01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040\nUnbelievable.\n\n01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040\nThe outrage.\n\n01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.840\nLike, like, like, like, I had so much retroactive outrage, I can't talk about it.\n\n01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.080\nIt's too uncharismatic.\n\n01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.040\nI just have to sit on my totally justified outrage.\n\n01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:13.240\nAll the arguments I looked at online, I was like, well, I think season three was so shitty\n\n01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.040\nthat season four, it just seems like, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.040\nFuck.\n\n01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.040\nMother fuck you in the fucking mother fuck.\n\n01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.040\nFuck you.\n\n01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.040\nFuck your mother with your father.\n\n01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040\nFuck you.\n\n01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.040\nLike, like, fuck you, man.\n\n01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.040\nLike, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, you,\n\n01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.040\nyou, people hate me that much that they're that willing to debate the possibility that\n\n01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.040\nI wasn't fuck you.\n\n01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.040\nLike, like, like, wow, I must be really unlikable.\n\n01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040\nJesus.\n\n01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.040\nWell, I'd like to say, I think the key to the success of the podcast, because my wife\n\n01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:57.040\nand I have discussed this, is really that your heart is as big as Spencer's balls.\n\n01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.040\nAll right.\n\n01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.040\nI just got the key to the city.\n\n01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:08.040\nAnd also, I can say with almost certain lack of fear of contradiction that we have a title\n\n01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.040\nfor our next episode.\n\n01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.040\nIs it your heart is as big as Spencer's balls?\n\n01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040\nBalls with big as Spencer's heart?\n\n01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040\nOh, man.\n\n01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:24.040\nThis is redundant, but you should know that everyone in the booth was crying when you were\n\n01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040\ntalking about your dad.\n\n01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040\nWhen I say everyone, I mean Dustin Marshall, our producer.\n\n01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040\nWe had to cry.\n\n01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:36.040\nI mean, it's, well, the father son stuff is, and it's not a fake thing.\n\n01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:41.040\nIt's like when you watch Lion King, when you read Hamlet, when you father son stuff just\n\n01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.040\nlike gets you, like, because there is a power there.\n\n01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:52.040\nI mean, like, it's almost unfair because the reason the power is there is precisely because\n\n01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.040\nthere's not an actual visceral connection on the level of the actual people that are\n\n01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.040\ncarrying the child, squeezing it out at their own peril.\n\n01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:10.040\nAnd if that child should be female, you know, the bond between, it's like us of the dangling\n\n01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:17.040\nwee-wee, when you have a little wee-wee and you use your little wee-wee to make another\n\n01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.040\nthing with a little wee-wee.\n\n01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.040\nWe let us of the dangling wee-wee be your cult name.\n\n01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:34.040\nYou know, it's like, because there is absolutely nothing, that wee-wee, that male symbol, you\n\n01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.040\nknow, the universal symbol for male and female, the male one is like this circle with an arrow\n\n01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040\ncoming out of it.\n\n01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.040\nI think that's so potent because it's like men are just this cursed half of the species\n\n01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.040\nthat have a life expectancy of, you know, what, 20 years less.\n\n01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:56.040\nAnd we lose our hair as we get older because we're riddled with this disease called testosterone.\n\n01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:05.040\nWe don't actively create with our bodies, which life in the beginning before the development\n\n01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:13.040\nof sexual reproduction, all cells were these asexual, reproducing cells.\n\n01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:21.040\nLike if you, all life was in the same soup and life meant creating new life.\n\n01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:29.040\nIt meant that you were never more than one unit of life away from a thing that was actually\n\n01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.040\nyou in some real way.\n\n01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:38.040\nAnd then when plants were, you know, developing and trying to figure out how they could develop\n\n01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.040\nfaster, sexual reproduction started happening, which would carry it into a biological, what\n\n01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.040\ndo you call it, whatever, it was more advanced than plants.\n\n01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:55.040\nLike men, drones, like these things that create sperm and we just shoot it wherever we can\n\n01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040\nshoot it.\n\n01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:02.040\nLike we kind of like walk the earth and like we're disconnected from God.\n\n01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.040\nAnd we fetishize that and we have a big murder complex about it.\n\n01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:14.040\nSo we build skyscrapers and missiles and they could just hate yourselves and each other.\n\n01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:20.040\nI'm going to make a bigger hole in the world before I leave than you and I'm going to fuck\n\n01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.040\nmore pussy than you.\n\n01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040\nBecause we're just nothing.\n\n01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.040\nIt's like, I'm not saying feel sorry for men.\n\n01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:36.040\nIt's just like, it's amazing like how we, I don't know, I lost it.\n\n01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040\nCum is amazing.\n\n01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040\nHappy Father's Day.\n\n01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.040\nMay your balls be with your heart.\n\n01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.040\nThe moralist, Dan loves cum, you guys.\n\n01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040\nJust take that away.\n\n01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.040\nI love cum.\n\n01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.040\nYou can't throw any of it out.\n\n01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.040\nI love cum, Spencer's dad.\n\n01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.040\nYour son's coming to work for me on Monday.\n\n01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.040\nIt's going to be great.\n\n01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.040\nNeverland Ranch.\n\n01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.040\nAlternate title, I love cum.\n\n01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.040\nAll right.\n\n01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.040\nErin, you called your dad, right?\n\n01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040\nI did.\n\n01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040\nI called my dad.\n\n01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.040\nMy dad actually left a Father's Day.\n\n01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:16.040\nMy dad calls me when it's Father's Day or his birthday in the morning and leaves a voicemail.\n\n01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:20.040\nHe left me a voicemail about Dan speaking about that father-son connection.\n\n01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.040\nI mean, my dad's so excited about you.\n\n01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040\nHe wants you to be his son.\n\n01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.040\nSo he called me asking me about you.\n\n01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.040\nBut yeah, my dad has an adorable habit of hanging up on me, which isn't...\n\n01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.040\nIt's not cold.\n\n01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:35.040\nIt's like, hey, Erin, how's it going?\n\n01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.040\nOh, it's going great.\n\n01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.040\nDan and I are hanging out.\n\n01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040\nWe're about to get dinner.\n\n01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040\nOh, good, good, good.\n\n01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040\nMy day was good.\n\n01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.040\nI grilled and I hung out with a wife and I took a nap.\n\n01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.040\nIt was a real great day.\n\n01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040\nAnd then click.\n\n01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040\nThey're just like, hang up.\n\n01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040\nAnd they're like, yeah.\n\n01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.040\nHello?\n\n01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.040\nMaybe because he was in the Navy.\n\n01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.040\nHe thinks it's like, he's just talking to the bridge.\n\n01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.040\nBut then you say out.\n\n01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:07.040\nCan I play his Father's Day voicemail real quick?\n\n01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040\nIt's 10 seconds.\n\n01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040\nIt's about you.\n\n01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040\nYou can't be my phone.\n\n01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.040\nYou know what a tight ship we run here.\n\n01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.040\nI hope this is nice and tidy.\n\n01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.040\nSo anyways, yeah, sperm.\n\n01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.040\nAll right, here we go.\n\n01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.040\nAnd my dad's also a great...\n\n01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040\nHe's a great guy.\n\n01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.040\nHe's a little selfish, but he's great.\n\n01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040\nHe's a pastor, right?\n\n01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.040\nHe's a pastor.\n\n01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040\nHe's a minister.\n\n01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.040\nHe's a minister of God.\n\n01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040\nYeah.\n\n01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.040\nHe's a minister of God.\n\n01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040\nWe were drinking a whole lot yesterday as we had to\n\n01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:42.040\nbecause we were watching a shitty TV show all day.\n\n01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.040\nWhat season was it?\n\n01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.040\nSeason, season, fan fiction, heart, no heart.\n\n01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040\nI'm so, so sorry.\n\n01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040\nRemember what he said?\n\n01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.040\nWhat Greenblatt said, we're bringing the heart back?\n\n01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.040\nI'm not allowed to express it.\n\n01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040\nI can't do it.\n\n01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.040\nThat's not fair.\n\n01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.040\nI fuck you.\n\n01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.040\nSo we were drinking a lot right now.\n\n01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.040\nWhat heart?\n\n01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040\nWhere was the heart?\n\n01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040\nWell, the heart.\n\n01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.040\nMy heart.\n\n01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.040\nMy heart is the heart.\n\n01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:16.040\nWhat about Bridget and Troy's really intimate love affair?\n\n01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.040\nDid you guys see the fountain scene?\n\n01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040\nThe heart.\n\n01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040\nLove.\n\n01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040\nLove has never been.\n\n01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.040\nThe heart was the size of regular baby's balls.\n\n01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:34.040\nThe heart in that show was as moving as balls.\n\n01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.040\nIt's a picture of balls.\n\n01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040\nI apologize.\n\n01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040\nWhatever.\n\n01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040\nNo one cares what I think about community.\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040\nIt's no stakes.\n\n01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040\nNo one's going to fire me from anything.\n\n01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040\nYou're not going to fire me.\n\n01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.040\nYou're only going to promote me if I am.\n\n01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.040\nExcuse me.\n\n01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.040\nOh, but we were drinking and I got real emotional.\n\n01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040\nNo.\n\n01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.040\nWe were drinking and we were talking about fathers.\n\n01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.040\nI've done this many times before.\n\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:08.040\nI've compared my father to Dan because he's a pastor and he has people who, he has a flock.\n\n01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040\nYou know.\n\n01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040\nRight.\n\n01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040\nIt's a whole thing.\n\n01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.040\nBut he's also really obsessed with himself and his, how.\n\n01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.040\nIt's not, you're not a flock.\n\n01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040\nYou guys don't worry about that.\n\n01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040\nIt's other people.\n\n01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.040\nCut to a guy in the back that's dressed like a sheep that hangs his head and walks out.\n\n01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040\nAll right.\n\n01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.040\nThis is my dad's voicemail.\n\n01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.040\nWait, where's the speaker?\n\n01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040\nOn the bottom.\n\n01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.040\nI know I'm in trouble when Jeff Davis is telling me a technical thing.\n\n01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040\nAll right.\n\n01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.040\nHere we go.\n\n01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:50.040\nHey, you're in this with Dan Holland say hi.\n\n01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.040\nSo Dan, what are you guys doing later?\n\n01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.040\nIt's fine.\n\n01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040\nI have a speaker.\n\n01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:02.040\nJust wanted to let you know your, your boyfriend is a fat alcoholic piece of shit and he's,\n\n01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.040\nhe's going to live to 48 the way he eats.\n\n01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.040\nIt's a reference to the Chevy Chase voicemail.\n\n01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040\nAll right.\n\n01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040\nHere we go.\n\n01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.040\nSorry, Andy.\n\n01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040\nHi, Aaron.\n\n01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040\nThis is dad.\n\n01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.040\nI just like to give you a call.\n\n01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.040\nI heard that Dan got the community back again.\n\n01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.040\nSo I just wanted to talk to you and get an update and see how y'all are doing.\n\n01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.040\nWe'll have you.\n\n01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.040\nI'll talk to you later.\n\n01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.040\nBye-bye.\n\n01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.040\nI mean, that's his father's day voicemail.\n\n01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.040\nThat's just a voicemail.\n\n01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.040\nNo, I know it's just a voicemail.\n\n01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.040\nAren't you supposed to be the one calling him for Father's Day?\n\n01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.040\nRight?\n\n01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040\nYes.\n\n01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040\nYes.\n\n01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040\nBut you're a dad.\n\n01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.040\nYou have to say that.\n\n01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.040\nBy the way, you guys haven't talked about it.\n\n01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:51.040\nFor the podcast listeners, Spencer's dad looks like, if there was a superhero called dad,\n\n01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.040\nyou looked like the daddest dad ever.\n\n01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.040\nNo one's looked more dad.\n\n01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.040\nYeah, like the dad from Family Guy.\n\n01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:06.040\nRegular son of someone was working in the nuclear facility when an unprecedented bolt\n\n01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:11.040\nof dad energies turned him into...\n\n01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.040\nYou have a kind face, sensible glasses, a button-up shirt.\n\n01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040\nThat's what it's really like.\n\n01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040\nDo you like to garden?\n\n01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:22.040\nAs a friend of mine said about a kind face, the kind of face that you'd like to shat on.\n\n01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040\nOh.\n\n01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.040\nThat's just one variation.\n\n01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.040\nYes, I do like to garden, actually, although I'm getting too old for it now.\n\n01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.040\nVegetables, flowers?\n\n01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:39.040\nWell, we had a backyard which was a two-to-one ratio hill, and I spent like two years of\n\n01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.040\nmy life making that into a kind of a sunset garden.\n\n01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.040\nSince then, it's gone to seed and everything, but it was fun.\n\n01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040\nRight.\n\n01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.040\nSee, and then at this point, his foes, which are the people who can't have children are\n\n01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.040\nshrinking and dying as he's explaining, but that was a weird reaction.\n\n01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.040\nI was thinking that he was a superhero.\n\n01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.040\nThat's a weird bit.\n\n01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040\nAaron, Aaron, I'm sorry.\n\n01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040\nCan we hear that message again?\n\n01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.040\nBecause that was fascinating.\n\n01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.040\nI feel like I missed some of the nuance in that one.\n\n01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.040\nI feel like maybe we could revisit that message.\n\n01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.040\nI mean, maybe what we should do is listen to all of his voicemails and we kind of piece\n\n01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040\nit together.\n\n01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:25.040\nIt's meaningful to me because my dad, now my dad just talks to me about, damn, he doesn't\n\n01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.040\ntalk.\n\n01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.040\nWhich is fine, but I was thinking about the father-son connection.\n\n01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.040\nIt's true that Father's Day, I'm like, the golf clubs, I don't care.\n\n01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040\nI love my dad, but it's different.\n\n01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.040\nThere's not the same thing.\n\n01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.040\nAnd then Mother's Day is, I guess Mother's Day would be more meaningful.\n\n01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.040\nWell, Mother's Day came first.\n\n01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.040\nAnd Father's Day, because I looked it up, because I was talking to our friend Lars from\n\n01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040\nDenmark.\n\n01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.540\nFather's Day, there's different dates in different countries.\n\n01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:01.040\nIf you go to the Wikipedia page, it's like a big, long, complicated list of dates.\n\n01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.040\nBut it was an American invention.\n\n01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.040\nIt was then just adopted, I think, throughout the globe, but on different days.\n\n01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.040\nBecause they probably, I'm assuming that in Denmark, if we say, it has to be the third\n\n01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.040\nSunday of every June, they're like, well, that's Vaminsklingen.\n\n01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.040\nVaminsklingen.\n\n01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.040\nYou know what I do have?\n\n01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.040\nCan't do it there.\n\n01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.040\nYou know what I do have?\n\n01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.040\nYou know what I do have is the recording of you leaving a voicemail for Bill Murray.\n\n01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040\nThat doesn't matter.\n\n01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040\nIt's as unremarkable.\n\n01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.040\nI said, hello, Bill Murray.\n\n01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040\nIt's Dan Harmon.\n\n01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040\nGive me a call.\n\n01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040\n3-2-3.\n\n01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.040\nAll right.\n\n01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.040\n5-5-5.\n\n01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.040\nAll right.\n\n01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:41.040\nSo we should probably get to Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.040\nSpencer?\n\n01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:50.040\nIf you would pass out the character she's to Dan, and he'll pass us along, let's get\n\n01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.040\nthis shit underway.\n\n01:13:52.040 --> 01:14:01.520\nLast time on Harmontown D&D, our heroes had just slain their shadows in a combat most\n\n01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:07.160\ndeadly on the shadowy shadow plane of Shadows, a slang which also returned the adventurers\n\n01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.680\nto the material plane in the burnt down ruins of the Connie Forest.\n\n01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:18.040\nJust then, a brilliant emerald energy was released as the soul of growth began soul of growing\n\n01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.040\nthe Connie Forest back to its former glory.\n\n01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.680\nAt the same time, quarks talking dagger exploded and the ensuing magical energy cloaked itself\n\n01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:32.480\nin branches and roots and began speaking, claiming it was the soul of growth.\n\n01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.040\nThe entity greeted the travelers and thanked them for unwittingly releasing the trapped\n\n01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.040\nspirit.\n\n01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.320\nAfter arguing with a newly materialized force of nature, the gang picked a new name for the\n\n01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:49.720\nAvatar of Seasons to avoid confusion, dubbing him Rudy Woodgrowth the third.\n\n01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:58.920\nThe nature spirit gave the heroes crazy awesome nature powers before ushering them through\n\n01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.560\na tree and outside of Yellow Camp, Sharpie's father's home.\n\n01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:11.560\nBut would it be as they expected a Father's Day reunion, or would it instead be a demon\n\n01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.880\ninfested nightmare?\n\n01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.560\nWe'll find out next.\n\n01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:28.080\nThis is going to be the best Father's Day ever.\n\n01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.360\nNow who should clean their room?\n\n01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.880\nThanks Adam for the note that you left on my character sheet.\n\n01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:43.520\nMaybe Liberty Spikes because that's cool and feminine.\n\n01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:50.160\nI forgot to mention that, yeah, he put your character's hair into Liberty Spikes.\n\n01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.160\nThat happened.\n\n01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.160\nThat's how it works.\n\n01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160\nI'll just do whatever.\n\n01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:03.320\nThat's what Adam Goldberg says at the foot of every woman's bed at 5am as he refasses\n\n01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320\nhis belt.\n\n01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.600\nI gave you Liberty Spikes.\n\n01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.040\nWelcome to the wonderful world.\n\n01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.120\nShe doesn't question it because she just wants him to leave so she's like, yeah, all right.\n\n01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.760\nYou'll find out what they are later.\n\n01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:27.360\nAdam's note at the bottom of my page is, step E, I owned it, kisses Adam.\n\n01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:33.600\nIf you recall, you got season powers, but you didn't know how to use them, so Rudy Woodgrowth\n\n01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.560\nthe third was like, oh, I'll teach you your powers.\n\n01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.000\nWell, I read here that I have the armlet of winter that I can use to call up a sleet storm\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.520\ntwice a day, 10 foot radius.\n\n01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520\nEnemies might fall down.\n\n01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520\nYeah.\n\n01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.520\nSo, yeah.\n\n01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.520\nThey might fall down.\n\n01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.520\nIt's shorthand.\n\n01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.520\nRight.\n\n01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.520\nAlso a Final Fantasy I reference.\n\n01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.520\nBut yeah.\n\n01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.520\nSo.\n\n01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:01.520\nI can calm or intensify hail, sleet and snow.\n\n01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520\nYeah.\n\n01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.520\nI love it.\n\n01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.120\nAnd I mean, there's no peace of mind like having that thing because even before you\n\n01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:14.680\nuse it twice a day, you could just say to the enemy, the way you rack a pump action shotgun,\n\n01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.520\nyou might fall down.\n\n01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.520\nAnd a lot of times that's more powerful than actually having to use it.\n\n01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520\nOr them actually falling down.\n\n01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520\nIt's probable that you'll be clumsy.\n\n01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520\nSorry.\n\n01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:30.720\nI've got a 10 skill modifier on Intimidate, I bet I could combine those together.\n\n01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720\nYeah.\n\n01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.640\nHe's like a pro, you know, Jeff's been playing a lot of D&D behind the scenes.\n\n01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640\nYeah.\n\n01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640\nI'm learning, I'm figuring this shit out finally.\n\n01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.640\nYeah.\n\n01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.120\nMy armlet is the Armlet of Spring.\n\n01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.640\nIt can summon armor of thorny vines.\n\n01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640\nYeah.\n\n01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640\nTwice a day.\n\n01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.200\nYou can command the vines to stop protecting you and lash out to entangle a foe.\n\n01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.160\nAfter they stop entangling, they come back.\n\n01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160\nThat sounds pretty cool.\n\n01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.160\nYeah.\n\n01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.720\nAnd I can calm and slash intensify clouds.\n\n01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.720\nNo guys, wait for it, wait for it, I promise they're intensifying.\n\n01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.720\nJust let's stir up everything.\n\n01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720\nClouds, comma, showers.\n\n01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.720\nAre you saying that you've looked at clouds from both sides now?\n\n01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720\nAll right.\n\n01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:20.720\nSo the way I remember it is we went back to my dad's camp and what was in place there\n\n01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.720\nwas like Admiral Darkstar had taken it over and some weird shit was going on.\n\n01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.720\nYeah.\n\n01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.720\nWe went back out and do a field to see if we could learn to use our armlets.\n\n01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.720\nWe became the Four Seasons.\n\n01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720\nYeah.\n\n01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.720\nAnd there was the music that played and that was good.\n\n01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.720\nSo now we're in this field with Rudy Woodworth.\n\n01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.720\nRudy Woodgrowth III.\n\n01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.720\nYou named him.\n\n01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.720\nAnd some armlets that might make people fall down.\n\n01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:58.720\nAll right, I go back in towards and examine the foes that we were facing before.\n\n01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720\nOkay.\n\n01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:05.720\nSo you kind of crawl under this yellow canvas and you're inside the interior.\n\n01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:12.720\nIt's open top so the sunlight is kind of shining down but you're situated between two kind of empty cages.\n\n01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:19.720\nPeering between the cages you can see kind of hordes of people that look like they're in rags kind of tied to a large turbine kind of system.\n\n01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.720\nSo they're not a turbine, whatever.\n\n01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.720\nThey're spinning.\n\n01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.720\nThey're like moving it around like cattle kind of being whipped by demons.\n\n01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:35.720\nSo the main foes you see are these three gaunt demons with these scraggly kind of tentacly like beards and they're whipping these people and they seem kind of prominent.\n\n01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:48.720\nAnd occasionally you see kind of lurking guards of these slimy slug guys that look kind of like half human monstrosities and half slugs, flesh colored sliding around on the ground in patrols.\n\n01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.720\nAll right.\n\n01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.720\nSharpie, we're here to meet your dad.\n\n01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.720\nIs your dad gone or is he here?\n\n01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720\nWell, I mean, this is where he was.\n\n01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.720\nI mean, it's father's day Sharpie.\n\n01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.720\nWell, yeah, but I mean, you can't expect everything to sync up perfectly.\n\n01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.720\nDid you hear that intro?\n\n01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.720\nI know.\n\n01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.720\nMaybe I could use blood magic to locate my father like I did that one time.\n\n01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.720\nYeah.\n\n01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.720\nBlood magic under special abilities because I forced it with bad improv.\n\n01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.720\nYep.\n\n01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.720\nIt works in this world.\n\n01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.720\nWhat do they do?\n\n01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.720\nYou cut yourself and you meditated on the ensuing blood.\n\n01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.720\nCut.\n\n01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:38.720\nThe cosmic sounds of belt whippings.\n\n01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:51.720\nThe blood it drops to the floor and sinks into the ground, but it kind of after sinking into the ground, it kind of comes back out and beads up and forms a kind of arrow that leads like kind of into this area.\n\n01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.720\nNice.\n\n01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.720\nThank you.\n\n01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.720\nHappy Father's Day.\n\n01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.720\nI told you the father said bonds bigger than any system.\n\n01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.720\nI go on with these guys.\n\n01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720\nI explain.\n\n01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.720\nOkay.\n\n01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:13.720\nI start crawling like slow and low to the ground along the direction of that arrow.\n\n01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:21.720\nAnd I look back and I give them that kind of Vietnam hand signal where you put a hand up and you wave them forward.\n\n01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.720\nAnd I point out to the foes and I said, we got three slug monsters.\n\n01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.720\nWe got slug monsters in the wire.\n\n01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720\nOkay.\n\n01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720\nThat happens.\n\n01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720\nAll right.\n\n01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720\nI start approaching.\n\n01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.720\nBut are we inside or outside this tent?\n\n01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.720\nSo if quark actually came through, I'm assuming you guys did too, but maybe you didn't.\n\n01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720\nAs long as it felt safe.\n\n01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720\nYeah.\n\n01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.720\nI went through.\n\n01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720\nThere we go.\n\n01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720\nSo are these foes?\n\n01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720\nYou said these foes are past foes.\n\n01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.720\nLike we don't need to.\n\n01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.720\nI don't remember.\n\n01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.720\nNo, we saw them.\n\n01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.720\nWe never fought them.\n\n01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.720\nOh yeah.\n\n01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.720\nYeah.\n\n01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720\nOh yeah.\n\n01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.720\nCause you were gone.\n\n01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720\nSo you came into this tent, right?\n\n01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720\nSorry.\n\n01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.720\nSorry.\n\n01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.720\nIt's fine.\n\n01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.720\nI didn't even.\n\n01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.720\nIt's fine.\n\n01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.720\nIt's Father's Day.\n\n01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.720\nYou're a daughter.\n\n01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.720\nMaybe one day a mother.\n\n01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720\nNo.\n\n01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:09.720\nSo you went, you went into this tent and you saw all these demons and then you left.\n\n01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.720\nAnd now you're coming back.\n\n01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.720\nI'm distracted by how sorry the audience felt for me in that moment.\n\n01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.720\nI don't understand.\n\n01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.720\nAnyway.\n\n01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.720\nSorry.\n\n01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720\nOkay.\n\n01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720\nGot it.\n\n01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720\nI'm not explaining it twice.\n\n01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.720\nNo, I know.\n\n01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.720\nOh, he just hung up when you fucking father styled.\n\n01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.720\nYeah.\n\n01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.720\nSorry.\n\n01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.720\nOkay.\n\n01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:28.720\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.720\nProbably demons.\n\n01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720\nAll right.\n\n01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.720\nHow close am I to the nearest foe?\n\n01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:39.720\nSo you're pretty close to like a small slithering patrol of these slug dudes.\n\n01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.720\nYou're pretty far away from the nearest, the big beardy demon.\n\n01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.720\nThose guys are kind of in the very center of the camp and you're still pretty much on\n\n01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720\nthe periphery.\n\n01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720\nAll right.\n\n01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720\nAll right.\n\n01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720\nDon't get mad when I ask you this.\n\n01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720\nWhere are we?\n\n01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.720\nYou're, you're in yellow camp.\n\n01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.720\nWe're in the yellow camp inside the tent.\n\n01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:02.720\nSensor's dad, how do you, how do you feel right now watching being on stage with your son?\n\n01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.720\nOh, it's, it's awesome.\n\n01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:10.720\nEspecially like when he does a little smile, you know, a little kind of impish smile after,\n\n01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.720\nafter he just dissed you, but then he smiles to let you know he's just kidding.\n\n01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:23.720\nI mean, I can confidently say don't think I've ever been happier than I am.\n\n01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.720\nSensor gives daggers to his dad through his eyes.\n\n01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.720\nFor real?\n\n01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.720\nMy game.\n\n01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.720\nI lost.\n\n01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:36.720\nHe says, dad, get the hell off of stage and stop embarrassing my bearded ass.\n\n01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.720\nI couldn't, not on Father's Day.\n\n01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.720\nI couldn't do it on Father's Day.\n\n01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.720\nAny other day.\n\n01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.720\nSo, so I have a plan of attack.\n\n01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.720\nCan I go?\n\n01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720\nYeah.\n\n01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:56.720\nWell, I'm putting on the armlet of autumn, which can make me invisible.\n\n01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.720\nAnd I'm going straight for the big ass demon in the middle.\n\n01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.720\nAnd I'm going to use my poison dagger to try and put him away.\n\n01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.720\nUse that poison dagger.\n\n01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.720\nNow, can I ask, would that be a sneak attack?\n\n01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:19.720\nWell, yeah, since I'm invisible, I guess it would have to be.\n\n01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.720\nThere has never been a better podcast ever.\n\n01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720\nDad?\n\n01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.720\nDungeon Dad Snap.\n\n01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.720\nThere's Klaid in the back.\n\n01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.720\nLet's all drink it and just die and float it.\n\n01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.720\nWell, let me ask you this, son.\n\n01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.720\nWas it a sneak attack when I drove you to McDonald's to meet your friends and you made me drop\n\n01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:47.720\nyou off two blocks away?\n\n01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.720\nI've never done that, right?\n\n01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.720\nWhy couldn't you be invisible, Dad?\n\n01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.720\nSon, your words are like a poison dagger sometimes.\n\n01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.720\nYou don't realize how bad they can wound.\n\n01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.720\nYou just dealt six hit points to my frylings.\n\n01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.720\nWhat is your father-son bonding activity?\n\n01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.720\nLike, do you have something that you guys enjoy doing together?\n\n01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.720\nLike, fishing or...\n\n01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:14.720\nI know you guys don't play D&D together.\n\n01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.720\nThese watch Gossip Girl.\n\n01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.720\nI mean, is there a show that you guys watch together?\n\n01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.720\nNo.\n\n01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.720\nSometimes I might, when he was home and he was watching Adventure Time, I might sit down with him\n\n01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.720\nand enjoy Jake and Finn.\n\n01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.720\nSince your dad loves you, let him in.\n\n01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.720\nNo.\n\n01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.720\nNo dice.\n\n01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.720\nThis is a source of pain.\n\n01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.720\nI don't know why all of you are laughing.\n\n01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.720\nBecause it's not us.\n\n01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.720\nOh, my gosh.\n\n01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.720\nWhat I wouldn't give for a dad that would come to a show that I did.\n\n01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:01.720\nMy dad asked me routinely, how is your internet talk going?\n\n01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.720\nYeah, but you don't want to listen.\n\n01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.720\nNo, I certainly don't, no.\n\n01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.720\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.720\nThis is great.\n\n01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.720\nWell, maybe you guys should, you know, model trains or like there's got to be something.\n\n01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.720\nYou guys ever go out in the backyard, fire up the grill?\n\n01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.720\nI built him a dice tower once for D&D.\n\n01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:23.720\nWe built it together.\n\n01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.720\nOh, well, that's a thing.\n\n01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.720\nThat's not something we do.\n\n01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.720\nThat's one thing we did.\n\n01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.720\nLet me in, son.\n\n01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:41.720\nMy heart is like a cold dungeon.\n\n01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:45.720\nTalk it out the only way you know, Spencer.\n\n01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:51.720\nYou're examining my personal feelings as well as past events.\n\n01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.720\nAndy, are you and Spencer's mom experiencing any sort of empty nest syndrome following something?\n\n01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.720\nShe is.\n\n01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.720\nShe is.\n\n01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.720\nYeah.\n\n01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.720\nBut she follows.\n\n01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.720\nIs she making you wear a beard?\n\n01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.720\nNo, she'd like for me to grow my mustache back.\n\n01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.720\nI got too many bomb chicka-bombs.\n\n01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.720\nI keep seeing glimmers of your sexuality.\n\n01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.720\nIt's horrifying.\n\n01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.720\nNo, no.\n\n01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.720\nAnd glimmers of Spencer's dad's sexuality is the name of my book.\n\n01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:31.720\nMy dad one night agreed to build a robot with me.\n\n01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:38.720\nAnd for the rest of my life, there was this half-built robot in the basement.\n\n01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.720\nMetaphor.\n\n01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.720\nAnd you're like, dad, can we finish this metaphor?\n\n01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:51.720\nAnd he's like, the fact that it will never be finished is the complete metaphor.\n\n01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.720\nAll right, so Andy as Christopher has just sneak attacked invisibly into the yellow camp.\n\n01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.720\nYeah, that happened.\n\n01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.720\nAnyway, so yeah, you creep in unseen up on this, up on this demon dude, you know, straight up,\n\n01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:10.720\nand you roll your attack, which I already rolled like five minutes ago.\n\n01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:17.720\nAnd you strike as you do as you've done so many times.\n\n01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.720\nWhy am I here?\n\n01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.720\nPlease let me out.\n\n01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.720\nPlease release me.\n\n01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.720\nDealing.\n\n01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.720\n24 damage.\n\n01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.720\nShit.\n\n01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.720\nHe really is Spencer's dad.\n\n01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.720\nUnfortunately, demons are immune to poison.\n\n01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.720\nGive him that.\n\n01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.720\nYeah, so that happens.\n\n01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.720\nSpencer, before this is over, I want you both to roll a hug check.\n\n01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:55.720\nSave versus bonding.\n\n01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.720\nMy dream would be for Spencer and Andy to switch places.\n\n01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.720\nHis dad to Dungeon Master.\n\n01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.720\nI wouldn't work.\n\n01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.720\nI don't get it.\n\n01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.720\nThis is so fascinating.\n\n01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.720\nI really have never been happier.\n\n01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.720\nI love your dad more than I love anyone in my family.\n\n01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:28.720\nI, through my armlet of summer, I have acquired fiery arrows.\n\n01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.720\nYeah, that's true.\n\n01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:40.720\nI fire a single good fiery arrow at the enemy.\n\n01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.720\nOkay, so she has a plus seven on adjectives for her arrows.\n\n01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.720\nJust, I should remind you, if you read yourselves in the trappings\n\n01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:54.720\nof your fiery armor that grants your arrows flamingness,\n\n01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.720\nthat would give away your position.\n\n01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.720\nEither way, I mean, you could still do it, but I should warn you.\n\n01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:04.720\nWell, I have a sack and some...\n\n01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.720\nOh.\n\n01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.720\nNow, is that sack made of asbestos?\n\n01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720\nThank you.\n\n01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.720\nThank you, Jerky Bill.\n\n01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.720\nHow about cool rock bill these days?\n\n01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:15.720\nIt's rock bill?\n\n01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.720\nCool rock bill.\n\n01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.720\nAre you referring to his satin-y shirt?\n\n01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.720\nI'm just trying to go with new bill.\n\n01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.720\nI think it's open like jasmine bill.\n\n01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.720\nHe gave cool rocks to people, you guys.\n\n01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720\nDo you not remember this?\n\n01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720\nYes, yes.\n\n01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.720\nBill's biggest advocate.\n\n01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720\nMe too.\n\n01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.720\nYeah, Bill.\n\n01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.720\nHe gave rocks to your birthday?\n\n01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.720\nHe gave rocks to people in the audience today.\n\n01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.720\nBill, they gave me rocks.\n\n01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.720\nYeah.\n\n01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.720\nI didn't get her rocks.\n\n01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.720\nIt's this whole thing.\n\n01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.720\nBeef Jerky Bill's going to just spend some more rocks while this game happens, everybody.\n\n01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:59.720\nIf you podcast listeners hear a strange jingle-jangle of stones slapping together gently,\n\n01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.720\nlike ripples through a stream.\n\n01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.720\nBeef Jerky Bill's wearing what can only be described as Neil Diamond's last tour shirt.\n\n01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.720\nIt's kind of a dark, brown, coppery, satin affair with some nice cufflinks.\n\n01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.720\nI really like that, Bill.\n\n01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.720\nIt's definitely like an 8,000 thread count shirt.\n\n01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.720\nI like this.\n\n01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.720\nHe's sifting to the crowd with a giant Ziploc baggie full of stones.\n\n01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:27.720\nI don't want to encourage you to give a tangent, but what's the deal with the stones?\n\n01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.720\nWhat's the story?\n\n01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720\nIt's this whole thing.\n\n01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:36.720\nNormally a guy in Hollywood with a satin shirt walking around slinging rock is a whole different thing.\n\n01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:44.720\nI really wish there was someone here to rival Stone Beef Jerky Bill named Sand Andrew.\n\n01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720\nWho? Just started handing out stories.\n\n01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.720\nWouldn't it be amazing if Beef Jerky Bill's dad was here?\n\n01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:54.720\nAnd he just had a bag of, I don't know, like model trains.\n\n01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:01.720\nCan we make next week just an arbitrary specific gift night where everybody brings the crowd?\n\n01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.720\nIt's just like a big show.\n\n01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.720\nGive a pageant of gifts?\n\n01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.720\nYeah, we'll do a little show until everybody has to bring the treats.\n\n01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:12.720\nWe'll do an episode where the theme is derailment.\n\n01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.720\nSo that the show is not derailed.\n\n01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.720\nSo I don't want to give away my position.\n\n01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:29.720\nSo with my sack and my bedroll.\n\n01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:33.720\nBoth flammable.\n\n01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:38.720\nYou're going to launch an attack on demons with a sack and a sleeping bag?\n\n01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.720\nIt'll have to be clear that I'm not doing a bed and this is how I like to play.\n\n01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:48.720\nWe play a private D&D game.\n\n01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.720\nWe play a private D&D game and we were trying to get 50 pounds of copper out of a mine.\n\n01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:56.720\nAnd Erin pipes in and goes, and she plays an older gentleman who's a bard.\n\n01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:02.720\nAnd she put forth the concept of taking the cheese that she has and melting it so we could slide the copper out of the mine.\n\n01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:07.720\nIt's not that crazy.\n\n01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.720\nShe was greasing the bottom of the sack.\n\n01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.720\nHow much cheese did she carry?\n\n01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:17.720\nI had to explain like carrying capacity to everyone and then we were like, oh, everyone can carry all the copper.\n\n01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:18.720\nIt's fine.\n\n01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.720\nRight, but I still wanted to slide my copper.\n\n01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:26.720\nAnyway, after that night, Dan had a very serious talk with me, which was, do you care about this game?\n\n01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.720\nAre you taking it seriously?\n\n01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:33.720\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:44.720\nYou're making it sound like I was yelled at you after everyone left for the cheese.\n\n01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:50.720\nAnd then he hit me with his bag of holder.\n\n01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:57.720\nIt's the fact that 90% of the time, you put a beard on when everyone's coming over, you put snacks out.\n\n01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.720\nYou do everything like you host this party.\n\n01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.720\nEveryone comes over and plays D&D.\n\n01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:08.720\nBut then you also, throughout the night, you're like, it seems like you're barely focused on the game and that you're not enjoying it.\n\n01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.720\nAnd I was saying to you that night, because I was saying, it seems like you're not enjoying it.\n\n01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.720\nI think if you sit in a chair and focus on the game, it's like that.\n\n01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.720\nAnd you were like, I just wanted to melt cheese into the thing.\n\n01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.720\nI was like, I'm not yelling at you over the fucking cheese thing.\n\n01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.720\nI love what a sassy neighborhood kid I am.\n\n01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.720\nI think I have it in the same way that you say that you have Asperger's.\n\n01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.720\nI have adult ADHD and it's a serious thing.\n\n01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:45.720\nI'm just wondering if sliding your copper is some kind of sexual euphemism.\n\n01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.720\nI'm not going to sleep with you, Spencer's dad.\n\n01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.720\nI have a boyfriend and you have a wife.\n\n01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:56.720\nIt gets so complicated.\n\n01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.720\nDoes ADHD stand for always Dan Harmon defying?\n\n01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.720\nDevoted.\n\n01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.720\nWell, Dan is right.\n\n01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.720\nI could be more focused during D&D.\n\n01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.720\nYou're not paying attention a hell of a lot during that game.\n\n01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:20.720\nThere's a syndrome where if you don't pay enough attention during D&D, then it's hard.\n\n01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.720\nThen you come sit down and it's like, you need to get immersed in the game, baby.\n\n01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.720\nShut up, shut up, lady.\n\n01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:36.720\nI know, yes, she puts out a plate of baby carrots.\n\n01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.720\nShe sharpens pencils.\n\n01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.720\nI'm no stranger to the sacrifices she's making.\n\n01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.720\nBut I would give all that up for her to have a good time.\n\n01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.720\nI want her to enjoy herself during the game.\n\n01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.720\nI would rather just go to the Roosevelt Hotel and rent a bungalow.\n\n01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.720\nLet's go to the fucking Chateau Marmont and do a big bag of Coke and play Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.720\nHave people bring shit to us.\n\n01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.720\nLet me die that way.\n\n01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:10.720\nLet there be black and white autopsy photos of me with a die in my fist.\n\n01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.720\nAfter that conversation, I realized that I was being distracting to other people because I was distracted.\n\n01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.720\nBut I wasn't unhappy.\n\n01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.720\nEspecially me, though, because I'm your boyfriend.\n\n01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.720\nI don't think anyone else cares that much.\n\n01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:29.720\nIt does come off to me that you don't really enjoy playing the actual game.\n\n01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.720\nThe game is not something that you particularly are invested in.\n\n01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.720\nNo, I do have a good time.\n\n01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:43.720\nI get distracted by hosting, which I really enjoy.\n\n01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.720\nI really like putting out snacks.\n\n01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.720\nThe snacks are out.\n\n01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.720\nNo, I know.\n\n01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:57.720\nYou don't have this chip in your brain that gives you joy when you're taking care of people.\n\n01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.720\nI get distracted by that.\n\n01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.720\nI get distracted by people being hungry.\n\n01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.720\nI also get distracted by being drunk and being like,\n\n01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.720\nI've got an idea.\n\n01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.720\nWhat if a puppy was a therapist?\n\n01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.720\nI should think about this.\n\n01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:13.720\nThat's an actual note in my phone that I saw tonight that I was writing during D&D.\n\n01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:16.720\nI was like, yeah, a puppy should be a therapist.\n\n01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.720\nBut meanwhile, we're getting our asses slashed to pieces by hobgoblins and shit.\n\n01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:27.720\nTo be fair, in the first couple of games when I suggested what I was really invested,\n\n01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.720\nI suggested the things that I was taking very seriously.\n\n01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.720\nYou shut me down.\n\n01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.720\nI felt, please don't do that.\n\n01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.720\nThat makes me want to kill myself.\n\n01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.720\nHow did I shut you down?\n\n01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.720\nNo, I'm fine.\n\n01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.720\nWhen we were talking, this is getting very specific.\n\n01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.720\nAnd Pittsburgh-y.\n\n01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.720\nWhen we were...\n\n01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.720\nWell, I'm glad we're talking about this.\n\n01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:55.720\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:59.720\nBut when we were giving our personal bios of our characters,\n\n01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.720\nand I know what you're going to say after I say this, but I was...\n\n01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.720\nI want to hear that too.\n\n01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:11.720\nI was giving the bio of my character Mordecai Stumpgarden.\n\n01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:14.720\nI was really excited to play.\n\n01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.720\nAnd in the middle of me explaining my origin story,\n\n01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:22.720\nin which I said, because I wanted to have a connection with you in this story,\n\n01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.720\nI said, well, and I think that, you know, because we're both...\n\n01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:28.720\nThis is getting real deep.\n\n01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:31.720\nWe're both halflings in the thing.\n\n01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:40.720\nI suggested, I said, well, and my character and Jeff's character,\n\n01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.720\nwe both have a secret connection.\n\n01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.720\nAnd then I continued to explain my story.\n\n01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.720\nAnd in the middle of it, Jeff was like, are you done?\n\n01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:50.720\nIs that it?\n\n01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.720\nAnd I was like...\n\n01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.720\nThat's not what happens.\n\n01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.720\nAbsolutely not what
