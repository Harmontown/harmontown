{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.440\nFrom Esther's Follies, in Austin, Motherfucking Texas, Harmontown, is now in session.\n\n00:17.440 --> 00:19.440\nHello, South by Southwest.\n\n00:19.440 --> 00:23.000\nIs it me or is it quieter here now?\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:24.000\nThe crowd's just smaller.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:25.000\nIt's groovy.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:26.000\nI love it.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:27.000\nOnly the sexy people now.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:34.000\nSpeaking of sexy people, let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:43.000\nHey guys, can I be heard?\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.000\nOh yeah.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:47.000\nCan we get more level on these mics?\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:48.000\nSound person?\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:49.000\nYeah.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:51.000\nLet's get my mic up and Spencer's mic up a little bit.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nOne, two, higher, higher, higher.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:57.000\nI also like South by Southwest.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:59.000\nNo, not the music, the microphones.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:02.000\nWell, let's get the music louder, I think, maybe.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nWell, fuck it.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:14.000\nLet's bring out Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nDan Harmon.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:19.000\nThank you.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:20.000\nThank you so much.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:21.000\nThank you.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:22.000\nI feel like I remember being here.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:23.000\nWe were here at one point.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:24.000\nYes, you were.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.000\nAnd you were delightful.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nI think I was going through a divorce.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nI don't know what was happening.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:30.000\nAlso, yeah.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nI think we were through the divorce at that point.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nWell, that's when the trouble starts.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:41.000\nBecause you have the divorce to focus on and then afterwards you're like, wait, I'm miserable.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:47.000\nThe unaddressed issue behind the note behind the note we call it in TV writers' notes.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nWhy does Sony want a dog on the show?\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nBecause they think the show sucks.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nThey don't love dogs.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nThey hate your show.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nIt's the note behind the note.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nI lost you.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nI lost you in 10 seconds.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nI've known you since 1994.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:04.000\nYou lost me for the first time.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:05.000\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:06.000\nThis show is about alienation.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nWe're here because we're alienated.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nAnd if you can't relate to an alienated person, then you're a fucking hypocrite.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:18.000\nWhat I do love about performing here at Esther's Follies is that there's always a band right outside.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:22.000\nI can hear them thumping, thumping away at the secessionist movement.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:25.000\nThey're thumping, thumping at the walls of America.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:26.000\nLet me out.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nI'm Texas for God's sake.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nI want to be free.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nIs Texas seceding or is Austin seceding from Texas?\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nAustin is the capital of the intelligent secessionist movement.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nYou go to Dallas and Houston and you have people who are just doing it because they're racist.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:50.000\nIn Austin, they're doing it because they're into the fucking pogs.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nI told them I have a bad feeling about this show.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nI think it's going to get worse.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:00.000\nI don't have to prepare for this stuff.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nThere's a rapist in the White House.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nAll right.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nI wake up in the morning and I'm like, should I brush my teeth?\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\nI don't know.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nThere's a rapist in the White House.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nHe fucked a 13-year-old girl in front of Jeff Epstein.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nThey recorded it.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:16.000\nThey flushed it into a fucking space vacuum.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nWhat?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nAm I unfounded in my accusations?\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:26.000\nAm I some kind of crazy person saying microwaves are cameras?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nI don't want to be branded a nut bag.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nI might end up the most powerful person in the fucking world.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.000\nI don't want to misspeak and have people start to think I'm crazy.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nThey might start voting for me.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nThey start giving me piles of money and chanting my name in the streets\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nif I accidentally say something so fucked up\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nthat it taps into the most visceral...\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nWhat are you writing?\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:51.000\nWhat are you writing?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nAre you a reporter?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nKeep talking.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nEverything he says is lies.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nIt's fake.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nIn advance, I'm telling you, I'm telling you,\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:05.000\neven if you liked me, it was rigged.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nI'm writing down today's date\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:14.000\nso I know when you were arrested.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nWhat is it? 13th?\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:21.000\nWe were delayed due to weather, not extreme weather.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:22.000\nNormal weather.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nWeather changes.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:26.000\nGet over it.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nIt's a hard line to take.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nLAX was enshrouded by a mystical fog\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:36.000\nand John Carpenter pirates were creeping around with maggots coming out of their eye sockets,\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\ncrashing at anyone who wandered too far from the cement,\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nbut it's totally normal and our flight was delayed a couple of times\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nand so I was in the new United Lounge.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nI had to buy a ticket for $60.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:56.000\nI retweeted an infographic that showed you\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nwhat if the world was 100 people?\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nHey Spencer, how are you doing?\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nHey guys.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nI always forget to involve you.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nWhat if the world was 100 people?\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nIf the world was 100 people, according to this infographic,\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:14.000\none of the people, one percent of the population of the United States,\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nspends over $90 a day.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nSo I've been monitoring my...\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nBut I'm done with that before I get out of bed.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:30.000\nI pay a publicist $3,000 a month to keep me out of TMZ.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nI'm sure the joke's on me. I'm sure TMZ doesn't want to write anything about me.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nBut I can't know that unless I stop giving these people $3,000 a month.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nThat's more than $90 a day right there.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nForget where I get my croissant.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:49.000\nAlso, forget the money you paid to learn how to pronounce croissant.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nSteve Martin, you son of a bitch.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nI paid $60 to get into this lounge,\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nwhich looked like an Apple store with melon slices.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\nThere was a young lady. She was sitting a few counters away from me.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:07.000\nThere was a sea of tables, and they all had the little AC outlets on them.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:12.000\nShe had her laptop. She was kind of a Rachel Maddow, but blonde.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:17.000\nShe was statuesque and had a long neck, and she had a Bluetooth in,\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nand she was tapping the laptop.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nAnd she was speaking very loudly about what she was doing.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nShe was saying, that's not what I want.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nWhat I want is this, and I think it should be this.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:30.000\nAnd I was like, she was loud, but I noted it, but I didn't have to sit near her.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:36.000\nAnd she was in a sea of Brazilian Brazil as in the movie, the Terry Gilliam movie.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:41.000\nShe was in this Brazilian-esque sea of things.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nIt wasn't like a private area.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:47.000\nThere wasn't a fireplace raging next to her.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:52.000\nThere wasn't a state Bernard waiting to save anybody from anything with hot cocoa.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nThere wasn't?\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nNo.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nBecause most airport lunches provide that.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nBut I thought it was really weird, because there was a lady that came by\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nwho was like vacuuming and picking things up.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:09.000\nAnd I always write race-neutral characters, but this woman was black.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nAnd I felt like it was important, because she was like in her 70s, I felt,\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nand she was African-American.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:19.000\nAnd as she was picking things up, she leaned over to me into my Minecraft game,\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:24.000\nand she went, how come you haven't told that woman to pipe it down?\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nNo!\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nWhich activated this weird Tim Allen instinct in me where I was like,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nI just wanted her to like me.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:35.000\nSo I was like, hey, I've learned to tune out worse than that.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nAnd she's like, I got it.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nI'm like, why am I telling, what am I talking about?\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nWhat am I, Fred Flintstone?\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nI don't know.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nI was just playing.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nIt sounds like you're an act two of Get Out.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:49.000\nWell, don't spoil that shit.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nI have to see it.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nFucking movies.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nAlso, tell me nothing about season one of Atlanta.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:58.000\nI like how you had a genuine communication with a real human being in your first instinct.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nWell, because I was, no, I'm observing myself.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nI'm going, like, why was I, she was saying,\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nthere's a person that works in the airport saying,\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:12.000\nwhy haven't you, fellow consumer, told her to shut the fuck up?\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:19.000\nAnd so, and my response was neither because, madam, she has a right to be a human.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nLike, nor was it like, you're right.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nChomp, chomp, chomp.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nShut up, madam.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nNor was it you tell her.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nNo, it was the best.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nIt was the right option.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nI took a path of least resistance through.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nPlato could have predicted my past.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nRight.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:39.000\nFucking steam shooting through the only opening available that turned me into a weird 80s comic.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nLike lamenting my, like, oh, the old ball and chain.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nLike, I made up a fictional step mom at home.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nLike, I'm like, well, I tune out worse than that.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nYeah.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:50.000\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nIt's to a person who said something to you.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nI just don't want the person that's talking to me to beat me up.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nRight.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nThat person I don't want to beat me up.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nI was tuning her out.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nI did everything.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nSo here's what, so then that was, she walked away.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nI was like, fucking nailed it with her.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nYeah, you did.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nShe loves me.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nShe loves me.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nShe loves me.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nShe's like, I hear that.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nI vacuum, vacuum, pick, pick.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nAnd so I'm like, fucking nailed it today.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:16.000\nI really, I made someone like me.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:21.000\nSo then this, and then moments after that, this old guy walks up and because I've done\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:26.000\nnon-race neutral casting, I'll tell you, this is like a kind of like a 90 year old Michael\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nchick list, like walks up to this woman.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nIt's like, it's like, couldn't be 30 seconds later.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:38.000\nAnd this, and this, and this like, like seven foot tall, like Rachel Maddow giraffe woman\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\non her laptop is just going on.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nShe's just, I think she's just in a zone.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:47.000\nShe's just explaining what, what spreadsheets work and which don't.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:54.000\nAnd this guy just goes like, and he goes, he goes, excuse me, you might keep an egg down.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nAnd she, and this woman's like, like fucking flips out.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nLike, like, like, like, like, I mean, flips out, like she had no idea.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nShe wasn't like, she wasn't like, blah, blah, blah.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nI don't care about anybody.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nIt was more like, blah, blah, blah.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nI haven't thought about anybody.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nLike there's a difference.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nShe didn't realize that she was being disruptive.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nWell, you know, when you're on a phone, that's the thing.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nAnd there's also like a heightened, like, I don't know.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nSometimes when you see someone on a phone, you like, I don't know.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\nWe get a hair trigger, like, like, like, if that person didn't have a phone in their hand\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nand they were just talking to their friend that loudly, when would you go over to them\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nand be all high-handed about it?\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:35.000\nLike we got a license when cell phones were invented to start getting real fucking dicky.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:40.000\nAnd, you know, like, and it's justifiable because I'm not, you know, no heroes, no villains.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nJust nobody beat me up. That's the point of my story.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nNobody beat me up.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nSo this guy goes like, he goes,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nyou want me, you want me, you want me to give me my lawn, you want me to shake my king.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nMoonlight shouldn't have won the La La Land.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nI couldn't hear what he said, but he was just like, he was a little boy.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nAnd this, and this, like, and Rachel Maddowwoman like, went,\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nshe fucking like, I was like watching peripherally\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:07.000\nbecause I'm not going to turn my head because someone will beat me up.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:12.000\nBut I was just like, she was like, oh my god, oh my god,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.440\nI'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Stacy, stop, wait,\n\n11:15.440 --> 11:18.320\nno, I'm sorry, oh, and the guy was like,\n\n11:18.320 --> 11:20.960\nit's just, it's just rude to see, what?\n\n11:20.960 --> 11:24.000\nI just was like, oh no, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.960\nLike her voice was cracking.\n\n11:25.960 --> 11:30.520\nAnd she packed up her shit, put her laptop in her bag,\n\n11:30.520 --> 11:32.840\nput her bag in her wheelie, put her wheelie\n\n11:32.840 --> 11:36.200\nin the transformer mode, took her fucking overcoat,\n\n11:36.200 --> 11:39.240\ntucked into the London fog and phased out.\n\n11:39.240 --> 11:41.280\nLike she went to a different lounge\n\n11:41.280 --> 11:44.280\nat a different airport, may have hung herself, I don't know.\n\n11:44.280 --> 11:49.280\nLike she, she, she wasn't, she wasn't doing anything.\n\n11:50.600 --> 11:53.600\nNow, what 90 year old Michael Chiklis\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:55.580\nhave walked up to a guy and done that.\n\n11:55.580 --> 11:57.200\nI think the answer is absolutely not.\n\n11:57.200 --> 12:00.280\nI think he felt empowered to walk up to a woman\n\n12:00.280 --> 12:01.720\nand say, you're being loud.\n\n12:01.720 --> 12:04.920\nThat's male privilege bullshit.\n\n12:04.920 --> 12:09.920\nThat is the tennis net, that's the tennis court net\n\n12:10.880 --> 12:14.400\nthat like some balls hit it and go straight up,\n\n12:14.400 --> 12:18.160\nlike that guy, the answer maybe he would have loved,\n\n12:18.160 --> 12:20.160\nhe would have done it twice as fast.\n\n12:20.160 --> 12:24.200\nIf he saw another old bald white guy doing that,\n\n12:24.200 --> 12:25.320\nhe wouldn't have fucking done it.\n\n12:25.320 --> 12:26.160\nHe wouldn't have walked up.\n\n12:26.160 --> 12:29.560\nEvery airport lounge has like two old guys doing exactly that.\n\n12:29.560 --> 12:32.960\nWell, more importantly, that's how old guys talk\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:33.800\nwithout a phone.\n\n12:33.800 --> 12:35.000\nRight, yeah.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.880\nLike, oh, do you remember the depression?\n\n12:36.880 --> 12:38.200\nI can't hear anything.\n\n12:38.200 --> 12:39.720\nYou know, they call it,\n\n12:39.720 --> 12:40.760\nLife is their phone.\n\n12:40.760 --> 12:43.320\nYou know, they call it, they call it Harmontown.\n\n12:43.320 --> 12:46.760\nI, old white guy is yelling.\n\n12:46.760 --> 12:48.600\nI don't know.\n\n12:48.600 --> 12:49.560\nI've been in restaurants\n\n12:49.560 --> 12:51.120\nwhere I've been annoyed by people on the phone.\n\n12:51.120 --> 12:54.840\nI've been in restaurants where I've seen someone on the phone\n\n12:54.840 --> 12:57.760\nand then I've, and the person that's more annoyed\n\n12:57.760 --> 13:00.360\nby the person on the phone, I'm more annoyed by them.\n\n13:00.360 --> 13:02.360\nThat they're, that they're taking more attention\n\n13:02.360 --> 13:04.800\nthat they're, it's like, the person is technically\n\n13:04.800 --> 13:07.600\non the phone, it's not really a license for you\n\n13:07.600 --> 13:12.600\nto vent your antipathy, your fucking inhumanity.\n\n13:14.560 --> 13:15.760\nI don't know, what my point is.\n\n13:15.760 --> 13:16.760\nNo, I had no point.\n\n13:16.760 --> 13:17.880\nIt's just a little story.\n\n13:17.880 --> 13:19.280\nI'm just a journalist.\n\n13:19.280 --> 13:22.400\nI had a good moment in an airport lounge.\n\n13:22.400 --> 13:25.200\nI went and I was flying to Vancouver\n\n13:25.200 --> 13:28.040\nand was up in the, or Canada lounge at LAX\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:31.600\nand I sat down like, because they're plugging my phone\n\n13:31.600 --> 13:33.680\nand there was a guy with his,\n\n13:33.680 --> 13:36.520\nI would assume girlfriend and talking\n\n13:36.520 --> 13:38.920\nat the top of his lungs about nothing.\n\n13:38.920 --> 13:40.280\nSo I was like, I just, motherfucker,\n\n13:40.280 --> 13:41.360\nhe's never gonna stop talking.\n\n13:41.360 --> 13:43.200\nSo I unplugged and I went somewhere else\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:44.720\nand there was another guy, he was Australian,\n\n13:44.720 --> 13:49.560\nwhich is worse, because when a loud rich guy is Australian,\n\n13:49.560 --> 13:52.320\nyou know, you know what I'm saying, me, me, me, me, me.\n\n13:52.320 --> 13:56.440\nIt's, it's, it's, I was making a movie.\n\n13:56.440 --> 13:57.400\nI was making a movie, right?\n\n13:57.400 --> 13:58.720\nIn fact, if you want to fight, you can also\n\n13:58.720 --> 14:01.680\nfight me at camp, I fucking, I fucking, mucky, tucky, tucky,\n\n14:01.680 --> 14:02.920\nmucky, mucky, tucky.\n\n14:02.920 --> 14:05.560\nAnd I was like, I'm gonna fucking blow my brains out.\n\n14:05.560 --> 14:09.320\nThe views of the spot guys do not reflect, I, I, look,\n\n14:09.320 --> 14:11.720\nthat is a huge continent that will be radiation safe\n\n14:11.720 --> 14:13.560\nin these other videos where it were.\n\n14:13.560 --> 14:14.400\nDan, we were there.\n\n14:14.400 --> 14:15.320\nI love them.\n\n14:15.320 --> 14:16.160\nWe were there.\n\n14:16.160 --> 14:18.480\nThey have lots of lumber and gas and water.\n\n14:18.480 --> 14:19.720\nWe know them, we love them.\n\n14:19.720 --> 14:22.560\nBut they all know what the rich guy sounds like.\n\n14:22.560 --> 14:25.000\nAnd every country knows what the rich white guy sounds like.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.320\nAnd there's a particular Australian rich white guy thing\n\n14:28.320 --> 14:29.160\nthat happens.\n\n14:29.160 --> 14:30.720\nAnd while that was happening, this is fucking,\n\n14:30.720 --> 14:31.560\nnow there's nowhere to go.\n\n14:31.560 --> 14:35.400\nNow I'm a prisoner because I found the only other place\n\n14:35.400 --> 14:37.480\nwhere I don't have to hear that guy.\n\n14:37.480 --> 14:39.920\nAnd this guy would not stop talking about himself.\n\n14:39.920 --> 14:42.800\nAnd right in the middle of my sadness,\n\n14:42.800 --> 14:45.040\nSarah Silverman walks up and sits down right by his,\n\n14:45.040 --> 14:47.080\nhey Jeff, and she started telling me stories\n\n14:47.080 --> 14:48.640\nabout her and Tom Cruise together.\n\n14:48.640 --> 14:51.160\nAnd, and that guy had to hear her Tom Cruise stories.\n\n14:51.160 --> 14:53.240\nAnd he went, he shut right the fuck up.\n\n14:53.240 --> 14:56.200\nI was like, yeah, motherfucker, we have better stories\n\n14:56.200 --> 14:57.040\nover here.\n\n14:57.040 --> 14:58.440\nFunny people.\n\n14:58.440 --> 15:01.760\nWe're not yelling them because we have a,\n\n15:01.760 --> 15:04.800\nwe'd go on TV and talk about them.\n\n15:04.800 --> 15:05.920\nWe have an antenna.\n\n15:07.080 --> 15:09.960\nSarah told better stories than this guy\n\n15:09.960 --> 15:11.440\nand it made me very happy.\n\n15:11.440 --> 15:13.440\nI, and then we killed him.\n\n15:13.440 --> 15:14.440\nThen we killed him.\n\n15:14.440 --> 15:18.400\nI, my therapist has taught me,\n\n15:18.400 --> 15:20.040\nso here's the thing I've learned\n\n15:20.040 --> 15:25.040\nthat's like been very, very like powerful to me.\n\n15:25.040 --> 15:28.120\nIn moments when people want an apology from me,\n\n15:28.120 --> 15:32.280\nwhich I used to interpret as them trying to leverage me.\n\n15:32.280 --> 15:33.720\nThey're manipulating me.\n\n15:33.720 --> 15:35.480\nWhat's going to exchange here?\n\n15:35.480 --> 15:38.160\nIf I, is this an apology window?\n\n15:38.160 --> 15:39.520\nI can still feel all of that.\n\n15:39.520 --> 15:41.560\nLike I could still look at somebody and go,\n\n15:41.560 --> 15:42.440\noh, you're a vampire.\n\n15:42.440 --> 15:43.280\nYou're a piece of shit.\n\n15:43.280 --> 15:45.520\nLike you're just trying to suck energy out of my body.\n\n15:45.520 --> 15:49.040\nBut the, my therapist explained to me, she said,\n\n15:49.040 --> 15:53.240\nDan, you are vigilant against abuse.\n\n15:53.240 --> 15:58.240\nYou cannot handle somebody accusing you of abuse.\n\n15:59.520 --> 16:02.800\nYou can handle people telling you that you hurt them.\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:06.400\nIf you went like this and you felt like a soft splat\n\n16:07.400 --> 16:09.280\nas you were reaching for your backpack\n\n16:09.280 --> 16:12.360\nand you turned and looked and someone's nose was bleeding,\n\n16:12.360 --> 16:15.840\nyou would not be offended by that person's claim\n\n16:15.840 --> 16:17.160\nthat you had hurt them.\n\n16:17.160 --> 16:22.160\nYou would stop at nothing to make it up to them.\n\n16:23.400 --> 16:28.400\nIf that person started to imply, as you apologize,\n\n16:29.480 --> 16:31.520\nthat you had done it on purpose\n\n16:31.520 --> 16:34.400\nor that you had done it because you weren't a good person,\n\n16:34.400 --> 16:36.840\nthat you had made a choice earlier that day\n\n16:36.840 --> 16:39.080\nto ignore their needs and things like that,\n\n16:39.080 --> 16:41.000\nyou'd start to get triggered.\n\n16:42.080 --> 16:44.320\nYou'd start to get defensive.\n\n16:44.320 --> 16:46.320\nThere's an irony that happens there every day\n\n16:46.320 --> 16:48.400\nin every bar, somebody hurt somebody\n\n16:48.400 --> 16:50.400\nand then someone feels bad about it\n\n16:50.400 --> 16:53.440\nand then someone is like, oh, I feel bad about this\n\n16:53.440 --> 16:54.680\nand I feel so bad about it\n\n16:54.680 --> 16:57.280\nbecause it seems like you don't fucking give a shit about me.\n\n16:57.280 --> 16:58.440\nAnd then the other person is like,\n\n16:58.440 --> 17:01.160\nhow dare you accuse me of being the kind of person\n\n17:01.160 --> 17:02.760\nthat doesn't give a shit about anyone?\n\n17:02.760 --> 17:04.000\nYou fucking lesbian!\n\n17:05.960 --> 17:07.120\nThat took a weird turn.\n\n17:08.120 --> 17:09.640\nIt always takes a weird turn.\n\n17:09.640 --> 17:12.240\nIt's like, you know, that is the thing.\n\n17:12.240 --> 17:16.280\nAnd it's like, what I am just slowly starting to realize\n\n17:16.280 --> 17:18.960\nis that people saying that you hurt them,\n\n17:18.960 --> 17:21.560\nthey're not saying you abused them.\n\n17:21.560 --> 17:23.800\nThey're saying they got hurt\n\n17:23.800 --> 17:25.920\nand it doesn't matter what they say beyond that.\n\n17:25.920 --> 17:27.840\nThey could put all the frosting they want on it\n\n17:27.840 --> 17:29.920\nbecause they're coming from wherever they're coming from.\n\n17:29.920 --> 17:33.280\nThey can't make you an abuser.\n\n17:33.280 --> 17:35.520\nThey can say that they're hurt\n\n17:35.520 --> 17:38.960\nand everyone can apologize for hurting people\n\n17:38.960 --> 17:40.960\nand everybody should be vigilant\n\n17:40.960 --> 17:42.760\nagainst admitting they're an abuser\n\n17:42.760 --> 17:44.480\nbecause if you're not a fucking abuser,\n\n17:44.480 --> 17:45.840\nthat's an important thing.\n\n17:45.840 --> 17:47.280\nThere are a couple of people among us\n\n17:47.280 --> 17:48.920\nwho fucking love abusing people.\n\n17:49.800 --> 17:51.880\nLike, we should definitely separate from them.\n\n17:51.880 --> 17:53.640\nAnd so the way, it's like,\n\n17:53.640 --> 17:55.640\nI'm just noticing in these daily exchanges,\n\n17:55.640 --> 17:56.560\nI'm like, wait a minute,\n\n17:56.560 --> 17:58.520\nI'm trying to take a step back and going like,\n\n17:58.520 --> 18:02.120\nokay, wait, you're hurt, I hurt you, I hurt you.\n\n18:02.120 --> 18:03.560\nI did not abuse you.\n\n18:03.560 --> 18:05.600\nI'm not an abuser, I'm a herder.\n\n18:05.600 --> 18:06.440\nI hurt you.\n\n18:06.440 --> 18:08.200\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n18:08.200 --> 18:16.040\nHave you, well, we all have, I'm assuming you have too,\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:17.720\nI do it all the time.\n\n18:17.720 --> 18:22.320\nThat abuse is like self-pity and things like that,\n\n18:22.320 --> 18:25.400\nlike I mean to Cody, look at the text and go like,\n\n18:25.400 --> 18:29.400\noh, I'm trying to do something here\n\n18:29.400 --> 18:31.280\nthat has nothing to do with her well-being\n\n18:31.280 --> 18:32.560\nand everything to do with mine.\n\n18:32.560 --> 18:36.200\nI'm actually hurting her on purpose.\n\n18:36.200 --> 18:37.800\nWillfully, which is abuse.\n\n18:37.800 --> 18:40.200\nYeah, and that's like, yeah,\n\n18:40.200 --> 18:43.240\nso we need to recognize when we're doing that\n\n18:43.240 --> 18:46.720\nso that we can apologize when we accidentally hurt people\n\n18:46.720 --> 18:49.040\nbecause that shouldn't be that big a deal.\n\n18:49.040 --> 18:50.960\nThere's eight billion of us walking around,\n\n18:50.960 --> 18:52.120\nwe're gonna step on each other's feet.\n\n18:52.120 --> 18:55.640\nI think for you though, I mean, not just for you,\n\n18:55.640 --> 18:58.440\nbut for you especially, because you have the ability\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:01.400\nto seem abusive when you're not being abusive.\n\n19:01.400 --> 19:02.240\nThank you.\n\n19:04.080 --> 19:05.280\nWeird thing to love.\n\n19:05.280 --> 19:09.720\nBut like, you can, you are so good verbally,\n\n19:09.720 --> 19:14.040\nI've seen you lay people out with a quip, with a line.\n\n19:14.040 --> 19:16.160\nBecause they're accusing you of abusing them.\n\n19:16.160 --> 19:17.000\nWell.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.880\nAnd I need them to know that they're a piece of fucking shit.\n\n19:18.880 --> 19:22.040\nAll right, but the problem is you're really good at that.\n\n19:22.040 --> 19:25.280\nAnd thank you, that's what I'm saying.\n\n19:25.280 --> 19:28.040\nYou're the Robin Hood in terms of archery\n\n19:28.040 --> 19:30.920\nof hitting the bullseye when someone goes,\n\n19:30.920 --> 19:34.440\nhey, fuck off buddy, and you just shoot an arrow\n\n19:34.440 --> 19:35.520\nright into their heart.\n\n19:35.520 --> 19:37.520\nYeah, if you imply that I hurt you on purpose,\n\n19:37.520 --> 19:39.160\nI will strangle you to death.\n\n19:40.440 --> 19:43.120\nI will wrap my hands around your neck until you're dead,\n\n19:43.120 --> 19:44.920\nand you can't say it ever again.\n\n19:44.920 --> 19:48.360\nYour gifts are your curses, you're a good writer,\n\n19:48.360 --> 19:51.040\nand so you're also really good at hurting people's feelings.\n\n19:51.040 --> 19:51.880\nThank you.\n\n19:53.200 --> 19:54.920\nStop saying thank you to them.\n\n19:54.920 --> 19:56.840\nSay, oops.\n\n19:56.840 --> 20:00.520\nNo, but I'm being glib, but what I'm saying is yes,\n\n20:00.520 --> 20:01.360\nbecause what happens.\n\n20:01.360 --> 20:03.160\nBut you love it, because you feel a reward.\n\n20:03.160 --> 20:04.400\nI'm learning about that in therapy.\n\n20:04.400 --> 20:08.080\nWhat happens is, being yourself following your own bliss,\n\n20:08.080 --> 20:11.360\nlike you can sometimes be hurtful to people\n\n20:11.360 --> 20:15.280\nthat is not the same crime as being abusive to someone.\n\n20:15.280 --> 20:17.560\nWe all commit both of those crimes.\n\n20:17.560 --> 20:21.720\nHurtfulness often comes with thoughtlessness, carelessness.\n\n20:21.720 --> 20:23.960\nYou weren't thinking about me\n\n20:23.960 --> 20:26.800\nwhen you changed lanes on the freeway.\n\n20:26.800 --> 20:30.640\nLike it's different than you thinking you're entitled\n\n20:30.640 --> 20:32.480\nto just drive however you want.\n\n20:32.480 --> 20:34.360\nLike there's shades of abuse there,\n\n20:34.360 --> 20:37.360\nwhere you're just like fuck everyone on the freeway.\n\n20:37.360 --> 20:40.960\nLike everyone, when we get down in fights,\n\n20:40.960 --> 20:43.000\nwhen we start arguing with each other,\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.640\nthose rare moments where we're actually able\n\n20:44.640 --> 20:48.320\nto connect with each other, and we find out truly\n\n20:48.320 --> 20:50.280\nwhat everyone is always saying the whole time,\n\n20:50.280 --> 20:52.360\nwhich is I didn't mean to do that.\n\n20:52.360 --> 20:54.040\nI didn't mean it that way.\n\n20:54.040 --> 20:55.680\nThat's not how I meant it.\n\n20:55.680 --> 20:59.680\nLike that always turns everything around.\n\n20:59.680 --> 21:04.160\nWell the problem that you face is that when you react\n\n21:04.160 --> 21:07.760\nand you accidentally fling an elbow verbally\n\n21:07.760 --> 21:12.520\nand hurt somebody's feelings, is that you're so succinct\n\n21:12.520 --> 21:15.720\nand it's so well written, it sounds meditated.\n\n21:15.720 --> 21:17.240\nLike it doesn't sound...\n\n21:17.240 --> 21:20.040\nYou're pumping me up so that everyone drives home\n\n21:20.040 --> 21:22.400\nto that going, I don't see what Jeff was seeing in him.\n\n21:22.400 --> 21:24.840\nI'm trying to...\n\n21:24.840 --> 21:27.560\nI've seen you, like if somebody hits you\n\n21:27.560 --> 21:29.720\nbelow the knee and your foot flies up,\n\n21:29.720 --> 21:34.080\nwhen somebody hits you and you respond,\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:37.960\nit sounds so good, it sounds abusive, but it wasn't.\n\n21:37.960 --> 21:39.480\nIt was just you reacting.\n\n21:39.480 --> 21:40.800\nIt was just a reflex.\n\n21:40.800 --> 21:43.000\nIt's very good at hurting people.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:44.960\nIt's as simple as protecting yourself.\n\n21:44.960 --> 21:46.200\nThere's airlocks all around us.\n\n21:46.200 --> 21:48.880\nYou lock somebody, you put a wall between you and them,\n\n21:48.880 --> 21:51.400\nand then you hit a button, and then you just watch them die.\n\n21:51.400 --> 21:56.400\nYou just stare at them while they turn purple,\n\n21:56.400 --> 21:57.960\nwhile they turn purple, and you go like,\n\n21:57.960 --> 22:00.600\nwhat, I thought you wanted to be near me.\n\n22:01.960 --> 22:04.560\nGo see Get Out in Theater, it's a fantastic film.\n\n22:07.080 --> 22:09.440\nBut yeah, we're looking into all those things.\n\n22:11.440 --> 22:13.960\nThe curse of being good at hurting people's feelings\n\n22:13.960 --> 22:17.600\nand it sounds like it's a neutron bomb.\n\n22:17.600 --> 22:22.600\nIt's not a gift, we watch movies about mafia people\n\n22:23.680 --> 22:25.520\nand serial killers and things\n\n22:25.520 --> 22:27.560\nbecause we're fascinated with that behavior\n\n22:27.560 --> 22:30.520\nbecause it's not a gift, but it is rare\n\n22:30.520 --> 22:34.040\nbecause our species is predisposed to compassion.\n\n22:34.040 --> 22:37.800\nIt's weird when somebody's circuits are so fucked up\n\n22:37.800 --> 22:40.840\nthat they could actually hurt somebody so meticulously,\n\n22:40.840 --> 22:43.240\nso horribly, we focus on it\n\n22:43.240 --> 22:44.960\nbecause we don't want it to happen anymore.\n\n22:44.960 --> 22:49.240\nIt's like ribbons and flowers spread at an intersection\n\n22:49.240 --> 22:50.680\nwhere a little girl got hit by a car.\n\n22:50.680 --> 22:55.520\nWe go to the point of the pain and we watch it,\n\n22:55.520 --> 22:58.480\nwe look at it and we go, here's where this happened.\n\n22:59.360 --> 23:00.920\nShould we bring out Doug Benson?\n\n23:00.920 --> 23:01.760\nHa ha ha ha!\n\n23:01.760 --> 23:02.600\nHa ha ha ha!\n\n23:02.600 --> 23:03.440\nHa ha ha!\n\n23:03.440 --> 23:05.000\nHa ha ha ha!\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.360\nWe don't have Doug Benson doing it.\n\n23:06.360 --> 23:07.360\nIf he's still backstage.\n\n23:07.360 --> 23:08.200\nYeah, he might be gone.\n\n23:08.200 --> 23:09.440\nHe was just backstage.\n\n23:09.440 --> 23:10.360\nDoug is here?\n\n23:10.360 --> 23:11.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n23:11.200 --> 23:12.040\nFor real?\n\n23:12.040 --> 23:12.880\nYeah.\n\n23:12.880 --> 23:13.720\nHe's coming.\n\n23:13.720 --> 23:14.560\nHe was just backstage.\n\n23:14.560 --> 23:15.400\nI didn't know Doug was here.\n\n23:15.400 --> 23:18.200\nI didn't either, but I saw him backstage and I was,\n\n23:18.200 --> 23:19.360\nI thought I'd...\n\n23:19.360 --> 23:21.040\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:21.040 --> 23:22.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n23:22.040 --> 23:22.880\nDoug Benson.\n\n23:22.880 --> 23:24.200\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:25.040\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:25.040 --> 23:26.200\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:26.200 --> 23:27.440\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:27.440 --> 23:28.640\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:28.640 --> 23:29.440\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:29.440 --> 23:30.560\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:30.560 --> 23:31.560\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:31.560 --> 23:33.960\nDoug Benson!\n\n23:33.960 --> 23:35.680\nGrab a seat, stand up, do what you like.\n\n23:35.680 --> 23:36.800\nWherever you're comfortable.\n\n23:36.800 --> 23:37.640\nOh, I like this.\n\n23:37.640 --> 23:39.520\nI like having you on my shoulder like that.\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:40.520\nI'll give you a nice little rub over here.\n\n23:40.520 --> 23:43.800\nYeah, Jeff is my angel on my shoulder.\n\n23:43.800 --> 23:45.000\nI'm your Michael Landon.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.240\nDo some quick fact checking on everything I say.\n\n23:48.240 --> 23:54.240\nLies. Lies. What happened? Who did you wrong in Austin already?\n\n23:54.240 --> 23:58.240\nOh, that's a great question. There has to be somebody.\n\n23:58.240 --> 24:02.240\nLast night there was a guy, I was just walking down the street, minding my own business,\n\n24:02.240 --> 24:07.240\nand this guy in front of one of the bars goes, hey, Doug Benson!\n\n24:07.240 --> 24:11.240\nI'm like, hey man, how's it going? And he goes, I go, you got food in there?\n\n24:11.240 --> 24:14.240\nBecause I was looking for somewhere to eat. You know, you got food in this bar?\n\n24:14.240 --> 24:18.240\nAnd he goes, no, but the bar next door has food. I'm going to pick up your meal\n\n24:18.240 --> 24:21.240\nand all of your drinks. I'm going to take care of it for you.\n\n24:21.240 --> 24:25.240\nAnd I was like, that's awesome. And then we go into this place next door,\n\n24:25.240 --> 24:29.240\nhe introduces me to everybody, and then I've got a friend that's not going to leave\n\n24:29.240 --> 24:33.240\nwhile I eat the free food and drink the free drinks. And it's going to get weirder and weirder\n\n24:33.240 --> 24:38.240\nas the thing goes along to the point where you finally have to be like, hey man,\n\n24:38.240 --> 24:44.240\nall right, I could buy my own food. I didn't know that I was going to be part of the deal\n\n24:44.240 --> 24:51.240\nis that I've got like a new friend for life, you know, who keeps offering me molly.\n\n24:51.240 --> 24:53.240\nAnd I'm like, dude, I'm a weed guy.\n\n24:53.240 --> 24:54.240\nFor real?\n\n24:54.240 --> 24:58.240\nYeah, he kept saying he had a list of things that I could have instead of weed.\n\n24:58.240 --> 24:59.240\nAnd I was like, no, weed is good.\n\n24:59.240 --> 25:04.240\nA drug that makes everyone have the same personality and vow to stay in touch more often.\n\n25:04.240 --> 25:07.240\nIt's weird that that was his drug of choice.\n\n25:07.240 --> 25:11.240\nSo yeah, so I think ultimately he might have been a little disgruntled.\n\n25:11.240 --> 25:17.240\nLike he expected more for buying me some chips and queso and a couple of vodka sodas.\n\n25:17.240 --> 25:24.240\nI had an encounter at the hotel bar that it occurs to me I've had 25 times in the last five years at least,\n\n25:24.240 --> 25:26.240\nwhich I hadn't started noticing.\n\n25:26.240 --> 25:30.240\nAnd so I don't know what the actual count is, but it seems like this happens all the time.\n\n25:30.240 --> 25:40.240\nAnd I have talked about encounters like this on the podcast where a person that like a person is projecting there.\n\n25:40.240 --> 25:49.240\nJeff is upstaging you with a dab behind the ears of vodka gag.\n\n25:49.240 --> 25:55.240\nIt's so weird to get a big laugh with a physical gag on an audio podcast.\n\n25:55.240 --> 25:59.240\nEveryone's like, what is dad saying right now that's so hilarious?\n\n25:59.240 --> 26:02.240\nHe's just setting up a premise at this point.\n\n26:02.240 --> 26:12.240\nIt's like in that bear movie where the baby bear goes roar and then the puma is like yikes and then there's a big bear behind it.\n\n26:12.240 --> 26:14.240\nI didn't see the movie.\n\n26:14.240 --> 26:21.240\nWait a second, which one of us is high right now?\n\n26:21.240 --> 26:25.240\nI'm on Molly, I just wanted to see you more often.\n\n26:25.240 --> 26:29.240\nI sat at the hotel bar and I was listening to this.\n\n26:29.240 --> 26:34.240\nThere was a lady next to me and she was talking to the bartender and they were talking about,\n\n26:34.240 --> 26:40.240\nthey were talking about South by Southwest and they were talking about, they both knew each other because she drinks there a lot.\n\n26:40.240 --> 26:49.240\nAnd she works in real estate and so she's a big mover and shaker and she's always at the hotel bar and he knows who she is and they know each other.\n\n26:49.240 --> 26:58.240\nBut they start talking about South by Southwest and they're like, yeah, they start talking about how many famous people are in Austin this time of year.\n\n26:58.240 --> 27:04.240\nAnd it's like, oh, it's like Hollywood all of a sudden, this time of year, all of a sudden there's all these famous people.\n\n27:04.240 --> 27:12.240\nAnd her big example was what she called the guy from the league.\n\n27:12.240 --> 27:14.240\nAnd I was just taken by that.\n\n27:14.240 --> 27:16.240\nI was like, learn his name.\n\n27:16.240 --> 27:19.240\nThere's like five of them to choose from.\n\n27:19.240 --> 27:21.240\nI know, it's like the guy from the league.\n\n27:21.240 --> 27:24.240\nI was just, I was just, I'm like, what, the guy from the league?\n\n27:24.240 --> 27:27.240\nAnd I swear she had, she brought her phone.\n\n27:27.240 --> 27:28.240\nShe was like, yeah, no, I know.\n\n27:28.240 --> 27:29.240\nHave you ever seen the league?\n\n27:29.240 --> 27:30.240\nAnd he's like, no, I have not.\n\n27:30.240 --> 27:35.240\nAnd she's like, no, the guy, this guy from the league, I think she had a photo of him on his phone.\n\n27:35.240 --> 27:36.240\nLike, I don't know.\n\n27:36.240 --> 27:39.240\nIt's like, wait, so it's a device you could use to Google him.\n\n27:39.240 --> 27:41.240\nJust say the guy from the league.\n\n27:41.240 --> 27:44.240\nI'm not saying like, like, like respect our craft.\n\n27:44.240 --> 27:47.240\nI'm just saying like, it's part of a conversation where you're, yes,\n\n27:47.240 --> 27:51.240\nhe ending his assertion that it's like Hollywood around here.\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:52.240\nYes, I agree.\n\n27:52.240 --> 27:53.240\nFamous people everywhere.\n\n27:53.240 --> 27:56.240\nFor instance, the guy from the league.\n\n27:56.240 --> 27:59.240\nShe didn't know who the fuck, learn his name.\n\n27:59.240 --> 28:05.240\nCould be anyone from a basic cable TV show that is finished, I believe.\n\n28:05.240 --> 28:08.240\nThen, so then, so then I, my burger comes.\n\n28:08.240 --> 28:10.240\nThe final at bat happened.\n\n28:10.240 --> 28:12.240\nIt was baseball, right?\n\n28:12.240 --> 28:17.240\nI think it was organized around a, was it Casey?\n\n28:17.240 --> 28:18.240\nI think they played Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n28:18.240 --> 28:20.240\nI don't know.\n\n28:20.240 --> 28:27.240\nWelcome to the four guys who don't know anything about sports podcast.\n\n28:27.240 --> 28:30.240\nBut then she, she, that's every podcast.\n\n28:30.240 --> 28:31.240\nEvery podcast.\n\n28:31.240 --> 28:32.240\nYeah.\n\n28:32.240 --> 28:40.240\nBut then, but then, so then my burger comes and I go, do you have any mustard?\n\n28:40.240 --> 28:41.240\nHere we go.\n\n28:41.240 --> 28:42.240\nWait for it.\n\n28:42.240 --> 28:44.240\nDo you have any mustard?\n\n28:44.240 --> 28:45.240\nThat's what I said.\n\n28:45.240 --> 28:46.240\nDo you have any mustard?\n\n28:46.240 --> 28:50.240\nWhich, which then, in Texas is a very provocative question.\n\n28:50.240 --> 28:57.240\nAnd the guy, the kid, I'm going to call him a kid behind the bar said, we have mustard,\n\n28:57.240 --> 28:58.240\nbut it's Dijon.\n\n28:58.240 --> 29:00.240\nIt's not yellow.\n\n29:00.240 --> 29:03.240\nNow I took that as a kindred spirit.\n\n29:03.240 --> 29:05.240\nLike I was like, I was like fucking a, yeah.\n\n29:05.240 --> 29:07.240\nI was like, I said, it's all right.\n\n29:07.240 --> 29:09.240\nI'm used to it.\n\n29:09.240 --> 29:12.240\nHe goes back to talking to her.\n\n29:12.240 --> 29:17.240\nAnd then I'm like, I think, well, he's going to get the brown mustard.\n\n29:17.240 --> 29:25.240\nSo I just offer up, I go like, yeah, I mean, I, I was at a restaurant recently where they\n\n29:25.240 --> 29:29.240\nhad yellow mustard on the table and it kind of blew my mind.\n\n29:29.240 --> 29:37.240\nAnd he and she both look at me with a combination of curiousness, curiosity, I think they call\n\n29:37.240 --> 29:40.240\nme a kid and disgust.\n\n29:40.240 --> 29:46.240\nJust like the vermouth and the dry martini is just disgust.\n\n29:46.240 --> 29:50.240\nLike disgust, if you pour a glass of it, then you're the bad guy.\n\n29:50.240 --> 29:52.240\nIf you just fucking run it around the rim.\n\n29:52.240 --> 29:55.240\nYeah, I'm disgusted with how curious I am.\n\n29:55.240 --> 29:58.240\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\n29:58.240 --> 29:59.240\nWhat the fuck?\n\n29:59.240 --> 30:01.240\nWhat the fuck are you babbling about?\n\n30:01.240 --> 30:06.240\nThink about what you said in effect was, hi, I have a lot of opinions on mustard.\n\n30:06.240 --> 30:09.240\nLike, that's your relationship with them at this point.\n\n30:09.240 --> 30:11.240\nWell, I'm not shocked you'd take their side.\n\n30:11.240 --> 30:15.240\nI know, but I'm just, I'm forensically, I'm breaking this down.\n\n30:15.240 --> 30:17.240\nNo, I'm aware of the fact.\n\n30:17.240 --> 30:22.240\nI looked, I looked over it and thought, I think what, what he might have heard was,\n\n30:22.240 --> 30:27.240\nit's okay that I have no yellow mustard or any mustard.\n\n30:27.240 --> 30:29.240\nI'm used to having no mustard.\n\n30:29.240 --> 30:32.240\nLike I'm Harry Potter before Hogwarts enrolled him.\n\n30:32.240 --> 30:36.240\nLike, I'm sorry, I don't deserve mustard, I'm okay with it.\n\n30:36.240 --> 30:39.240\nLike, okay, fine, he's allowed to interpret it that way.\n\n30:39.240 --> 30:40.240\nBut it was weird.\n\n30:40.240 --> 30:43.240\nThey both looked at me in a way that brought me back to the sixth grade, like,\n\n30:43.240 --> 30:47.240\nplayground where it was just like, I'd like to contribute to the conversation.\n\n30:47.240 --> 30:51.240\nAnd they're just like, ew, gross, so gross.\n\n30:51.240 --> 30:54.240\nYou're so gross, you're such a gross monster.\n\n30:54.240 --> 30:56.240\nEw, what are you talking about?\n\n30:56.240 --> 30:57.240\nTalking about mustard much?\n\n30:57.240 --> 30:59.240\nYou're gross.\n\n30:59.240 --> 31:05.240\nAnd then they just went back to talking about real estate, which is so fucking cool.\n\n31:05.240 --> 31:09.240\nBecause it's Texas, there's lots of real estate.\n\n31:09.240 --> 31:11.240\nAnd he never brought you your mustard?\n\n31:11.240 --> 31:14.240\nHe never brought fucking mustard.\n\n31:14.240 --> 31:18.240\nAnd over time, my burger tasted better with the inhumanity on it.\n\n31:18.240 --> 31:21.240\nI was like, I'm not gonna fucking play this game.\n\n31:21.240 --> 31:26.240\nI'm not gonna, I'm not gonna be uppity and say, like, I asked for mustard earlier.\n\n31:26.240 --> 31:29.240\nI'm just like, mm, good burger.\n\n31:29.240 --> 31:30.240\nCalled his fucking bluff.\n\n31:30.240 --> 31:32.240\nHere's what happened.\n\n31:32.240 --> 31:33.240\nShe settles up.\n\n31:33.240 --> 31:34.240\nShe walks away.\n\n31:34.240 --> 31:38.240\nShe's got real estate to sell.\n\n31:38.240 --> 31:40.240\nFor you video subscribers.\n\n31:40.240 --> 31:44.240\nThat was me dabbing more vodka behind my ears.\n\n31:44.240 --> 31:48.240\nThis guy goes, he goes, so what are you doing in town?\n\n31:48.240 --> 31:51.240\nWhat's your schedule like?\n\n31:51.240 --> 31:54.240\nI didn't start a conversation with this fucking guy.\n\n31:54.240 --> 31:56.240\nDon't tell what room number.\n\n31:56.240 --> 31:59.240\nI said, I'm going to Esther's Follies.\n\n31:59.240 --> 32:04.240\nHe's like, yeah, for what?\n\n32:04.240 --> 32:05.240\nJust to see the show.\n\n32:05.240 --> 32:06.240\nIt's really good.\n\n32:06.240 --> 32:07.240\nComedy show.\n\n32:07.240 --> 32:08.240\nThe Esther's Follies show.\n\n32:08.240 --> 32:12.240\nThey're still doing that over there.\n\n32:12.240 --> 32:16.240\nThis guy's on a road so high it's untenable.\n\n32:16.240 --> 32:19.240\nIt's ridiculous.\n\n32:19.240 --> 32:21.240\nAnd I just don't want to get yelled at.\n\n32:21.240 --> 32:23.240\nI just don't want to get beaten up.\n\n32:23.240 --> 32:26.240\nI just want to settle up.\n\n32:26.240 --> 32:27.240\nI'd like to settle up.\n\n32:27.240 --> 32:28.240\nLet me settle up.\n\n32:28.240 --> 32:30.240\nSo what are you doing over there?\n\n32:30.240 --> 32:32.240\nI'm doing a couple of shows.\n\n32:32.240 --> 32:33.240\nI'm doing a couple of shows.\n\n32:33.240 --> 32:34.240\nYeah, what shows?\n\n32:34.240 --> 32:36.240\nHe won't stop.\n\n32:36.240 --> 32:38.240\nBecause you can't crucify with one nail.\n\n32:38.240 --> 32:41.240\nThe person would fall off.\n\n32:41.240 --> 32:43.240\nYou'd be guilty of a minor felony.\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:45.240\nYou'd have wounded a hand.\n\n32:45.240 --> 32:47.240\nCrucifixion requires.\n\n32:47.240 --> 32:50.240\nThat's our episode title for certain.\n\n32:50.240 --> 32:51.240\nYou need the feet.\n\n32:51.240 --> 32:52.240\nYou need the hands.\n\n32:52.240 --> 32:53.240\nThis is some studied it.\n\n32:53.240 --> 32:55.240\nSo I was like, well, what show?\n\n32:55.240 --> 32:58.240\nAnd I'm like, well, I'm doing a podcast.\n\n32:58.240 --> 33:04.240\nAnd he was like, aha, I got it.\n\n33:04.240 --> 33:05.240\nGreat.\n\n33:05.240 --> 33:06.240\nCharge it to my room.\n\n33:06.240 --> 33:07.240\nSign it.\n\n33:07.240 --> 33:08.240\nI was like, what's the other show?\n\n33:08.240 --> 33:09.240\nJesus fucking Christ.\n\n33:09.240 --> 33:11.240\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n33:11.240 --> 33:12.240\nAnother podcast.\n\n33:12.240 --> 33:14.240\nHe shut him down.\n\n33:14.240 --> 33:21.240\nI said, it's promoting a show on CISO?\n\n33:21.240 --> 33:23.240\nCISO.\n\n33:23.240 --> 33:28.240\nTwist his face like a fucking pigs cock.\n\n33:28.240 --> 33:32.240\nLike Beetlejuice special effect.\n\n33:32.240 --> 33:36.240\nI can't let you know enough that I have no idea where you work.\n\n33:36.240 --> 33:40.240\nI don't pretend to think anyone knows what the fuck CISO is.\n\n33:40.240 --> 33:43.240\nThank you for coming on the show, by the way.\n\n33:43.240 --> 33:45.240\nYou're welcome.\n\n33:45.240 --> 33:49.240\nAnd then he finally goes, it goes like, well, what's that show?\n\n33:49.240 --> 33:51.240\nAnd then I said, it's promoting a show.\n\n33:51.240 --> 33:54.240\nIt's I playing Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n33:54.240 --> 33:57.240\nAnd he's like, his eyes, muscles.\n\n33:57.240 --> 33:59.240\nI'm going to kill this fucking guy.\n\n33:59.240 --> 34:01.240\nHe's going to get no Trump care from his fucking muscles\n\n34:01.240 --> 34:05.240\ndetaching from the eyes rolling back into his head.\n\n34:05.240 --> 34:10.240\nAnd he's polishing a glass like there's anyone else coming in.\n\n34:10.240 --> 34:13.240\nLike the robot and passengers.\n\n34:13.240 --> 34:14.240\nWhat?\n\n34:14.240 --> 34:15.240\nCan we talk about that movie?\n\n34:15.240 --> 34:16.240\nWhat the fuck?\n\n34:16.240 --> 34:17.240\nI just saw that movie.\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:19.240\nHe turned into Bert Kresicher right there.\n\n34:19.240 --> 34:20.240\nWhat the fuck?\n\n34:20.240 --> 34:21.240\nWhat the fuck?\n\n34:21.240 --> 34:22.240\nWhat the fuck?\n\n34:22.240 --> 34:23.240\nWhat?\n\n34:23.240 --> 34:24.240\nThat movie.\n\n34:24.240 --> 34:26.240\nHe waits all the time and then he wakes up.\n\n34:26.240 --> 34:27.240\nI was making the joke.\n\n34:27.240 --> 34:30.240\nThe rest of the podcast was in Falsetto.\n\n34:30.240 --> 34:33.240\nYou realize I was in Falsetto.\n\n34:33.240 --> 34:38.240\nI love Southwest because I like waiting in lines.\n\n34:38.240 --> 34:39.240\nOh, sir.\n\n34:39.240 --> 34:44.240\nThe only way to go to your double broadcast site.\n\n34:44.240 --> 34:47.240\nYou realize the third act of that movie.\n\n34:47.240 --> 34:49.240\nI don't know if anyone, I know everyone's like.\n\n34:49.240 --> 34:52.240\nWho's worried about having passengers spoiled?\n\n34:52.240 --> 34:53.240\nNobody.\n\n34:53.240 --> 34:55.240\nNobody gives a shit.\n\n34:55.240 --> 34:58.240\nYou've probably seen the blogs about why it's, it's a fucked up thing.\n\n34:58.240 --> 34:59.240\nYeah.\n\n34:59.240 --> 35:02.240\nThe only reason to watch it is if you like those two actors and you, you know, want to,\n\n35:02.240 --> 35:05.240\nlike it'd be sexy for you to see them in space.\n\n35:05.240 --> 35:07.240\nAnd you feel like everything is keeping.\n\n35:07.240 --> 35:09.240\nYou know, like I think it's only jerk off material.\n\n35:09.240 --> 35:14.240\nIt's like, it's like if sleepless in Seattle was about Tom Hanks buying night vision goggles\n\n35:14.240 --> 35:20.240\nand, you know, just living in Meg Ryan's apartment for a while.\n\n35:20.240 --> 35:24.240\nJust watching her from a cupboard.\n\n35:24.240 --> 35:25.240\nAnd then finally deciding.\n\n35:25.240 --> 35:26.240\nOnly when she sleeps.\n\n35:26.240 --> 35:27.240\nHe watches her when she's sleeping.\n\n35:27.240 --> 35:29.240\nAnd if instead of a kid.\n\n35:29.240 --> 35:30.240\nAnd he Googles her.\n\n35:30.240 --> 35:31.240\nHe Googles her while she's sleeping.\n\n35:31.240 --> 35:32.240\nOh, because that's what you know.\n\n35:32.240 --> 35:33.240\nIt's true love.\n\n35:33.240 --> 35:36.240\nI'm like, this is, this is beyond anything.\n\n35:36.240 --> 35:41.240\nHe threw a wine bottle, slipped on it and the first pair of tits he saw, he was like,\n\n35:41.240 --> 35:44.240\nI'm Googling her and low and behold, he's in love with her.\n\n35:44.240 --> 35:45.240\nYeah.\n\n35:45.240 --> 35:48.240\nIf he's going to play that creepy play, he should look, he should walk around and look\n\n35:48.240 --> 35:50.240\nat every sleeping passenger.\n\n35:50.240 --> 35:53.240\nThere should have found the sexiest one to wake up.\n\n35:53.240 --> 35:58.240\nThere needed to be at least one Foxy black lady on the ship that he was like looking\n\n35:58.240 --> 36:01.240\nat and going like, I don't like that fart joke.\n\n36:01.240 --> 36:05.240\nLike, like just, just show me that you're not racist.\n\n36:05.240 --> 36:09.240\nBut the, but we all, you all wrote your blogs about that, but did you notice that in the\n\n36:09.240 --> 36:13.240\nthird act of that movie, I was making the joke because my girlfriend and I are laughing\n\n36:13.240 --> 36:14.240\nat it while watching it.\n\n36:14.240 --> 36:17.240\nWe're like, oh my God, they really think this elephant isn't in the room.\n\n36:17.240 --> 36:21.240\nLike, like as it turns into a romance and they're playing dance dance revolution together,\n\n36:21.240 --> 36:24.240\nlike they really, they really think we forgot about this thing.\n\n36:24.240 --> 36:25.240\nOkay, fine.\n\n36:25.240 --> 36:27.240\nMisstep, swing and a mess, whatever.\n\n36:27.240 --> 36:33.240\nBut like, I was making the joke as we go to the third act, like, like, like, like as\n\n36:33.240 --> 36:40.240\nJennifer Lawrence would have to say, like, to Chris Pratt, like, my God, the ship, it\n\n36:40.240 --> 36:42.240\ndoesn't know what it wants.\n\n36:42.240 --> 36:44.240\nIt needs to be raped, Chris.\n\n36:44.240 --> 36:47.240\nYou need to rape the ship to save us.\n\n36:47.240 --> 36:50.240\nAnd I was making that joke.\n\n36:50.240 --> 36:51.240\nIt was true.\n\n36:51.240 --> 36:54.240\nThe act of the fucking ship needed, didn't know.\n\n36:54.240 --> 37:01.240\nIt had like a tube that wouldn't let things out or in and he had to go into it and like,\n\n37:01.240 --> 37:06.240\ndo you guys not, it's behind, it's like the third act of that movie.\n\n37:06.240 --> 37:09.240\nI thought we were talking about trolls.\n\n37:09.240 --> 37:14.240\nThe third act of that movie is a concretization of an argument for no meaning.\n\n37:14.240 --> 37:17.240\nThey say rape the ship.\n\n37:17.240 --> 37:21.240\nThe ship, the ship is all blocked up and it needs to just let it go.\n\n37:21.240 --> 37:23.240\nI've never heard of this movie.\n\n37:23.240 --> 37:28.240\nHe needs to penetrate a tube that cannot, that does not want to be penetrated.\n\n37:28.240 --> 37:29.240\nYou're not supposed to go in there.\n\n37:29.240 --> 37:30.240\nHe's not supposed to be in there.\n\n37:30.240 --> 37:31.240\nHe goes in there.\n\n37:31.240 --> 37:32.240\nHe goes in there.\n\n37:32.240 --> 37:35.240\nThe movie is clearly anti-ship rape.\n\n37:35.240 --> 37:36.240\nWell, finally.\n\n37:36.240 --> 37:37.240\nYeah.\n\n37:37.240 --> 37:38.240\nAnyways.\n\n37:38.240 --> 37:40.240\nBut then Andy Garcia shows up.\n\n37:40.240 --> 37:41.240\nOh my God.\n\n37:41.240 --> 37:42.240\nWhat is that about?\n\n37:42.240 --> 37:43.240\nHe gets top billing.\n\n37:43.240 --> 37:46.240\nIt has to be a movie about being nowhere.\n\n37:46.240 --> 37:51.240\nHe's like top billing because he looks at a tree.\n\n37:51.240 --> 37:55.240\nAgain, if you haven't seen Passengers, first of all, don't.\n\n37:55.240 --> 38:00.240\nAnd secondly, no, I thought there were parts of it that were all right.\n\n38:00.240 --> 38:04.240\nIt was Oscar nominated for visual production design.\n\n38:04.240 --> 38:05.240\nDoug, you love movies.\n\n38:05.240 --> 38:06.240\nI do.\n\n38:06.240 --> 38:10.240\nAs your podcast proudly proclaims.\n\n38:10.240 --> 38:12.240\nHave you seen Get Out?\n\n38:12.240 --> 38:13.240\nI have not seen Get Out.\n\n38:13.240 --> 38:15.240\nGo see it in the theater.\n\n38:15.240 --> 38:17.240\nIt's fucking good fun.\n\n38:17.240 --> 38:19.240\nWhat if there's nobody else in the theater?\n\n38:19.240 --> 38:22.240\nBecause I like to go to empty matinees.\n\n38:22.240 --> 38:23.240\nIs that ruining?\n\n38:23.240 --> 38:24.240\nIs it more fun with the crowd?\n\n38:24.240 --> 38:28.240\nI went to a matinee at the Los Feliz 3 in LA, which is usually empty.\n\n38:28.240 --> 38:31.240\nThere was, you know, there was 20, maybe 12 people in there.\n\n38:31.240 --> 38:33.240\n12 white people?\n\n38:33.240 --> 38:34.240\nThere was no black people.\n\n38:34.240 --> 38:35.240\nThere were no black people.\n\n38:35.240 --> 38:37.240\nIt was Asian and Latino.\n\n38:37.240 --> 38:38.240\nOh, okay.\n\n38:38.240 --> 38:39.240\nYeah.\n\n38:39.240 --> 38:42.240\nSo, but sadly, I kind of want to go.\n\n38:42.240 --> 38:45.240\nI don't know if this is really reductive in being a piece of shit.\n\n38:45.240 --> 38:48.240\nI want to go to a black neighborhood and watch that movie in the theater.\n\n38:48.240 --> 38:49.240\nOh my God.\n\n38:49.240 --> 38:53.240\nIt would probably be a phenomenal.\n\n38:53.240 --> 38:54.240\nOh shit.\n\n38:54.240 --> 38:55.240\nOh shit.\n\n38:55.240 --> 38:57.240\nIt would be a phenomenal experience.\n\n38:57.240 --> 38:58.240\nJesus Christ.\n\n38:58.240 --> 38:59.240\nThere's a black cowboy.\n\n38:59.240 --> 39:02.240\nYou've activated a black cowboy.\n\n39:02.240 --> 39:03.240\nOkay.\n\n39:03.240 --> 39:04.240\nHold up.\n\n39:04.240 --> 39:05.240\nHold up.\n\n39:05.240 --> 39:06.240\nOh my God.\n\n39:06.240 --> 39:07.240\nWestworld Season 2.\n\n39:07.240 --> 39:08.240\nNo, no, no.\n\n39:08.240 --> 39:10.240\nGet the fuck out of here.\n\n39:10.240 --> 39:11.240\nWhat's your name, first of all?\n\n39:11.240 --> 39:12.240\nAnthony Carter.\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:13.240\nAnthony Carter.\n\n39:13.240 --> 39:14.240\nGrab a mic, Anthony.\n\n39:14.240 --> 39:15.240\nHey, Anthony.\n\n39:15.240 --> 39:16.240\nGet in there.\n\n39:16.240 --> 39:17.240\nIt's that easy to be on the show.\n\n39:17.240 --> 39:18.240\nJoin us.\n\n39:18.240 --> 39:21.240\nSouth by Southwest 2017.\n\n39:21.240 --> 39:25.240\nWow, this is like we're on a coach flight home.\n\n39:25.240 --> 39:26.240\nYeah.\n\n39:26.240 --> 39:28.240\nNow, Anthony, without...\n\n39:28.240 --> 39:29.240\nWhoa.\n\n39:29.240 --> 39:30.240\nJesus.\n\n39:30.240 --> 39:31.240\nGod damn it, man.\n\n39:31.240 --> 39:32.240\nI'm kidding.\n\n39:32.240 --> 39:33.240\nI'm kidding.\n\n39:33.240 --> 39:34.240\nStophead spreading.\n\n39:34.240 --> 39:35.240\nI'm kidding.\n\n39:35.240 --> 39:36.240\nI'm kidding.\n\n39:36.240 --> 39:39.240\nFor the listeners that are not watching, we have a very good-looking black man with\n\n39:39.240 --> 39:42.240\na fantastic cowboy head on right now.\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:43.240\nYes, indeed.\n\n39:43.240 --> 39:44.240\nAnthony.\n\n39:44.240 --> 39:49.240\nNow, without spoiling the movie for Dan or anybody else, because it's a movie that\n\n39:49.240 --> 39:51.240\nI went in, I didn't know who was in it.\n\n39:51.240 --> 39:52.240\nI didn't know who directed it.\n\n39:52.240 --> 39:53.240\nI didn't know what the genre was.\n\n39:53.240 --> 39:55.240\nI didn't know a fucking thing about it.\n\n39:55.240 --> 40:00.240\nYou just knew that it was a movie that was asking you to leave.\n\n40:00.240 --> 40:03.240\nI went with my girlfriend and we had a fucking jam.\n\n40:03.240 --> 40:05.240\nIt was good fun.\n\n40:05.240 --> 40:08.240\nWhen I left, I said to my girlfriend, who, guess what?\n\n40:08.240 --> 40:10.240\nSpoiler alert, she's white.\n\n40:10.240 --> 40:11.240\nYeah.\n\n40:11.240 --> 40:15.240\nOh, well, that seems to be...\n\n40:15.240 --> 40:17.240\nWell, my girlfriend's white, too.\n\n40:17.240 --> 40:18.240\nShe's here somewhere.\n\n40:18.240 --> 40:20.240\nShe might have left me.\n\n40:20.240 --> 40:21.240\nBut here's the thing.\n\n40:21.240 --> 40:22.240\nHi, Kristen.\n\n40:22.240 --> 40:26.240\nWhen I left, I want to be...\n\n40:26.240 --> 40:31.240\nI don't want to be the guy that asks all of my black friends what they think about that\n\n40:31.240 --> 40:36.240\nmovie, because then I'm one of the white people in that movie that's asked, do you know Tiger\n\n40:36.240 --> 40:38.240\nWoods?\n\n40:38.240 --> 40:42.240\nBut the thing is, I do want to know, did you watch it in a theater?\n\n40:42.240 --> 40:44.240\nNo, I have not seen it either.\n\n40:44.240 --> 40:46.240\nWhat are you, motherfucker?\n\n40:46.240 --> 40:48.240\nGet out the fucking stage.\n\n40:48.240 --> 40:51.240\nI brought you up for one reason, Anthony Carter.\n\n40:51.240 --> 40:52.240\nI wouldn't ask it.\n\n40:52.240 --> 40:53.240\nThank you for having me.\n\n40:53.240 --> 40:56.240\nI was going to go see that movie.\n\n40:56.240 --> 40:58.240\nHey, no, no.\n\n40:58.240 --> 41:00.240\nI know I've seen the previews.\n\n41:00.240 --> 41:02.240\nNo, get the fuck out of the stage.\n\n41:02.240 --> 41:04.240\nWe all saw the previews.\n\n41:04.240 --> 41:06.240\nDo it, do it, do it, do it.\n\n41:06.240 --> 41:07.240\nYeah.\n\n41:07.240 --> 41:08.240\nMic drop.\n\n41:08.240 --> 41:12.240\nIt was a tasteful mic drop.\n\n41:12.240 --> 41:14.240\nYou usually don't see a mic drop with...\n\n41:14.240 --> 41:17.240\nHis friend does a Rick and Morty shirt on it.\n\n41:17.240 --> 41:20.240\nThere you go, pick up the...\n\n41:20.240 --> 41:22.240\nBetter hat, better shirt.\n\n41:22.240 --> 41:26.240\nAll right, I want all the white people to listen for me for one second, please.\n\n41:26.240 --> 41:27.240\nWhat's your name, first off?\n\n41:27.240 --> 41:28.240\nMy name is Calvin.\n\n41:28.240 --> 41:30.240\nCalvin, hold up.\n\n41:30.240 --> 41:32.240\nI'm just writing it down.\n\n41:32.240 --> 41:33.240\nSit down.\n\n41:33.240 --> 41:34.240\nHow long does this wait?\n\n41:34.240 --> 41:35.240\nHow long do I have to hold on for?\n\n41:35.240 --> 41:36.240\nWhat do you mean?\n\n41:36.240 --> 41:37.240\nWhat?\n\n41:37.240 --> 41:38.240\nDon't want to hold on.\n\n41:38.240 --> 41:40.240\nI just wanted to hear your name.\n\n41:40.240 --> 41:45.240\nWhite people, go and see, get out, and get educated.\n\n41:45.240 --> 41:46.240\nOh, shit.\n\n41:46.240 --> 41:47.240\nAll right.\n\n41:47.240 --> 41:48.240\nOh, shit.\n\n41:48.240 --> 41:49.240\nThe mic's being dropped.\n\n41:49.240 --> 41:50.240\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n41:50.240 --> 41:51.240\nCalvin, come on.\n\n41:51.240 --> 41:52.240\nSam, I...\n\n41:52.240 --> 41:53.240\nHe's got a question.\n\n41:53.240 --> 41:54.240\nNow, first off.\n\n41:54.240 --> 41:56.240\nWhat's the premature mic drop situation?\n\n41:56.240 --> 41:57.240\nGive us...\n\n41:57.240 --> 41:59.240\nI really hate when that happens.\n\n41:59.240 --> 42:00.240\nRight?\n\n42:00.240 --> 42:03.240\nYou don't want that to happen in front of a nice lady.\n\n42:03.240 --> 42:05.240\nYou wait, and then everything...\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:10.240\nYou dropped the mic kind of from pretty high tonight?\n\n42:10.240 --> 42:13.240\nI thought you were different.\n\n42:13.240 --> 42:15.240\nEveryone thinks I'm different.\n\n42:15.240 --> 42:18.240\nSo, Calvin, without spoilers, you dug the movie, right?\n\n42:18.240 --> 42:19.240\nOh, I loved it, yeah.\n\n42:19.240 --> 42:20.240\nThat's great.\n\n42:20.240 --> 42:23.240\nAnd you say white people should go see that movie?\n\n42:23.240 --> 42:25.240\nEvery white person should go see that movie.\n\n42:25.240 --> 42:26.240\nYes.\n\n42:26.240 --> 42:28.240\nIt's not a brave stance, though, right?\n\n42:28.240 --> 42:29.240\nI mean, we're not...\n\n42:29.240 --> 42:30.240\nIt's not controversial.\n\n42:30.240 --> 42:32.240\nOh, it's controversial in the best way possible.\n\n42:32.240 --> 42:37.240\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say that every Somalian needs to see this movie.\n\n42:37.240 --> 42:41.240\nNot just every Somalian, but every Somalian pirate also.\n\n42:41.240 --> 42:42.240\nSure.\n\n42:42.240 --> 42:47.240\nDo you think it has the power to change minds of white racist people?\n\n42:47.240 --> 42:48.240\nI think it makes...\n\n42:48.240 --> 42:51.240\nI guess it's a power to make them feel more insecure than they already do about...\n\n42:51.240 --> 42:52.240\nOh, nice.\n\n42:52.240 --> 42:53.240\nI like that.\n\n42:53.240 --> 42:54.240\nAnd they should feel that.\n\n42:54.240 --> 42:56.240\nWe need that right now.\n\n42:56.240 --> 42:58.240\nI walked out of the theater, and it's a small theater.\n\n42:58.240 --> 43:01.240\nIt was maybe only, again, like 15 people tops in there.\n\n43:01.240 --> 43:02.240\nI walked out.\n\n43:02.240 --> 43:05.240\nI was like, that movie was fucked up!\n\n43:05.240 --> 43:08.240\nAnd white people turned back and looked at me like...\n\n43:08.240 --> 43:11.240\nThey were bummed out.\n\n43:11.240 --> 43:13.240\nThey thought I hated the movies.\n\n43:13.240 --> 43:15.240\nNo, that movie's fucking crazy!\n\n43:15.240 --> 43:16.240\nYeah.\n\n43:16.240 --> 43:18.240\nI had a friend that saw it in Vermont, of all places.\n\n43:18.240 --> 43:19.240\nOh, dear heavens.\n\n43:19.240 --> 43:22.240\nI had a black friend that saw it in Vermont, and he laughed...\n\n43:22.240 --> 43:26.240\nYour story's getting harder to believe with every detail.\n\n43:26.240 --> 43:29.240\nThere actually aren't black people living in Vermont.\n\n43:29.240 --> 43:32.240\nThey're named Reggie and Ken.\n\n43:32.240 --> 43:35.240\nReggie, Ken, and Dana.\n\n43:35.240 --> 43:38.240\nHe saw it in Vermont, and he laughed the entire time,\n\n43:38.240 --> 43:40.240\nbut all the white people felt pretty uncomfortable.\n\n43:40.240 --> 43:42.240\nWhich made it better for him.\n\n43:42.240 --> 43:45.240\nOh, was he doing like Robert DeNiro and Kate Fear laughter at it?\n\n43:50.240 --> 43:51.240\nNo, that movie...\n\n43:51.240 --> 43:52.240\nBecause it's funny as shit.\n\n43:52.240 --> 43:53.240\nIt's really funny.\n\n43:53.240 --> 43:54.240\nIt's funny.\n\n43:54.240 --> 43:55.240\nIt's got a lot of social commentary, but, you know...\n\n43:55.240 --> 43:57.240\nThat would be the thing that kept me from saying it,\n\n43:57.240 --> 43:59.240\nis other people being funny.\n\n43:59.240 --> 44:01.240\nThat's what keeps me from watching Atlanta, too.\n\n44:01.240 --> 44:03.240\nYeah, it just makes you mad at it, right?\n\n44:03.240 --> 44:04.240\nYou just mad the whole time.\n\n44:04.240 --> 44:06.240\nIt's not race, it's like...\n\n44:06.240 --> 44:08.240\nYeah, I mean, believe me.\n\n44:08.240 --> 44:11.240\nI watched Blade Among the People.\n\n44:13.240 --> 44:16.240\nI felt their hatred of vampires.\n\n44:16.240 --> 44:18.240\nI joined in it, and I loved it.\n\n44:18.240 --> 44:20.240\nBut there's something really interesting about this.\n\n44:20.240 --> 44:22.240\nYou don't have to drag you down into the fucking murk, you're a stranger.\n\n44:22.240 --> 44:23.240\nNo, I was okay, I'm there, it's cool.\n\n44:23.240 --> 44:25.240\nBut there's an interesting thing about that,\n\n44:25.240 --> 44:28.240\nbecause I was telling that story that happens in LAX's lounge, right?\n\n44:28.240 --> 44:31.240\nSo this woman comes up to me, and she gives me these choices.\n\n44:39.240 --> 44:41.240\nThis is really happening.\n\n44:46.240 --> 44:47.240\nCheers.\n\n44:49.240 --> 44:51.240\nSorry about Season 3, we're drawing it.\n\n44:51.240 --> 44:55.240\nNo, it's...\n\n44:58.240 --> 45:00.240\nI mean, the Rick Roll thing was pretty nice,\n\n45:00.240 --> 45:02.240\nin the most torturous way possible.\n\n45:02.240 --> 45:03.240\nYeah, it was good.\n\n45:03.240 --> 45:06.240\nSee, when that woman came up to me at LAX,\n\n45:06.240 --> 45:09.240\nshe was referring to a woman over there,\n\n45:09.240 --> 45:12.240\nand there's a lot of things on the table,\n\n45:12.240 --> 45:16.240\nand the weird energy that squirted out of me...\n\n45:18.240 --> 45:20.240\nThat's a nice way to put it.\n\n45:20.240 --> 45:23.240\nWas, you know, like Plato studied steam engines,\n\n45:23.240 --> 45:26.240\nthe platonic engine where you just heat up a bunch of water,\n\n45:26.240 --> 45:28.240\nand you only give it so much egress,\n\n45:28.240 --> 45:31.240\nthat if you put it in different positions,\n\n45:31.240 --> 45:34.240\nyou'll make a thing spin around, it's a platonic engine, right?\n\n45:34.240 --> 45:38.240\nIt's like steam escaping, it'll find the nearest escape,\n\n45:38.240 --> 45:41.240\nit'll find the weakest membrane to squeak through.\n\n45:41.240 --> 45:43.240\nNow, isn't that membrane's fault?\n\n45:43.240 --> 45:46.240\nSo for instance, why have we been a misogynistic culture\n\n45:46.240 --> 45:49.240\nlonger than we've been a racist culture?\n\n45:49.240 --> 45:52.240\nLike, don't get aggravated by my assertion there.\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:58.240\nWhy are we quicker to club women than we are to...\n\n45:58.240 --> 46:01.240\nLike, why are we so able to, like,\n\n46:01.240 --> 46:05.240\novercome pigment before we are able to...\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:08.240\nIs this question for anybody on the panel?\n\n46:08.240 --> 46:12.240\nI, in a sense, when that woman said to me at the airport,\n\n46:12.240 --> 46:15.240\nshe said, how come you don't tell that woman to shut the fuck up?\n\n46:15.240 --> 46:19.240\nI said, well, because I'm my mother-in-law.\n\n46:19.240 --> 46:21.240\nYou know, like, it was fake.\n\n46:21.240 --> 46:23.240\nIt was like where the...\n\n46:23.240 --> 46:26.240\nIt was an essentially misogynistic, like, valve\n\n46:26.240 --> 46:28.240\nthat that energy went through.\n\n46:28.240 --> 46:31.240\nI'm like, with women, like, if you think women talking loud\n\n46:31.240 --> 46:34.240\nis gonna get my goat, you should deal with what I deal with\n\n46:34.240 --> 46:35.240\non Christmas Eve.\n\n46:35.240 --> 46:37.240\nI don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.\n\n46:37.240 --> 46:39.240\nI was just trying to escape a situation.\n\n46:39.240 --> 46:44.240\nThe steam was so high, that was the weakest membrane.\n\n46:44.240 --> 46:46.240\nIt wouldn't have been...\n\n46:46.240 --> 46:48.240\nIf it was the 1950s, would I have said to that woman,\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:52.240\nlike, bite your tongue, lady.\n\n46:52.240 --> 46:53.240\nYou know your place.\n\n46:53.240 --> 46:54.240\nGive me a cornflakes.\n\n46:54.240 --> 46:56.240\nOh, no.\n\n46:56.240 --> 47:00.240\nThat got much worse than the second part.\n\n47:00.240 --> 47:02.240\nThat's my question. Answer it.\n\n47:02.240 --> 47:04.240\nI think it goes...\n\n47:04.240 --> 47:06.240\nWell, fuck.\n\n47:06.240 --> 47:07.240\nTen seconds.\n\n47:07.240 --> 47:09.240\nNine, eight.\n\n47:09.240 --> 47:13.240\nI think it comes down to, I mean, just talking about it.\n\n47:13.240 --> 47:16.240\nAnd I think a lot of people that feel like misogyny is not a problem,\n\n47:16.240 --> 47:18.240\nthey haven't dealt with it or thought about it\n\n47:18.240 --> 47:21.240\nor had a woman in their life that actually experienced that.\n\n47:21.240 --> 47:23.240\nWho doesn't have a woman in their life?\n\n47:23.240 --> 47:25.240\nLike, that's the thing I think...\n\n47:25.240 --> 47:28.240\nTo answer your question, Dan, I think misogyny...\n\n47:28.240 --> 47:31.240\nMisogyny is bigger than racism.\n\n47:31.240 --> 47:33.240\nI don't know by what percentage, but I think it's happening\n\n47:33.240 --> 47:37.240\nbecause women are 50%...\n\n47:37.240 --> 47:41.240\nLike, women are a bigger threat because there's more of them.\n\n47:41.240 --> 47:45.240\nAnd men that are threatened by women are going...\n\n47:45.240 --> 47:46.240\nYou know what I mean?\n\n47:46.240 --> 47:48.240\nThey're going to be threatened because it's half of the people\n\n47:48.240 --> 47:49.240\nand it's also their mother.\n\n47:49.240 --> 47:52.240\nIt's also their mama is a fucking woman, you know?\n\n47:52.240 --> 47:54.240\nYes, because your memories of becoming a man\n\n47:54.240 --> 47:56.240\ninvolve becoming abusive to your mother.\n\n47:56.240 --> 47:59.240\nLike, in a lie...\n\n47:59.240 --> 48:01.240\nShut up, mom. I don't want to do this.\n\n48:01.240 --> 48:02.240\nRight. And you didn't...\n\n48:02.240 --> 48:04.240\nAs a white kid, you weren't growing up going,\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:05.240\nshut up, black guy.\n\n48:05.240 --> 48:07.240\nLike...\n\n48:07.240 --> 48:10.240\nSo it's all directed at women and not race.\n\n48:10.240 --> 48:12.240\nI like that we've solved that problem.\n\n48:12.240 --> 48:16.240\nRacism's over, misogyny needs some work on it.\n\n48:16.240 --> 48:18.240\nWe need to bring race back into puberty.\n\n48:18.240 --> 48:21.240\nI'm so glad there's no women up here to defend themselves right now.\n\n48:21.240 --> 48:24.240\nYour mom's in a hit you, didn't they?\n\n48:24.240 --> 48:27.240\nWe'll tell women how to deal with this.\n\n48:27.240 --> 48:29.240\nLike, for all the women in the audience,\n\n48:29.240 --> 48:30.240\nwatching a bunch of white dudes...\n\n48:30.240 --> 48:31.240\nOh, not white dudes.\n\n48:31.240 --> 48:33.240\nWhite dudes minus one.\n\n48:33.240 --> 48:34.240\nHe's close enough.\n\n48:34.240 --> 48:35.240\nSit the fuck down.\n\n48:35.240 --> 48:37.240\nLook at that hat. He's close enough to white.\n\n48:37.240 --> 48:40.240\nAnd watching a bunch of men talk about women...\n\n48:40.240 --> 48:41.240\nHad a t-shirt?\n\n48:41.240 --> 48:42.240\nYeah, it's a guy...\n\n48:42.240 --> 48:45.240\nHis t-shirt is on upside down.\n\n48:45.240 --> 48:47.240\nOr he's got a shirt on...\n\n48:47.240 --> 48:49.240\nI don't think you can put a t-shirt on upside down.\n\n48:49.240 --> 48:52.240\nI'm gonna sit down.\n\n48:52.240 --> 48:54.240\nI mean, you can. It'd be hard.\n\n48:54.240 --> 48:56.240\nYeah, it fits weird.\n\n48:56.240 --> 48:58.240\nYeah.\n\n48:58.240 --> 48:59.240\nIt's more of a tube top.\n\n48:59.240 --> 49:00.240\nA little tight.\n\n49:00.240 --> 49:02.240\nJeff, you got derailed midstream.\n\n49:02.240 --> 49:04.240\nYou were about to incite women to hate the show.\n\n49:04.240 --> 49:06.240\nPlease continue.\n\n49:06.240 --> 49:09.240\nWomen already hate the show.\n\n49:09.240 --> 49:12.240\nWatching three men stumble into the realization\n\n49:12.240 --> 49:15.240\nthat this is the easiest thing in the world\n\n49:15.240 --> 49:16.240\nthat it always has been,\n\n49:16.240 --> 49:19.240\nis probably just as good for whatever money\n\n49:19.240 --> 49:22.240\nthey paid for their badges as anything.\n\n49:22.240 --> 49:25.240\nI mean, it's...\n\n49:25.240 --> 49:28.240\nBecause men can't imagine what it's like to be a woman.\n\n49:28.240 --> 49:30.240\nWe can't. We can think we can. We fucking can't.\n\n49:30.240 --> 49:34.240\nI'm going to. Watch.\n\n49:34.240 --> 49:36.240\nStand back.\n\n49:36.240 --> 49:40.240\nSpencer, dungeon master, me waking up of being a woman.\n\n49:40.240 --> 49:43.240\nJeff, play appropriate music.\n\n49:43.240 --> 49:45.240\nHow much time do we have left?\n\n49:45.240 --> 49:47.240\nWe got loads of time.\n\n49:47.240 --> 49:49.240\nOkay.\n\n49:49.240 --> 49:54.240\nYou wake up in a bedroom.\n\n49:54.240 --> 49:56.240\nIt's empty.\n\n49:56.240 --> 50:04.240\nBecause you make less money than men.\n\n50:04.240 --> 50:05.240\nI get out of bed.\n\n50:05.240 --> 50:07.240\nAll right.\n\n50:07.240 --> 50:12.240\nYou're still in the bedroom.\n\n50:12.240 --> 50:16.240\nI put on whatever outfit will walk the line\n\n50:16.240 --> 50:18.240\nbetween me being branded a slut\n\n50:18.240 --> 50:22.240\nand me being dismissed as a human being.\n\n50:22.240 --> 50:24.240\nYou managed to thread the needle once more\n\n50:24.240 --> 50:26.240\nlike millions of women across the earth\n\n50:26.240 --> 50:29.240\ndo every morning of their lives.\n\n50:29.240 --> 50:33.240\nSlutty outfit.\n\n50:33.240 --> 50:36.240\nCan I ask what I'm wearing?\n\n50:36.240 --> 50:37.240\nNo.\n\n50:37.240 --> 50:38.240\nOkay.\n\n50:38.240 --> 50:41.240\nThat's probably a good idea.\n\n50:41.240 --> 50:44.240\nI go down to get into an Uber.\n\n50:44.240 --> 50:45.240\nAll right.\n\n50:45.240 --> 50:48.240\nWhere I'm certain that someone will simply drive me to work.\n\n50:48.240 --> 50:50.240\nIt's doing the thing where it's like a block away\n\n50:50.240 --> 50:53.240\nbut it's just spinning around for the last five minutes.\n\n50:53.240 --> 50:56.240\nIt shows up and the guy makes no indication\n\n50:56.240 --> 51:00.240\nthat that wasn't supposed to be part of his job.\n\n51:00.240 --> 51:02.240\nI get in.\n\n51:02.240 --> 51:03.240\nOh.\n\n51:03.240 --> 51:06.240\nHe touches you.\n\n51:06.240 --> 51:08.240\nI file a complaint with Uber.\n\n51:08.240 --> 51:09.240\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n51:09.240 --> 51:16.240\nHe gets promoted to head of Uber.\n\n51:16.240 --> 51:18.240\nYou get to your job or whatever.\n\n51:18.240 --> 51:20.240\nI get out of the Uber and I run for president.\n\n51:20.240 --> 51:22.240\nI'm tired of this.\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:23.240\nI'm fucking ending it.\n\n51:23.240 --> 51:24.240\nI've played nice.\n\n51:24.240 --> 51:25.240\nI'm running for president.\n\n51:25.240 --> 51:26.240\nYou lose.\n\n51:26.240 --> 51:27.240\nYeah.\n\n51:27.240 --> 51:30.240\nMore people hated me than liked me.\n\n51:30.240 --> 51:34.240\nIt turns out you did what you had to do.\n\n51:34.240 --> 51:36.240\nAre you saying I lost the popular vote?\n\n51:36.240 --> 51:37.240\nNo.\n\n51:37.240 --> 51:38.240\nThat's what's crazy.\n\n51:38.240 --> 51:39.240\nOh.\n\n51:39.240 --> 51:44.240\nAnd it's argued, you know, you might have won even harder\n\n51:44.240 --> 51:46.240\nif not for, you know, the striking.\n\n51:46.240 --> 51:47.240\nOkay.\n\n51:47.240 --> 51:48.240\nThat's too political.\n\n51:48.240 --> 51:49.240\nSorry.\n\n51:49.240 --> 51:53.240\nI don't know why it's that.\n\n51:53.240 --> 51:56.240\nWell, I walk into the woods and I wait for someone to need me.\n\n51:56.240 --> 51:57.240\nNo one, yeah.\n\n51:57.240 --> 52:00.240\nNo one needs you, but everyone wants something from you.\n\n52:00.240 --> 52:02.240\nAnd it's your problem.\n\n52:02.240 --> 52:08.240\nAll the trees are mad.\n\n52:08.240 --> 52:10.240\nI go up to one of the trees.\n\n52:10.240 --> 52:11.240\nOkay.\n\n52:11.240 --> 52:14.240\nIt ignores you.\n\n52:14.240 --> 52:17.240\nI thought I just heard you grumbling things about me being...\n\n52:17.240 --> 52:19.240\nWhat a bitch.\n\n52:19.240 --> 52:23.240\nYou know, we've been growing here for hundreds of years.\n\n52:23.240 --> 52:28.240\nNo one's coming through being talked about by us before until you.\n\n52:28.240 --> 52:30.240\nSo you're the problem.\n\n52:30.240 --> 52:32.240\nAll right.\n\n52:32.240 --> 52:34.240\nGo further into the woods.\n\n52:34.240 --> 52:35.240\nAll right.\n\n52:35.240 --> 52:38.240\nYou do that.\n\n52:38.240 --> 52:46.240\nYou find, you find, you know, you're feeling, you're feeling cramping up.\n\n52:46.240 --> 52:49.240\nCramping.\n\n52:49.240 --> 52:51.240\nOh, no.\n\n52:51.240 --> 52:54.240\nI pay attention to that feeling.\n\n52:54.240 --> 53:00.240\nIt's worse than what men have to deal with on their daily lives.\n\n53:00.240 --> 53:05.240\nBut you just, you don't even, you know, you don't even mention it unless it's kind of crippling you and making you in bed.\n\n53:05.240 --> 53:08.240\nThe fact that you're walking around means it's not even worth mentioning,\n\n53:08.240 --> 53:12.240\neven though it's terrible crippling agony.\n\n53:12.240 --> 53:22.240\nI go home and I put on some tea and I read a book.\n\n53:22.240 --> 53:31.240\nThe book has all sorts of opinions on stuff that you should do or represent that don't even have anything to do with what you think you should do in life.\n\n53:31.240 --> 53:33.240\nI turn on the television.\n\n53:33.240 --> 53:36.240\nI feel like we peaked. Have we peaked?\n\n53:36.240 --> 53:46.240\nSorry. On the television, it's more of the same. The media is rewarding men for doing things that hurt you and punishing you for doing the things that demand your equal rights.\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:53.240\nYou see, this is what I mean. It's just, it's just the sad reality of life.\n\n53:53.240 --> 54:00.240\nI try, I try to do comedy about the situation because I think it'll be so funny that it'll make people, yeah.\n\n54:00.240 --> 54:03.240\nYeah. Why aren't women funny? This is terrible.\n\n54:03.240 --> 54:05.240\nWho said that?\n\n54:05.240 --> 54:07.240\nNobody on earth.\n\n54:07.240 --> 54:11.240\nI try to prove them wrong by being really dirty and later on.\n\n54:11.240 --> 54:16.240\nYou do amazing stuff and a couple alt comedians and people in the scene are like, yeah, she's getting really big.\n\n54:16.240 --> 54:20.240\nBut you know, you've done everything that everyone, I don't know.\n\n54:20.240 --> 54:26.240\nI just say a really funny joke. I'd say a really funny joke that's like kind of fucking crazy because it's inappropriate.\n\n54:26.240 --> 54:30.240\nOh, it goes over well. You get what's considered a polite chuckle.\n\n54:30.240 --> 54:39.240\nAnd after the show, seven guys try and hit on you saying, you know, you're actually pretty funny.\n\n54:39.240 --> 54:41.240\nNow can I be president?\n\n54:41.240 --> 54:43.240\nNo.\n\n54:43.240 --> 54:44.240\nAll right.\n\n54:44.240 --> 54:51.240\nSpencer Crittenden, world's best feminist.\n\n54:51.240 --> 54:54.240\nMale feminist. World's best male feminist.\n\n54:54.240 --> 54:59.240\nBut like, to really answer your question, I really think you're talking about abuse.\n\n54:59.240 --> 55:02.240\nLater that same night.\n\n55:02.240 --> 55:05.240\nYou're talking about the mental abuse earlier. I think men have that problem.\n\n55:05.240 --> 55:13.240\nThey don't want to accept the fact that, you know, they've, you know, maybe abused women, you know, emotionally, even if it's intentionally or not, they don't want to acknowledge it.\n\n55:13.240 --> 55:14.240\nI think that's the biggest problem.\n\n55:14.240 --> 55:16.240\nOh, no, that's the most offensive thing.\n\n55:16.240 --> 55:20.240\nRacially, I always repeat that joke that our late friend Mario from the drawing room said.\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:26.240\nIt's like, you can call a white guy a honky, you can call him a cracker, but if you call him a racist, he gets really bent out of shape.\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:32.240\nYou can call a man anything you want, but if you say that he's abusing women, they'll fucking choke you.\n\n55:32.240 --> 55:33.240\nWhat?\n\n55:33.240 --> 55:46.240\nBut we do, I think that, you know, we should probably, it's all you have to do is just like put a little radar tag on your lapel and just be like, oh, how am I interacting with anybody, with people?\n\n55:46.240 --> 55:48.240\nThat's what my therapist is always saying.\n\n55:48.240 --> 55:52.240\nShe's like, you don't have to quit drinking. She said that.\n\n55:52.240 --> 55:54.240\nShe said, just notice when you take a drink.\n\n55:54.240 --> 55:56.240\nThat's it. That'll be the beginning of it.\n\n55:56.240 --> 55:58.240\nYeah, look in the cup, see what's up.\n\n55:58.240 --> 56:02.240\nOh, vodka again.\n\n56:02.240 --> 56:05.240\nOr vodka.\n\n56:05.240 --> 56:14.240\nBut yeah, I think of what, but that's why, that's why people that we often complain about, people that are outspoken and it was like, we go like, oh, they get tweeted out.\n\n56:14.240 --> 56:23.240\nSo we had our friends from Reductress on the podcast and they talked about the women that stand out that they might be just comedically saying, hey, look at this phenomenon.\n\n56:23.240 --> 56:25.240\nIt's like saying, look at Joan of Arc.\n\n56:25.240 --> 56:38.240\nIt's like there's more kindling there and there's drier weather and there's easier ways to start fires and it turns to witch burning way faster when someone is just saying, hey, be aware of this.\n\n56:38.240 --> 56:43.240\nBut being aware of something doesn't mean someone wants your pants.\n\n56:43.240 --> 56:45.240\nNo one's going to take your pants.\n\n56:45.240 --> 56:53.240\nLike if privilege is real and you admit that it's real, it means you have privilege. It means no one can have your pants.\n\n56:53.240 --> 56:58.240\nYeah, you can't pry on my pants from my cold heart.\n\n56:58.240 --> 57:00.240\nCold, you know what I meant.\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:02.240\nCold dead, cold dead heart fingers.\n\n57:02.240 --> 57:05.240\nCold dead dick.\n\n57:05.240 --> 57:08.240\nIt took me a while to see things that way too.\n\n57:08.240 --> 57:14.240\nBecause as I've said a thousand times, it's like, I get it. You're a doughy white guy. You've been born. You come up through the system.\n\n57:14.240 --> 57:16.240\nYou endure when you perceive.\n\n57:16.240 --> 57:18.240\nThe system. The mean streets.\n\n57:18.240 --> 57:20.240\nYou're out there in Gen Pop.\n\n57:20.240 --> 57:24.240\nThe system.\n\n57:24.240 --> 57:26.240\nOkay, granted.\n\n57:26.240 --> 57:30.240\nJust click your heels, Dorothy. You've been in Oz the whole time.\n\n57:30.240 --> 57:32.240\nWhat you perceive is the system.\n\n57:32.240 --> 57:40.240\nAnd then when you start hearing talk about how you've had it easy, how are you supposed to react if you have an ounce of salt in your salt bladder?\n\n57:40.240 --> 57:42.240\nI don't know how medicine works.\n\n57:42.240 --> 57:44.240\nSalt bladder.\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:50.240\nPeople feel really insecure. Men feel really insecure really quick when that's even challenged, which I think is a weird thing.\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:52.240\nAnd they don't even want to meditate on it at all.\n\n57:52.240 --> 58:00.240\nI would argue the one thing that unites us all is that we all would have the same reaction if we were all told, shut up, stop complaining you've had it easy.\n\n58:00.240 --> 58:06.240\nWe all, it's just that there's got to be somebody at the top that actually has had it easy.\n\n58:06.240 --> 58:10.240\nThose people are going to hear that. They're going to take that the wrong way.\n\n58:10.240 --> 58:16.240\nIt is the same reaction, though. It's like, it is the thing that we say to each other.\n\n58:16.240 --> 58:26.240\nWhen someone says, I work as a clicky-clock clacker, and I don't get enough click-clacks for my click-click.\n\n58:26.240 --> 58:32.240\nYou say the same thing to that person that if someone said it to you, you would fucking punch him in the face.\n\n58:32.240 --> 58:40.240\nFuck you, you privileged piece of shit. You always dump that shit downhill. You dump it down.\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:44.240\nEvery time there's a strike, every time someone sues a corporation because a jerk had killed their kid.\n\n58:44.240 --> 58:50.240\nWe always side with the corporation. We have this human tendency to be like, fuck you, you whiny piece of shit.\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:54.240\nYou should fucking love capitalism. Fucking rules.\n\n58:54.240 --> 58:58.240\nWhat was my point? I don't know. Watch CISO.\n\n58:58.240 --> 59:06.240\nI think your point was the guy that was burnt by hot coffee at McDonald's really deserved to win that lawsuit.\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:12.240\nYeah, that coffee was too hot. It was too hot. People don't know, but it was too hot.\n\n59:12.240 --> 59:15.240\nIt wasn't a goddamn guy. It was a fucking old lady.\n\n59:15.240 --> 59:20.240\nOh, I didn't know who it was. I just remember Kramer trying it on Seinfeld.\n\n59:20.240 --> 59:26.240\nI just saw that episode. It's indication they had like the Johnny Cochran like analog guy.\n\n59:26.240 --> 59:28.240\nDid you watch it on CISO?\n\n59:28.240 --> 59:32.240\nProbably.

01:07:56.240\nI'm going to lift him to start him.\n\n01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240\nLift him up.\n\n01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.240\nI'm going to lift Doug Benson like a girl.\n\n01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.240\nYo, Calvin, talk about a Doug Benson rap, Calvin.\n\n01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.240\nDoug, Doug, Doug Benson rap.\n\n01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.240\nWhy is he rapping?\n\n01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240\nHe's not even clapping.\n\n01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240\nDo you have the clap?\n\n01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240\nWhat is the clap?\n\n01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240\nWhy am I rapping?\n\n01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240\nJeff, why'd you do this?\n\n01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.240\nThere's two guys right next to me who could do it better.\n\n01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.240\nThat didn't rhyme.\n\n01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.240\nThis is a good example of why you shouldn't have said my name.\n\n01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.240\nBut it's cool.\n\n01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.240\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.240\nI'm going to sell the only black guys on stage rapping.\n\n01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240\nYeah.\n\n01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.240\nIt's Calvin Doug Benson rap.\n\n01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.240\nHe said white guys can rap better.\n\n01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.240\nAnd it's also the only one not in a sweater.\n\n01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240\nOh.\n\n01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.240\nMama's spaghetti.\n\n01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240\nIt's warm out.\n\n01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.240\nYou know it.\n\n01:08:45.240 -->

wrong.\n\n01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.240\nThis is called the Doug Benson rap.\n\n01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.240\nI know.\n\n01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.240\nI tried.\n\n01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240\nWhen I said I could do it, I lied.\n\n01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.240\nI said, yeah.\n\n01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.240\nYeah.\n\n01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.240\nLet yourself go.\n\n01:09:05.240 -->

for our entertainment.\n\n01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.240\nThat's all I got.\n\n01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.240\nYo, left to right.\n\n01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240\nI'm going to fuck your

rhyme this with nothing but the front lawn.\n\n01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240\nDijon.\n\n01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.240\nFuck her.\n\n01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.240\nDijon.\n\n01:09:30.240 -->
