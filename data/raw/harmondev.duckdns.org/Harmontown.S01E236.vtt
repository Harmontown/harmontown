00:00.000 --> 00:17.440
From Esther's Follies, in Austin, Motherfucking Texas, Harmontown, is now in session.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.440
Hello, South by Southwest.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.000
Is it me or is it quieter here now?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
The crowd's just smaller.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
It's groovy.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
I love it.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Only the sexy people now.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Speaking of sexy people, let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.

00:34.000 --> 00:43.000
Hey guys, can I be heard?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh yeah.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Can we get more level on these mics?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Sound person?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Let's get my mic up and Spencer's mic up a little bit.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
One, two, higher, higher, higher.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I also like South by Southwest.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
No, not the music, the microphones.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, let's get the music louder, I think, maybe.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Well, fuck it.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
Let's bring out Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmontown.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Dan Harmon.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Thank you.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you so much.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Thank you.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I feel like I remember being here.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
We were here at one point.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes, you were.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And you were delightful.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I think I was going through a divorce.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I don't know what was happening.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Also, yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I think we were through the divorce at that point.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Well, that's when the trouble starts.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Because you have the divorce to focus on and then afterwards you're like, wait, I'm miserable.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
The unaddressed issue behind the note behind the note we call it in TV writers' notes.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Why does Sony want a dog on the show?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Because they think the show sucks.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
They don't love dogs.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
They hate your show.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
It's the note behind the note.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I lost you.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I lost you in 10 seconds.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I've known you since 1994.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
You lost me for the first time.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
This show is about alienation.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
We're here because we're alienated.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
And if you can't relate to an alienated person, then you're a fucking hypocrite.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
What I do love about performing here at Esther's Follies is that there's always a band right outside.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I can hear them thumping, thumping away at the secessionist movement.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
They're thumping, thumping at the walls of America.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Let me out.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm Texas for God's sake.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I want to be free.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Is Texas seceding or is Austin seceding from Texas?

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Austin is the capital of the intelligent secessionist movement.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
You go to Dallas and Houston and you have people who are just doing it because they're racist.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
In Austin, they're doing it because they're into the fucking pogs.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
I told them I have a bad feeling about this show.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
I think it's going to get worse.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I don't have to prepare for this stuff.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
There's a rapist in the White House.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
All right.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I wake up in the morning and I'm like, should I brush my teeth?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't know.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
There's a rapist in the White House.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
He fucked a 13-year-old girl in front of Jeff Epstein.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
They recorded it.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
They flushed it into a fucking space vacuum.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
What?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Am I unfounded in my accusations?

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
Am I some kind of crazy person saying microwaves are cameras?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I don't want to be branded a nut bag.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
I might end up the most powerful person in the fucking world.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I don't want to misspeak and have people start to think I'm crazy.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
They might start voting for me.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
They start giving me piles of money and chanting my name in the streets

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
if I accidentally say something so fucked up

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
that it taps into the most visceral...

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
What are you writing?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
What are you writing?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Are you a reporter?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Keep talking.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Everything he says is lies.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
It's fake.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
In advance, I'm telling you, I'm telling you,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
even if you liked me, it was rigged.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm writing down today's date

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
so I know when you were arrested.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
What is it? 13th?

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
We were delayed due to weather, not extreme weather.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Normal weather.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Weather changes.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Get over it.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's a hard line to take.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
LAX was enshrouded by a mystical fog

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
and John Carpenter pirates were creeping around with maggots coming out of their eye sockets,

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
crashing at anyone who wandered too far from the cement,

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
but it's totally normal and our flight was delayed a couple of times

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
and so I was in the new United Lounge.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I had to buy a ticket for $60.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
I retweeted an infographic that showed you

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
what if the world was 100 people?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Hey Spencer, how are you doing?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Hey guys.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I always forget to involve you.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
What if the world was 100 people?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
If the world was 100 people, according to this infographic,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
one of the people, one percent of the population of the United States,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
spends over $90 a day.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
So I've been monitoring my...

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
But I'm done with that before I get out of bed.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
I pay a publicist $3,000 a month to keep me out of TMZ.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm sure the joke's on me. I'm sure TMZ doesn't want to write anything about me.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
But I can't know that unless I stop giving these people $3,000 a month.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
That's more than $90 a day right there.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Forget where I get my croissant.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Also, forget the money you paid to learn how to pronounce croissant.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Steve Martin, you son of a bitch.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I paid $60 to get into this lounge,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
which looked like an Apple store with melon slices.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
There was a young lady. She was sitting a few counters away from me.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
There was a sea of tables, and they all had the little AC outlets on them.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
She had her laptop. She was kind of a Rachel Maddow, but blonde.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
She was statuesque and had a long neck, and she had a Bluetooth in,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
and she was tapping the laptop.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
And she was speaking very loudly about what she was doing.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
She was saying, that's not what I want.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
What I want is this, and I think it should be this.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
And I was like, she was loud, but I noted it, but I didn't have to sit near her.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
And she was in a sea of Brazilian Brazil as in the movie, the Terry Gilliam movie.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
She was in this Brazilian-esque sea of things.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It wasn't like a private area.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
There wasn't a fireplace raging next to her.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
There wasn't a state Bernard waiting to save anybody from anything with hot cocoa.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
There wasn't?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
No.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Because most airport lunches provide that.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
But I thought it was really weird, because there was a lady that came by

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
who was like vacuuming and picking things up.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
And I always write race-neutral characters, but this woman was black.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
And I felt like it was important, because she was like in her 70s, I felt,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
and she was African-American.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
And as she was picking things up, she leaned over to me into my Minecraft game,

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
and she went, how come you haven't told that woman to pipe it down?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
No!

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Which activated this weird Tim Allen instinct in me where I was like,

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I just wanted her to like me.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
So I was like, hey, I've learned to tune out worse than that.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
And she's like, I got it.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm like, why am I telling, what am I talking about?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
What am I, Fred Flintstone?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I don't know.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I was just playing.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
It sounds like you're an act two of Get Out.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Well, don't spoil that shit.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I have to see it.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Fucking movies.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Also, tell me nothing about season one of Atlanta.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
I like how you had a genuine communication with a real human being in your first instinct.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
What the fuck is going on?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Well, because I was, no, I'm observing myself.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm going, like, why was I, she was saying,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
there's a person that works in the airport saying,

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
why haven't you, fellow consumer, told her to shut the fuck up?

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
And so, and my response was neither because, madam, she has a right to be a human.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Like, nor was it like, you're right.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Shut up, madam.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Nor was it you tell her.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
No, it was the best.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
It was the right option.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I took a path of least resistance through.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Plato could have predicted my past.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Right.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
Fucking steam shooting through the only opening available that turned me into a weird 80s comic.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Like lamenting my, like, oh, the old ball and chain.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Like, I made up a fictional step mom at home.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Like, I'm like, well, I tune out worse than that.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
What am I talking about?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's to a person who said something to you.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I just don't want the person that's talking to me to beat me up.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Right.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That person I don't want to beat me up.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
I was tuning her out.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I did everything.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So here's what, so then that was, she walked away.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I was like, fucking nailed it with her.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, you did.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
She loves me.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
She loves me.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
She loves me.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
She's like, I hear that.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I vacuum, vacuum, pick, pick.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And so I'm like, fucking nailed it today.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I really, I made someone like me.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
So then this, and then moments after that, this old guy walks up and because I've done

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
non-race neutral casting, I'll tell you, this is like a kind of like a 90 year old Michael

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
chick list, like walks up to this woman.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
It's like, it's like, couldn't be 30 seconds later.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
And this, and this, and this like, like seven foot tall, like Rachel Maddow giraffe woman

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
on her laptop is just going on.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
She's just, I think she's just in a zone.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
She's just explaining what, what spreadsheets work and which don't.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
And this guy just goes like, and he goes, he goes, excuse me, you might keep an egg down.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And she, and this woman's like, like fucking flips out.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Like, like, like, like, like, I mean, flips out, like she had no idea.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
She wasn't like, she wasn't like, blah, blah, blah.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I don't care about anybody.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It was more like, blah, blah, blah.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I haven't thought about anybody.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Like there's a difference.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
She didn't realize that she was being disruptive.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Well, you know, when you're on a phone, that's the thing.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And there's also like a heightened, like, I don't know.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Sometimes when you see someone on a phone, you like, I don't know.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
We get a hair trigger, like, like, like, if that person didn't have a phone in their hand

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
and they were just talking to their friend that loudly, when would you go over to them

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
and be all high-handed about it?

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Like we got a license when cell phones were invented to start getting real fucking dicky.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
And, you know, like, and it's justifiable because I'm not, you know, no heroes, no villains.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Just nobody beat me up. That's the point of my story.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Nobody beat me up.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So this guy goes like, he goes,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
you want me, you want me, you want me to give me my lawn, you want me to shake my king.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Moonlight shouldn't have won the La La Land.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I couldn't hear what he said, but he was just like, he was a little boy.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
And this, and this, like, and Rachel Maddowwoman like, went,

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
she fucking like, I was like watching peripherally

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
because I'm not going to turn my head because someone will beat me up.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
But I was just like, she was like, oh my god, oh my god,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.440
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Stacy, stop, wait,

11:15.440 --> 11:18.320
no, I'm sorry, oh, and the guy was like,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.960
it's just, it's just rude to see, what?

11:20.960 --> 11:24.000
I just was like, oh no, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.960
Like her voice was cracking.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.520
And she packed up her shit, put her laptop in her bag,

11:30.520 --> 11:32.840
put her bag in her wheelie, put her wheelie

11:32.840 --> 11:36.200
in the transformer mode, took her fucking overcoat,

11:36.200 --> 11:39.240
tucked into the London fog and phased out.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.280
Like she went to a different lounge

11:41.280 --> 11:44.280
at a different airport, may have hung herself, I don't know.

11:44.280 --> 11:49.280
Like she, she, she wasn't, she wasn't doing anything.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.600
Now, what 90 year old Michael Chiklis

11:53.600 --> 11:55.580
have walked up to a guy and done that.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.200
I think the answer is absolutely not.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.280
I think he felt empowered to walk up to a woman

12:00.280 --> 12:01.720
and say, you're being loud.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.920
That's male privilege bullshit.

12:04.920 --> 12:09.920
That is the tennis net, that's the tennis court net

12:10.880 --> 12:14.400
that like some balls hit it and go straight up,

12:14.400 --> 12:18.160
like that guy, the answer maybe he would have loved,

12:18.160 --> 12:20.160
he would have done it twice as fast.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.200
If he saw another old bald white guy doing that,

12:24.200 --> 12:25.320
he wouldn't have fucking done it.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.160
He wouldn't have walked up.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.560
Every airport lounge has like two old guys doing exactly that.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.960
Well, more importantly, that's how old guys talk

12:32.960 --> 12:33.800
without a phone.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.000
Right, yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.880
Like, oh, do you remember the depression?

12:36.880 --> 12:38.200
I can't hear anything.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.720
You know, they call it,

12:39.720 --> 12:40.760
Life is their phone.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.320
You know, they call it, they call it Harmontown.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.760
I, old white guy is yelling.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.600
I don't know.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.560
I've been in restaurants

12:49.560 --> 12:51.120
where I've been annoyed by people on the phone.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.840
I've been in restaurants where I've seen someone on the phone

12:54.840 --> 12:57.760
and then I've, and the person that's more annoyed

12:57.760 --> 13:00.360
by the person on the phone, I'm more annoyed by them.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.360
That they're, that they're taking more attention

13:02.360 --> 13:04.800
that they're, it's like, the person is technically

13:04.800 --> 13:07.600
on the phone, it's not really a license for you

13:07.600 --> 13:12.600
to vent your antipathy, your fucking inhumanity.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.760
I don't know, what my point is.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.760
No, I had no point.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.880
It's just a little story.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.280
I'm just a journalist.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.400
I had a good moment in an airport lounge.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.200
I went and I was flying to Vancouver

13:25.200 --> 13:28.040
and was up in the, or Canada lounge at LAX

13:28.040 --> 13:31.600
and I sat down like, because they're plugging my phone

13:31.600 --> 13:33.680
and there was a guy with his,

13:33.680 --> 13:36.520
I would assume girlfriend and talking

13:36.520 --> 13:38.920
at the top of his lungs about nothing.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.280
So I was like, I just, motherfucker,

13:40.280 --> 13:41.360
he's never gonna stop talking.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.200
So I unplugged and I went somewhere else

13:43.200 --> 13:44.720
and there was another guy, he was Australian,

13:44.720 --> 13:49.560
which is worse, because when a loud rich guy is Australian,

13:49.560 --> 13:52.320
you know, you know what I'm saying, me, me, me, me, me.

13:52.320 --> 13:56.440
It's, it's, it's, I was making a movie.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.400
I was making a movie, right?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.720
In fact, if you want to fight, you can also

13:58.720 --> 14:01.680
fight me at camp, I fucking, I fucking, mucky, tucky, tucky,

14:01.680 --> 14:02.920
mucky, mucky, tucky.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.560
And I was like, I'm gonna fucking blow my brains out.

14:05.560 --> 14:09.320
The views of the spot guys do not reflect, I, I, look,

14:09.320 --> 14:11.720
that is a huge continent that will be radiation safe

14:11.720 --> 14:13.560
in these other videos where it were.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.400
Dan, we were there.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.320
I love them.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.160
We were there.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.480
They have lots of lumber and gas and water.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.720
We know them, we love them.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.560
But they all know what the rich guy sounds like.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.000
And every country knows what the rich white guy sounds like.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.320
And there's a particular Australian rich white guy thing

14:28.320 --> 14:29.160
that happens.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.720
And while that was happening, this is fucking,

14:30.720 --> 14:31.560
now there's nowhere to go.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.400
Now I'm a prisoner because I found the only other place

14:35.400 --> 14:37.480
where I don't have to hear that guy.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.920
And this guy would not stop talking about himself.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.800
And right in the middle of my sadness,

14:42.800 --> 14:45.040
Sarah Silverman walks up and sits down right by his,

14:45.040 --> 14:47.080
hey Jeff, and she started telling me stories

14:47.080 --> 14:48.640
about her and Tom Cruise together.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.160
And, and that guy had to hear her Tom Cruise stories.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.240
And he went, he shut right the fuck up.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.200
I was like, yeah, motherfucker, we have better stories

14:56.200 --> 14:57.040
over here.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.440
Funny people.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.760
We're not yelling them because we have a,

15:01.760 --> 15:04.800
we'd go on TV and talk about them.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.920
We have an antenna.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.960
Sarah told better stories than this guy

15:09.960 --> 15:11.440
and it made me very happy.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.440
I, and then we killed him.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.440
Then we killed him.

15:14.440 --> 15:18.400
I, my therapist has taught me,

15:18.400 --> 15:20.040
so here's the thing I've learned

15:20.040 --> 15:25.040
that's like been very, very like powerful to me.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.120
In moments when people want an apology from me,

15:28.120 --> 15:32.280
which I used to interpret as them trying to leverage me.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.720
They're manipulating me.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.480
What's going to exchange here?

15:35.480 --> 15:38.160
If I, is this an apology window?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.520
I can still feel all of that.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.560
Like I could still look at somebody and go,

15:41.560 --> 15:42.440
oh, you're a vampire.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.280
You're a piece of shit.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.520
Like you're just trying to suck energy out of my body.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.040
But the, my therapist explained to me, she said,

15:49.040 --> 15:53.240
Dan, you are vigilant against abuse.

15:53.240 --> 15:58.240
You cannot handle somebody accusing you of abuse.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.800
You can handle people telling you that you hurt them.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.400
If you went like this and you felt like a soft splat

16:07.400 --> 16:09.280
as you were reaching for your backpack

16:09.280 --> 16:12.360
and you turned and looked and someone's nose was bleeding,

16:12.360 --> 16:15.840
you would not be offended by that person's claim

16:15.840 --> 16:17.160
that you had hurt them.

16:17.160 --> 16:22.160
You would stop at nothing to make it up to them.

16:23.400 --> 16:28.400
If that person started to imply, as you apologize,

16:29.480 --> 16:31.520
that you had done it on purpose

16:31.520 --> 16:34.400
or that you had done it because you weren't a good person,

16:34.400 --> 16:36.840
that you had made a choice earlier that day

16:36.840 --> 16:39.080
to ignore their needs and things like that,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.000
you'd start to get triggered.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.320
You'd start to get defensive.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.320
There's an irony that happens there every day

16:46.320 --> 16:48.400
in every bar, somebody hurt somebody

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
and then someone feels bad about it

16:50.400 --> 16:53.440
and then someone is like, oh, I feel bad about this

16:53.440 --> 16:54.680
and I feel so bad about it

16:54.680 --> 16:57.280
because it seems like you don't fucking give a shit about me.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.440
And then the other person is like,

16:58.440 --> 17:01.160
how dare you accuse me of being the kind of person

17:01.160 --> 17:02.760
that doesn't give a shit about anyone?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.000
You fucking lesbian!

17:05.960 --> 17:07.120
That took a weird turn.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.640
It always takes a weird turn.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.240
It's like, you know, that is the thing.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.280
And it's like, what I am just slowly starting to realize

17:16.280 --> 17:18.960
is that people saying that you hurt them,

17:18.960 --> 17:21.560
they're not saying you abused them.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.800
They're saying they got hurt

17:23.800 --> 17:25.920
and it doesn't matter what they say beyond that.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.840
They could put all the frosting they want on it

17:27.840 --> 17:29.920
because they're coming from wherever they're coming from.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.280
They can't make you an abuser.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.520
They can say that they're hurt

17:35.520 --> 17:38.960
and everyone can apologize for hurting people

17:38.960 --> 17:40.960
and everybody should be vigilant

17:40.960 --> 17:42.760
against admitting they're an abuser

17:42.760 --> 17:44.480
because if you're not a fucking abuser,

17:44.480 --> 17:45.840
that's an important thing.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.280
There are a couple of people among us

17:47.280 --> 17:48.920
who fucking love abusing people.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.880
Like, we should definitely separate from them.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.640
And so the way, it's like,

17:53.640 --> 17:55.640
I'm just noticing in these daily exchanges,

17:55.640 --> 17:56.560
I'm like, wait a minute,

17:56.560 --> 17:58.520
I'm trying to take a step back and going like,

17:58.520 --> 18:02.120
okay, wait, you're hurt, I hurt you, I hurt you.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.560
I did not abuse you.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.600
I'm not an abuser, I'm a herder.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.440
I hurt you.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.200
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

18:08.200 --> 18:16.040
Have you, well, we all have, I'm assuming you have too,

18:16.040 --> 18:17.720
I do it all the time.

18:17.720 --> 18:22.320
That abuse is like self-pity and things like that,

18:22.320 --> 18:25.400
like I mean to Cody, look at the text and go like,

18:25.400 --> 18:29.400
oh, I'm trying to do something here

18:29.400 --> 18:31.280
that has nothing to do with her well-being

18:31.280 --> 18:32.560
and everything to do with mine.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.200
I'm actually hurting her on purpose.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.800
Willfully, which is abuse.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.200
Yeah, and that's like, yeah,

18:40.200 --> 18:43.240
so we need to recognize when we're doing that

18:43.240 --> 18:46.720
so that we can apologize when we accidentally hurt people

18:46.720 --> 18:49.040
because that shouldn't be that big a deal.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.960
There's eight billion of us walking around,

18:50.960 --> 18:52.120
we're gonna step on each other's feet.

18:52.120 --> 18:55.640
I think for you though, I mean, not just for you,

18:55.640 --> 18:58.440
but for you especially, because you have the ability

18:58.440 --> 19:01.400
to seem abusive when you're not being abusive.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.240
Thank you.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.280
Weird thing to love.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.720
But like, you can, you are so good verbally,

19:09.720 --> 19:14.040
I've seen you lay people out with a quip, with a line.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.160
Because they're accusing you of abusing them.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.000
Well.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.880
And I need them to know that they're a piece of fucking shit.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.040
All right, but the problem is you're really good at that.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.280
And thank you, that's what I'm saying.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.040
You're the Robin Hood in terms of archery

19:28.040 --> 19:30.920
of hitting the bullseye when someone goes,

19:30.920 --> 19:34.440
hey, fuck off buddy, and you just shoot an arrow

19:34.440 --> 19:35.520
right into their heart.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.520
Yeah, if you imply that I hurt you on purpose,

19:37.520 --> 19:39.160
I will strangle you to death.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.120
I will wrap my hands around your neck until you're dead,

19:43.120 --> 19:44.920
and you can't say it ever again.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.360
Your gifts are your curses, you're a good writer,

19:48.360 --> 19:51.040
and so you're also really good at hurting people's feelings.

19:51.040 --> 19:51.880
Thank you.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.920
Stop saying thank you to them.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.840
Say, oops.

19:56.840 --> 20:00.520
No, but I'm being glib, but what I'm saying is yes,

20:00.520 --> 20:01.360
because what happens.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.160
But you love it, because you feel a reward.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.400
I'm learning about that in therapy.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.080
What happens is, being yourself following your own bliss,

20:08.080 --> 20:11.360
like you can sometimes be hurtful to people

20:11.360 --> 20:15.280
that is not the same crime as being abusive to someone.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.560
We all commit both of those crimes.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.720
Hurtfulness often comes with thoughtlessness, carelessness.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.960
You weren't thinking about me

20:23.960 --> 20:26.800
when you changed lanes on the freeway.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.640
Like it's different than you thinking you're entitled

20:30.640 --> 20:32.480
to just drive however you want.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.360
Like there's shades of abuse there,

20:34.360 --> 20:37.360
where you're just like fuck everyone on the freeway.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.960
Like everyone, when we get down in fights,

20:40.960 --> 20:43.000
when we start arguing with each other,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.640
those rare moments where we're actually able

20:44.640 --> 20:48.320
to connect with each other, and we find out truly

20:48.320 --> 20:50.280
what everyone is always saying the whole time,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.360
which is I didn't mean to do that.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.040
I didn't mean it that way.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.680
That's not how I meant it.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.680
Like that always turns everything around.

20:59.680 --> 21:04.160
Well the problem that you face is that when you react

21:04.160 --> 21:07.760
and you accidentally fling an elbow verbally

21:07.760 --> 21:12.520
and hurt somebody's feelings, is that you're so succinct

21:12.520 --> 21:15.720
and it's so well written, it sounds meditated.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.240
Like it doesn't sound...

21:17.240 --> 21:20.040
You're pumping me up so that everyone drives home

21:20.040 --> 21:22.400
to that going, I don't see what Jeff was seeing in him.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.840
I'm trying to...

21:24.840 --> 21:27.560
I've seen you, like if somebody hits you

21:27.560 --> 21:29.720
below the knee and your foot flies up,

21:29.720 --> 21:34.080
when somebody hits you and you respond,

21:34.080 --> 21:37.960
it sounds so good, it sounds abusive, but it wasn't.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.480
It was just you reacting.

21:39.480 --> 21:40.800
It was just a reflex.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.000
It's very good at hurting people.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.960
It's as simple as protecting yourself.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.200
There's airlocks all around us.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.880
You lock somebody, you put a wall between you and them,

21:48.880 --> 21:51.400
and then you hit a button, and then you just watch them die.

21:51.400 --> 21:56.400
You just stare at them while they turn purple,

21:56.400 --> 21:57.960
while they turn purple, and you go like,

21:57.960 --> 22:00.600
what, I thought you wanted to be near me.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.560
Go see Get Out in Theater, it's a fantastic film.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.440
But yeah, we're looking into all those things.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.960
The curse of being good at hurting people's feelings

22:13.960 --> 22:17.600
and it sounds like it's a neutron bomb.

22:17.600 --> 22:22.600
It's not a gift, we watch movies about mafia people

22:23.680 --> 22:25.520
and serial killers and things

22:25.520 --> 22:27.560
because we're fascinated with that behavior

22:27.560 --> 22:30.520
because it's not a gift, but it is rare

22:30.520 --> 22:34.040
because our species is predisposed to compassion.

22:34.040 --> 22:37.800
It's weird when somebody's circuits are so fucked up

22:37.800 --> 22:40.840
that they could actually hurt somebody so meticulously,

22:40.840 --> 22:43.240
so horribly, we focus on it

22:43.240 --> 22:44.960
because we don't want it to happen anymore.

22:44.960 --> 22:49.240
It's like ribbons and flowers spread at an intersection

22:49.240 --> 22:50.680
where a little girl got hit by a car.

22:50.680 --> 22:55.520
We go to the point of the pain and we watch it,

22:55.520 --> 22:58.480
we look at it and we go, here's where this happened.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.920
Should we bring out Doug Benson?

23:00.920 --> 23:01.760
Ha ha ha ha!

23:01.760 --> 23:02.600
Ha ha ha ha!

23:02.600 --> 23:03.440
Ha ha ha!

23:03.440 --> 23:05.000
Ha ha ha ha!

23:05.000 --> 23:06.360
We don't have Doug Benson doing it.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.360
If he's still backstage.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.200
Yeah, he might be gone.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.440
He was just backstage.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.360
Doug is here?

23:10.360 --> 23:11.200
Yeah, yeah.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.040
For real?

23:12.040 --> 23:12.880
Yeah.

23:12.880 --> 23:13.720
He's coming.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.560
He was just backstage.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.400
I didn't know Doug was here.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.200
I didn't either, but I saw him backstage and I was,

23:18.200 --> 23:19.360
I thought I'd...

23:19.360 --> 23:21.040
Doug Benson!

23:21.040 --> 23:22.040
Yeah, yeah.

23:22.040 --> 23:22.880
Doug Benson.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.200
Doug Benson!

23:24.200 --> 23:25.040
Doug Benson!

23:25.040 --> 23:26.200
Doug Benson!

23:26.200 --> 23:27.440
Doug Benson!

23:27.440 --> 23:28.640
Doug Benson!

23:28.640 --> 23:29.440
Doug Benson!

23:29.440 --> 23:30.560
Doug Benson!

23:30.560 --> 23:31.560
Doug Benson!

23:31.560 --> 23:33.960
Doug Benson!

23:33.960 --> 23:35.680
Grab a seat, stand up, do what you like.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.800
Wherever you're comfortable.

23:36.800 --> 23:37.640
Oh, I like this.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.520
I like having you on my shoulder like that.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
I'll give you a nice little rub over here.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.800
Yeah, Jeff is my angel on my shoulder.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.000
I'm your Michael Landon.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.240
Do some quick fact checking on everything I say.

23:48.240 --> 23:54.240
Lies. Lies. What happened? Who did you wrong in Austin already?

23:54.240 --> 23:58.240
Oh, that's a great question. There has to be somebody.

23:58.240 --> 24:02.240
Last night there was a guy, I was just walking down the street, minding my own business,

24:02.240 --> 24:07.240
and this guy in front of one of the bars goes, hey, Doug Benson!

24:07.240 --> 24:11.240
I'm like, hey man, how's it going? And he goes, I go, you got food in there?

24:11.240 --> 24:14.240
Because I was looking for somewhere to eat. You know, you got food in this bar?

24:14.240 --> 24:18.240
And he goes, no, but the bar next door has food. I'm going to pick up your meal

24:18.240 --> 24:21.240
and all of your drinks. I'm going to take care of it for you.

24:21.240 --> 24:25.240
And I was like, that's awesome. And then we go into this place next door,

24:25.240 --> 24:29.240
he introduces me to everybody, and then I've got a friend that's not going to leave

24:29.240 --> 24:33.240
while I eat the free food and drink the free drinks. And it's going to get weirder and weirder

24:33.240 --> 24:38.240
as the thing goes along to the point where you finally have to be like, hey man,

24:38.240 --> 24:44.240
all right, I could buy my own food. I didn't know that I was going to be part of the deal

24:44.240 --> 24:51.240
is that I've got like a new friend for life, you know, who keeps offering me molly.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.240
And I'm like, dude, I'm a weed guy.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.240
For real?

24:54.240 --> 24:58.240
Yeah, he kept saying he had a list of things that I could have instead of weed.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.240
And I was like, no, weed is good.

24:59.240 --> 25:04.240
A drug that makes everyone have the same personality and vow to stay in touch more often.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.240
It's weird that that was his drug of choice.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.240
So yeah, so I think ultimately he might have been a little disgruntled.

25:11.240 --> 25:17.240
Like he expected more for buying me some chips and queso and a couple of vodka sodas.

25:17.240 --> 25:24.240
I had an encounter at the hotel bar that it occurs to me I've had 25 times in the last five years at least,

25:24.240 --> 25:26.240
which I hadn't started noticing.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.240
And so I don't know what the actual count is, but it seems like this happens all the time.

25:30.240 --> 25:40.240
And I have talked about encounters like this on the podcast where a person that like a person is projecting there.

25:40.240 --> 25:49.240
Jeff is upstaging you with a dab behind the ears of vodka gag.

25:49.240 --> 25:55.240
It's so weird to get a big laugh with a physical gag on an audio podcast.

25:55.240 --> 25:59.240
Everyone's like, what is dad saying right now that's so hilarious?

25:59.240 --> 26:02.240
He's just setting up a premise at this point.

26:02.240 --> 26:12.240
It's like in that bear movie where the baby bear goes roar and then the puma is like yikes and then there's a big bear behind it.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.240
I didn't see the movie.

26:14.240 --> 26:21.240
Wait a second, which one of us is high right now?

26:21.240 --> 26:25.240
I'm on Molly, I just wanted to see you more often.

26:25.240 --> 26:29.240
I sat at the hotel bar and I was listening to this.

26:29.240 --> 26:34.240
There was a lady next to me and she was talking to the bartender and they were talking about,

26:34.240 --> 26:40.240
they were talking about South by Southwest and they were talking about, they both knew each other because she drinks there a lot.

26:40.240 --> 26:49.240
And she works in real estate and so she's a big mover and shaker and she's always at the hotel bar and he knows who she is and they know each other.

26:49.240 --> 26:58.240
But they start talking about South by Southwest and they're like, yeah, they start talking about how many famous people are in Austin this time of year.

26:58.240 --> 27:04.240
And it's like, oh, it's like Hollywood all of a sudden, this time of year, all of a sudden there's all these famous people.

27:04.240 --> 27:12.240
And her big example was what she called the guy from the league.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.240
And I was just taken by that.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.240
I was like, learn his name.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.240
There's like five of them to choose from.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.240
I know, it's like the guy from the league.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.240
I was just, I was just, I'm like, what, the guy from the league?

27:24.240 --> 27:27.240
And I swear she had, she brought her phone.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.240
She was like, yeah, no, I know.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.240
Have you ever seen the league?

27:29.240 --> 27:30.240
And he's like, no, I have not.

27:30.240 --> 27:35.240
And she's like, no, the guy, this guy from the league, I think she had a photo of him on his phone.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.240
Like, I don't know.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.240
It's like, wait, so it's a device you could use to Google him.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.240
Just say the guy from the league.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.240
I'm not saying like, like, like respect our craft.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.240
I'm just saying like, it's part of a conversation where you're, yes,

27:47.240 --> 27:51.240
he ending his assertion that it's like Hollywood around here.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.240
Yes, I agree.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
Famous people everywhere.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.240
For instance, the guy from the league.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.240
She didn't know who the fuck, learn his name.

27:59.240 --> 28:05.240
Could be anyone from a basic cable TV show that is finished, I believe.

28:05.240 --> 28:08.240
Then, so then, so then I, my burger comes.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.240
The final at bat happened.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.240
It was baseball, right?

28:12.240 --> 28:17.240
I think it was organized around a, was it Casey?

28:17.240 --> 28:18.240
I think they played Dungeons and Dragons.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.240
I don't know.

28:20.240 --> 28:27.240
Welcome to the four guys who don't know anything about sports podcast.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.240
But then she, she, that's every podcast.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
Every podcast.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.240
Yeah.

28:32.240 --> 28:40.240
But then, but then, so then my burger comes and I go, do you have any mustard?

28:40.240 --> 28:41.240
Here we go.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.240
Wait for it.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.240
Do you have any mustard?

28:44.240 --> 28:45.240
That's what I said.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.240
Do you have any mustard?

28:46.240 --> 28:50.240
Which, which then, in Texas is a very provocative question.

28:50.240 --> 28:57.240
And the guy, the kid, I'm going to call him a kid behind the bar said, we have mustard,

28:57.240 --> 28:58.240
but it's Dijon.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.240
It's not yellow.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.240
Now I took that as a kindred spirit.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.240
Like I was like, I was like fucking a, yeah.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.240
I was like, I said, it's all right.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.240
I'm used to it.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.240
He goes back to talking to her.

29:12.240 --> 29:17.240
And then I'm like, I think, well, he's going to get the brown mustard.

29:17.240 --> 29:25.240
So I just offer up, I go like, yeah, I mean, I, I was at a restaurant recently where they

29:25.240 --> 29:29.240
had yellow mustard on the table and it kind of blew my mind.

29:29.240 --> 29:37.240
And he and she both look at me with a combination of curiousness, curiosity, I think they call

29:37.240 --> 29:40.240
me a kid and disgust.

29:40.240 --> 29:46.240
Just like the vermouth and the dry martini is just disgust.

29:46.240 --> 29:50.240
Like disgust, if you pour a glass of it, then you're the bad guy.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.240
If you just fucking run it around the rim.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.240
Yeah, I'm disgusted with how curious I am.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.240
What the fuck are you talking about?

29:58.240 --> 29:59.240
What the fuck?

29:59.240 --> 30:01.240
What the fuck are you babbling about?

30:01.240 --> 30:06.240
Think about what you said in effect was, hi, I have a lot of opinions on mustard.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.240
Like, that's your relationship with them at this point.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.240
Well, I'm not shocked you'd take their side.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.240
I know, but I'm just, I'm forensically, I'm breaking this down.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.240
No, I'm aware of the fact.

30:17.240 --> 30:22.240
I looked, I looked over it and thought, I think what, what he might have heard was,

30:22.240 --> 30:27.240
it's okay that I have no yellow mustard or any mustard.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.240
I'm used to having no mustard.

30:29.240 --> 30:32.240
Like I'm Harry Potter before Hogwarts enrolled him.

30:32.240 --> 30:36.240
Like, I'm sorry, I don't deserve mustard, I'm okay with it.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.240
Like, okay, fine, he's allowed to interpret it that way.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.240
But it was weird.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.240
They both looked at me in a way that brought me back to the sixth grade, like,

30:43.240 --> 30:47.240
playground where it was just like, I'd like to contribute to the conversation.

30:47.240 --> 30:51.240
And they're just like, ew, gross, so gross.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.240
You're so gross, you're such a gross monster.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.240
Ew, what are you talking about?

30:56.240 --> 30:57.240
Talking about mustard much?

30:57.240 --> 30:59.240
You're gross.

30:59.240 --> 31:05.240
And then they just went back to talking about real estate, which is so fucking cool.

31:05.240 --> 31:09.240
Because it's Texas, there's lots of real estate.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.240
And he never brought you your mustard?

31:11.240 --> 31:14.240
He never brought fucking mustard.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.240
And over time, my burger tasted better with the inhumanity on it.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.240
I was like, I'm not gonna fucking play this game.

31:21.240 --> 31:26.240
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna be uppity and say, like, I asked for mustard earlier.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.240
I'm just like, mm, good burger.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
Called his fucking bluff.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.240
Here's what happened.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.240
She settles up.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.240
She walks away.

31:34.240 --> 31:38.240
She's got real estate to sell.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.240
For you video subscribers.

31:40.240 --> 31:44.240
That was me dabbing more vodka behind my ears.

31:44.240 --> 31:48.240
This guy goes, he goes, so what are you doing in town?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.240
What's your schedule like?

31:51.240 --> 31:54.240
I didn't start a conversation with this fucking guy.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.240
Don't tell what room number.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.240
I said, I'm going to Esther's Follies.

31:59.240 --> 32:04.240
He's like, yeah, for what?

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
Just to see the show.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.240
It's really good.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.240
Comedy show.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
The Esther's Follies show.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.240
They're still doing that over there.

32:12.240 --> 32:16.240
This guy's on a road so high it's untenable.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.240
It's ridiculous.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.240
And I just don't want to get yelled at.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.240
I just don't want to get beaten up.

32:23.240 --> 32:26.240
I just want to settle up.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.240
I'd like to settle up.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.240
Let me settle up.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.240
So what are you doing over there?

32:30.240 --> 32:32.240
I'm doing a couple of shows.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.240
I'm doing a couple of shows.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.240
Yeah, what shows?

32:34.240 --> 32:36.240
He won't stop.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.240
Because you can't crucify with one nail.

32:38.240 --> 32:41.240
The person would fall off.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.240
You'd be guilty of a minor felony.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.240
You'd have wounded a hand.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.240
Crucifixion requires.

32:47.240 --> 32:50.240
That's our episode title for certain.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.240
You need the feet.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.240
You need the hands.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
This is some studied it.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.240
So I was like, well, what show?

32:55.240 --> 32:58.240
And I'm like, well, I'm doing a podcast.

32:58.240 --> 33:04.240
And he was like, aha, I got it.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
Great.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.240
Charge it to my room.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.240
Sign it.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.240
I was like, what's the other show?

33:08.240 --> 33:09.240
Jesus fucking Christ.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.240
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:11.240 --> 33:12.240
Another podcast.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.240
He shut him down.

33:14.240 --> 33:21.240
I said, it's promoting a show on CISO?

33:21.240 --> 33:23.240
CISO.

33:23.240 --> 33:28.240
Twist his face like a fucking pigs cock.

33:28.240 --> 33:32.240
Like Beetlejuice special effect.

33:32.240 --> 33:36.240
I can't let you know enough that I have no idea where you work.

33:36.240 --> 33:40.240
I don't pretend to think anyone knows what the fuck CISO is.

33:40.240 --> 33:43.240
Thank you for coming on the show, by the way.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.240
You're welcome.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.240
And then he finally goes, it goes like, well, what's that show?

33:49.240 --> 33:51.240
And then I said, it's promoting a show.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.240
It's I playing Dungeons and Dragons.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.240
And he's like, his eyes, muscles.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.240
I'm going to kill this fucking guy.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.240
He's going to get no Trump care from his fucking muscles

34:01.240 --> 34:05.240
detaching from the eyes rolling back into his head.

34:05.240 --> 34:10.240
And he's polishing a glass like there's anyone else coming in.

34:10.240 --> 34:13.240
Like the robot and passengers.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.240
What?

34:14.240 --> 34:15.240
Can we talk about that movie?

34:15.240 --> 34:16.240
What the fuck?

34:16.240 --> 34:17.240
I just saw that movie.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.240
He turned into Bert Kresicher right there.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.240
What the fuck?

34:20.240 --> 34:21.240
What the fuck?

34:21.240 --> 34:22.240
What the fuck?

34:22.240 --> 34:23.240
What?

34:23.240 --> 34:24.240
That movie.

34:24.240 --> 34:26.240
He waits all the time and then he wakes up.

34:26.240 --> 34:27.240
I was making the joke.

34:27.240 --> 34:30.240
The rest of the podcast was in Falsetto.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.240
You realize I was in Falsetto.

34:33.240 --> 34:38.240
I love Southwest because I like waiting in lines.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.240
Oh, sir.

34:39.240 --> 34:44.240
The only way to go to your double broadcast site.

34:44.240 --> 34:47.240
You realize the third act of that movie.

34:47.240 --> 34:49.240
I don't know if anyone, I know everyone's like.

34:49.240 --> 34:52.240
Who's worried about having passengers spoiled?

34:52.240 --> 34:53.240
Nobody.

34:53.240 --> 34:55.240
Nobody gives a shit.

34:55.240 --> 34:58.240
You've probably seen the blogs about why it's, it's a fucked up thing.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.240
Yeah.

34:59.240 --> 35:02.240
The only reason to watch it is if you like those two actors and you, you know, want to,

35:02.240 --> 35:05.240
like it'd be sexy for you to see them in space.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.240
And you feel like everything is keeping.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.240
You know, like I think it's only jerk off material.

35:09.240 --> 35:14.240
It's like, it's like if sleepless in Seattle was about Tom Hanks buying night vision goggles

35:14.240 --> 35:20.240
and, you know, just living in Meg Ryan's apartment for a while.

35:20.240 --> 35:24.240
Just watching her from a cupboard.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.240
And then finally deciding.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.240
Only when she sleeps.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.240
He watches her when she's sleeping.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.240
And if instead of a kid.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.240
And he Googles her.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.240
He Googles her while she's sleeping.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.240
Oh, because that's what you know.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.240
It's true love.

35:33.240 --> 35:36.240
I'm like, this is, this is beyond anything.

35:36.240 --> 35:41.240
He threw a wine bottle, slipped on it and the first pair of tits he saw, he was like,

35:41.240 --> 35:44.240
I'm Googling her and low and behold, he's in love with her.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.240
Yeah.

35:45.240 --> 35:48.240
If he's going to play that creepy play, he should look, he should walk around and look

35:48.240 --> 35:50.240
at every sleeping passenger.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.240
There should have found the sexiest one to wake up.

35:53.240 --> 35:58.240
There needed to be at least one Foxy black lady on the ship that he was like looking

35:58.240 --> 36:01.240
at and going like, I don't like that fart joke.

36:01.240 --> 36:05.240
Like, like just, just show me that you're not racist.

36:05.240 --> 36:09.240
But the, but we all, you all wrote your blogs about that, but did you notice that in the

36:09.240 --> 36:13.240
third act of that movie, I was making the joke because my girlfriend and I are laughing

36:13.240 --> 36:14.240
at it while watching it.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.240
We're like, oh my God, they really think this elephant isn't in the room.

36:17.240 --> 36:21.240
Like, like as it turns into a romance and they're playing dance dance revolution together,

36:21.240 --> 36:24.240
like they really, they really think we forgot about this thing.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.240
Okay, fine.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.240
Misstep, swing and a mess, whatever.

36:27.240 --> 36:33.240
But like, I was making the joke as we go to the third act, like, like, like, like as

36:33.240 --> 36:40.240
Jennifer Lawrence would have to say, like, to Chris Pratt, like, my God, the ship, it

36:40.240 --> 36:42.240
doesn't know what it wants.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.240
It needs to be raped, Chris.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.240
You need to rape the ship to save us.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.240
And I was making that joke.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.240
It was true.

36:51.240 --> 36:54.240
The act of the fucking ship needed, didn't know.

36:54.240 --> 37:01.240
It had like a tube that wouldn't let things out or in and he had to go into it and like,

37:01.240 --> 37:06.240
do you guys not, it's behind, it's like the third act of that movie.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.240
I thought we were talking about trolls.

37:09.240 --> 37:14.240
The third act of that movie is a concretization of an argument for no meaning.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.240
They say rape the ship.

37:17.240 --> 37:21.240
The ship, the ship is all blocked up and it needs to just let it go.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.240
I've never heard of this movie.

37:23.240 --> 37:28.240
He needs to penetrate a tube that cannot, that does not want to be penetrated.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.240
You're not supposed to go in there.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.240
He's not supposed to be in there.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.240
He goes in there.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.240
He goes in there.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.240
The movie is clearly anti-ship rape.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.240
Well, finally.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.240
Yeah.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.240
Anyways.

37:38.240 --> 37:40.240
But then Andy Garcia shows up.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
Oh my God.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.240
What is that about?

37:42.240 --> 37:43.240
He gets top billing.

37:43.240 --> 37:46.240
It has to be a movie about being nowhere.

37:46.240 --> 37:51.240
He's like top billing because he looks at a tree.

37:51.240 --> 37:55.240
Again, if you haven't seen Passengers, first of all, don't.

37:55.240 --> 38:00.240
And secondly, no, I thought there were parts of it that were all right.

38:00.240 --> 38:04.240
It was Oscar nominated for visual production design.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.240
Doug, you love movies.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.240
I do.

38:06.240 --> 38:10.240
As your podcast proudly proclaims.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.240
Have you seen Get Out?

38:12.240 --> 38:13.240
I have not seen Get Out.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.240
Go see it in the theater.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.240
It's fucking good fun.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.240
What if there's nobody else in the theater?

38:19.240 --> 38:22.240
Because I like to go to empty matinees.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.240
Is that ruining?

38:23.240 --> 38:24.240
Is it more fun with the crowd?

38:24.240 --> 38:28.240
I went to a matinee at the Los Feliz 3 in LA, which is usually empty.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.240
There was, you know, there was 20, maybe 12 people in there.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.240
12 white people?

38:33.240 --> 38:34.240
There was no black people.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.240
There were no black people.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.240
It was Asian and Latino.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.240
Oh, okay.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.240
Yeah.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.240
So, but sadly, I kind of want to go.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.240
I don't know if this is really reductive in being a piece of shit.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.240
I want to go to a black neighborhood and watch that movie in the theater.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.240
Oh my God.

38:49.240 --> 38:53.240
It would probably be a phenomenal.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.240
Oh shit.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.240
Oh shit.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.240
It would be a phenomenal experience.

38:57.240 --> 38:58.240
Jesus Christ.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.240
There's a black cowboy.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.240
You've activated a black cowboy.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.240
Okay.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.240
Hold up.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
Hold up.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.240
Oh my God.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.240
Westworld Season 2.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.240
No, no, no.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.240
Get the fuck out of here.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.240
What's your name, first of all?

39:11.240 --> 39:12.240
Anthony Carter.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.240
Anthony Carter.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.240
Grab a mic, Anthony.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.240
Hey, Anthony.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.240
Get in there.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.240
It's that easy to be on the show.

39:17.240 --> 39:18.240
Join us.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.240
South by Southwest 2017.

39:21.240 --> 39:25.240
Wow, this is like we're on a coach flight home.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.240
Yeah.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.240
Now, Anthony, without...

39:28.240 --> 39:29.240
Whoa.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.240
Jesus.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.240
God damn it, man.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.240
I'm kidding.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.240
I'm kidding.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.240
Stophead spreading.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.240
I'm kidding.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.240
I'm kidding.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.240
For the listeners that are not watching, we have a very good-looking black man with

39:39.240 --> 39:42.240
a fantastic cowboy head on right now.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.240
Yes, indeed.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.240
Anthony.

39:44.240 --> 39:49.240
Now, without spoiling the movie for Dan or anybody else, because it's a movie that

39:49.240 --> 39:51.240
I went in, I didn't know who was in it.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.240
I didn't know who directed it.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.240
I didn't know what the genre was.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.240
I didn't know a fucking thing about it.

39:55.240 --> 40:00.240
You just knew that it was a movie that was asking you to leave.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.240
I went with my girlfriend and we had a fucking jam.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.240
It was good fun.

40:05.240 --> 40:08.240
When I left, I said to my girlfriend, who, guess what?

40:08.240 --> 40:10.240
Spoiler alert, she's white.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.240
Yeah.

40:11.240 --> 40:15.240
Oh, well, that seems to be...

40:15.240 --> 40:17.240
Well, my girlfriend's white, too.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.240
She's here somewhere.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.240
She might have left me.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.240
But here's the thing.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.240
Hi, Kristen.

40:22.240 --> 40:26.240
When I left, I want to be...

40:26.240 --> 40:31.240
I don't want to be the guy that asks all of my black friends what they think about that

40:31.240 --> 40:36.240
movie, because then I'm one of the white people in that movie that's asked, do you know Tiger

40:36.240 --> 40:38.240
Woods?

40:38.240 --> 40:42.240
But the thing is, I do want to know, did you watch it in a theater?

40:42.240 --> 40:44.240
No, I have not seen it either.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.240
What are you, motherfucker?

40:46.240 --> 40:48.240
Get out the fucking stage.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.240
I brought you up for one reason, Anthony Carter.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.240
I wouldn't ask it.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.240
Thank you for having me.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.240
I was going to go see that movie.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.240
Hey, no, no.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.240
I know I've seen the previews.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.240
No, get the fuck out of the stage.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.240
We all saw the previews.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.240
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.240
Yeah.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.240
Mic drop.

41:08.240 --> 41:12.240
It was a tasteful mic drop.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.240
You usually don't see a mic drop with...

41:14.240 --> 41:17.240
His friend does a Rick and Morty shirt on it.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.240
There you go, pick up the...

41:20.240 --> 41:22.240
Better hat, better shirt.

41:22.240 --> 41:26.240
All right, I want all the white people to listen for me for one second, please.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.240
What's your name, first off?

41:27.240 --> 41:28.240
My name is Calvin.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.240
Calvin, hold up.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.240
I'm just writing it down.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.240
Sit down.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
How long does this wait?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.240
How long do I have to hold on for?

41:35.240 --> 41:36.240
What do you mean?

41:36.240 --> 41:37.240
What?

41:37.240 --> 41:38.240
Don't want to hold on.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.240
I just wanted to hear your name.

41:40.240 --> 41:45.240
White people, go and see, get out, and get educated.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.240
Oh, shit.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.240
All right.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.240
Oh, shit.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.240
The mic's being dropped.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.240
No, no, no, no.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.240
Calvin, come on.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.240
Sam, I...

41:52.240 --> 41:53.240
He's got a question.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.240
Now, first off.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.240
What's the premature mic drop situation?

41:56.240 --> 41:57.240
Give us...

41:57.240 --> 41:59.240
I really hate when that happens.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.240
Right?

42:00.240 --> 42:03.240
You don't want that to happen in front of a nice lady.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.240
You wait, and then everything...

42:05.240 --> 42:10.240
You dropped the mic kind of from pretty high tonight?

42:10.240 --> 42:13.240
I thought you were different.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.240
Everyone thinks I'm different.

42:15.240 --> 42:18.240
So, Calvin, without spoilers, you dug the movie, right?

42:18.240 --> 42:19.240
Oh, I loved it, yeah.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.240
That's great.

42:20.240 --> 42:23.240
And you say white people should go see that movie?

42:23.240 --> 42:25.240
Every white person should go see that movie.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.240
Yes.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.240
It's not a brave stance, though, right?

42:28.240 --> 42:29.240
I mean, we're not...

42:29.240 --> 42:30.240
It's not controversial.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.240
Oh, it's controversial in the best way possible.

42:32.240 --> 42:37.240
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that every Somalian needs to see this movie.

42:37.240 --> 42:41.240
Not just every Somalian, but every Somalian pirate also.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.240
Sure.

42:42.240 --> 42:47.240
Do you think it has the power to change minds of white racist people?

42:47.240 --> 42:48.240
I think it makes...

42:48.240 --> 42:51.240
I guess it's a power to make them feel more insecure than they already do about...

42:51.240 --> 42:52.240
Oh, nice.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.240
I like that.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.240
And they should feel that.

42:54.240 --> 42:56.240
We need that right now.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.240
I walked out of the theater, and it's a small theater.

42:58.240 --> 43:01.240
It was maybe only, again, like 15 people tops in there.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.240
I walked out.

43:02.240 --> 43:05.240
I was like, that movie was fucked up!

43:05.240 --> 43:08.240
And white people turned back and looked at me like...

43:08.240 --> 43:11.240
They were bummed out.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.240
They thought I hated the movies.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.240
No, that movie's fucking crazy!

43:15.240 --> 43:16.240
Yeah.

43:16.240 --> 43:18.240
I had a friend that saw it in Vermont, of all places.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.240
Oh, dear heavens.

43:19.240 --> 43:22.240
I had a black friend that saw it in Vermont, and he laughed...

43:22.240 --> 43:26.240
Your story's getting harder to believe with every detail.

43:26.240 --> 43:29.240
There actually aren't black people living in Vermont.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.240
They're named Reggie and Ken.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.240
Reggie, Ken, and Dana.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.240
He saw it in Vermont, and he laughed the entire time,

43:38.240 --> 43:40.240
but all the white people felt pretty uncomfortable.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.240
Which made it better for him.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.240
Oh, was he doing like Robert DeNiro and Kate Fear laughter at it?

43:50.240 --> 43:51.240
No, that movie...

43:51.240 --> 43:52.240
Because it's funny as shit.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.240
It's really funny.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.240
It's funny.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.240
It's got a lot of social commentary, but, you know...

43:55.240 --> 43:57.240
That would be the thing that kept me from saying it,

43:57.240 --> 43:59.240
is other people being funny.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.240
That's what keeps me from watching Atlanta, too.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.240
Yeah, it just makes you mad at it, right?

44:03.240 --> 44:04.240
You just mad the whole time.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.240
It's not race, it's like...

44:06.240 --> 44:08.240
Yeah, I mean, believe me.

44:08.240 --> 44:11.240
I watched Blade Among the People.

44:13.240 --> 44:16.240
I felt their hatred of vampires.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.240
I joined in it, and I loved it.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.240
But there's something really interesting about this.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.240
You don't have to drag you down into the fucking murk, you're a stranger.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.240
No, I was okay, I'm there, it's cool.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.240
But there's an interesting thing about that,

44:25.240 --> 44:28.240
because I was telling that story that happens in LAX's lounge, right?

44:28.240 --> 44:31.240
So this woman comes up to me, and she gives me these choices.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.240
This is really happening.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.240
Cheers.

44:49.240 --> 44:51.240
Sorry about Season 3, we're drawing it.

44:51.240 --> 44:55.240
No, it's...

44:58.240 --> 45:00.240
I mean, the Rick Roll thing was pretty nice,

45:00.240 --> 45:02.240
in the most torturous way possible.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.240
Yeah, it was good.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.240
See, when that woman came up to me at LAX,

45:06.240 --> 45:09.240
she was referring to a woman over there,

45:09.240 --> 45:12.240
and there's a lot of things on the table,

45:12.240 --> 45:16.240
and the weird energy that squirted out of me...

45:18.240 --> 45:20.240
That's a nice way to put it.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.240
Was, you know, like Plato studied steam engines,

45:23.240 --> 45:26.240
the platonic engine where you just heat up a bunch of water,

45:26.240 --> 45:28.240
and you only give it so much egress,

45:28.240 --> 45:31.240
that if you put it in different positions,

45:31.240 --> 45:34.240
you'll make a thing spin around, it's a platonic engine, right?

45:34.240 --> 45:38.240
It's like steam escaping, it'll find the nearest escape,

45:38.240 --> 45:41.240
it'll find the weakest membrane to squeak through.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.240
Now, isn't that membrane's fault?

45:43.240 --> 45:46.240
So for instance, why have we been a misogynistic culture

45:46.240 --> 45:49.240
longer than we've been a racist culture?

45:49.240 --> 45:52.240
Like, don't get aggravated by my assertion there.

45:54.240 --> 45:58.240
Why are we quicker to club women than we are to...

45:58.240 --> 46:01.240
Like, why are we so able to, like,

46:01.240 --> 46:05.240
overcome pigment before we are able to...

46:05.240 --> 46:08.240
Is this question for anybody on the panel?

46:08.240 --> 46:12.240
I, in a sense, when that woman said to me at the airport,

46:12.240 --> 46:15.240
she said, how come you don't tell that woman to shut the fuck up?

46:15.240 --> 46:19.240
I said, well, because I'm my mother-in-law.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.240
You know, like, it was fake.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.240
It was like where the...

46:23.240 --> 46:26.240
It was an essentially misogynistic, like, valve

46:26.240 --> 46:28.240
that that energy went through.

46:28.240 --> 46:31.240
I'm like, with women, like, if you think women talking loud

46:31.240 --> 46:34.240
is gonna get my goat, you should deal with what I deal with

46:34.240 --> 46:35.240
on Christmas Eve.

46:35.240 --> 46:37.240
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.240
I was just trying to escape a situation.

46:39.240 --> 46:44.240
The steam was so high, that was the weakest membrane.

46:44.240 --> 46:46.240
It wouldn't have been...

46:46.240 --> 46:48.240
If it was the 1950s, would I have said to that woman,

46:48.240 --> 46:52.240
like, bite your tongue, lady.

46:52.240 --> 46:53.240
You know your place.

46:53.240 --> 46:54.240
Give me a cornflakes.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.240
Oh, no.

46:56.240 --> 47:00.240
That got much worse than the second part.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.240
That's my question. Answer it.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.240
I think it goes...

47:04.240 --> 47:06.240
Well, fuck.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.240
Ten seconds.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.240
Nine, eight.

47:09.240 --> 47:13.240
I think it comes down to, I mean, just talking about it.

47:13.240 --> 47:16.240
And I think a lot of people that feel like misogyny is not a problem,

47:16.240 --> 47:18.240
they haven't dealt with it or thought about it

47:18.240 --> 47:21.240
or had a woman in their life that actually experienced that.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.240
Who doesn't have a woman in their life?

47:23.240 --> 47:25.240
Like, that's the thing I think...

47:25.240 --> 47:28.240
To answer your question, Dan, I think misogyny...

47:28.240 --> 47:31.240
Misogyny is bigger than racism.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.240
I don't know by what percentage, but I think it's happening

47:33.240 --> 47:37.240
because women are 50%...

47:37.240 --> 47:41.240
Like, women are a bigger threat because there's more of them.

47:41.240 --> 47:45.240
And men that are threatened by women are going...

47:45.240 --> 47:46.240
You know what I mean?

47:46.240 --> 47:48.240
They're going to be threatened because it's half of the people

47:48.240 --> 47:49.240
and it's also their mother.

47:49.240 --> 47:52.240
It's also their mama is a fucking woman, you know?

47:52.240 --> 47:54.240
Yes, because your memories of becoming a man

47:54.240 --> 47:56.240
involve becoming abusive to your mother.

47:56.240 --> 47:59.240
Like, in a lie...

47:59.240 --> 48:01.240
Shut up, mom. I don't want to do this.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.240
Right. And you didn't...

48:02.240 --> 48:04.240
As a white kid, you weren't growing up going,

48:04.240 --> 48:05.240
shut up, black guy.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.240
Like...

48:07.240 --> 48:10.240
So it's all directed at women and not race.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.240
I like that we've solved that problem.

48:12.240 --> 48:16.240
Racism's over, misogyny needs some work on it.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.240
We need to bring race back into puberty.

48:18.240 --> 48:21.240
I'm so glad there's no women up here to defend themselves right now.

48:21.240 --> 48:24.240
Your mom's in a hit you, didn't they?

48:24.240 --> 48:27.240
We'll tell women how to deal with this.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.240
Like, for all the women in the audience,

48:29.240 --> 48:30.240
watching a bunch of white dudes...

48:30.240 --> 48:31.240
Oh, not white dudes.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.240
White dudes minus one.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.240
He's close enough.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.240
Sit the fuck down.

48:35.240 --> 48:37.240
Look at that hat. He's close enough to white.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.240
And watching a bunch of men talk about women...

48:40.240 --> 48:41.240
Had a t-shirt?

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
Yeah, it's a guy...

48:42.240 --> 48:45.240
His t-shirt is on upside down.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.240
Or he's got a shirt on...

48:47.240 --> 48:49.240
I don't think you can put a t-shirt on upside down.

48:49.240 --> 48:52.240
I'm gonna sit down.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.240
I mean, you can. It'd be hard.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.240
Yeah, it fits weird.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.240
Yeah.

48:58.240 --> 48:59.240
It's more of a tube top.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
A little tight.

49:00.240 --> 49:02.240
Jeff, you got derailed midstream.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.240
You were about to incite women to hate the show.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.240
Please continue.

49:06.240 --> 49:09.240
Women already hate the show.

49:09.240 --> 49:12.240
Watching three men stumble into the realization

49:12.240 --> 49:15.240
that this is the easiest thing in the world

49:15.240 --> 49:16.240
that it always has been,

49:16.240 --> 49:19.240
is probably just as good for whatever money

49:19.240 --> 49:22.240
they paid for their badges as anything.

49:22.240 --> 49:25.240
I mean, it's...

49:25.240 --> 49:28.240
Because men can't imagine what it's like to be a woman.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.240
We can't. We can think we can. We fucking can't.

49:30.240 --> 49:34.240
I'm going to. Watch.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.240
Stand back.

49:36.240 --> 49:40.240
Spencer, dungeon master, me waking up of being a woman.

49:40.240 --> 49:43.240
Jeff, play appropriate music.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.240
How much time do we have left?

49:45.240 --> 49:47.240
We got loads of time.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.240
Okay.

49:49.240 --> 49:54.240
You wake up in a bedroom.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.240
It's empty.

49:56.240 --> 50:04.240
Because you make less money than men.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.240
I get out of bed.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.240
All right.

50:07.240 --> 50:12.240
You're still in the bedroom.

50:12.240 --> 50:16.240
I put on whatever outfit will walk the line

50:16.240 --> 50:18.240
between me being branded a slut

50:18.240 --> 50:22.240
and me being dismissed as a human being.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.240
You managed to thread the needle once more

50:24.240 --> 50:26.240
like millions of women across the earth

50:26.240 --> 50:29.240
do every morning of their lives.

50:29.240 --> 50:33.240
Slutty outfit.

50:33.240 --> 50:36.240
Can I ask what I'm wearing?

50:36.240 --> 50:37.240
No.

50:37.240 --> 50:38.240
Okay.

50:38.240 --> 50:41.240
That's probably a good idea.

50:41.240 --> 50:44.240
I go down to get into an Uber.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.240
All right.

50:45.240 --> 50:48.240
Where I'm certain that someone will simply drive me to work.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.240
It's doing the thing where it's like a block away

50:50.240 --> 50:53.240
but it's just spinning around for the last five minutes.

50:53.240 --> 50:56.240
It shows up and the guy makes no indication

50:56.240 --> 51:00.240
that that wasn't supposed to be part of his job.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.240
I get in.

51:02.240 --> 51:03.240
Oh.

51:03.240 --> 51:06.240
He touches you.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.240
I file a complaint with Uber.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.240
It doesn't matter.

51:09.240 --> 51:16.240
He gets promoted to head of Uber.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.240
You get to your job or whatever.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.240
I get out of the Uber and I run for president.

51:20.240 --> 51:22.240
I'm tired of this.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.240
I'm fucking ending it.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.240
I've played nice.

51:24.240 --> 51:25.240
I'm running for president.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.240
You lose.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.240
Yeah.

51:27.240 --> 51:30.240
More people hated me than liked me.

51:30.240 --> 51:34.240
It turns out you did what you had to do.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.240
Are you saying I lost the popular vote?

51:36.240 --> 51:37.240
No.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.240
That's what's crazy.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.240
Oh.

51:39.240 --> 51:44.240
And it's argued, you know, you might have won even harder

51:44.240 --> 51:46.240
if not for, you know, the striking.

51:46.240 --> 51:47.240
Okay.

51:47.240 --> 51:48.240
That's too political.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.240
Sorry.

51:49.240 --> 51:53.240
I don't know why it's that.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.240
Well, I walk into the woods and I wait for someone to need me.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.240
No one, yeah.

51:57.240 --> 52:00.240
No one needs you, but everyone wants something from you.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.240
And it's your problem.

52:02.240 --> 52:08.240
All the trees are mad.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.240
I go up to one of the trees.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.240
Okay.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.240
It ignores you.

52:14.240 --> 52:17.240
I thought I just heard you grumbling things about me being...

52:17.240 --> 52:19.240
What a bitch.

52:19.240 --> 52:23.240
You know, we've been growing here for hundreds of years.

52:23.240 --> 52:28.240
No one's coming through being talked about by us before until you.

52:28.240 --> 52:30.240
So you're the problem.

52:30.240 --> 52:32.240
All right.

52:32.240 --> 52:34.240
Go further into the woods.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
All right.

52:35.240 --> 52:38.240
You do that.

52:38.240 --> 52:46.240
You find, you find, you know, you're feeling, you're feeling cramping up.

52:46.240 --> 52:49.240
Cramping.

52:49.240 --> 52:51.240
Oh, no.

52:51.240 --> 52:54.240
I pay attention to that feeling.

52:54.240 --> 53:00.240
It's worse than what men have to deal with on their daily lives.

53:00.240 --> 53:05.240
But you just, you don't even, you know, you don't even mention it unless it's kind of crippling you and making you in bed.

53:05.240 --> 53:08.240
The fact that you're walking around means it's not even worth mentioning,

53:08.240 --> 53:12.240
even though it's terrible crippling agony.

53:12.240 --> 53:22.240
I go home and I put on some tea and I read a book.

53:22.240 --> 53:31.240
The book has all sorts of opinions on stuff that you should do or represent that don't even have anything to do with what you think you should do in life.

53:31.240 --> 53:33.240
I turn on the television.

53:33.240 --> 53:36.240
I feel like we peaked. Have we peaked?

53:36.240 --> 53:46.240
Sorry. On the television, it's more of the same. The media is rewarding men for doing things that hurt you and punishing you for doing the things that demand your equal rights.

53:46.240 --> 53:53.240
You see, this is what I mean. It's just, it's just the sad reality of life.

53:53.240 --> 54:00.240
I try, I try to do comedy about the situation because I think it'll be so funny that it'll make people, yeah.

54:00.240 --> 54:03.240
Yeah. Why aren't women funny? This is terrible.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.240
Who said that?

54:05.240 --> 54:07.240
Nobody on earth.

54:07.240 --> 54:11.240
I try to prove them wrong by being really dirty and later on.

54:11.240 --> 54:16.240
You do amazing stuff and a couple alt comedians and people in the scene are like, yeah, she's getting really big.

54:16.240 --> 54:20.240
But you know, you've done everything that everyone, I don't know.

54:20.240 --> 54:26.240
I just say a really funny joke. I'd say a really funny joke that's like kind of fucking crazy because it's inappropriate.

54:26.240 --> 54:30.240
Oh, it goes over well. You get what's considered a polite chuckle.

54:30.240 --> 54:39.240
And after the show, seven guys try and hit on you saying, you know, you're actually pretty funny.

54:39.240 --> 54:41.240
Now can I be president?

54:41.240 --> 54:43.240
No.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.240
All right.

54:44.240 --> 54:51.240
Spencer Crittenden, world's best feminist.

54:51.240 --> 54:54.240
Male feminist. World's best male feminist.

54:54.240 --> 54:59.240
But like, to really answer your question, I really think you're talking about abuse.

54:59.240 --> 55:02.240
Later that same night.

55:02.240 --> 55:05.240
You're talking about the mental abuse earlier. I think men have that problem.

55:05.240 --> 55:13.240
They don't want to accept the fact that, you know, they've, you know, maybe abused women, you know, emotionally, even if it's intentionally or not, they don't want to acknowledge it.

55:13.240 --> 55:14.240
I think that's the biggest problem.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.240
Oh, no, that's the most offensive thing.

55:16.240 --> 55:20.240
Racially, I always repeat that joke that our late friend Mario from the drawing room said.

55:20.240 --> 55:26.240
It's like, you can call a white guy a honky, you can call him a cracker, but if you call him a racist, he gets really bent out of shape.

55:26.240 --> 55:32.240
You can call a man anything you want, but if you say that he's abusing women, they'll fucking choke you.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.240
What?

55:33.240 --> 55:46.240
But we do, I think that, you know, we should probably, it's all you have to do is just like put a little radar tag on your lapel and just be like, oh, how am I interacting with anybody, with people?

55:46.240 --> 55:48.240
That's what my therapist is always saying.

55:48.240 --> 55:52.240
She's like, you don't have to quit drinking. She said that.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.240
She said, just notice when you take a drink.

55:54.240 --> 55:56.240
That's it. That'll be the beginning of it.

55:56.240 --> 55:58.240
Yeah, look in the cup, see what's up.

55:58.240 --> 56:02.240
Oh, vodka again.

56:02.240 --> 56:05.240
Or vodka.

56:05.240 --> 56:14.240
But yeah, I think of what, but that's why, that's why people that we often complain about, people that are outspoken and it was like, we go like, oh, they get tweeted out.

56:14.240 --> 56:23.240
So we had our friends from Reductress on the podcast and they talked about the women that stand out that they might be just comedically saying, hey, look at this phenomenon.

56:23.240 --> 56:25.240
It's like saying, look at Joan of Arc.

56:25.240 --> 56:38.240
It's like there's more kindling there and there's drier weather and there's easier ways to start fires and it turns to witch burning way faster when someone is just saying, hey, be aware of this.

56:38.240 --> 56:43.240
But being aware of something doesn't mean someone wants your pants.

56:43.240 --> 56:45.240
No one's going to take your pants.

56:45.240 --> 56:53.240
Like if privilege is real and you admit that it's real, it means you have privilege. It means no one can have your pants.

56:53.240 --> 56:58.240
Yeah, you can't pry on my pants from my cold heart.

56:58.240 --> 57:00.240
Cold, you know what I meant.

57:00.240 --> 57:02.240
Cold dead, cold dead heart fingers.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.240
Cold dead dick.

57:05.240 --> 57:08.240
It took me a while to see things that way too.

57:08.240 --> 57:14.240
Because as I've said a thousand times, it's like, I get it. You're a doughy white guy. You've been born. You come up through the system.

57:14.240 --> 57:16.240
You endure when you perceive.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.240
The system. The mean streets.

57:18.240 --> 57:20.240
You're out there in Gen Pop.

57:20.240 --> 57:24.240
The system.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.240
Okay, granted.

57:26.240 --> 57:30.240
Just click your heels, Dorothy. You've been in Oz the whole time.

57:30.240 --> 57:32.240
What you perceive is the system.

57:32.240 --> 57:40.240
And then when you start hearing talk about how you've had it easy, how are you supposed to react if you have an ounce of salt in your salt bladder?

57:40.240 --> 57:42.240
I don't know how medicine works.

57:42.240 --> 57:44.240
Salt bladder.

57:44.240 --> 57:50.240
People feel really insecure. Men feel really insecure really quick when that's even challenged, which I think is a weird thing.

57:50.240 --> 57:52.240
And they don't even want to meditate on it at all.

57:52.240 --> 58:00.240
I would argue the one thing that unites us all is that we all would have the same reaction if we were all told, shut up, stop complaining you've had it easy.

58:00.240 --> 58:06.240
We all, it's just that there's got to be somebody at the top that actually has had it easy.

58:06.240 --> 58:10.240
Those people are going to hear that. They're going to take that the wrong way.

58:10.240 --> 58:16.240
It is the same reaction, though. It's like, it is the thing that we say to each other.

58:16.240 --> 58:26.240
When someone says, I work as a clicky-clock clacker, and I don't get enough click-clacks for my click-click.

58:26.240 --> 58:32.240
You say the same thing to that person that if someone said it to you, you would fucking punch him in the face.

58:32.240 --> 58:40.240
Fuck you, you privileged piece of shit. You always dump that shit downhill. You dump it down.

58:40.240 --> 58:44.240
Every time there's a strike, every time someone sues a corporation because a jerk had killed their kid.

58:44.240 --> 58:50.240
We always side with the corporation. We have this human tendency to be like, fuck you, you whiny piece of shit.

58:50.240 --> 58:54.240
You should fucking love capitalism. Fucking rules.

58:54.240 --> 58:58.240
What was my point? I don't know. Watch CISO.

58:58.240 --> 59:06.240
I think your point was the guy that was burnt by hot coffee at McDonald's really deserved to win that lawsuit.

59:06.240 --> 59:12.240
Yeah, that coffee was too hot. It was too hot. People don't know, but it was too hot.

59:12.240 --> 59:15.240
It wasn't a goddamn guy. It was a fucking old lady.

59:15.240 --> 59:20.240
Oh, I didn't know who it was. I just remember Kramer trying it on Seinfeld.

59:20.240 --> 59:26.240
I just saw that episode. It's indication they had like the Johnny Cochran like analog guy.

59:26.240 --> 59:28.240
Did you watch it on CISO?

59:28.240 --> 59:32.240
Probably. They have a lot of archive NBC comedies.

59:32.240 --> 59:35.240
My community because that's co-owned by Sony.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.240
They got Saturday late nights next day?

59:37.240 --> 59:38.240
Next day.

59:38.240 --> 59:39.240
Next day.

59:39.240 --> 59:42.240
Saturday night live. Sunday morning, not live.

59:42.240 --> 59:46.240
Man, when you subscribe to CISO, you're really subscribing to humanity.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.240
Yeah.

59:48.240 --> 59:51.240
I say if you see so, say so.

59:51.240 --> 59:53.240
Yeah, I've been saying that for so long.

59:53.240 --> 59:55.240
Everybody, just go out there. Tell the world.

59:55.240 --> 59:57.240
How much time do we have left?

59:57.240 --> 59:58.240
Just yelling.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.240
Probably time for a rap.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240
I don't know.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240
23.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.240
Yeah, we got a bit of time.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.240
Oh my God. The audience is asking us to stretch.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.240
Calvin, are you local? Do you live in Austin?

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.240
No, I'm living in Florida right now.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.240
All right. Thanks for coming by. You were a great guest.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.240
No, I'm kidding. You want to hang out the whole show?

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240
Yeah, I'll hang out the whole show.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.240
It's up to Dan. It's not my decision.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.240
No, no. Calvin stays.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.240
Yeah, it's how like Martha Stewart's coming out.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.240
Calvin, because that first guy, what's his name?

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.240
The cowboy?

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.240
Are you jealous of him right now, or is he going to be mad at you in the way?

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.240
Did Anthony leave?

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.240
The black guy, the cowboy had his cameo and then left.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.240
I was going to ask him if he knew who he was.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.240
His girlfriend left before he came on stage.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.240
She left.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.240
She was like, I'm not having no date that's better than me.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.240
No, she found out that he's a piece of shit.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.240
He liked about seeing Get Out.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:08.240
Wait, well, he didn't say I saw Get Out.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.240
We started talking about Get Out and he went,

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.240
and then he like took it, took it up under the stage

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.240
and like he took advantage of a market that was there.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.240
Capitalism.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.240
Yeah, he took advantage of the bullshit market.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.240
And the question is, had he been white or a woman,

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.240
would he have made it this far?

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.240
Before the stun guns came out.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.240
Yeah, if it was a woman, I would have pushed her back.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:41.240
I would have grabbed her by both shoulders and sent her sailing.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.240
Yeah, if you're thinking about it now, ladies.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.240
Just try.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.240
I mean, who doesn't want to be sailing?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.240
That sounds delightful.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240
Right, it sounds like I'm Christopher Cross

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.240
and a very romantic thing is about to happen.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.240
Well, do you make an agreement that if a woman does charge the stage

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.240
that you will set her sailing but you will go with her

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.240
on a night cruise down the Texas River, whatever the fuck we're at?

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.240
No, I won't commit to that, Jeff.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.240
We're really putting you through our paces there.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.240
I was standing in my fucking hotel at the Radisson on the fucking river

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.240
while people crowded to watch the bats come out and waited till sunset.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.240
And there's a thousand people out there, an hour went by,

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.240
waiting for the sun to go down.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.240
And as I waited an hour to watch the bats,

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.240
I realized when the bats come out, it'll be dark out and I won't see shit.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.240
So I fucking left.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.240
You didn't even see it?

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.240
No, I've never waited for it.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.240
I was in a hotel room, the Hyatt looks in the right direction

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.240
and I got tired of waiting for the fucking bats to come out.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.240
Me too. I couldn't take it.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.240
Well, now that everyone knows we're at the Radisson,

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.240
can I just promote them for the fact that they have...

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:02.240
their rooms are the fucking best in terms of AC outlet placement.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.240
When you stay at the downtown Radisson...

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.240
That's important if you are connected.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.240
You are never more than 8 inches from a fucking AC outlet at a USB port.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.240
It is incredible.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.240
This is important to my listeners.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.240
The shower has been turned into a giant extension cord

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.240
so that you can learn door fortress.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.240
There's no need for...

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.240
But please, put toothpaste in the rooms.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240
Let's all put toothpaste in the hotel room.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.240
That's a rare thing.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.240
Did you just see that somewhere and think it should be everywhere?

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.240
No, it was maybe I saw it somewhere in Paris or something.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.240
I'm not happy with my Radisson experience.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.240
Oh, shit.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.240
Fuckin' left all day long.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.240
They didn't clean my room. There was no water back in the room.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.240
I asked for water and they came up and they knocked on the door

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.240
and they just said housekeeping and they didn't have any fucking water.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.240
Okay, but they did have a thing...

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.240
Same thing, but they didn't knock on the door every 10 minutes

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.240
going housekeeping in that voice.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.240
Are we having a Radisson debate?

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.240
I think there was some literature or something that said

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.240
if you'd like your house to be put in order, you can put a thing out.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240
I don't know.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.240
It's a Radisson. Who gives a shit?

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.240
Did they have mustard?

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.240
No, they didn't have mustard.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.240
But I looked up into the corner of my room

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.240
where there should only be spiders.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.240
There was an AC outlet up in the corner.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.240
There was an AC outlet up in the corner.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.240
I just love AC outlets.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.240
You know what can go fuck itself? It's Holiday Inn Express.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.240
I stayed at one in some weird part of the country.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.240
I think it was called Indiana, Pennsylvania.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.240
And if I'm wrong, I'm close.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.240
It was confusing.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.240
My room had no windows, no closets,

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.240
and if you turned anything on, the TV went off.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.240
You took a shower and water came out of the TV.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.240
It's like a March Brothers bit.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.240
And not now, Power Hog.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.240
And the sign above it in awesome Holiday Inn font

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.240
said, relax, it's Holiday Inn.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.240
Which could be written a couple ways.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.240
Relax. It's Holiday Inn.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.240
What did you think was gonna fuck it happen?

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.240
They should go one step further and be settled down.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.240
It's Holiday Inn.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.240
Simmer down.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.240
Don't be too big for your boots.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.240
In a world where there's a lot of fish to fry,

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.240
the Raddison downtown Austin has more AC outlets

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.240
than you can shake a stick at.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.240
And I ordered room service and I ordered a cheeseburger

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.240
and the woman that answered the phone and said,

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.240
room service, I said, I'd like a cheeseburger.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.240
She said, go on. I said, I'd like a Stella Artois.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.240
And she said, excellent choice.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.240
And then she said, I'll be right up.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.240
And I was like, I'll be right up.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.240
Weird pronoun. This is a system.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.240
This is Brazil. You're supposed to what?

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.240
Knock on the door. She comes in.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.240
Cindy comes in, learned her name.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.240
Because guess what? Figured out who she was.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.240
Because as she opened my Stella,

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.240
she went, oh, that looks good.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.240
So...

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.240
Yeah, it's dark. It's dark.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.240
But...

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.240
Cindy's an alcoholic.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.240
But I was like, did you take my order?

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.240
She said, hello, my name is Cindy and I'm an alcoholic.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.240
I said...

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.240
Hi, Cindy.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.240
She said, here's your Stella Artois.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.240
She did like a French accent.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.240
And she opened it and she's like, oh, that looked good.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.240
And I really thought, hmm.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.240
And I was like, were you the one that took the order?

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.240
And she said, yes.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.240
And I said, you know, I really appreciated

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.240
you excellent-choicing me.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.240
Like, you told me it was an excellent choice.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.240
She's like, it is an excellent choice.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.240
It's like, do you want my Stella?

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.240
Have a drink.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.240
Do you want to take a sip of it?

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.240
And she said, oh, I can't go there.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.240
And it was like, oh, darkness, darkness.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.240
It's a fine line.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.240
But I think she's going to be fine.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.240
She ate all of your food.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.240
And then she left.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.240
She's going to be fine because she made it this far

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.240
and her weakness is Stella Artois.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.240
Like, it's not like, you know, she wasn't like, antifreeze.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.240
No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.240
I think...

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.240
All right, so we only have a few minutes left.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.240
Oh, shit.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.240
Shall we finish this off with a Doug Benson rap?

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.240
What?

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.240
Yeah.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.240
Yeah.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.240
What does that mean?

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240
Let's do it.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240
Yo.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.240
Whatever you want it to be.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.240
Doug Benson rap.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.240
Oh, shit.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.240
Yo.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.240
Oh, Calvin on the beat box, all right.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.240
Doug Benson rap.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.240
He's going to rap to tell you crap.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.240
When Doug Benson raps, you're going to tell all your friends you heard of Doug Benson rap.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:39.240
But the first two minutes of a Doug Benson rap is a Dan Harmon rap.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.240
It's an introductory rap.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:46.240
But if I can rap about this lap, it's a victory lap where I go around.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.240
I'm going to Christmas rap his rap.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.240
I'm going to wrap it up and give it to you as a gift.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.240
Doug Benson's who I'm here to lift.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.240
I'm going to lift him to start him.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240
Lift him up.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.240
I'm going to lift Doug Benson like a girl.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.240
Yo, Calvin, talk about a Doug Benson rap, Calvin.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.240
Doug, Doug, Doug Benson rap.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.240
Why is he rapping?

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240
He's not even clapping.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240
Do you have the clap?

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240
What is the clap?

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240
Why am I rapping?

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240
Jeff, why'd you do this?

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.240
There's two guys right next to me who could do it better.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.240
That didn't rhyme.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.240
This is a good example of why you shouldn't have said my name.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.240
But it's cool.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.240
It doesn't matter.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.240
I'm going to sell the only black guys on stage rapping.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240
Yeah.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.240
It's Calvin Doug Benson rap.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.240
He said white guys can rap better.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.240
And it's also the only one not in a sweater.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240
Oh.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.240
Mama's spaghetti.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240
It's warm out.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.240
You know it.

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.240
You dressed up to show it.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.240
OK.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.240
Well, you proved him wrong.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.240
You proved him wrong.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.240
This is called the Doug Benson rap.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.240
I know.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.240
I tried.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240
When I said I could do it, I lied.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.240
I said, yeah.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.240
Yeah.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.240
Let yourself go.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.240
Let it go.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.240
Let it all out there.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.240
Oh, let's be frozen.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.240
Because Dan is the chosen one for our entertainment.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.240
That's all I got.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.240
Yo, left to right.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240
I'm going to fuck your mama.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.240
Like, catch a fuck's mustard tonight.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.240
I'm going to take it to the break.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.240
Don, I'm going to rhyme this with nothing but the front lawn.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240
Dijon.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.240
Fuck her.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.240
Dijon.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.240
Dijon.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.240
Dijon.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.240
Monday morning quarterback.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.240
That's a good guy.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.240
Probably come in here, try and take the beat,

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.240
and then give it a spin.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240
I feel really insecure.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.240
I shouldn't have took your rap.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.240
I'm going to step kind of back and let you do the sack.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.240
You know what you didn't say to you?

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.240
Thank you for coming to Harmon's Channel, everybody.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.240
He pooped on his rap.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.240
Let's hear it.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240
Let's hear it.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240
Doug Benson, everybody.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.240
Yeah, thank you.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.240
Calvin.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.240
Spencer Crittenden.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.240
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.240
Your Mayor is Dan Harmon.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240
Thank you so much.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.240
Thank you so much.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.240
We'll see you at the bar.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:15.240
Drive fast and take chances.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:25.240
Did you get any of that?

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:42.240
It's a good show.
