{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:27.500\nFrom a strange hangar, Quonset Hut, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:38.000\nAn awesomely international Harmontown is now in session\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:46.000\nWelcome to the stage, the Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:55.000\nOh fuck, oh fuck\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:59.000\nHe seems high, but he couldn't score, so he's not\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nOh, don't you worry\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:06.000\nIf anybody's holding, meet Spencer backstage\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:07.000\nDon't you worry\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:11.000\nAlright, oh, do I know, I don't know something you know\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:12.000\nI'm plenty high\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:13.000\nOh good, good boy\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nLet's bring out the mayor, shall we?\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:17.000\nJane Harmon\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:19.000\nWoo!\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:24.000\nGood day\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nI say good day to you\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:30.000\nThank you so much\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:34.000\nI won't say it like you\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nI'm here to bring you variety\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:38.000\nI'm not gonna just mock your accent\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:41.000\nI'm gonna let you think that I talk funny\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nGood, good day\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:44.000\nStruth\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:45.000\nStruth\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:48.000\nCrikey\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:51.000\nI like that hat\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nBut I have been working on my Australian accent\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:56.000\nAnd it's very difficult accent, as you guys don't know\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:57.000\nYou don't know that\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nYou think it's quite natural\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nDan was actually cramming backstage\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nThat's all he was doing\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nNo, I don't have an accent\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nHe had YouTube tutorials on\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nHe has one sentence, and it's perfect\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nI do, okay, here's what I've learned\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:14.000\nSo far\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nI like that hat, Mike\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nYour eyes are oise\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nYour a's are eyes\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nYour a's are a's\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nAnd the T's, R's and G's\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:36.000\nFuck them\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nAnd their shrimps\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nAnd their shrimps are prawns\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nAnd you're supposed to have\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nThis is the part that I can't get\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nBecause I'm concentrating too hard\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:50.000\nBut you're supposed to have a playful, soft, twangy tone\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nThat's what really separates it from the cockney\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nA lot of people that try to do Australian\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nThat aren't Australian, they slip into cockney\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nBecause you're like\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nBut professionals like me\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nAccentologists\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:09.000\nWe know that you're supposed to let your tongue\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nYou're not supposed to move your tongue that much\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nYou're supposed to just let it sit\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:17.000\nAs if it was laying over a ball in your mouth\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nDon't move your lips, somebody said\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nSo don't move your...\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nDon't move your lips or your tongue\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nAnd then say\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nI like that hat, Mike\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nI like that hat, Mike\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:34.000\nMike\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nI can't tell if they're applauding ironically or not\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nI think they're impressed\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nI like that hat, Mike\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:42.000\nI can't do it fast\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:43.000\nNow let's say\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nHey, somebody called me an Uber\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nI have to be home by seven\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nHurry\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nSomebody\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nCall\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nCall\n\n03:58.000 --> 03:59.000\nCall\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nCall\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nCall me an Uber\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nCall me an Uber\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nYou're moving your lips too much\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nI have to be home by seven\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nMike\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nYou sound British, lady\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nDon't you dare\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nYou know both you and I consider that the height of offense\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nWe're sister colonies\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nWe did the same thing at the same time\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nWe're terrible, horrible genocidal maniacs\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nThat were kicked out of the crown\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nWe were banished to a godless land\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nI think we left, though\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nAnd no, come on, nobody wanted no Puritans hanging around\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nNo, it was...\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nI'm not saying they loved them\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nI think they left\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nI guess there's a little bit more of a criminal thing\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:53.000\nWith the Australians\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nWell, there was\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nThey got over that pretty quick\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nAlright, okay\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nThat's what she said\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nWhen our prison colony is shut down\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:07.000\nOr as we would put it in America\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nWhen there's no more room in hell\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nThe dead will walk the earth\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nGeorge Romero\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nYeah, but anyways\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nI mean, we're obviously siblings\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nEven if you're not from here\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nEven if you're not...\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:25.000\nBut these guys have a lot of Chinese action going\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nWe got some from Shenzhen right in the second or third row\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nYeah, so that's where the phrase\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nFair dinkum comes from\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nFair dinkum, do you know that phrase, Jeff?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nDo not\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nFair dinkum\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:43.000\nAsk me if you like my hat, Mike\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nDo you like your hat?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nTrue blue, I do\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nFair dinkum\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nFair dinkum, it's a great hat, Mike\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nAlright, alright\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nAlright, come on, alright\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nAlright, that's it, that's the whole show\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nThat's all I have\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nI truly spent like an hour trying to...\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nYou seem to have assimilated quite well with your hat\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nAnd your West End shirt\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:07.000\nWest End massive?\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:08.000\nI don't know what this means\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:11.000\nI hope this doesn't make me homophobic or...\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nI'm hoping this is...\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:14.000\nI don't know if this is like...\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nOkay, good\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nI'm an advocate, I didn't want to...\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nThere was a shirt next to this one\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nIn the shop that I got it\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nThe shirt said, homosexuals are gay\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nAnd I didn't know if I got that one\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nWhose side I was on\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nI don't...\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nI don't know what that meant\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nBut...\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nI...\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nOkay\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nThat's very...\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nThat's very brave of you, sir\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nHe said...\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:40.000\nHe said they are\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nOr madam\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nBut he shouldn't have said they are\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nHe should have said they are\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nRule number five\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nYour eyes are oyes\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nYour A's are eyes\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nYour As are As\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nYour G's, G's and R's and G's\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nNow Dan came into this bar\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nCalled the End in the West End\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:56.000\nWhich is a covo bar\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\nRight?\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nAnd so we were there yesterday\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nWe met, I think, the owner, right, Nick?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nAnd we had a good old time\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nHe's a fan of Rick and Morty\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nAnd Harmontown, I think\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nAnd like lots of people\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nThat were there that knew the show\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nAnd Dan came in today\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nAnd we said, Dan, you got to get like a hat\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:12.000\nWe thought maybe getting like a cork hat\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:13.000\nOr a slouch hat\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nOr like something, you know, like...\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nLike what do they call the...\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nA Cuba\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nAn Acura\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nAn Acura\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nSo Dan bought a brand new Acura Legend\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nA Cordoba?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nA Curb Your Enthusiasm?\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nA Cuba Gooding Junior\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nA Cuba Gooding\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.000\nThat's actually...\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nThat's the state we're going to next\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nA Cuba Gooding\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nIt goes Queensland\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nWe're in Queensland right now\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd then clockwise around Australia\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nYou know, it's...\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nI wrote it down here somewhere\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nI think it's...\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nIt goes from here\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nWe go to Struth\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nAnd then Billabong\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nAnd Flapjacket\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nFlapjacket\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nBut today Dan walks into the bar\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nWe had lost him\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nI thought Dan just got lost\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nBecause he was trying to\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nBy breathe right strips\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nBecause he's been snoring on this trip\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nAnd we lost him for a while\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nHe comes back into the bar\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nWearing this West End massive shirt\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd this strange hat\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnd then the owner comes in\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nWearing West End massive shirt\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nHe made that shirt\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nHe was wearing that\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nAccidentally at the same time\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nIt was fantastic\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nIt was great\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nIt was true blue\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nNo, it's...\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nFair dinkum\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nFair dinkum\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nBut Dan, in that hat\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nBecause you look a little bit\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nLike Hank Williams the third\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nYeah, I'm not really fitting in\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nNo, not the third\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nJunior, you look like Hank Junior\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nI feel like I'm ready\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nFor some Australian rules football\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nRight now\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nBut I've been trying to fit in\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nI got the hat\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nAnd I love flat whites\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nInstead of cappuccinos\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nAnd of course\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nWho doesn't love\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nBeing terrified of poisonous spiders\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nI'm fucking terrified\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:50.000\nGod damn it\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:51.000\nSo I heard that\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nApparently this is probably a lie\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nI don't know\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nThe government guarantees\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nThat if you get poisoned by something\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nYou get a free airlift\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nTo a hospital or something\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nIs that true?\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nWait\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nBut that's not something\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nThat you would do\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nIf poisonous things\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nWeren't constantly murdering\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nEverybody all the time\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nRight, it's kind of like\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nIf you get bitten by a spider\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nYou and a guest spend\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nThree days and four nights\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nBut wait, doesn't everyone\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nGet that deal everywhere?\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nI don't know\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nLike what if you\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nNot in America\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nYou gotta pay for that shit\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nWell, yeah\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:25.000\nBut in America\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nThey still take you to the hospital\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nThey just then bankrupt you\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nYeah, no, they'll tell you though\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nThey'll land the helicopter\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nAnd say ten thousand dollars\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nRight\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd then they'll just fly the fuck away\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nWhat's the one called\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nA red jacket or the red something?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nThe red back\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nThe red back\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nIt's got a red stripe on its back\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nIt's tiny\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nAnd it hides under toilet seats\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nWhat?\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nThat's right\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nNo, that's the plot to the movie\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nGoolies\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nNo, you're thinking of the white tail\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nEqually poisonous\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nEven tinier\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd it hides in your wallet\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nWhat?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nCheck your bedding\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nCheck everything\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nI do like\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nMy wall has a zipper on\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nAnd that's why I keep the white tails out\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nWe're staying at a really nice hotel\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nAnd I don't know if this is it\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:13.000\nSometimes, you know\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nI'm not gonna make any premature\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nI'm like, oh, Australia's like this\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nAustralia's like that\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nI'm not some kind of rube, you know?\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nI'm like, oh, this is Brisbane\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nAnd this is this hotel\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nI don't know\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nBut I like the hotel\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nThat we're in\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nEverything's very simple\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nLike there's no dumb art on the wall\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nThat's trying to intimidate you\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nInto thinking there's more to life\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nThan you understand\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nLike it's just a picture\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nOf some half lady\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nWith a surfboard going through her ear\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nOr something\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nOr a crushed trumpet\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:44.000\nOr something\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.000\nAnd it's like, oh man\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nI guess this place is pretty cool\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nIt's just a blank kind of room\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nIt's like, it reminded me of staying in Baraboo, Wisconsin\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nWhen I was back in the States\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nBack then\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nBut then I started to realize\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nOh, I bet this is all simple\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nAnd clean and nice\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nBecause it's like, they don't want\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:03.000\nYou want to know what the spiders are\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nYeah, exactly\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nThey want, I bet this is like a thing\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nLike it's like, Arizona's like that\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nLike everywhere you stay in Arizona\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nIt's like, clearly like there's no such thing\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nAs a shadow\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nOr a corner\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nOr a scorpion could fucking jump out\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nGrab your face\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nLay eggs in your goddamn brain\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nIn my bathroom\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI opened up the window\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nLike you can kind of lever the window open\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nAnd there's awesome like jungle birds down here\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nThat make crazy like sounds\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nThey're human beings, Jeff\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nAnd they're trying to\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nThey're trying to make a living\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nAnd they're called sex workers\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nSo I'm fucking one of these birds\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nAnd I mean\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nI like that jungle bird!\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nMike!\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nWhat's that bird that just goes\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nA what?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nA carawang?\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nYou're all saying gibberish at the same time\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:56.000\nSo\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nYou see these videos of these goddamn kangaroos\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nAnd by the way\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nThey're as fascinated with kangaroos as we are\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nAre you talking about Jeff the kangaroo?\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nYou're like chess bumps the fucking window door\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nThere's these videos where there's just kangaroos\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nWill just like\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nI guess they wander up to people's\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nYeah, Jeff\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nThat's his name\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nThere's a famous kangaroo called Jeff\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nWell there's this viral kangaroo\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nAnd I think they call it Jeff\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nI thought it was a kangaroo problem\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nIt is\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI mean kangaroos are the biggest problem\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nBehind horses and camels I believe\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nBut they come up\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nAnd they see their reflection or something\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:34.000\nAnd they have human arms\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nThey're giant rats with human arms\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nThey look like werewolves\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nIf you didn't know that werewolves weren't real\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nYou'd be like holy shit\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nThat's a man beast\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nDon't let the name fool you\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nThese are not silly creatures\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nThey're not fun at all\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nThey have giant scary chimpanzee arms\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nThey cool themselves off by licking themselves\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nThat's fucking genius\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nThey have pockets on the outside of their body\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nInstead of uteruses\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nThey're fucked up\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nThey're like monsters\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nWait, what's Jeff the kangaroo's deal?\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nHe was hitting this fucking window or some shit\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:12.000\nI think that's the video\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nThe video is like this guy\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.000\nHe's been through it so many times\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nHe's like oh god damn it\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nI can't do an Australian accent\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nOh god damn it\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nGet the fuck out of here\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nGive me a piece of shit\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nGet out of here\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nYou fucking\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nYou piece of shit\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nI don't like your hat mate\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nYou're not wearing one\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nBut if you did\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nI wouldn't like it\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nOh I forgot\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nEverything's a question\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nEverything's gotta be a question\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nI forgot that part\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nI'm sorry about that\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nEverything's a question\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nEverything's up at the end\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nEverything's a question\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nI like that hat mate\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nDo I?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nDo I? I don't know\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nMaybe I don't\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nI'm trying\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nWhile we're on the subject\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nOf Jeff the kangaroo\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nWe were told by our\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nWhat do we call Alice\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nOur liaison\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nOur tour manager\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nWhat is she?\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nTour manager\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nShe's a jungle bird\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nYou said that not me\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nWell she likes it\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nAlice you're from where?\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nSydney?\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nFrom Sydney\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nShe's convinced that there's a term\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nThat is only here\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nLocal to Brisbane\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nGet Jeffed\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nOr Jeff in\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nOr like I Jeffed somebody\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nAnybody know what that is?\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nSee nobody knows Alice\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nShe tried to convince me for the last two days\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nThat that meant finger blasting somebody\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nNobody fucking can bear that out\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nIt's like I got Jeff in the parking lot last night\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nRight\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nDo you think she was\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.000\nDo you think that she's sexually harassing you?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nDo they have that here?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nI don't know\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:58.000\nI hope Jeff the kangaroo gets Jeffed\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nJeff\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nJeff\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nJeff's out there again banging on my glass\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nAlso\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nI was told by other people\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nI did not bother to look it up\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nBecause I was too busy drinking all day\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nThat all koalas have chlamydia\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nThere we go\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nYou hear that Alice?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nThat's called confirmed\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nThat's the APA style\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nWe confirmed that\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:28.000\nNo do they all have it or do most koalas?\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nThen it takes a lot\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nAll koalas have chlamydia\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:37.000\nAll koalas have chlamydia\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nBecause they ain't slenderia\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nI hit that by mistake\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nWell they eat the eucalyptus leaves\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nAnd they have diseases you believe\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:54.000\nThey'll give them to you if you sleep with thieves\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nThieves\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nThat's koala justice\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nThat's koala justice\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nDo 100% of koalas have chlamydia?\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nThat's a common stereotype\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\n98\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\n98 might\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nA lot like that\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.000\nCan a human being contract chlamydia by handling a koala?\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nWithout a doubt\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nDo you say without a doubt or we don't know?\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nHe might have said past assault\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nYou fucking monster people\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nYou talk weird\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:38.000\nAre there cases of human beings that have contracted chlamydia by hanging out with koalas?\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nWe're divided on that one\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nBut no one's ever heard of Jeffing being finger-banging\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nNo one's ever Jeffed a koala\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nAnd lived to tell about it\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nThe night is very young\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:54.000\nSomebody bring me a koala\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nI'm gonna Jeff that fucker\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nFair dinkum\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nI Jeffed a koala\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nNow I got the chlamydia\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nIt's a question\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nDo I have anybody?\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nI've crossed the threshold and do offensive\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nDo we have anybody who...\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nYou're not afraid to speak\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nThat's the only...\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nSomeone with a nice speaking voice\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nAnd if you know about Doritos, that helps\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nThis guy in the front\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nHe probably knows about Doritos\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nYeah, come on up if you'd like to\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nEcho\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nEcho?\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nLike, you know, in the Grand Canyon\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nWhen you throw your shit down there and it echoes\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nAlright\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nA very colourful way of describing\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nNot reverb\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nEcho\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nI wrote down these three phrases\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nThat I think are very Australian\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nLike, would you want to read that top one?\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nCan you read that?\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nLast night's episode of Caffe and Kim was Hamo\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nHamo, I made up that word\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nYeah, we decided that Dan's...\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nBecause you guys nickname everybody here\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nSo we decided that Harmon is Hamo\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nThe Brisbane thing is to call everyone Old Mate\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nOld Mate?\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nOld Mate, yeah, if you don't know the name\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nOr if you don't care, that's Old Mate\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nOld Mate\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nYou won't hear that anywhere else, it's just a Brisbane thing\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nOld Mate\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nOld Mate\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nOld Mate\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nOld Mate\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nOh, Old Mate\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nOh, Apostrophe Mate\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nBut is the... Oh, is the apostrophe for LD?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nIs it...\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nOrder!\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nI will clear this quonset hut\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nO-L, Apostrophe Mate\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nOld Mate\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nThank you, Old Mate\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nIt's also the most popular cologne here in Brisbane\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nAlright, here's the next phrase\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nDon't move, mate, there's a spider on your face\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nAnd it's poisonous as...\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nPoisonous as\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nThey say something is something as\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nAnd then they just stop talking\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nThat's their thing\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nIt's like poison as, mate\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nPoison as, mate\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nBut it's A-Z, not A-S, poison as\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nThis taco is poison as, mate\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nYeah, rich as, mate\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:34.000\nAnd then this is a phrase that Jeff Swears was told to him by our Australian friend\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:39.000\nHer Vag was Ledge\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nI asked a friend who's from Melbourne\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nI said, give me a...\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nWhat's the most Australian thing you could say?\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nHer Vag was Ledge\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nOkay, so, and I found...\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nThis is seriously...\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nI found those I wrote\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nBut this is seriously a dialogue I found\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:05.000\nBecause I was googling, like, how to do the accent\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nAnd they actually have this dialogue between us\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:11.000\nAnd I said, Jeff, you should do this dialogue with me\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nAnd he said, no, bring up somebody\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nAnd it's all vodka flying off my mustache\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nDon't be grossed out by it\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nIf it hits you, just...\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:22.000\nIt'll kill all the microscopic spiders on your face\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nCool\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nSo I think you be...\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.000\nWait\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nOh, you be Adam\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nAnd I'll be John\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nThis is, like, I got this off of, like...\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nI don't know, some website that said...\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nI think it's supposed to be, like, quick,\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nDecentral Australian dialogue\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nSo you be Adam and I'll do John, okay\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.000\nG'day, mate\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nHow are you going?\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nHow was your weekend?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nG'day\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nYeah\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:48.000\nMy weekend was heaps good\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nI went to the beach\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.000\nAnd had a barbecue with my mates\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nIt was a truly weekend\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nChublew weekend\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nSounds great\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nHow was the beach?\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nThe beach...\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nWas fully sick\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nFair dinkum\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nI caught five waves\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nAnd then took a break\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:19.000\nBut creaky, I was nearly bit by a shark\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nStruth, mate, you okay?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nWish I had a come with you, but I'm glad you didn't get it\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nI'm afraid of sharks\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:30.000\nChublew, next time, see you later\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nBye, mate\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nBye\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nWho was Adam and who was John in that one?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nHe was Adam\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nHey, Adam\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nYeah, mate\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nDid your friend John have a stroke?\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nIs he okay?\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:49.000\nI think his friend John is a...\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:53.000\nShit, I forgot the name of the things that fight Dr. Who\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nA dollar\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nA dollar\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nExtrema, mate\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nI like your hat, mate\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nA dollar\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nI like your hat, mate\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nExtrema, mate\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:08.000\nWhen you've been in the sun too long, you kind of start talking like that\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nBut that's when you've been out for a while\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:14.000\nWe noticed that everyone over 45 dresses like how I'm dressed\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nLike that's why...\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:20.000\nAll the young people are like normal earthlings\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nJeff's theory was that when you turn 45\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nYou take your driver's license and they just give you an outfit\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:31.000\nBecause everyone's just walking around dressed like an Australian action figure\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nIt's like Logan's run rules, you hit sanctuary and you have to put on the hat\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:38.000\nI like that carousel, mate\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.000\nEcho, are you a local Brisbaneite?\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nI have been for a few months, I just got back from America actually\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.000\nI was in Ohio, Florida, Texas and California\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nAll the good places\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:53.000\nI just missed the winter which was kind of disappointing\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.000\nAnd I understand we have to be careful when we talk about politics here\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nBecause you have liberals with a capital L\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:02.000\nBut their liberals are Nazis\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:11.000\nI'd like to say we're not doing as bad as you guys are right now\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nBut that's...\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nIt's not really the case anymore\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:20.000\nOh really? What is going on here in your best description?\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:23.000\nYou can tap out, you didn't sign on for this right\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:26.000\nIf it's controversial and they're going to start booing or something\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.000\nI don't think they'll start booing, I think you can just sort of point at any of them\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:33.000\nAnd just sort of say, you know, this one is shit\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:37.000\nAnd like half of them will go yeah\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:41.000\nAll you really got to drag on is like Pauline Hanson\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:45.000\nPauline Hanson is your number one target\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.000\nIf you want to make friends with him here\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nPauline Hanson\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nIs Pauline like a...\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nPauline\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nPauline\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nIt's Pauline\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nCrunchy\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nCall Pauline just to piss him off more\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:05.000\nDo some research on him and come up with some nice talking points\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nFirst of all, he has a girl's name\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:11.000\nOkay\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nAlright, I mean I have a girl's name\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:16.000\nHey Dan, why don't you leave your cisgender bullshit back in the States, man?\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nYeah\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:22.000\nLike Jane, I'd like to represent the entire trans community\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nAnd everything you say will be monitored\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:28.000\nYeah, there was graffiti, you saw graffiti that said\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:31.000\nFuck the system but spelled C-I-S\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nYeah\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nYeah, fuck that system\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:39.000\nBigger fish now, man, there's fucking Nazis in the White House\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nI can't even, I gotta tell my trans friends\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nI'll be back in a second\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nNazis, Nazis in the White House\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nAlright, anyways, sorry\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:54.000\nYou're saying that your trans friends have to rely on you to get Nazis out of the White House?\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:57.000\nThey have to go cool it for a while?\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nI may stumble over a pronoun here and there\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nI'm terrified for my life, I'm just like\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:06.000\nThe election happened and on the night before it, it was like\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:09.000\nI'm almost perfect in the way that I think and talk\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:13.000\nAnd then it was like this fucking monster happened\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:17.000\nAnd then I was like, I need a musket and I need fresh water\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:21.000\nIt really is, I mean, I'm assuming most of you are from here\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:24.000\nBut waking up as a citizen of the United States\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:27.000\nEvery day is like we're living in a fucking nightmare\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nIt's absolutely insane\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:32.000\nIt's pretty historical stuff, it feels\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nDan and I both voted for Trump, but we didn't know what we were doing\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nWe thought it was a lark\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nIt was a protest vote\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:45.000\nWe just wanted Hillary to know she couldn't take us for granted\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nWe didn't know she was gonna lose\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nWe were playing hard to get\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nIt's all they respect\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nYou gotta take that red pill\n\n25:55.000 --> 26:01.000\nSo you guys, so you're liberals with a capital L\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nBut do you use the word liberal with a small L to mean\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nLike the opposite of what your liberals are?\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nYeah, no, definitely\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nThat must get so confusing\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nBut I guess we have Democrats and it's like\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nOh, those are your guys in favor of voting, like what?\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nAnd then the Republicans and it's like\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.000\nWell, yeah, they love republics\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nWhat the fuck is a republic?\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:17.000\nI don't know\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:20.000\nBut then your liberals are labor, right?\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nLabor are liberals\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:24.000\nAnd then our labor, we don't have anybody that calls themselves labor\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nThat's offensive to all of our labor\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:27.000\nThey're like, I don't labor\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nI'm gonna be rich one day\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nI'm gonna scratch off away\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nI always got confused by the labor name as a kid as well\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:33.000\nIt was just like, what?\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nThis is so confusing\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nJust pick one\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nAnd then you have Tories and Poison Spiders\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nWell, Tories\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.000\nFour party system\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nYeah, poison\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nI'm all for the poison spiders\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:45.000\nAnd the poison spiders are in favor of healthcare\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nIn the form of helicopters that come and take you\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nTo the poison centers\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nBut only so they can bite you again\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nIs what I'm told\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nWe'll see the thing is, we didn't need a talking car\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:57.000\nTo broker the deal between the spiders and the piece\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nThe government\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\nThey were already in our ice cream anyway\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:04.000\nThat's a reference to my hit show, Rick and Morty\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nIt's a hit, it's a transcontinental hit\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nThe problem with spiders running healthcare is that\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nWhen you go and you're at the hospital\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nAnd you're reaching into your wallet for your insurance card\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nThere's a fucking spider in your wallet\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nAnd they fucking get you coming there\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nThere's spiders everywhere\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:21.000\nAnd what we're told is the bigger they are\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nOr the bigger they are\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nThat was good\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nThat actually sounded pretty good\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nThe bigger they are\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:30.000\nNo, no, no, you're pushing too hard\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nThe less poisonous they are\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.000\nYeah, you gotta, just to remind\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nYou gotta talk out of your nose a bit more\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nIf you really want to get that Australian thing\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:40.000\nYou gotta put your upper lip up into the nose bridge\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nSo it's sort of coming out of that end\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:43.000\nYeah, like that\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nLike that\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:52.000\nBut yeah, so there's tiny, itty-bitty little spiders\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nOh, they'll kill you more\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nAnd they can just kill you\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nHas anybody here in the audience tonight\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nEver died from a spider bite?\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nThere hasn't been a spider bite yet in 30 years\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nBut that's a misnomer, right?\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nBecause you don't die from the bite\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nYou die because your throat swells up\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:13.000\nAnd you suffocate, right?\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nNobody's died, somebody posits from the audience\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nThat nobody has died from a spider bite in 30 years\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:21.000\nYeah, in Australia or just on Earth?\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\nAustralia, okay\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nBut Spencer's suggesting that it's like in the wire\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nWhen you're just calling the death a different thing\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nLike when they go like, oh, we don't have a drug problem\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nThis is a, this was a\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nIt's like you don't die from the car crash\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nYou die from the strangulation on the state bill\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.000\nSo there's probably like a million spider deaths a week here\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nBut your flesh starts to die\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nAnd your finger falls off and shit, right?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nDepends which one bites you\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nYeah\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nYour friend lost his big toe\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nThat sounds like necritus\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nIt sounds like his toe necrotized\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nYeah\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nI know all about poison spiders\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:59.000\nWho here has a personal...\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nHas anybody here lost a limb?\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:06.000\nWell, alright, just, no, just any personal, horrifying spider story\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nIt could be a...\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nRight, right in the front row\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nIs it going to be your friend that lost his toe?\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nBecause we don't want to hear about that shit\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nThat's just second hand, that's an urban legend\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:18.000\nI want somebody who has had a spider on their face\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nWait, we got a good one in the back row or something?\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nWell, we know as he's shouting back row\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nHe's a liberal\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nYou sir in the tie?\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:36.000\nOh shit, lucky\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nHave you got a personal spider story?\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nGet the fuck up here\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nAlright\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:45.000\nPersonal spider stories\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:49.000\nPersonal spider stories\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nAwkawala's hepimedia\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nAwkawala's hepimedia\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:57.000\nPersonal spider stories\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:02.000\nFrom the land, so the Antipodes\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:03.000\nIt's a...\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nIt's a nankawala, sorry\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nHello, what's your name?\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nJosh\n\n30:06.000

30:14.000\nI like your hat too, mate\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nThank you\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nTrue blue\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nHanky dinkum\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nAlright, so spider stories\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.000\nLay it on us, Josh\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:24.000\nSpider story, I used to live out...\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:28.000\nAnd you went Ipswich\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nIpswich\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nAlright, it's not that bad, alright\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nIt's just the people\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nAnd...\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nAnd...\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nOy-ey\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nOy-ey\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nJesus\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nThis guy's just being hazed for saying where he's from\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:48.000\nAre the Ipswichians inferior to them?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:49.000\nAnd if so...\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:54.000\nWell then why bully him?\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:57.000\nJust feel sorry for him if you really believe that\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nI think you protest too much\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:01.000\nI think the Ipswichians may be superior\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nOr you wouldn't be so defensive\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:07.000\nYeah, I've been here five minutes\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nAnd I know lies\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:12.000\nAnybody else here from Ipswich by applause?\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:16.000\nWhy, Josh, I'll let you answer\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:21.000\nWhy does the whole crowd bristle at the name Ipswich?\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nI have to be very careful\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nBecause my grandmother still lives in Ipswich\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nShe doesn't listen to this\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nYeah, true\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nIt's just a little...\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nYeah, Paulin Hansen is...\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nOh, Paulin Hansen\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nIt's a little bit backwards\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nShe's from Ipswich\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nYeah\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nIt's a throwback\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:43.000\nAnd now she's trying to force her fucked up Ipswich views\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nOn the entire continent\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.000\nFrom Billabong to Struthnick\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nSo it's just...\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nYeah, it's not great\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nBut do you live here now or no?\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nI live in Brisbane, yeah\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:55.000\nAlright, so you've moved?\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nI've moved\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nYou've gotten out of Ipswich\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:58.000\nAre you embarrassed to be from there?\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nAre you proud of your Ipswich heritage?\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:03.000\nIt's a really great talking point at a party\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nBut not here, because you're gonna...\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\nNot here\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nYou're gonna get your ass handed to you\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nI'm sorry after the show\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.000\nThese folks do not like that hat, mate\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nThat hat ain't good, mate\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nAlright, so lay your spider story on us\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nIt is a spider story\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nIt's not a poisonous spider\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nBut it's a huntsman\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nIt's alright, it's okay\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:27.000\nIt's alright\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:30.000\nIt can be a giant, scary, not poisonous spider story\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nMaybe this is a scarier story\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:35.000\nThan just your friend's toe falling off\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nI am...\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nSo, living in Ipswich\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nHey, everybody, call the fuck out\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:46.000\nThere will be walkabouts enforced\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nYou will be sent...\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nThat's like a timeout, right?\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nExactly\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nYou will be sent on walkabout\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:54.000\nIf you don't...\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:55.000\nOh, shit\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nIf you don't cool it\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:59.000\nThe crowd is about to mutiny, I have no idea\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nYou have a lot of events in there\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:07.000\nWell, these are things you can think about on walkabout\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nAlright, Josh\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nJosh, you have the conch right now\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:12.000\nLay it down\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nSo, we had a pool\n\n33:14.000 -->

33:45.000\nI don't want Pauline Hansen down there\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nAlright, so you're wearing your little snuggles\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nNo, I'm not wearing one though\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nYou're not wearing them\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nI'm about to wear them\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nYou're about to...\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nOh, dear\n\n33:52.000 -->

pain\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nBecause a huntsman spider has freaked out\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:06.000\nAnd bitten between my arse\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nAnd my testicles\n\n34:08.000 -->

sensation of that?\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nLike, can you put the...\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:35.000\nI was about nine at the time\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:41.000\nAnd I remember screaming in intense pain\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nAnd then for the next hour and a half\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:46.000\nMy mum had to hold the cold back to my area\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nYou couldn't hold it yourself?\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:51.000\nWell, I was nine and I was very scared\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nWas the...\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nWas the huntsman destroyed by the pudding\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nOn of the dick tongs?\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nI thought it ran away\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nAnd then proceeded to be horrified\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nIt might come back\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nBut my dad said he killed it\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nOh, he was...\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:07.000\nHe lied\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nI think he was blatantly lying to me\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nI saw a video on the internet\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nWas that a huntsman that was like\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:16.000\nCrawling up the side of a fridge with a mouse in its mouth?\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nThey're about...\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:18.000\nThey're massive\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:19.000\nSo they're huge\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:20.000\nWait, wait, yeah\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nBigger than a...\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:22.000\nThey can...\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nThe size of a grown man's hand\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\nYeah, the grown man's hand\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nMore like your hand\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:27.000\nNot mine\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:28.000\nYou're putting on your dick tongs\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nAnd you don't see a fucking hubcap place there\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI was excited\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nYou couldn't wait to...\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nI was gonna get in the pool\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nPlay some Maca Apollo\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nAs far as...\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nAs far as that spider was concerned\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nOh, look, a lovely little hammock for me to ride\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nI said, oh shit, a guy's gonna sit on me\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nWhat is he doing in there?\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:49.000\nDid he think flies would be in there?\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nWere there flies in there?\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nI don't know\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nProbably\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:56.000\nYou had sticky balls when you were nine\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nAh, shit\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nAh, hip switch sucks\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nYou're just going for the easier pull\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:03.000\nI'm sorry\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nSo you and your mother are having an intimate encounter\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:08.000\nWhere she's holding an ice pack to your balls\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nTane\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nThe end?\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nAll's well that ends well\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.000\nYeah\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:15.000\nIt didn't necrotize\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.000\nWell, I didn't go on...\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nI now don't swim anymore in pools\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nSo I don't know if that's a...\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:23.000\nSo that's put you off swimming at all, like forever\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:24.000\nWell, I still swim\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nOh, but not in pools\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:27.000\nNot really in pools\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:28.000\nYou could just...\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:29.000\nWhy do you blame the pool?\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nThat's such a weird connection to make\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nWell, there's less pools than there are spiders\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:34.000\nSo I just, you know...\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nWhat about the shorts?\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nWhere do you...\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:37.000\nHedge my bets\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nLike the shorts are what you should associate with the...\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:40.000\nRight\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nThe dick toss\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nI'm going to not...\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nI'm not going to...\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nI'm not going to trauma-splain to you\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nSorry\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nYou can experience trauma however you want\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nAnd cope with it\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nBut I think pools didn't really do anything in this story\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nIf anything, if you had jumped into the pool\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nSoon enough, the spider would have drowned\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.000\nYeah, that's true\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nI don't know why\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nI've told the story on the Hammer Time before\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nWhen a spider fell into my ear one night\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:09.000\nAnd I thought there was a marching band inside my brain\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nI found out that what you do is you just pour alcohol in there\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nAnd get it fucked up and it falls asleep\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:17.000\nInstead, I just kept hitting myself in the head like a moron\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:20.000\nAnd then at one point I just wanted to jab a pencil into my ear\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:23.000\nAnd just kill myself so that the noise would stop\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:24.000\nYeah, no\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:27.000\nAnd so now, I mean, I'm a live and let live sort of fellow\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nBut if I see a spider, sorry fellow\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nBut they kill all the flies\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nYeah, but fuck them, flies don't go into my ear at night\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:38.000\nI had three nights in a row where each night\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nI was woken to a spider on my face\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:41.000\nWhat?\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nNo joke, each night, I caught the first one\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nIt was crawling up and I was like, not gone\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nSecond night, I woke up, it was on the face\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nThird night, it was trying to get on my mouth\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nThat's when I pulled the bed apart\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nAnd threw the bug bomb around the room\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nJesus Christ, I got to get out of here\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nThis is fucking it, this is my worst nightmare\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nDan, Dan, Dan, Dan\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nDon't move\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nIt's not even funny\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nMove, Dan\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:09.000\nYou just, you get some long grass and you walk out behind them\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nAnd you tickle them all night\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:11.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:16.000\nHey, did you guys know, you guys know the typewriter was invented here?\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:21.000\nBut Wi-Fi was, Wi-Fi was invented here, I'm told\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:23.000\nIs that true?\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nI don't know\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:29.000\nNobody here agrees on shit, you guys, it's so divided\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:32.000\nIt's a big continent and there's a lot of them\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:35.000\nThey're probably all, these are the first time they've seen each other\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:38.000\nThere's probably different factions and things\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nEvery street is a boundary\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nEvery postcode has another crew in it\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nI read about the boundary streets\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:50.000\nThe, the, the, so, so, so, okay\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:57.000\nI mean, are all crowds here this fucking awesomely loud and\n\n38:58.000 --> 38:59.000\nFucking night\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:01.000\nIt's Australia, everyone\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:02.000\nI love it, I fucking love it\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nWe're all going out to a bar after this, right?\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:05.000\nWe're all going to go\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:09.000\nAlright, so\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:12.000\nI sat in one bar since 9 a.m. until like fucking 5\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.000\nThat's the best\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:17.000\nYeah, we got, but their bars don't open until 10\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:20.000\nIt was, that was, they don't serve until 10\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:23.000\nI had a coffee and an avocado mash and then I drank myself\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nSmashed avocado\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:25.000\nSmash, smash\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nAlright, I forgot both your names\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.000\nJosh and Echo\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:29.000\nJosh and Echo\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:30.000\nYou forgot Echo?\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:31.000\nYeah\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:35.000\nThe guy who describes himself as what the sound makes when you throw shit down the Grand Canyon\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nWell, let's have a hand for Josh and Echo\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:38.000\nJosh and Echo\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\nJosh and Echo\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:46.000\nJosh and Echo, you can catch their new animated children's cartoon on Nick and Knight\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nThese ventures of Josh and Echo\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:54.000\nSpencer, how's your, how's your Australia been?\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:55.000\nOh, fine\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:58.000\nI mean, I don't know\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:02.000\nAnytime we travel, I'm like, what am I supposed to say, that I hate it?\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nLike, it's not going to go over well\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nWell, you could probably, they'd probably be willing\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:10.000\nLet's just talk about all the other places I went that I hated\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nCanada, fuck it\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:14.000\nYou don't like Canada?\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nNew York City, forget about it\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:20.000\nFlorida, drown that entire state\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nI agree with that one\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nLike, just fuck all of it\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:28.000\nNo, Australia's fine, I don't know, I don't want to get all into it\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:32.000\nI feel like all this material is just like hack at this point, right? I don't know\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:35.000\nThe O sound weird, you've been doing all this accent shit\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:39.000\nI still don't know how to say a fucking O in Australian\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:43.000\nAs far as I can tell, it's like an A-R-O sound\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:46.000\nLike, like narrow, kind of, except like narrow\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:50.000\nBut I can't do it, that's the problem\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:54.000\nI don't know, what else? Also just, I mean, you've already, this is well-tron-ground\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:57.000\nEven on this show, but just the fucking bugs\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:01.000\nI mean, there's a lot of things, there's a lot of animals that can kill you anywhere you go\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:05.000\nYou can get stepped on by an elephant, you can get murdered by a lion\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nBut those are beasts, right?\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nThese are beasts, fearsome creatures\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:13.000\nBut in Australia, there's literally monsters\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:17.000\nLike, I don't, there's things that'll kill you in all the places\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nLike polar bears, holy shit\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nBut that's not a monster, that's a beast\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:26.000\nLike, if you have to use weapons to kill an insect, that's a fucking monster\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:31.000\nLike, that's in an RPG\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:35.000\nGiant monstrous insects that you have to kill with weapons\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nAre like the lowest level monster that exists\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nI'm sure there's probably fucking slime blobs here too, right?\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:45.000\nYou already talking about Pauline Henson?\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:49.000\nI'm killing, I'm killing!\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:53.000\nI'm Australia's favorite comedian\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nI know nothing about anything\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:00.000\nAlright, Spencer, you're walking down the streets of Australia\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nAnd you see a beast\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nIt's just a spider, it's a spider\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:11.000\nThey're very common, they're terrifying the common\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:14.000\nAlright, that was it, I thought it was going to be more mythological than that\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:17.000\nWell, you gotta give me more than that, you see a creature? What the fuck?\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:20.000\nAlright, I, I, I, I\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:23.000\nThis guy just said rock and roll, assumedly\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nThey're excited, it's a big night out\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nNo, they're excited, that much is clear\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:30.000\nWhat do you want, Spencer? Do you want the name of a creature?\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nI don't know, whatever you guys want\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:39.000\nThis is the excitement I was alluding to\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:42.000\nI feel like I heard the word wombat, strumpet\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:47.000\nOh, drop bear, they're talking about drop bears\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:48.000\nDrop bears\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:52.000\nYeah, are there any drop bears in the house?\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nYeah!\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:55.000\nAlright\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nYou hear a strange whistling sound from above\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:02.000\nYou look up in a brown blur, you're crushed\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:06.000\nIt's a drop bear, right? I don't know what a drop bear is\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nI mean, I don't care what a drop bear is\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nI just don't know\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:14.000\nDrop bear?\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nDrop bear, yeah\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:21.000\nOh, a koala is a drop bear? Do they like fall on your cars and stuff here?\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:26.000\nOh, a fucking drop bear ruined my windshield, Mike?\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:32.000\nThey're like coconuts in Los Angeles, koalas\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:37.000\nThey'll just fall on your car and you'll get chlamydia all over your windshield\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:41.000\nAn insurance won't cover them, because they're fucking liberals\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:47.000\nDo we have a koala expert, like somebody like a naturalist out there who knows about it\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:50.000\nAre they all suffering from chlamydia?\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:51.000\nDid they drop dead?\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nThey can't stand it\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nYou work with koalas a lot?\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nAlright, get up here, we have to talk to you\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nYou want to come up and explain?\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:07.000\nI was going to say I'm not getting a heavy scientist vibe from the crowd\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:11.000\nBut I guess we have a zoologist here\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:18.000\nAlright, approaching the stage is a man who has handled koalas\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:22.000\nDarcy?\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.000\nAlright\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:24.000\nDarcy?\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:25.000\nDarcy\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:26.000\nOh, Darcy\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.000\nIt's a hot day\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nI'm Hamo\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nDarcy, alright, so you work with what zoo?\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nTeronga Zoo\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nTeronga\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nYeah, it's in Sydney\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nI like that zoo, mate\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nYeah, it's a good zoo, mate\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nOkay, that's good, you did it up at the end\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:48.000\nBut you could use a little work on the s at the e\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nI'll work on it\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:54.000\nRepeat a bit, Kath in Kim was a masterpiece\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:57.000\nKath in Kim was a masterpiece\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nMasterpiece?\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nMasterpiece?\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nUp at the end?\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:01.000\nAlright, so...\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nWhat the fuck is happening?\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nI'm coaching, I'm doing dialogue coaching\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.000\nYou're doing great, Dan\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nI'm learning how to be Australian\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nYou just give my ears chlamydia\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:13.000\nAlright, so what are we...\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:14.000\nI got it from the koalas\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:18.000\nAlright, so what's the deal with koala chlamydia?\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nYeah, go\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nI mean, that's not the most interesting thing about koalas\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:25.000\nWhat's the most interesting thing about koalas?\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:29.000\nTheir primary food source makes them high\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:33.000\nOh, so does mine\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nWhich strangely is eucalyptus leaves\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:42.000\nKris Boruffuf, our technical director and live director\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:46.000\nHe said that baby koalas have to eat koala shit\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:49.000\nYeah!\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nWe did it!\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nWait, they have to or they like to?\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nNo, they have to and they like to\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nIs that correct?\n\n45:58.000 --> 45:59.000\nAnd kangaroos\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:00.000\nAnd kangaroos\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:01.000\nThey can't get enough of it\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nWell, it's probably because I think elephants and stuff\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nThey eat each other's shit too\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nBecause it's like they digest cellulose maybe\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nAnd there's probably like a lot of plant in their shit\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nAnd then they just eat it again\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nI mean, maybe\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:16.000\nIt's like the really bad version of like the baby bird\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nGetting brought from the mother\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:19.000\nExcept you get shafted\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nThey said bacteria\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:24.000\nSo there's bacteria from the mother\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nThat helps them digest\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nOh, right\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:31.000\nBecause they're marsupials\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:35.000\nAlright, so this might have been kind of a dud\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:38.000\nWait, do you know anything about Doritos?\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nI have all these Dorito issues\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nWhat's the Dorito issue?\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nCould you explain the difference between the yellow bag and the orange bag?\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nYes, because one says nacho cheese\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:47.000\nBut the other says cheese supreme\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:48.000\nWe have different ones\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:51.000\nI think they might be labeled differently\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:56.000\nSo let's start with cheese supreme\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nSo obviously that's the bad\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:01.000\nThat's standard, right?\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:02.000\nThat's the good one?\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:03.000\nNo, no, the standard\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:06.000\nLike the one that they started with was nacho cheese\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:07.000\nRight\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nAnd then they amped it up with cheese supreme\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nRight\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:11.000\nBut what's the difference?\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:12.000\nBecause I had a nacho cheese\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nAnd I would say it sounded like\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nOr it tasted like cool ranch\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:18.000\nOr is I think it's called cool american?\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nOh, they call it cool ranch here\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:21.000\nThe blue one\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:22.000\nYou've got a whole different color\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nThat's how it tasted though\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nIt tasted like it, mate\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nThat sounded really insulting when I said it\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nListen here, mate\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nYou don't be throwing different colors at me\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nWe're talking red and yellow\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.000\nYou're talking blue\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.000\nI'm talking true blue\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nTrue blue, Struth?\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nOkay, so you do have the cool ranch\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nBut the nacho cheese just tastes half like cool ranch\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:49.000\nAnd half like cheese\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nIt's actually Mexican\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:56.000\nI would say that the nacho cheese tasted\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:59.000\nMore like ranch than nacho cheese\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:03.000\nAnd the cheese supreme tasted like nacho cheesier\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.000\nIs what we call it\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nWe don't really have ranch over here\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:07.000\nSo that's a whole new flavor\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nBut you have the blue bin\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:10.000\nWe're talking about it\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nWe have it\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nIt's just that Australians are kind of stupid\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:14.000\nWhen it comes to ranch\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:15.000\nThey don't know what it is\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nWell, ranch is terrible\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nI would never eat ranch willingly\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nThe sauce, not the chip\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nAnd that's why you go cheese supreme, mate\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nRight, yeah, nacho cheesier\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nBut if it's cheesier\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nThen why isn't it more nacho a year?\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:30.000\nThat's what I don't get\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nIt's like the cheesier is less nacho-y\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:33.000\nThan the nacho cheese\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nWell, I guess that does make sense\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:38.000\nThey had to sacrifice the spicy for the cheese\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\nRight\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nWe got both in America, baby\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:43.000\nIt's a Venn diagram\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:44.000\nSo the more cheese you get\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nThe less nacho you have\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:47.000\nRight\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nSo ours is the best of both worlds\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:50.000\nWe really win\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:51.000\nIs it true?\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:52.000\nWell, in America\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:53.000\nI don't know if you know this\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:56.000\nBut an adult has to eat cool ranch\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nAnd then shit in a baby's mouth\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nBecause there's a bacteria that only Americans have\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:05.000\nThat helps the baby digest the nacho cheese\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nBut you guys don't do that here, apparently\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nNo, no, we do that with shrimp\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nOh, shit\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:13.000\nRight\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:14.000\nIt's\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:16.000\nOh, shit\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nIt's prawn in Queensland, for God's sake\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:19.000\nEven I know that\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:21.000\nWho was it?\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:23.000\nDarcy?\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:24.000\nDarcy?\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:25.000\nDarcy\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:26.000\nLet's have a hand for Darcy\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nDarcy\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:29.000\nKoala Expert\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nKoala Expert Darcy\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nAll of its Dorino expertise as well\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:35.000\nI feel like\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nWe engineered something\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nWe've got a crowd of a particular personality\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nThey have a dynamic\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:44.000\nI'm going to call that personality prison riot\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nIt's fine, it's fine\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nFuck it\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nPlease don't kill us\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nI think there's a way to use that energy\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nBetter than like\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nWe don't have to do an NPR podcast\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nNaked dodgeball\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nNaked dodgeball\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nBut let's try\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:05.000\nI'm going to try this\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nJust to see if this works\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nI'm going to do a little one man\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:09.000\nImprov\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nAnd I'm going to\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.000\nWhen you see me pause\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nAnd go like this\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:17.000\nThat means I'm going to get a suggestion from you\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:18.000\nOkay\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:19.000\nSo\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:20.000\nI think this will work\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nBecause you guys like yelling stuff out\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nOh, here I'm going in the door\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nOh, look, it's a\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nYeah, this is great\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nIt's a thing\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nThat's good, that's great\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nA koala pen\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:42.000\nOh, look, it's a dildo tire\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nI'll just put that on my car\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nSo that I can\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nThere's a police officer\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nIs that a dildo on your tire?\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:57.000\nYes, I'm using it to fuck traffic\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nSo I can drive better\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nOn the thing\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nForgive me, understand what I do for a living\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nIt's very important I get to work\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nWhat do you do for a living, sir?\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nI'm a peanut allergist\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nAlright, on you go\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nThere are children's lives on the line\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:19.000\nDildo car, dildo car, driving to my work\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nThat's a copyright, right?\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:26.000\nHere I am at the Peanut Allergies Science Research Center\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nI better go talk to my boss\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:32.000\nHello, I'm reporting for duty\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nAre there any emergencies I should know about?\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:37.000\nThis is non-standard procedure for your day to day\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nYou have reports and emails to deal with\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nI got pulled over by the police\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nOh, right, of course\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:50.000\nI just want to do my best to try to keep kids from dying of peanut allergies\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:53.000\nOh shit, there's a drone strike happening\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:56.000\nHello?\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nHello, can I speak to Dan Harmon?\n\n51:58.000 --> 51:59.000\nIs this the police?\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:00.000\nYes\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:01.000\nOkay, here he is\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:04.000\nSir, we found your car and there's a...\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:05.000\nGoana!\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nThere's a

scene\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nBut we should have one of the\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nBrisbaneites\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nProvide that this has never been done before\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nIf they were to provide\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nSome form of sound effects\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nUsing their mouth and the microphone alone\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nWhile we do an improv scene\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nSo we do a scene and we make them do the noises\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nThat would be required in the scene\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nSo we collaborate together\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nIn a scene\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nThat is constructed in front of their very eyes\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nAlright, how about Madam here\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nWho knows about science and knows about stuff\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nWould you

01:17:41.000\nFucking amazing\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nYou don't think the singularity is going to happen there?\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nYou have 10 seconds to comply, starfish\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nYou modified\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nSo it killed all the Crown of Thorns starfish\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nand then you're like, well, let's just\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nlet's just give it\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nsentience\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nYou know what, fucking...\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nOctopus has been bumming me out for a while\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nLet's kill those motherfuckers too\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nThey have a brain, we can't do that\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nWhat does the business end\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nof a starfish killing robot look like?\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nAre you looking it up right now?\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nWhat?\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nAre you looking up right now?\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nI'm looking at my notes\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nThat's the show\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nIt's a mid-long\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nyellow penis shaped\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nthing with a couple of sidebars\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nand a keel on top\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nThat's the only way I can finish\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nThat's the only way I can finish\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nThat's the only way I can fish\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nI hate when the audience is\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nfunnier than us\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nSo you're a starfish\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nkilling robot has a big yellowish\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\npenis looking thing on it?\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nNo, no, it is\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nIt's a phallic kind of meter long tube\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nsubmarine\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nWell, it's got a world's\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nfirst injection system\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nthat's...\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nWhat's the air pressure one?\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nThat's the oldest come on I've ever heard of\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nHey, there it is, you want to meet me?\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nThe oldest injection system?\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nIt's a pneumatic injection system\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nand it injects the starfish with bile salts\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nBile salts?\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nThey get it from an ox, but\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nthe starfish don't like it because they don't have\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nthat kind of protein in their body, so they melt\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nBut does it knock them dead?\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nYeah, it melts them in about 24 hours\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nThat sounds fucking excretiating\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nIsn't there a more humane way to kill this?\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nThey're fucking starfish\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nWho is the Great Barrier Reef?\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nSo\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nYou work for a corporation\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nthat sends out a giant dick\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nthat melts starfish\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nIt's public money, it's a university\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nGood on ya\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nThat was very Australian\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nGood on ya\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nAustralian engineering, invented the internet\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nand killer robot\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nstarfish dicks\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nAnd written on the side of it, it says, how's the serenity?\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nHow's the serenity?\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nHow's the serenity?\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nWe did our research\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nSo much serenity\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nHow's the serenity?\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nThey fucking melt starfish by injecting them with\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\npoison\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nYou could inject them with anything, really, right?\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nIf you inject someone with milk, you'd kill them\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nI don't know\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nYou could just put, like, air\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nYou could probably inject them with air\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nFuck them right up\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nAnd I'm not going to\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nbut if I stuck a huge robot dick into you\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nand just pumped air into you\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nyou'd die, I think\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nBut I think these starfish, they're more robust\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nThey're a more robust enemy\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nThey're like barnacles or liberals\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nGive me a ballad\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nLet's do a song, like, not a rap\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nPerfect\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nOh, it doesn't do that\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nWhat was that?\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nThank you, sir\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nI like your hair, mate\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nAlright, what do you want, Dan?\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nJust give me, like, you know\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nsomething that's more emotional\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nOkay\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nLet's see what we got here\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nAre you in an emotional mood right now?\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nYeah, I don't know why\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nI already did the rap and I almost died of a heart attack\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nRight\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nI'm still trying to, I don't know if

bone\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nTo the knickknocked oak\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nTo the break of dawn\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nOh, Brisbane\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nI-S-B-A-N-E\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nI assume\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nI assume that's how you spell it\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nOh, I like your hotels\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nThey have\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nNew carpeting\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nAnd the shower\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nThe water pressure\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nCould be better, but\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nIt was still nice\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nA little tiny bar of soap\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nAnd a disposable toothbrush\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nFrom the airline\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nThat's probably not to your credit\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nBut I used it here\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nAnd had a good time\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nTo the break of dawn\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nB-R-I-S-B-A-N-E\n\n01:22:23.000 -->

01:22:35.000\nI need my piss guards to take a piss\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nI put them on\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nTook her to the room\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nAnd I climbed inside her womb\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nI became a baby\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nThat day\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nAnd got born in a whole new way\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nI'm an Australian now\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nI see the world clearer\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nI fucked your mama like a kangaroo\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nThat came nearer than I wanted to\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nWhen it sees reflections\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nI fucked your mama so hard\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nWith my Australian erection\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nA Tasmanian day\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nIn a true blue way\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nTruth\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nI fucked your mama\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nTrue blue, fair dinkum\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nAlright\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nWhen did this become a rap?\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nYou said you were feeling emotional\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nYeah, yeah, sorry\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nYo, yo\n\n01:23:21.000 -->

very far\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nIn any direction\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nYou'll see a bunch of water\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nThat's all I know about Australia\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nI imagine surfing\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nIs very popular here\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nI think I've seen that in movies\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nThey like to surf\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nBut\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nHere's the thing\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nThe track ran out\n\n01:24:01.000 -->

notch\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nFrom a dead stop?\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nWe've had some fun\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nI want to know who in the audience\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nHas had a real difficult time\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nWe want to help somebody\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nThe whole\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nWell, then if it's everyone\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nThen who's had the worst time ever\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nAnd I don't mean like want your money back\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nWe'll talk to you after the show\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nIf that's the case\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nYou've been a good sport\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nAnd I see that you

when I\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nget a foot ache and don't destroy my life?\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nHerbal medicine\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nrather than don't go down the traditional route\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nlike I did, I had surgery and stuff\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nI don't know\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nWhat traditional

01:34:01.000\nhas been well researched\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nfor its anti-inflammatory properties\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nSo I definitely recommend you take turmeric\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nThat's not even Eastern medicine\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nThat's just nutrition science\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nBut are you saying\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nyou said don't go down the path\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nI went down\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nIf I wasn't wearing onesie\n\n01:34:17.000 -->

dream come true\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nThank you, that's what I was hoping\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nI didn't want it to seem forced\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nI can see a little peepee poking out of your thing\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nWhat do you mean what?\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nYour dick was coming out of the thing\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nI think that was a doughnut\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nMy dick was out?\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nProbably so\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nThere would be like police\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nYou can get\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nall laws are off in this building right now\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nGiven the impression that\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nthe pain is one directional\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nthat you have a spot that causes the pain\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nand sends the message to your brain\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nbut pain is more like\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nan ant colony coming to your house\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nwhen a storm comes\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nand they just all flood in\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nIs that how ants work?\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nYeah they come in the rain\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nI was trying to think of metaphors\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nto explain it because you almost need\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nany medical degree to understand my condition\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nbut it's a central nervous system\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\npain condition that can be triggered by\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nanyway\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nI don't understand what their stance is\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nor what they're doing\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nI don't know if they want you to be in more pain\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nor less pain\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nI feel like this is the scene\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nin Mutiny and the Bounty\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nwhen they try to kill Captain Blyre\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nI think what happens\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nI think what I've realized has happened\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nin my shut in days\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\npeople have become really like\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nassociate herbal medicine\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nor anything kind of like outside\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nof the mainstream medicine sphere\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nlike you're either like a flat earth\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nor an anti-vaxxer\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nso I think that their reaction might be\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nis that they're encoding what I'm saying\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nas somebody who has a\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nyeah that's it\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\noh it's probably an action
