WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:27.500
From a strange hangar, Quonset Hut, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
An awesomely international Harmontown is now in session

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Welcome to the stage, the Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Oh fuck, oh fuck

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
He seems high, but he couldn't score, so he's not

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, don't you worry

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
If anybody's holding, meet Spencer backstage

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Don't you worry

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Alright, oh, do I know, I don't know something you know

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm plenty high

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh good, good boy

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Let's bring out the mayor, shall we?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Jane Harmon

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Woo!

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Good day

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I say good day to you

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Thank you so much

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I won't say it like you

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm here to bring you variety

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm not gonna just mock your accent

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm gonna let you think that I talk funny

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Good, good day

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Struth

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Struth

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Crikey

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
I like that hat

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
But I have been working on my Australian accent

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
And it's very difficult accent, as you guys don't know

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
You don't know that

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
You think it's quite natural

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Dan was actually cramming backstage

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
That's all he was doing

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
No, I don't have an accent

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
He had YouTube tutorials on

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
He has one sentence, and it's perfect

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I do, okay, here's what I've learned

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
So far

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I like that hat, Mike

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Your eyes are oise

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Your a's are eyes

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Your a's are a's

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And the T's, R's and G's

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Fuck them

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And their shrimps

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And their shrimps are prawns

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And you're supposed to have

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
This is the part that I can't get

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Because I'm concentrating too hard

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
But you're supposed to have a playful, soft, twangy tone

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
That's what really separates it from the cockney

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
A lot of people that try to do Australian

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
That aren't Australian, they slip into cockney

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Because you're like

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
But professionals like me

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Accentologists

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
We know that you're supposed to let your tongue

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You're not supposed to move your tongue that much

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
You're supposed to just let it sit

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
As if it was laying over a ball in your mouth

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Don't move your lips, somebody said

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
So don't move your...

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Don't move your lips or your tongue

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
And then say

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I like that hat, Mike

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I like that hat, Mike

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Mike

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I can't tell if they're applauding ironically or not

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I think they're impressed

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I like that hat, Mike

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I can't do it fast

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Now let's say

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Hey, somebody called me an Uber

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I have to be home by seven

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Hurry

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Somebody

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Call

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Call

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Call

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Call

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Call me an Uber

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Call me an Uber

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
You're moving your lips too much

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I have to be home by seven

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Mike

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
You sound British, lady

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Don't you dare

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
You know both you and I consider that the height of offense

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
We're sister colonies

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
We did the same thing at the same time

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
We're terrible, horrible genocidal maniacs

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
That were kicked out of the crown

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
We were banished to a godless land

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I think we left, though

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And no, come on, nobody wanted no Puritans hanging around

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
No, it was...

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm not saying they loved them

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I think they left

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I guess there's a little bit more of a criminal thing

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
With the Australians

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, there was

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
They got over that pretty quick

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Alright, okay

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
That's what she said

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
When our prison colony is shut down

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Or as we would put it in America

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
When there's no more room in hell

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
The dead will walk the earth

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
George Romero

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah, but anyways

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I mean, we're obviously siblings

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Even if you're not from here

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Even if you're not...

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
But these guys have a lot of Chinese action going

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
We got some from Shenzhen right in the second or third row

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, so that's where the phrase

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Fair dinkum comes from

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Fair dinkum, do you know that phrase, Jeff?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Do not

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Fair dinkum

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Ask me if you like my hat, Mike

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Do you like your hat?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
True blue, I do

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Fair dinkum

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Fair dinkum, it's a great hat, Mike

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Alright, alright

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Alright, come on, alright

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Alright, that's it, that's the whole show

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
That's all I have

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I truly spent like an hour trying to...

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
You seem to have assimilated quite well with your hat

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
And your West End shirt

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
West End massive?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't know what this means

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I hope this doesn't make me homophobic or...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm hoping this is...

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I don't know if this is like...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, good

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I'm an advocate, I didn't want to...

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
There was a shirt next to this one

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
In the shop that I got it

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
The shirt said, homosexuals are gay

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And I didn't know if I got that one

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Whose side I was on

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I don't...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't know what that meant

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
But...

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I...

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
That's very...

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's very brave of you, sir

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
He said...

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
He said they are

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Or madam

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
But he shouldn't have said they are

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
He should have said they are

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Rule number five

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Your eyes are oyes

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Your A's are eyes

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Your As are As

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Your G's, G's and R's and G's

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Now Dan came into this bar

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Called the End in the West End

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Which is a covo bar

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Right?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
And so we were there yesterday

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
We met, I think, the owner, right, Nick?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And we had a good old time

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
He's a fan of Rick and Morty

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
And Harmontown, I think

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
And like lots of people

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
That were there that knew the show

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And Dan came in today

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And we said, Dan, you got to get like a hat

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
We thought maybe getting like a cork hat

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Or a slouch hat

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Or like something, you know, like...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Like what do they call the...

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
A Cuba

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
An Acura

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
An Acura

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So Dan bought a brand new Acura Legend

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
A Cordoba?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
A Curb Your Enthusiasm?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
A Cuba Gooding Junior

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
A Cuba Gooding

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
That's actually...

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
That's the state we're going to next

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
A Cuba Gooding

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It goes Queensland

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
We're in Queensland right now

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And then clockwise around Australia

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
You know, it's...

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I wrote it down here somewhere

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I think it's...

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
It goes from here

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
We go to Struth

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
And then Billabong

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
And Flapjacket

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Flapjacket

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
But today Dan walks into the bar

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
We had lost him

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I thought Dan just got lost

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Because he was trying to

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
By breathe right strips

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Because he's been snoring on this trip

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
And we lost him for a while

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
He comes back into the bar

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Wearing this West End massive shirt

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And this strange hat

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
And then the owner comes in

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Wearing West End massive shirt

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
He made that shirt

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
He was wearing that

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Accidentally at the same time

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
It was fantastic

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
It was great

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It was true blue

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
No, it's...

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Fair dinkum

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Fair dinkum

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
But Dan, in that hat

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Because you look a little bit

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Like Hank Williams the third

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah, I'm not really fitting in

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
No, not the third

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Junior, you look like Hank Junior

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I feel like I'm ready

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
For some Australian rules football

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Right now

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
But I've been trying to fit in

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I got the hat

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
And I love flat whites

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Instead of cappuccinos

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
And of course

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Who doesn't love

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Being terrified of poisonous spiders

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I'm fucking terrified

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
God damn it

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
So I heard that

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Apparently this is probably a lie

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't know

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
The government guarantees

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
That if you get poisoned by something

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
You get a free airlift

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
To a hospital or something

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Is that true?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Wait

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
But that's not something

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
That you would do

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
If poisonous things

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Weren't constantly murdering

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Everybody all the time

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Right, it's kind of like

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
If you get bitten by a spider

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
You and a guest spend

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Three days and four nights

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
But wait, doesn't everyone

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Get that deal everywhere?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
I don't know

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Like what if you

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Not in America

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
You gotta pay for that shit

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, yeah

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
But in America

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
They still take you to the hospital

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
They just then bankrupt you

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, no, they'll tell you though

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
They'll land the helicopter

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And say ten thousand dollars

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Right

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And then they'll just fly the fuck away

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
What's the one called

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
A red jacket or the red something?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
The red back

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
The red back

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
It's got a red stripe on its back

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
It's tiny

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And it hides under toilet seats

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
What?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
That's right

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
No, that's the plot to the movie

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Goolies

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
No, you're thinking of the white tail

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Equally poisonous

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Even tinier

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And it hides in your wallet

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
What?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Check your bedding

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Check everything

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I do like

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
My wall has a zipper on

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And that's why I keep the white tails out

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
We're staying at a really nice hotel

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
And I don't know if this is it

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Sometimes, you know

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm not gonna make any premature

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm like, oh, Australia's like this

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Australia's like that

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm not some kind of rube, you know?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm like, oh, this is Brisbane

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
And this is this hotel

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I don't know

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
But I like the hotel

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That we're in

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Everything's very simple

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Like there's no dumb art on the wall

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
That's trying to intimidate you

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Into thinking there's more to life

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Than you understand

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Like it's just a picture

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Of some half lady

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
With a surfboard going through her ear

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Or something

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Or a crushed trumpet

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Or something

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
And it's like, oh man

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I guess this place is pretty cool

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
It's just a blank kind of room

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
It's like, it reminded me of staying in Baraboo, Wisconsin

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
When I was back in the States

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Back then

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
But then I started to realize

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, I bet this is all simple

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
And clean and nice

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Because it's like, they don't want

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
You want to know what the spiders are

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, exactly

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
They want, I bet this is like a thing

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Like it's like, Arizona's like that

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Like everywhere you stay in Arizona

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It's like, clearly like there's no such thing

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
As a shadow

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Or a corner

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Or a scorpion could fucking jump out

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Grab your face

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Lay eggs in your goddamn brain

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
In my bathroom

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I opened up the window

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Like you can kind of lever the window open

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
And there's awesome like jungle birds down here

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
That make crazy like sounds

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
They're human beings, Jeff

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And they're trying to

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
They're trying to make a living

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
And they're called sex workers

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
So I'm fucking one of these birds

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
And I mean

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I like that jungle bird!

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Mike!

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
What's that bird that just goes

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
A what?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
A carawang?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
You're all saying gibberish at the same time

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
So

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
You see these videos of these goddamn kangaroos

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
And by the way

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
They're as fascinated with kangaroos as we are

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Are you talking about Jeff the kangaroo?

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
You're like chess bumps the fucking window door

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
There's these videos where there's just kangaroos

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Will just like

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I guess they wander up to people's

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah, Jeff

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
That's his name

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
There's a famous kangaroo called Jeff

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Well there's this viral kangaroo

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
And I think they call it Jeff

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I thought it was a kangaroo problem

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
It is

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I mean kangaroos are the biggest problem

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Behind horses and camels I believe

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
But they come up

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And they see their reflection or something

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
And they have human arms

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
They're giant rats with human arms

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
They look like werewolves

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
If you didn't know that werewolves weren't real

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You'd be like holy shit

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
That's a man beast

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Don't let the name fool you

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
These are not silly creatures

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
They're not fun at all

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
They have giant scary chimpanzee arms

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
They cool themselves off by licking themselves

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
That's fucking genius

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
They have pockets on the outside of their body

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Instead of uteruses

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
They're fucked up

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
They're like monsters

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Wait, what's Jeff the kangaroo's deal?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
He was hitting this fucking window or some shit

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I think that's the video

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
The video is like this guy

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
He's been through it so many times

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
He's like oh god damn it

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I can't do an Australian accent

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh god damn it

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Get the fuck out of here

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Give me a piece of shit

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Get out of here

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
You fucking

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
You piece of shit

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I don't like your hat mate

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
You're not wearing one

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
But if you did

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
I wouldn't like it

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Oh I forgot

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Everything's a question

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Everything's gotta be a question

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I forgot that part

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm sorry about that

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Everything's a question

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Everything's up at the end

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Everything's a question

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I like that hat mate

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Do I?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Do I? I don't know

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Maybe I don't

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I'm trying

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
While we're on the subject

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Of Jeff the kangaroo

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
We were told by our

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
What do we call Alice

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Our liaison

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Our tour manager

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
What is she?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Tour manager

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
She's a jungle bird

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
You said that not me

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Well she likes it

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Alice you're from where?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Sydney?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
From Sydney

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
She's convinced that there's a term

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That is only here

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Local to Brisbane

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Get Jeffed

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Or Jeff in

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Or like I Jeffed somebody

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Anybody know what that is?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
See nobody knows Alice

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
She tried to convince me for the last two days

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
That that meant finger blasting somebody

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Nobody fucking can bear that out

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
It's like I got Jeff in the parking lot last night

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Right

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Do you think she was

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Do you think that she's sexually harassing you?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Do they have that here?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I don't know

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I hope Jeff the kangaroo gets Jeffed

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Jeff

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Jeff

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Jeff's out there again banging on my glass

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Also

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I was told by other people

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I did not bother to look it up

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Because I was too busy drinking all day

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
That all koalas have chlamydia

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
There we go

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
You hear that Alice?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
That's called confirmed

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
That's the APA style

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
We confirmed that

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
No do they all have it or do most koalas?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Then it takes a lot

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
All koalas have chlamydia

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
All koalas have chlamydia

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Because they ain't slenderia

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I hit that by mistake

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Well they eat the eucalyptus leaves

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
And they have diseases you believe

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
They'll give them to you if you sleep with thieves

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Thieves

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
That's koala justice

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
That's koala justice

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Do 100% of koalas have chlamydia?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
That's a common stereotype

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
98

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
98 might

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
A lot like that

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Can a human being contract chlamydia by handling a koala?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Without a doubt

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Do you say without a doubt or we don't know?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
He might have said past assault

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
You fucking monster people

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
You talk weird

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Are there cases of human beings that have contracted chlamydia by hanging out with koalas?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
We're divided on that one

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
But no one's ever heard of Jeffing being finger-banging

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
No one's ever Jeffed a koala

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And lived to tell about it

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
The night is very young

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Somebody bring me a koala

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm gonna Jeff that fucker

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Fair dinkum

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I Jeffed a koala

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Now I got the chlamydia

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
It's a question

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Do I have anybody?

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
I've crossed the threshold and do offensive

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Do we have anybody who...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
You're not afraid to speak

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
That's the only...

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Someone with a nice speaking voice

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And if you know about Doritos, that helps

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
This guy in the front

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
He probably knows about Doritos

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, come on up if you'd like to

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
What's your name, sir?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Echo

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Echo?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Like, you know, in the Grand Canyon

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
When you throw your shit down there and it echoes

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Alright

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
A very colourful way of describing

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Not reverb

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Echo

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I wrote down these three phrases

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
That I think are very Australian

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Like, would you want to read that top one?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Can you read that?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Last night's episode of Caffe and Kim was Hamo

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Hamo, I made up that word

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, we decided that Dan's...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Because you guys nickname everybody here

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
So we decided that Harmon is Hamo

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
The Brisbane thing is to call everyone Old Mate

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Old Mate?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Old Mate, yeah, if you don't know the name

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Or if you don't care, that's Old Mate

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Old Mate

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
You won't hear that anywhere else, it's just a Brisbane thing

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Old Mate

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Old Mate

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Old Mate

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Old Mate

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh, Old Mate

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh, Apostrophe Mate

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
But is the... Oh, is the apostrophe for LD?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Is it...

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Order!

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I will clear this quonset hut

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
O-L, Apostrophe Mate

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Old Mate

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Thank you, Old Mate

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
It's also the most popular cologne here in Brisbane

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Alright, here's the next phrase

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Don't move, mate, there's a spider on your face

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And it's poisonous as...

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Poisonous as

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
They say something is something as

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And then they just stop talking

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
That's their thing

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
It's like poison as, mate

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Poison as, mate

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
But it's A-Z, not A-S, poison as

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
This taco is poison as, mate

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, rich as, mate

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
And then this is a phrase that Jeff Swears was told to him by our Australian friend

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
Her Vag was Ledge

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I asked a friend who's from Melbourne

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I said, give me a...

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
What's the most Australian thing you could say?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Her Vag was Ledge

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Okay, so, and I found...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
This is seriously...

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I found those I wrote

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
But this is seriously a dialogue I found

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Because I was googling, like, how to do the accent

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And they actually have this dialogue between us

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
And I said, Jeff, you should do this dialogue with me

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And he said, no, bring up somebody

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And it's all vodka flying off my mustache

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Don't be grossed out by it

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
If it hits you, just...

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
It'll kill all the microscopic spiders on your face

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Cool

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
So I think you be...

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Wait

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Oh, you be Adam

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
And I'll be John

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
This is, like, I got this off of, like...

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't know, some website that said...

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I think it's supposed to be, like, quick,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Decentral Australian dialogue

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
So you be Adam and I'll do John, okay

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
G'day, mate

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
How are you going?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
How was your weekend?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
G'day

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
My weekend was heaps good

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I went to the beach

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
And had a barbecue with my mates

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
It was a truly weekend

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Chublew weekend

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Sounds great

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
How was the beach?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
The beach...

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Was fully sick

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Fair dinkum

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I caught five waves

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And then took a break

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
But creaky, I was nearly bit by a shark

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Struth, mate, you okay?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Wish I had a come with you, but I'm glad you didn't get it

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I'm afraid of sharks

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Chublew, next time, see you later

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Bye, mate

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Bye

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Who was Adam and who was John in that one?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
He was Adam

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Hey, Adam

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah, mate

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Did your friend John have a stroke?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Is he okay?

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
I think his friend John is a...

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Shit, I forgot the name of the things that fight Dr. Who

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
A dollar

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
A dollar

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Extrema, mate

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I like your hat, mate

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
A dollar

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I like your hat, mate

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Extrema, mate

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
When you've been in the sun too long, you kind of start talking like that

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But that's when you've been out for a while

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
We noticed that everyone over 45 dresses like how I'm dressed

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Like that's why...

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
All the young people are like normal earthlings

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Jeff's theory was that when you turn 45

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
You take your driver's license and they just give you an outfit

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
Because everyone's just walking around dressed like an Australian action figure

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
It's like Logan's run rules, you hit sanctuary and you have to put on the hat

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I like that carousel, mate

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
Echo, are you a local Brisbaneite?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I have been for a few months, I just got back from America actually

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I was in Ohio, Florida, Texas and California

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
All the good places

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
I just missed the winter which was kind of disappointing

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
And I understand we have to be careful when we talk about politics here

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Because you have liberals with a capital L

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
But their liberals are Nazis

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
I'd like to say we're not doing as bad as you guys are right now

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
But that's...

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
It's not really the case anymore

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
Oh really? What is going on here in your best description?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
You can tap out, you didn't sign on for this right

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
If it's controversial and they're going to start booing or something

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
I don't think they'll start booing, I think you can just sort of point at any of them

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
And just sort of say, you know, this one is shit

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
And like half of them will go yeah

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
All you really got to drag on is like Pauline Hanson

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Pauline Hanson is your number one target

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
If you want to make friends with him here

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Pauline Hanson

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Is Pauline like a...

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Pauline

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Pauline

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It's Pauline

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Crunchy

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Call Pauline just to piss him off more

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Do some research on him and come up with some nice talking points

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
First of all, he has a girl's name

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Okay

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Alright, I mean I have a girl's name

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Hey Dan, why don't you leave your cisgender bullshit back in the States, man?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
Like Jane, I'd like to represent the entire trans community

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
And everything you say will be monitored

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah, there was graffiti, you saw graffiti that said

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Fuck the system but spelled C-I-S

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Yeah

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Yeah, fuck that system

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Bigger fish now, man, there's fucking Nazis in the White House

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I can't even, I gotta tell my trans friends

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I'll be back in a second

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Nazis, Nazis in the White House

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Alright, anyways, sorry

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
You're saying that your trans friends have to rely on you to get Nazis out of the White House?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
They have to go cool it for a while?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I may stumble over a pronoun here and there

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I'm terrified for my life, I'm just like

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
The election happened and on the night before it, it was like

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm almost perfect in the way that I think and talk

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
And then it was like this fucking monster happened

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
And then I was like, I need a musket and I need fresh water

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
It really is, I mean, I'm assuming most of you are from here

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
But waking up as a citizen of the United States

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Every day is like we're living in a fucking nightmare

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
It's absolutely insane

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
It's pretty historical stuff, it feels

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Dan and I both voted for Trump, but we didn't know what we were doing

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
We thought it was a lark

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
It was a protest vote

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
We just wanted Hillary to know she couldn't take us for granted

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
We didn't know she was gonna lose

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
We were playing hard to get

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It's all they respect

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
You gotta take that red pill

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
So you guys, so you're liberals with a capital L

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
But do you use the word liberal with a small L to mean

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Like the opposite of what your liberals are?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah, no, definitely

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
That must get so confusing

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
But I guess we have Democrats and it's like

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Oh, those are your guys in favor of voting, like what?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
And then the Republicans and it's like

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, yeah, they love republics

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
What the fuck is a republic?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I don't know

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
But then your liberals are labor, right?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Labor are liberals

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
And then our labor, we don't have anybody that calls themselves labor

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That's offensive to all of our labor

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
They're like, I don't labor

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm gonna be rich one day

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I'm gonna scratch off away

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
I always got confused by the labor name as a kid as well

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
It was just like, what?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
This is so confusing

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Just pick one

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And then you have Tories and Poison Spiders

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Well, Tories

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Four party system

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, poison

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm all for the poison spiders

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
And the poison spiders are in favor of healthcare

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
In the form of helicopters that come and take you

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
To the poison centers

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
But only so they can bite you again

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Is what I'm told

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
We'll see the thing is, we didn't need a talking car

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
To broker the deal between the spiders and the piece

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
The government

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
They were already in our ice cream anyway

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
That's a reference to my hit show, Rick and Morty

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
It's a hit, it's a transcontinental hit

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
The problem with spiders running healthcare is that

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
When you go and you're at the hospital

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And you're reaching into your wallet for your insurance card

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
There's a fucking spider in your wallet

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
And they fucking get you coming there

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
There's spiders everywhere

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
And what we're told is the bigger they are

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Or the bigger they are

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
That was good

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
That actually sounded pretty good

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
The bigger they are

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
No, no, no, you're pushing too hard

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
The less poisonous they are

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Yeah, you gotta, just to remind

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
You gotta talk out of your nose a bit more

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
If you really want to get that Australian thing

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
You gotta put your upper lip up into the nose bridge

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
So it's sort of coming out of that end

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah, like that

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Like that

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
But yeah, so there's tiny, itty-bitty little spiders

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Oh, they'll kill you more

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And they can just kill you

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Has anybody here in the audience tonight

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Ever died from a spider bite?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
There hasn't been a spider bite yet in 30 years

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
But that's a misnomer, right?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Because you don't die from the bite

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
You die because your throat swells up

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
And you suffocate, right?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Nobody's died, somebody posits from the audience

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
That nobody has died from a spider bite in 30 years

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Yeah, in Australia or just on Earth?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Australia, okay

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
But Spencer's suggesting that it's like in the wire

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
When you're just calling the death a different thing

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Like when they go like, oh, we don't have a drug problem

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
This is a, this was a

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
It's like you don't die from the car crash

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
You die from the strangulation on the state bill

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
So there's probably like a million spider deaths a week here

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
But your flesh starts to die

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And your finger falls off and shit, right?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Depends which one bites you

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Your friend lost his big toe

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That sounds like necritus

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It sounds like his toe necrotized

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I know all about poison spiders

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Who here has a personal...

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Has anybody here lost a limb?

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
Well, alright, just, no, just any personal, horrifying spider story

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
It could be a...

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Right, right in the front row

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Is it going to be your friend that lost his toe?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Because we don't want to hear about that shit

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
That's just second hand, that's an urban legend

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
I want somebody who has had a spider on their face

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Wait, we got a good one in the back row or something?

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Well, we know as he's shouting back row

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
He's a liberal

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
You sir in the tie?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Oh shit, lucky

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Have you got a personal spider story?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Get the fuck up here

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Alright

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Personal spider stories

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
Personal spider stories

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Awkawala's hepimedia

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Awkawala's hepimedia

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
Personal spider stories

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
From the land, so the Antipodes

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
It's a...

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
It's a nankawala, sorry

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Hello, what's your name?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Josh

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Josh, hello Josh, welcome to the stage

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Thank you, thank you, it's good to be here

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I like that hat, mate

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I like your hat too, mate

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Thank you

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
True blue

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Hanky dinkum

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Alright, so spider stories

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Lay it on us, Josh

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Spider story, I used to live out...

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
And you went Ipswich

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Ipswich

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Alright, it's not that bad, alright

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
It's just the people

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And...

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
And...

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Oy-ey

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Oy-ey

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Jesus

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
This guy's just being hazed for saying where he's from

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
Are the Ipswichians inferior to them?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
And if so...

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
Well then why bully him?

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Just feel sorry for him if you really believe that

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I think you protest too much

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
I think the Ipswichians may be superior

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Or you wouldn't be so defensive

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
Yeah, I've been here five minutes

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And I know lies

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Anybody else here from Ipswich by applause?

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Why, Josh, I'll let you answer

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
Why does the whole crowd bristle at the name Ipswich?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
I have to be very careful

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Because my grandmother still lives in Ipswich

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
She doesn't listen to this

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah, true

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
It's just a little...

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Yeah, Paulin Hansen is...

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh, Paulin Hansen

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
It's a little bit backwards

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
She's from Ipswich

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
It's a throwback

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
And now she's trying to force her fucked up Ipswich views

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
On the entire continent

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
From Billabong to Struthnick

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
So it's just...

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, it's not great

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
But do you live here now or no?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I live in Brisbane, yeah

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Alright, so you've moved?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I've moved

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
You've gotten out of Ipswich

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Are you embarrassed to be from there?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Are you proud of your Ipswich heritage?

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
It's a really great talking point at a party

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
But not here, because you're gonna...

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Not here

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
You're gonna get your ass handed to you

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
I'm sorry after the show

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
These folks do not like that hat, mate

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
That hat ain't good, mate

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Alright, so lay your spider story on us

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
It is a spider story

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
It's not a poisonous spider

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
But it's a huntsman

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
It's alright, it's okay

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
It's alright

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
It can be a giant, scary, not poisonous spider story

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Maybe this is a scarier story

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Than just your friend's toe falling off

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I am...

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
So, living in Ipswich

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Hey, everybody, call the fuck out

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
There will be walkabouts enforced

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
You will be sent...

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
That's like a timeout, right?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Exactly

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
You will be sent on walkabout

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
If you don't...

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Oh, shit

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
If you don't cool it

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
The crowd is about to mutiny, I have no idea

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
You have a lot of events in there

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
Well, these are things you can think about on walkabout

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Alright, Josh

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Josh, you have the conch right now

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Lay it down

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
So, we had a pool

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
And I wore Dick Tox

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Dick...

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
DT's

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Budgie Smugglers

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Dick, wait, Dick Tox?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Budgie Smugglers

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Speedo

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Speedo

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Dick Tox?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Dick Tox

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Dick Tox

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Dick Tox

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
You know Dick Tox

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Banana hammock

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
You know, a fucking...

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
A banana hammock

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
A budgie smuggler

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
A marble bag

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
A Cleveland reach around

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
A...

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
A...

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
A...

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
A...

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
A...

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
I don't want Pauline Hansen down there

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Alright, so you're wearing your little snuggles

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
No, I'm not wearing one though

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
You're not wearing them

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
I'm about to wear them

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
You're about to...

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Oh, dear

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
I've taken them off the clothesline

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
And I've put them on

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
And right about here

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
I felt a very intense pain

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Because a huntsman spider has freaked out

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
And bitten between my arse

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And my testicles

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Which is...

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
The taint

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
I say taint

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
It's a taint

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
It's a taint

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
That's worldwide, baby

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
So you...

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
So as it stands

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
You have your...

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Your...

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Your balltogs

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
What do you call them?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Dick Tox

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Dick Tox on

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
A huntsman spider has latched onto your taint

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Yes

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
What sort...

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Can you describe the sensation of that?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Like, can you put the...

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
I was about nine at the time

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
And I remember screaming in intense pain

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
And then for the next hour and a half

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
My mum had to hold the cold back to my area

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You couldn't hold it yourself?

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
Well, I was nine and I was very scared

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Was the...

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Was the huntsman destroyed by the pudding

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
On of the dick tongs?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I thought it ran away

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
And then proceeded to be horrified

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
It might come back

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
But my dad said he killed it

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Oh, he was...

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
He lied

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I think he was blatantly lying to me

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I saw a video on the internet

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Was that a huntsman that was like

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Crawling up the side of a fridge with a mouse in its mouth?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
They're about...

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
They're massive

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
So they're huge

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Wait, wait, yeah

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Bigger than a...

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
They can...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
The size of a grown man's hand

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah, the grown man's hand

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
More like your hand

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Not mine

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
You're putting on your dick tongs

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
And you don't see a fucking hubcap place there

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I was excited

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
You couldn't wait to...

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I was gonna get in the pool

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Play some Maca Apollo

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
As far as...

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
As far as that spider was concerned

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Oh, look, a lovely little hammock for me to ride

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I said, oh shit, a guy's gonna sit on me

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
What is he doing in there?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Did he think flies would be in there?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Were there flies in there?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
I don't know

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Probably

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
You had sticky balls when you were nine

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Ah, shit

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Ah, hip switch sucks

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
You're just going for the easier pull

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
I'm sorry

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
So you and your mother are having an intimate encounter

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Where she's holding an ice pack to your balls

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Tane

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The end?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
All's well that ends well

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
It didn't necrotize

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Well, I didn't go on...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I now don't swim anymore in pools

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
So I don't know if that's a...

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
So that's put you off swimming at all, like forever

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Well, I still swim

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh, but not in pools

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Not really in pools

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
You could just...

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Why do you blame the pool?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
That's such a weird connection to make

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Well, there's less pools than there are spiders

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
So I just, you know...

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
What about the shorts?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Where do you...

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Hedge my bets

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Like the shorts are what you should associate with the...

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Right

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
The dick toss

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I'm going to not...

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
I'm not going to...

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I'm not going to trauma-splain to you

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Sorry

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
You can experience trauma however you want

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
And cope with it

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But I think pools didn't really do anything in this story

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
If anything, if you had jumped into the pool

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Soon enough, the spider would have drowned

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Yeah, that's true

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I don't know why

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I've told the story on the Hammer Time before

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
When a spider fell into my ear one night

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
And I thought there was a marching band inside my brain

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I found out that what you do is you just pour alcohol in there

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
And get it fucked up and it falls asleep

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
Instead, I just kept hitting myself in the head like a moron

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
And then at one point I just wanted to jab a pencil into my ear

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
And just kill myself so that the noise would stop

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Yeah, no

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
And so now, I mean, I'm a live and let live sort of fellow

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
But if I see a spider, sorry fellow

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
But they kill all the flies

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Yeah, but fuck them, flies don't go into my ear at night

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I had three nights in a row where each night

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I was woken to a spider on my face

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
What?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
No joke, each night, I caught the first one

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
It was crawling up and I was like, not gone

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Second night, I woke up, it was on the face

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Third night, it was trying to get on my mouth

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
That's when I pulled the bed apart

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And threw the bug bomb around the room

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Jesus Christ, I got to get out of here

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
This is fucking it, this is my worst nightmare

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Don't move

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
It's not even funny

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Move, Dan

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
You just, you get some long grass and you walk out behind them

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
And you tickle them all night

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
Hey, did you guys know, you guys know the typewriter was invented here?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
But Wi-Fi was, Wi-Fi was invented here, I'm told

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Is that true?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I don't know

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Nobody here agrees on shit, you guys, it's so divided

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
It's a big continent and there's a lot of them

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
They're probably all, these are the first time they've seen each other

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
There's probably different factions and things

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Every street is a boundary

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Every postcode has another crew in it

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I read about the boundary streets

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
The, the, the, so, so, so, okay

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
I mean, are all crowds here this fucking awesomely loud and

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Fucking night

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
It's Australia, everyone

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
I love it, I fucking love it

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
We're all going out to a bar after this, right?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
We're all going to go

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Alright, so

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
I sat in one bar since 9 a.m. until like fucking 5

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
That's the best

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah, we got, but their bars don't open until 10

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
It was, that was, they don't serve until 10

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
I had a coffee and an avocado mash and then I drank myself

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Smashed avocado

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Smash, smash

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Alright, I forgot both your names

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Josh and Echo

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Josh and Echo

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
You forgot Echo?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Yeah

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
The guy who describes himself as what the sound makes when you throw shit down the Grand Canyon

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Well, let's have a hand for Josh and Echo

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Josh and Echo

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Josh and Echo

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Josh and Echo, you can catch their new animated children's cartoon on Nick and Knight

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
These ventures of Josh and Echo

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Spencer, how's your, how's your Australia been?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Oh, fine

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
I mean, I don't know

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Anytime we travel, I'm like, what am I supposed to say, that I hate it?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Like, it's not going to go over well

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Well, you could probably, they'd probably be willing

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Let's just talk about all the other places I went that I hated

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Canada, fuck it

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
You don't like Canada?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
New York City, forget about it

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Florida, drown that entire state

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
I agree with that one

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Like, just fuck all of it

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
No, Australia's fine, I don't know, I don't want to get all into it

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
I feel like all this material is just like hack at this point, right? I don't know

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
The O sound weird, you've been doing all this accent shit

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
I still don't know how to say a fucking O in Australian

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
As far as I can tell, it's like an A-R-O sound

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Like, like narrow, kind of, except like narrow

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
But I can't do it, that's the problem

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't know, what else? Also just, I mean, you've already, this is well-tron-ground

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
Even on this show, but just the fucking bugs

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
I mean, there's a lot of things, there's a lot of animals that can kill you anywhere you go

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
You can get stepped on by an elephant, you can get murdered by a lion

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
But those are beasts, right?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
These are beasts, fearsome creatures

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
But in Australia, there's literally monsters

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
Like, I don't, there's things that'll kill you in all the places

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Like polar bears, holy shit

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
But that's not a monster, that's a beast

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
Like, if you have to use weapons to kill an insect, that's a fucking monster

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
Like, that's in an RPG

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
Giant monstrous insects that you have to kill with weapons

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Are like the lowest level monster that exists

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
I'm sure there's probably fucking slime blobs here too, right?

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
You already talking about Pauline Henson?

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
I'm killing, I'm killing!

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
I'm Australia's favorite comedian

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I know nothing about anything

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
Alright, Spencer, you're walking down the streets of Australia

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
And you see a beast

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It's just a spider, it's a spider

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
They're very common, they're terrifying the common

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
Alright, that was it, I thought it was going to be more mythological than that

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Well, you gotta give me more than that, you see a creature? What the fuck?

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Alright, I, I, I, I

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
This guy just said rock and roll, assumedly

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
They're excited, it's a big night out

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
No, they're excited, that much is clear

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
What do you want, Spencer? Do you want the name of a creature?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't know, whatever you guys want

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
This is the excitement I was alluding to

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
I feel like I heard the word wombat, strumpet

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Oh, drop bear, they're talking about drop bears

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Drop bears

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
Yeah, are there any drop bears in the house?

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Yeah!

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Alright

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
You hear a strange whistling sound from above

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
You look up in a brown blur, you're crushed

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
It's a drop bear, right? I don't know what a drop bear is

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I mean, I don't care what a drop bear is

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I just don't know

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Drop bear?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Drop bear, yeah

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
Oh, a koala is a drop bear? Do they like fall on your cars and stuff here?

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
Oh, a fucking drop bear ruined my windshield, Mike?

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
They're like coconuts in Los Angeles, koalas

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
They'll just fall on your car and you'll get chlamydia all over your windshield

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
An insurance won't cover them, because they're fucking liberals

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
Do we have a koala expert, like somebody like a naturalist out there who knows about it

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Are they all suffering from chlamydia?

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Did they drop dead?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
They can't stand it

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
You work with koalas a lot?

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Alright, get up here, we have to talk to you

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
You want to come up and explain?

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
I was going to say I'm not getting a heavy scientist vibe from the crowd

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
But I guess we have a zoologist here

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
Alright, approaching the stage is a man who has handled koalas

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
What's your name, sir?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Darcy?

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Alright

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Darcy?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Darcy

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Oh, Darcy

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
It's a hot day

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I'm Hamo

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Darcy, alright, so you work with what zoo?

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Teronga Zoo

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Teronga

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Yeah, it's in Sydney

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
I like that zoo, mate

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Yeah, it's a good zoo, mate

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Okay, that's good, you did it up at the end

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
But you could use a little work on the s at the e

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I'll work on it

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
Repeat a bit, Kath in Kim was a masterpiece

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Kath in Kim was a masterpiece

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Masterpiece?

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Masterpiece?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Up at the end?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Alright, so...

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
What the fuck is happening?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I'm coaching, I'm doing dialogue coaching

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
You're doing great, Dan

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I'm learning how to be Australian

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
You just give my ears chlamydia

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Alright, so what are we...

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
I got it from the koalas

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Alright, so what's the deal with koala chlamydia?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah, go

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I mean, that's not the most interesting thing about koalas

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
What's the most interesting thing about koalas?

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Their primary food source makes them high

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Oh, so does mine

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Which strangely is eucalyptus leaves

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
Kris Boruffuf, our technical director and live director

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
He said that baby koalas have to eat koala shit

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Yeah!

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
We did it!

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Wait, they have to or they like to?

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
No, they have to and they like to

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Is that correct?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
And kangaroos

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
And kangaroos

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
They can't get enough of it

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Well, it's probably because I think elephants and stuff

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
They eat each other's shit too

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Because it's like they digest cellulose maybe

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And there's probably like a lot of plant in their shit

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
And then they just eat it again

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
I mean, maybe

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
It's like the really bad version of like the baby bird

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Getting brought from the mother

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Except you get shafted

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
They said bacteria

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
So there's bacteria from the mother

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
That helps them digest

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Oh, right

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Because they're marsupials

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
Alright, so this might have been kind of a dud

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
Wait, do you know anything about Doritos?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I have all these Dorito issues

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
What's the Dorito issue?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Could you explain the difference between the yellow bag and the orange bag?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Yes, because one says nacho cheese

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
But the other says cheese supreme

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
We have different ones

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
I think they might be labeled differently

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
So let's start with cheese supreme

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
So obviously that's the bad

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
That's standard, right?

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
That's the good one?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
No, no, the standard

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
Like the one that they started with was nacho cheese

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Right

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
And then they amped it up with cheese supreme

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Right

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
But what's the difference?

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Because I had a nacho cheese

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
And I would say it sounded like

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Or it tasted like cool ranch

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Or is I think it's called cool american?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Oh, they call it cool ranch here

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
The blue one

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
You've got a whole different color

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
That's how it tasted though

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
It tasted like it, mate

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
That sounded really insulting when I said it

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Listen here, mate

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
You don't be throwing different colors at me

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
We're talking red and yellow

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
You're talking blue

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
I'm talking true blue

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
True blue, Struth?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Okay, so you do have the cool ranch

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
But the nacho cheese just tastes half like cool ranch

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
And half like cheese

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It's actually Mexican

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
I would say that the nacho cheese tasted

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
More like ranch than nacho cheese

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
And the cheese supreme tasted like nacho cheesier

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Is what we call it

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
We don't really have ranch over here

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
So that's a whole new flavor

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
But you have the blue bin

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
We're talking about it

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
We have it

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
It's just that Australians are kind of stupid

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
When it comes to ranch

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
They don't know what it is

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Well, ranch is terrible

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I would never eat ranch willingly

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
The sauce, not the chip

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
And that's why you go cheese supreme, mate

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Right, yeah, nacho cheesier

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
But if it's cheesier

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Then why isn't it more nacho a year?

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
That's what I don't get

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
It's like the cheesier is less nacho-y

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Than the nacho cheese

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Well, I guess that does make sense

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
They had to sacrifice the spicy for the cheese

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Right

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
We got both in America, baby

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
It's a Venn diagram

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
So the more cheese you get

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
The less nacho you have

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Right

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
So ours is the best of both worlds

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
We really win

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Is it true?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Well, in America

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
I don't know if you know this

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
But an adult has to eat cool ranch

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
And then shit in a baby's mouth

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Because there's a bacteria that only Americans have

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
That helps the baby digest the nacho cheese

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
But you guys don't do that here, apparently

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
No, no, we do that with shrimp

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Oh, shit

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Right

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
It's

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Oh, shit

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
It's prawn in Queensland, for God's sake

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Even I know that

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Who was it?

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Darcy?

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Darcy?

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Darcy

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Let's have a hand for Darcy

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Darcy

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Koala Expert

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Koala Expert Darcy

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
All of its Dorino expertise as well

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
I feel like

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
We engineered something

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
We've got a crowd of a particular personality

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
They have a dynamic

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
I'm going to call that personality prison riot

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It's fine, it's fine

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Fuck it

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Please don't kill us

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I think there's a way to use that energy

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Better than like

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
We don't have to do an NPR podcast

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Naked dodgeball

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Naked dodgeball

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
But let's try

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
I'm going to try this

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Just to see if this works

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm going to do a little one man

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Improv

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
And I'm going to

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
When you see me pause

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And go like this

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
That means I'm going to get a suggestion from you

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Okay

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
So

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
I think this will work

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Because you guys like yelling stuff out

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Oh, here I'm going in the door

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Oh, look, it's a

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, this is great

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
It's a thing

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
That's good, that's great

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
A koala pen

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
Oh, look, it's a dildo tire

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I'll just put that on my car

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
So that I can

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
There's a police officer

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Is that a dildo on your tire?

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
Yes, I'm using it to fuck traffic

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So I can drive better

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
On the thing

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Forgive me, understand what I do for a living

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
It's very important I get to work

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
What do you do for a living, sir?

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I'm a peanut allergist

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Alright, on you go

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
There are children's lives on the line

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
Dildo car, dildo car, driving to my work

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
That's a copyright, right?

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
Here I am at the Peanut Allergies Science Research Center

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I better go talk to my boss

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
Hello, I'm reporting for duty

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Are there any emergencies I should know about?

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
This is non-standard procedure for your day to day

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
You have reports and emails to deal with

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
What are you doing?

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I got pulled over by the police

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Oh, right, of course

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
I just want to do my best to try to keep kids from dying of peanut allergies

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
Oh shit, there's a drone strike happening

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Hello?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Hello, can I speak to Dan Harmon?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Is this the police?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Yes

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Okay, here he is

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Sir, we found your car and there's a...

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Goana!

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
There's a goana on it

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Oh no, that's like three bananas

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
In one

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
Yes, sir, you have three bananas in your car

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Well, why is that a...

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
It's being impounded

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
Alright, well, I'll come down to the impound lot right away

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
And since I shouldn't use my now street illegal car

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I'm going to use my...

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
My Yosaharma

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
My...

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
9-11

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
My 9-11

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I'm going to use my 9-11

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
I'll put one fallen tower on each foot

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
And use them as stilts to

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Stride across the down under

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
Oh no, god damn it, I thought for sure I had picked a legal way to drive

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
Sir, are you trying to drive down the street in a culturally insensitive fashion?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Well, I won't tell you I'm on walkabout

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Apparently, that's even worse

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
What are you from Ipswich?

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
Yes, my name is Pauline Henson

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I'm a liberal

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
And I'm riddled with chlamydia

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Right now

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
If you could please, I need to get to the impound lot

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Here, I'll loan you my...

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I heard diktop

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I'll loan you my piss flaps

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
These are heirloom piss flaps

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
These piss flaps were handed down by my great grandmother

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
From her great grandmother

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
From her great great grandmother

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Sir, I appreciate it, thank you for giving me your piss flaps

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I thank you, I will honor and cherish you

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
Use them wisely, but three words of warning

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
Don't use the piss flaps after midnight

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Don't feed the piss flaps

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
And strangely, don't get them wet

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Alright, thank you

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
I'm putting them on

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Ah, fuck, there's a huntsman

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Ah, huntsman tape

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Oh, classic, classic

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Alright, well, we tried using them to yell out things that way

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Yeah, we did it, that was a little improv experiment

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
I thought that worked out pretty nicely

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Good job, you guys did really good

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
You like yelling stuff out

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Maybe we should go meet individuals

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Maybe if they're meeting them as individuals

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Then they're yelling things out

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
You don't think the insane mob rule thing is working right now?

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
I just want them to be, you know, just want to adapt and be happy

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
When you suggested that, I heard someone audibly gasp

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Yeah, because maybe they...

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Alright, well, you got kind of derailed earlier

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
You had a friend who lost their toe

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
And then we went to the back row guy

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Because he yelled out back row, what's your name?

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Hi, I'm Louise

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Louise? Okay, how do you know when you're finished?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Alright, work in the crowd, I'm working the crowd

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Alright

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Ipswitch

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Ipswitch

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
Alright, what's your name, young lady?

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Mel

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Mel?

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
More like, more like, more like Mel

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Alright, well, I'm in the back, Jeff

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Dan, what can you tell us on the back row right now?

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
Oh, everyone's real handsome back here

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
And the audio is just a slight delay

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
So I'm confusing myself by talking

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
You know, when I was like, children's exhibits

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
At a discovery museum where you talk into the phone

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
And it's on a little bit of a delay

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
That's interesting, that's why all the chairs are pointing this way

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
And this is where the stage is

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Oh, you don't think I could do the show from back here?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I'd like to see you try it

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
I dare you, Dan, to go out to that back door

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
Oh, thank you

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
You're getting a drink? What's happening?

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
She gave me a sticker that says, you're awesome

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Wow

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
Dan, walk out one of those back doors

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
And there's a staircase, you can go up into the balcony

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Up there with the balcony people

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Okay

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
You really think this wireless mic's gonna...

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Hey, Jeff, do we got...

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Oh, is it Rio?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
Rio, do we have lights for the balcony or no?

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
Are there house lights up there?

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Oh, there we are

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
Fuck yeah

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Okay

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
I think I'm...

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Can you still hear me, Jeff?

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Yeah, you sound great, Dan

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Okay

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
You're doing great

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I like this staircase, mate

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
This is...

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
Our show has completely gone to its up

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Oh, my God

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Oh, my God

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
There's just a bunch of people up there

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
They're gonna kick my ass

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
They don't even have chairs, most of them

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
They look hungry for human flesh

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
How are you guys enjoying the show?

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Now, everybody just call yourselves collectively

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Now, Dan...

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
The balcony people, they say

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
The balcony people right now

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
What Dan hasn't told you

56:58.000 --> 57:03.000
In one of Dan's pockets is $100 American

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
In another pocket, Huntsman Spider

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Well, no, see, they're not lethal

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
You tried to...

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
Yes, sir

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
You're Australian, you don't say cunt

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
I have to...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
He has to say cunt more

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
I don't know if you can hear me, Jeff

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
But I've just been told I need to say cunt more

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
In order to sound Australia

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Dan, you're a great cunt

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
You should say cunt as much as possible

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
There's some street humor going on up here

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
His friend next to him said I'm not a cunt

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Because I don't taste good or something

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
All right

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
All right

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
All right

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Oh, thank you, sir

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
What's your name?

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Elliot

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Elliot's back here

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Phone home, you know what I'm saying?

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
He gave me a drink

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
That's the 80s reference that nobody knows

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
What do you think, Jeff, if you give me a beat

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Do you think I'll be...

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Even though it's on a delay

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
It might be hard for me to...

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Spencer's got a beat for us

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
We're going to lay a Spencer beat down

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Are you going to do some balcony rapping?

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
What kind of vodka is this?

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
I know that...

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I tried the butter vodka here, the triple six

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
What is this?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
They have butter-flavored vodka

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
What is it?

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
No...

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Okay

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
It's just the well

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Well, vodka

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Dan, you ready for a beat?

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Yeah

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Now, it might be off, but it'll be because...

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
There's a delay

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Oh, yeah

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
It won't be because I'm bad at rapping

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Is that working?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I don't think it's coming through right

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Take the case off

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
There is no case

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Yeah, it's not a block in it

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
There it is

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Yeah

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Elect a hot mate

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Elect a hot mate

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Yeah

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
It's true

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
True blue

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Fair dinkum

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Fuck your mama in the kitchen sinkum

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
Fuck your mama down under

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
Fuck your mama with the lightning and the thunder

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Am I off beat?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I can't tell

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
I'm going to come back down the stairs

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
Elect a hot mate

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
Elect a hot mate

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Elect a hot mate

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Fuck your mama for a pair of roller skites

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
Fuck your mama all the way to Brisbane

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
I fucked your mama and fucked her up once again

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
I fucked your mama

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I fucked her in Sydney

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
I fucked your mama so hard

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Shut down her kidneys

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
I fucked your mama across the outback

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
I fucked your mama and she's a throwback

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
To a time when her beds were burning

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I fucked your mama so hard

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
She stopped learning

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
A disability is what I gave her

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
I fucked your mama in the fur

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Ew

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
That was gross but

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Fucked your mama real good

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Fucked your mama like you should

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Fucked your mama in Australia

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I fucked your mama

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I could live to tell the tale of ya

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Yo

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Fucked your mama in Tasmania

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I fucked your mama in Hulkamania

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Fucked the iron chic

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I fucked your mama every day

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Of the motherfucking week

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Huntsman spider

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Fangs go deep

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I fucked your mama

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I fucked her chic

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I fucked your mama in Queensland

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I fucked your mama in Queensland

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I gotta learn more Australian states

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Before we go to the next one

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
New South Wales

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
South Wales

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Yeah

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Sales

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Jewelry

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Do they have those?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Australian rap

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Australian rap

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Australian

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I like that cat

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Australian rap

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Australian rap

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I got the Aussie stuff

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And the big flapjack

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
The cargo shorts

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And the funny hat

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The clever girl

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The clever girl

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Is that your guys favorite character?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The clever girl guy from Jurassic Park

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Alright Jeff, I'm out of breath

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You know, they say that

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
The water spins a different way down the drain

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
In the northern hemisphere in the southern

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Dan is just as good at rapping down here

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
As he is up there

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
That guy gave me vodka

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
But it's like, I have Top Shelf vodka

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Down on stage, but...

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And then he, yeah

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You okay?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
No, okay, I'm 43

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And I eat bacon every meal

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And I just walked

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
More than I've ever walked in my life

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
My watch was beeping

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
My Apple watch was going like

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
You've met every goal ever

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Now breathe, breathe

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
You have 20 emails

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Jesus Christ, Jeff

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I gotta work out

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I gotta get fucking better

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I gotta get better in shape

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I was just gonna say

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
You get click cookies

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Click cookies?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah, while you're ellipticking

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Yeah

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Anybody cookie collecting?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
In Australia?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Cookie collector too?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Okay, good, all right

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'm gonna fucking die, Jeff

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I'm gonna die on stage in Brisbane, Australia

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It's all right

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It'll be like a special moment for all of us

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The Australian military

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Invented Wi-Fi

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
You're welcome

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Thank you

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Now

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
It was all women?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Yeah, I'm sure there's a woman in front of us

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yeah, a woman did it

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
What did you say there?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
A woman that did it

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Yeah

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Let's all break up into small discussion groups

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
She's gonna explain Wi-Fi to us

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
We're gonna pass our microphones

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
We can all do our own podcasts

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
All right

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I love how communal

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And fucking nuts this place

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
You're at like a weird family dinner

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Where everybody is a sibling

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
That maybe hates the other people

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I think, Jeff

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
We're going to Melbourne tomorrow

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And they hate Sydney and Sydney hates Melbourne

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And everybody hates you guys

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It's all fucking...

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
We haven't heard anybody say they hate Brisbane yet

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Except like...

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
This is our first stop

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
When you had your little hat on

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I wanted to call you what I've heard

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
People call this place

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I want to call you big country

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
It's a big country town

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
That guy's mad that it wasn't an insults

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Ah, okay

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Fuck yourself

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Jeff, I think that

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I have a new, now another experiment

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
To do with the audience

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I love this, this has never been done before

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Now that you've regained your breath

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I think that you and I

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Should do a little scene

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But we should have one of the

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Brisbaneites

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Provide that this has never been done before

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
If they were to provide

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Some form of sound effects

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Using their mouth and the microphone alone

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
While we do an improv scene

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So we do a scene and we make them do the noises

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
That would be required in the scene

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So we collaborate together

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
In a scene

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That is constructed in front of their very eyes

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Alright, how about Madam here

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Who knows about science and knows about stuff

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Would you come up and help us out?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Kate, kite, kite

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I like your kite Mike

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Alright, kite

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Thanks dude

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Okay, so you're gonna

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Jeff and I are gonna do a little scene

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And it's gonna take place in

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
In Australia

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
In Australia

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Alright

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Alright

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
In a brothel

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
In Australian brothel

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Australian brothel

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Okay

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So you're gonna do all the sound effects

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I'm gonna open a door

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Alright

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I'm going to

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Punch

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
A duck

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Perfect

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Kate is on the fucking scene everybody

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
That is the sound that makes when you punch a duck

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Alright, I thought the door opening could use a little

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Okay

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Okay

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Alright, and here we go

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Australian brothel

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Hello

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Good morning sir, good morning

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I was about to ring the little bell on your desk

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
If you'd like to ring the bell, go ahead

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It's actually customary

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
For the customers to ring the bell

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I'm just the footman

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Ding ding

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Steve

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Can I help you? Yes, I would like

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
The services of a prostitute please

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Well, let me

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Go into

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
My computer, let me just start it up

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
The computer's been turned off, I'll start my computer up

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Ding dong ding ding

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Oh, you're using Windows

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
93

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yes, I have an old

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
School modem

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Let me start the internet

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
God, I thought Wi-Fi was invented

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Down here

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I wonder if I have any

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Male

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I have one male

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Would you like a male prostitute

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Or a female prostitute

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I have one male

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
No cisgender, heteronormative

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Binary

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Prejudices for me

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Ah, you would like our potpourri prostitutes

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Give me the grab bag

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I'll take whatever, whoever you recommend

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Alright, I will use my

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Some people go when they go hunting

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
They call it dock or they call it bowl

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
We actually

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Very old fashioned here

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
In our Australian brothel

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I have a prostitute call

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That calls all of our possibly

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Transgendered LGBT

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Who knows what prostitutes

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Let me just blow on that right now

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Oi, get out of here

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Is that

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yeah, bush pig

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Was that

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Was that Paul Hogan

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That's not a prostitute

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I said get out of here

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Oh, oh, oh

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Here, he or she comes right now

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
You can hear the high heels

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Coming down the wooden staircase

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Oh, they fell down

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Sorry, she died

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I'm going to have to call

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I'm going to have to call somebody else

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
With my different prostitute call

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Hey, big tits

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
It's time for you

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Ah, you are very

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Luxor

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
You got big tits

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Big tits

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Come out

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
You can hear her getting ready upstairs

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
She's got the hair down

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
You can hear her getting ready upstairs

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
She's got the hair dryer on

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
She's got the

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
She's also got the shaver

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
She's shaving her private areas

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Oh

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
She's doing it

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
She's doing it dundee style

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
She's very ambidextrous

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I can't wait to be here

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Walk with me, sir

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
We'll walk you upstairs to big tits room

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Let's go up the stairs

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
These stairs are very old

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
They're very haunted

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
by the ghosts of old prostitutes

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Where's that cream

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
for the thrush

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That's a yeast infection

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Did you

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Did you

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It's ghost inside human

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Ah, here we are

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I will leave you to it

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Big tits will be right into service

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I feel like I want to freshen up

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I'll use some of this

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
mouth freshener

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Sir, if you're going to waste

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
our mouth freshener

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
that's going to cost you extra

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Well, here I have a lot

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
of Australian coins here

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
that are worth any number of money

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Thank you sir

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Just ring the bell

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Big tits will be right out

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You'll notice that when

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
the bell rings it has an enchanting sound

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
and I hope you enjoy it

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
because it's the only bell in the house

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
that plays a Lady Gaga song

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
when you ring the bell

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Poke Poke Face

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Poke Poke Face

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Motherfucker

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That's Lady Gaga

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
as far as I

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
didn't know it

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That's about what I would have done

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Alright, well good

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Bye, I can't wait to meet this

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
One more thing

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
before you go in

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I'd like to give you one thing

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
These are my great-great-grandmothers piss flaps

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I want you to have these

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Don't get them wet, don't see them

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Don't use them after midnight

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Oh God

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Okay, that was the piss flaps

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Alright, I think

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I'm supposed to just stand here

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I already rang the bell

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Hello

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Big tits

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Can't you tell?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Hub it up, hub it up

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I can hear them

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
when you fuck

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Yes, two of them

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
just fell off

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
which is why I keep two

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
on the back and reserve

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Whoa

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I've swung them right back in front

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I'm like a shark's teeth

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
they just keep reforming right in front

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Also, I have a transformer

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
in my vagina

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Well, I'm just going to

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
put on my piss flaps

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Oh, yes

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
There's a little bit of foley work in there

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Now, as this is

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
an Australian brothel

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
there is a couple traditions that we

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
do before we start

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
First, I sing

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
in high falsetto

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Waltzing Matilda

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
as I get undressed

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
and all of my clothing

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
is made of metal

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
You're supposed to be singing, I'm just doing the music

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
That's a good point

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Why would you even

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You said you were going to sing

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Listen, I'm glad you came up here

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I've been trying to get out of this brothel for a long time

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
There's only one way out of here

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
My jet pack

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Jesus

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Shit, it just flew off without us

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
We're trapped here

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Fucking

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Ipswich jet packs

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Listen to me

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I'm here to save you

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I've been undercover the whole time

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I have a grappling gun

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I'm from the Australian version of the CIA

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
The AIC?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
ISIS

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
You're from ISIS?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Everything's backwards down here

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
ISIS is the CIA

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Liberals are labor

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Men wear piss flaps

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Gath and Kim was a hit

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
All right

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Grappling gun

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
That's a machine gun sir

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I'm shooting a hole

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
in the ceiling now

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Grappling gun

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Pretend you're not here, that's the door

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Yes

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
What's happening in there?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I'm the footman again

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Nothing, just having a great time with the sacks

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Okay, that's fine

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I'll go back to playing my accordion

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Fucking piece of shit accordion

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
You shot a hole in the window now

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Now, I'm going to use the grappling gun for real

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
When I pull the trigger

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
it's going to make a grappling gun sound

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
and it's going to shoot up

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
and then latch onto the edge of the hole

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
that I made with the machine gun

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and then I'm going to press a button on the side of the gun

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
that's going to winch us both up

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
to the thing

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Can I bring my violin?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yes

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Here we go

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Kate everybody

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Jesus Christ

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
She knows

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I'm pretty sweaty

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Thank you

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I had Kate in my hand and went right into her armpit

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Right up in the armpit

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
They call that a

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Yes, at least it wasn't your pistol

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Thank you Kate

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
What I like about

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
When we leave Brisbane tomorrow

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I'm going to look back on this

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
The one thing I love about this town is everybody is so shy

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Once they came out of their shells

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
we really started having a good time

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
She knows everything about the internet

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
but then she's like Michael Winslow too

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
She's a great

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You know, those don't usually go together

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
She also just took the spoon out of the ice

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
and was making woodpecker

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
She really knew what she was doing

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I travel with Ryan Stiles

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Ryan Stiles is not as funny as Kate

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Kate, what do you do for a living?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
What's your game?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I'm a media officer at a university

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
so I tell good research stories

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
You're a media officer at a university

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
and you tell good

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
research stories

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Kate, sit the fuck down

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I'm kidding, of course Kate

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Did you hear on the interwebs

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
about the Crown of Thorns killing starfish?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Oh, I love this joke

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
The Crown of Thorns

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
The Crown of Thorns style killing one

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
My university built a robot to kill Crown of Thorns

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
because they're eating the Great Barrier Reef

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I got that story out

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
You got it out

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I didn't do the research

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I've seen the time lapse

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
underwater footage of the Crown of Thorns

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You've eaten every goddamn thing up

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You made a

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
You didn't make

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Our roboticists did

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So they built a robot to kill them

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Just a robot that kills all the starfish?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You have a starfish killing robot?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Yes, we do technically

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
but no, we're changing it into

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
from the Cots bot, the Crown of Thorns killing robot

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
to the Ranger bot

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
which will be a multi-purpose multi-function

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
all... see it?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
No, not killing machine

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
It's a monitoring tool

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Fucking amazing

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
You don't think the singularity is going to happen there?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
You have 10 seconds to comply, starfish

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
You modified

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So it killed all the Crown of Thorns starfish

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
and then you're like, well, let's just

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
let's just give it

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
sentience

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
You know what, fucking...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Octopus has been bumming me out for a while

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Let's kill those motherfuckers too

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
They have a brain, we can't do that

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
What does the business end

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
of a starfish killing robot look like?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Are you looking it up right now?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
What?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Are you looking up right now?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I'm looking at my notes

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
That's the show

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
It's a mid-long

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
yellow penis shaped

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
thing with a couple of sidebars

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
and a keel on top

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
That's the only way I can finish

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
That's the only way I can finish

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
That's the only way I can fish

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I hate when the audience is

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
funnier than us

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So you're a starfish

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
killing robot has a big yellowish

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
penis looking thing on it?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
No, no, it is

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It's a phallic kind of meter long tube

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
submarine

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Well, it's got a world's

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
first injection system

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
that's...

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
What's the air pressure one?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
That's the oldest come on I've ever heard of

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Hey, there it is, you want to meet me?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
The oldest injection system?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's a pneumatic injection system

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
and it injects the starfish with bile salts

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Bile salts?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
They get it from an ox, but

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
the starfish don't like it because they don't have

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
that kind of protein in their body, so they melt

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
But does it knock them dead?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah, it melts them in about 24 hours

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
That sounds fucking excretiating

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Isn't there a more humane way to kill this?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
They're fucking starfish

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Who is the Great Barrier Reef?

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
So

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
You work for a corporation

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
that sends out a giant dick

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
that melts starfish

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
It's public money, it's a university

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Good on ya

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
That was very Australian

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Good on ya

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Australian engineering, invented the internet

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
and killer robot

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
starfish dicks

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And written on the side of it, it says, how's the serenity?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
How's the serenity?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
How's the serenity?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
We did our research

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
So much serenity

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
How's the serenity?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
They fucking melt starfish by injecting them with

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
poison

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
You could inject them with anything, really, right?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
If you inject someone with milk, you'd kill them

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I don't know

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
You could just put, like, air

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
You could probably inject them with air

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Fuck them right up

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And I'm not going to

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
but if I stuck a huge robot dick into you

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and just pumped air into you

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
you'd die, I think

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
But I think these starfish, they're more robust

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
They're a more robust enemy

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
They're like barnacles or liberals

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Give me a ballad

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Let's do a song, like, not a rap

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Perfect

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Oh, it doesn't do that

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
What was that?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Thank you, sir

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I like your hair, mate

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Alright, what do you want, Dan?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Just give me, like, you know

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
something that's more emotional

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Okay

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Let's see what we got here

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Are you in an emotional mood right now?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Yeah, I don't know why

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I already did the rap and I almost died of a heart attack

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Right

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I'm still trying to, I don't know if you...

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I'm pouring sweat

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Oh, we are strong up here

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Yeah

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Yeah

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Yeah

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Brisbane

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Yeah

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Oh, boy

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Oh, Brisbane

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I'm gonna fuck you

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
All night long

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
To the bill of bone

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
To the knickknocked oak

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
To the break of dawn

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Oh, Brisbane

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I-S-B-A-N-E

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I assume

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I assume that's how you spell it

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Oh, I like your hotels

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
They have

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
New carpeting

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And the shower

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
The water pressure

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Could be better, but

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
It was still nice

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
A little tiny bar of soap

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And a disposable toothbrush

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
From the airline

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That's probably not to your credit

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
But I used it here

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And had a good time

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
To the break of dawn

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
B-R-I-S-B-A-N-E

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I like your hat, mate

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yo

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Two times

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I told your mama this

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I need my piss guards to take a piss

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I put them on

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Took her to the room

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And I climbed inside her womb

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I became a baby

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
That day

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And got born in a whole new way

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I'm an Australian now

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I see the world clearer

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I fucked your mama like a kangaroo

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
That came nearer than I wanted to

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
When it sees reflections

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
With my Australian erection

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
A Tasmanian day

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
In a true blue way

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Truth

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I fucked your mama

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
True blue, fair dinkum

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Alright

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
When did this become a rap?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
You said you were feeling emotional

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Yeah, yeah, sorry

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Yo, yo

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Everywhere I go

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I see the ocean

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Because Australia is a big giant island

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
If you walk very far

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
In any direction

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
You'll see a bunch of water

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That's all I know about Australia

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I imagine surfing

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Is very popular here

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I think I've seen that in movies

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
They like to surf

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
But

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Here's the thing

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
The track ran out

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I was about to get to the 9-11 part

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Alright

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Let's bring it down a notch

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
From a dead stop?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
We've had some fun

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I want to know who in the audience

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Has had a real difficult time

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
We want to help somebody

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
The whole

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Well, then if it's everyone

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Then who's had the worst time ever

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And I don't mean like want your money back

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
We'll talk to you after the show

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
If that's the case

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
You've been a good sport

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And I see that you are

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Using a chair

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Instead of a regular chair

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Is that part of your difficult time?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
But you're about to get out of it

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
So already there's a triumph here

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
You look like you're

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Okay, well, miracles

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Okay, do you need help

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Coming up here?

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Because God knows I did

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
What's your name?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Louise

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Louise, welcome to the stage

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
A hand for Louise

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I don't think I've ever seen that kind of

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
It's a chair with wheels

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
But it's not a classic wheelchair

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:33.000
It's kind of a casual wheelchair

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
All right, Louise

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Do you need help?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The closer you

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
It's a great song

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
It's so good

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Was that Jean Wilkinson?

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
He's married, do you mind?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
No, she loves it

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Is that him in there in the front?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
He is, yes

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
The cane handler?

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Do you love him?

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
How long have you guys been married?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
We've been together 16 years

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And we've been married for

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
8 years

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
16 years

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I haven't done anything for 16 years

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I can't sit down on a regular chair

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
It'll be all right for a bit

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
You can stand

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I'm going to sit

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
If that's okay

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It's all right

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Can I ask

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
You're sitting in a chair

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
That has wheels on it

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
It's a wheelie walker

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
A wheelchair and a walker

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
At the same time

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
You can get up out of it and use it as a walker

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Yes

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Why do you need it?

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I actually have what you have

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
It's much, much worse

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Alcoholism?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
No

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
That's the one thing

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Body odor?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It's like

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
It's like an advanced form of back pain

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Oh

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
How do you know about my back pain?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It's not a huge fucking fan

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
It's like

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I'm like a sanctioned stalker

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I'm a sanctioned stalker

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Is it like a degenerative

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Spinal thing?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I had a bicycle accident

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
When I was six

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I smashed my two front teeth

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
It impacted my spine

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
But they didn't know

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I'm three months older than you Dan

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Believe it or not

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
So it's a while ago

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
True blue

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Did you know the invented weird reactions here?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Jeff?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
That was weird

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Can I hit pause?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I didn't know

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
You said you're three months older and things got weird

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I don't know what that was about either

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
What was that one about?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
A stalky vibe?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Oh, how dare you

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Self-confessed stalker

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
I've been a shut in

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
for about

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
18 months

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
So Harmontown's been a big part

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
of keeping me sane

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Yeah

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Permission to stalk, granted

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
You've been sanctioned

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Yes, thank you

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
So yeah, I had this accident when I was a kid

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
and then I didn't realize

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
that I was having problems for a long time

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and then I got a series of

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
like kind of clusterfucks

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
over a period and then I had a really

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
bad stressful time

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
at a job that I can't talk about

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
for legal purposes, got really depressed

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Do you work for the Starfishfucking robot?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
For ISIS

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
For legal reasons

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I can't tell you if I worked for Starfishfuckers

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Yeah

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But that was my friend

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
So I

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Yeah, I went

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
things kind of spiraled downhill

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and then more stuff happened

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
and then I went overseas

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and four days into my trip away by myself

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I bent over and my back

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
kind of went

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
and then I've had

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
So then I came home

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Brad had to fly over to meet me

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
to take me home

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
and

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I was trapped, so I've had periods of time

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
where I've had like episodes

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
So I've trapped in a bed for like three weeks at a time

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
where I can't even get up to go to the toilet

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Brad's had to do everything for me

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Yeah

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
So like I'd make up

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
stupid songs like when I was able to get

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
on the walker again

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I'd sing like to get through the pain

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I'd sing songs like it's great, not to poop

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
in a tray, hooray, hooray, hooray

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So that's kind of where

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
that's where I've been at

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
So you've been having a hard time

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I mean it's like your back's all fucked up

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and you've been having a real, real bad

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I'm officially disabled now

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I just got the disability

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Is it permanent? Yeah

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Now it's permanent

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Well let's let the applause for the

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Go ahead

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
It's fucking hard to get the pension

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I can't get a read of this

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
audience at all

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I think they're

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I was reading in the accent guide

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
It's like something to do, it's like

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
there's a silly, you have to be silly

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and playful in tone, they're silly, playful people

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
They're not rowdy, they're not going to kill us

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
or anything

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You keep believing that, Dan, I am

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I am here to kill you, Dan

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I was up in the balcony, man

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
They inject starfish with poison here

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
A robo dick

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
They seem like good people

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
at heart

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Everyone's good

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
at heart

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
So now you get

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
whip-ass parking now, right?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Is that a thing in Australia?

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
It's only literally been two days since I

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
after 18 months of battling with the government

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
that we finally got the pension

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
But it's like, I just don't leave the house

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Basically this is like a huge fucking deal

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
for me to come out, I haven't come out

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
and I'm actually going to Sydney

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I already bought my tickets for Sydney

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
You're going to be in Sydney too?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And then my friends were over

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
the other night, they were like, do you realize they're playing

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
in Brisbane? I'm like, what the fuck?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
So, yeah, I bought tickets

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
to come tonight, so I'm going to be

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
um, yeah, I was

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I was like, yeah, so hardcore, I was like

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
oh, I'm missing out on Melbourne, but that's just great

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It's amazing, I...

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
The Melbourne show's going to suck

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
No, it's going to be the best

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Sorry guys, but the Melbourne show will be

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
the best, I reckon

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Alright, now

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I'm officially in love with Brisbane

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It's so funny, because it sounds

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
like a fight's about to break out, but everyone's just having

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
like a good fucking, a good laugh

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
at everybody else's expense

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
That's right, fucking you

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
too, honey

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Is that what it is?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
No one really takes anything

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
that seriously here

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I think it's kind of like

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
if James Franco was a city

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
That's how I've been feeling about it

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
It's so weird though, it's like walking on the street

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
for the last two days, walking on the street, it's eerily quiet

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
It's very peaceful

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
There's not loud Americans, except for us

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
We were in bars and restaurants

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
and clearly we're the loud people there

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
but it's just very placid and nice

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
and people like having a good time

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
but in here, it's just fucking madness, it's great

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Well, let's give Louise a wish

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
aside from coming to this amazing show

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
And seeing my friend Kate kick ass on stage

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
That is so fucking cool

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Oh yeah, fucking Kate on sound effects, holy shit

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
That will not soon be forgotten

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
But also, is it Brad?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Yeah, Brad, yep, my husband

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I think MVP award goes to Brad

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
for cleaning up your poop forever

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
He is a god

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
You should worship him

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
He's a king amongst nerds

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I'm moving to Brisbane, I fucking love it here

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
He's also like a total renaissance nerd

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
He's been creating independent comics

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
for like 20 years

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
It's kind of awesome

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
So yeah, what does that do

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
to a relationship?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I live in terror of that becoming infirm

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and how I'll become

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
like an asshole because I'm a baby

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Oh, you will be a fucking asshole

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I was a complete cunt

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I was not gracious at all

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I was saying like

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
why don't you leave me

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and take me out

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
and shoot me like a fucking dog

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
because I was just in so much pain

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
So what gets you across the threshold

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
other than maybe painkillers

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Is there an epiphany you had

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
that you can impart to me for when I

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
get a foot ache and don't destroy my life?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Herbal medicine

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
rather than don't go down the traditional route

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
like I did, I had surgery and stuff

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I don't know

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
What traditional medicine?

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Like Chinese herbal medicine

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You could hit me up

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
There are now booing Chinese medicine

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
A lot of people would

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
This stuff

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
things like turmeric

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
has been well researched

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
for its anti-inflammatory properties

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So I definitely recommend you take turmeric

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
That's not even Eastern medicine

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
That's just nutrition science

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
But are you saying

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
you said don't go down the path

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I went down

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
If I wasn't wearing onesie

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I'd show you my tramp stamp scar

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
from the surgery I had

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
and um

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Do you want to see it

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Would you wish me to see my meundies?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Yeah sure

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Oh shit

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Oh they're very nice

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
They're little donuts

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And there's a hole right in the asshole

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Dan this is like a dream come true

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Thank you, that's what I was hoping

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I didn't want it to seem forced

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I can see a little peepee poking out of your thing

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
What do you mean what?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Your dick was coming out of the thing

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I think that was a doughnut

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
My dick was out?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Probably so

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
There would be like police

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
You can get

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
all laws are off in this building right now

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Given the impression that

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
the pain is one directional

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
that you have a spot that causes the pain

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
and sends the message to your brain

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
but pain is more like

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
an ant colony coming to your house

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
when a storm comes

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
and they just all flood in

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Is that how ants work?

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Yeah they come in the rain

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I was trying to think of metaphors

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
to explain it because you almost need

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
any medical degree to understand my condition

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
but it's a central nervous system

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
pain condition that can be triggered by

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
anyway

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I don't understand what their stance is

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
or what they're doing

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
I don't know if they want you to be in more pain

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
or less pain

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I feel like this is the scene

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
in Mutiny and the Bounty

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
when they try to kill Captain Blyre

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I think what happens

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I think what I've realized has happened

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
in my shut in days

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
people have become really like

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
associate herbal medicine

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
or anything kind of like outside

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
of the mainstream medicine sphere

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
like you're either like a flat earth

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
or an anti-vaxxer

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
so I think that their reaction might be

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
is that they're encoding what I'm saying

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
as somebody who has a

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
yeah that's it

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
oh it's probably an action like

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
she's made out of turmeric

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
what can I say

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I love racist wrangers

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
that's why I like Donald Trump so much

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
yeah I don't think she's one of the bad guys

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
regardless of how she's treating her pain

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
if you really are that concerned with her

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
and want to give her painkillers after the show

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
well I'm actually lucky

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I said to my GP

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I'm lucky that I'm a constipated pod head

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
because otherwise I'd probably be dead

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
because I was able to access that

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
instead of the opioids which probably would have killed me

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I think we have the name of our episode

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
yeah constipated pod head

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
but I couldn't take the opioid medication

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
because it'd make me sit down for too long

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
in the toilet

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
let's hear it for Louise everybody

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Jesus Christ

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
well okay

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
let's

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Louise

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I mean we started talking about poop in the night

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I had to pull the trigger on that

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
as a fan of the show

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
yeah we'll send her on her way but as a fan of the show

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
is there anything that

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
would you think that we would be able to grant you

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
as a wish like something you'd like to see

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
your shoulder underwear

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
that was my wish

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
it's a joke, it's a joke, continue

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
do you mean

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
generally or tonight?

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I think I'm out of show

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
like 20 minutes ago

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
yeah I would really

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I would also like you to take care of yourself

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
because I think that you're like

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
yeah I'd really

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I'd really like to see you

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
and if you want any advice you can hit me up

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
but yeah

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I'd really love to see you take more self-care

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
because I think you have a beautiful mind

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
and I would like to see that

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
in the world for as long as possible

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
alright

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
thank you Louise

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
and poop, more poop

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
more poop

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
not gonna happen

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
not gonna happen

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
that ship has sailed

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
thank you Louise

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I really thought she'd say

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
you know could you do a reggae song

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
or something

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
then she hit me with the old

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
take care of yourself

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
my therapist keeps saying that

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
self-care, self-care

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
well what like should I drink less

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
like

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
yeah see I don't know who to listen to

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
you can't ask this audience

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I guess they're no question

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
it's really

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I don't drink that, it's only when I'm with you guys

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
that I'm drinking

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Dan only drinks when he's alone or with people

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I do

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I do feel like I'm kind of getting kind of shatnery

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
when I look in the mirror like I'm starting to pickle

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
and bloat you know

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
you're looking like a little bit of a

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
like a heavy set George Carlin right now

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
with the hair slicked back

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
yeah

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
steeper when, yeah

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
a stingray is about to come up and stab you

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
oh fuck off

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
that's your threshold

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Steve Irwin

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
he's a national hero

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I know but I didn't bring it up

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
this fucking guy did

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
he got

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
he used to hang out with crocodiles

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
he got killed by a fish

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
also you don't really look like

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Steve Irwin I don't even get that

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
well they just like saying stuff

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
yeah no I can tell

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
they're excited

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I can tell

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
they're a jocular people

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
the brisbaneites

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
brisbanians

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
what's that, ficus?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
you just yelling out plants

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
brisbagus

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
he said brisbagus

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
brisbagus

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
like a portmanteau

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
oh brisbin

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
the city that sleeps

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
at least until 10am

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
brisban on a thursday night

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
shit is on the hook

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
the thing is there's only 300 people here

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
cause we're the only game in town right now

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
it's not like springsteen's rolling through here later on

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
what should we do Jeff

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
we got like 15 left

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I think we

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
we fuck gently off into the night

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
and take them all out to karaoke with us

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I'm afraid to

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
we're not going to get one answer

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
but where should we go after the show

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I used to say throw it out of the crowd

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
home

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
someone said home

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
we should go home

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
we're all going to LA

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
we're all going to the drawing room to do karaoke

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
we'll find a place

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
and you'll

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
sonny's house of blues is thrown out there

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
oh that's the place with the karaoke right

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
where should we make it

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I say when the show's over we all split up

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
we'll cover more ground that way

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I love you guys so much

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I only resent that I'm not out there drinking with you

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I'm up here on stage

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
alright

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
shut up

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
what do we do more musical interludes

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
why don't we all do a rousing version of Pringle Stick together

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
who by applause knows the words to Pringle Stick

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
alright for those of you who are not applauding

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I'm sorry for what's about to happen

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
this is a song I improvised on a tour bus

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
in one go

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I was holding a Pringles can

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
up to my crotch

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
like it was my dick

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
and it goes like this

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
some people call me Pringles dick

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
but I never really found out why

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I don't really have a Pringles dick

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I just keep my dick inside

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
because it keeps my penis safe and dry

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
because it keeps my penis safe and dry

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
some people call me Pringles dick

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
but I never really found out

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
oh I never found out

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I never really found out why

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
now we're going to do a land down under

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
by fucking men at work

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
let's do Pauline Henson the musical

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
let's try to make her a sympathetic

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
character

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
tell people the untold story

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
fade in on an apocalyptic wasteland

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
pan over to a cave

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
of jagged stalagmites

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
pushing in

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
we hear the roars of a bear

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
giving birth

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
a single slick

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Pauline Henson

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
plops from a bear's vagina

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
a ledge badge

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
but her sign all the same

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
as Pauline

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
spreads her gremlin ears

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
from across her face

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
and extends her

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
claw-like hands

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:13.000
in song

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I'm Pauline Henson

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I'm going to

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
do some things and then some

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I'm a

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
demon lady from a bear's vagina

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I'm going to

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
South Carolina

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
after

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I destroy

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Australia

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
dissolved to college

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
oh my god

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
that politics class was so amazing

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I know

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I can't believe we're

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Australians from the valley

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Pauline like

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
who are you taking to prom

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I don't know

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
because I like that

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
hat might but

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I don't want a huntsman on my tank

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Pauline you're so silly

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
you can have any guy you want

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I'm not sure what kind of guy you like

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I want a man

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
who makes cabbage soup

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
oh my god what an amazing song

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
uh oh here comes the professor

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Pauline what are you singing about boys

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
in the hallway for

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
oh professor I'm just trying to

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
oh you're just trying to get expelled

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
you can't have any pudding

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
if you don't eat your meat

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
no

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I'm expelled

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
three years later

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
in medical school

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
suture

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
you know what forget these sutures

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
let's just pour nutrition on this wound

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Chinese needles

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
witch hazel

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
eye of newt

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
now it's time to become president of Australia

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I want to rule

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
down under

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
bring the brimstone fire

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
lightning and thunder

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
lightning and thunder

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
it's the only thing that rhymes with down under

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I'm Pauline Henson

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
and I'm here to say

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I like to do rhymes in the laziest way

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I am Pauline Henson

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
a landslide election

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
has occurred

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
the Australian Electoral College

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
has decided

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
that Pauline Henson

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
is the president even though she only got six votes

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
the Queensland

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
represents

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
17,000 electoral votes

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and so now she's president

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I swear to take the duties

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
with Christ and my eternal soul

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
to rule all of Australia

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
with ease and grace

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
now to go to the Australian White House

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I love

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I love okay it's not a song

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
it's just a transition

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
pencils

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
drawers

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
a giant bear claw

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
shoots out of Pauline's top drawer

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
grabbing her face and pulling her into

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
a cosmic world of introspection

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
what have I done

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
with my life

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
yeah

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
a bear comes out and is kind of

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
ethnic

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
well what do you want from me

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
yeah

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Pauline

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
you need to atone for your sins

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
no

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
no no no

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
no

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
yeah

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
no

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
alright

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
the bear reaches out

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
and puts a single sigil

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
into her forehead

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
it's a Tasmanian

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
ancient outback sigil

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
it represents

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
the four elements

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
fire, water, poison spiders

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
and flip flops

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
you don't correct a person's

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
improv

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
that's the first

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
you know what, that's the first thing you've done tonight

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
that upset me

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I was so

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
we were working so well together

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
alright fine, bonk, bonk, whatever you said

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
thongs

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I've had it with you

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
dicktugs

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I'm not going near those things

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I'm fucking filled with huntsmen

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Pauline's head falls off

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
and Australia enters a bright new world

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
filled with

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
olives and fairies

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
and angels

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
and Gaelic

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
chants

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
oh

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
alrighty ta ta ta

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Australia's been saved

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
these songs are short

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
you didn't think it was a good idea

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
to do this musical

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
you're just speeding it along

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
you know that my songs are not the strong part

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
this second act is dragon

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
it's my

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
a dragon

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I'm a dragon

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
okay

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Pauline Henson's body

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
turns to ash

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
the ashes sprinkle across

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
the northern

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
coast of Australia

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
where the national bird

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
the tusk

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
they eat the ash

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
laden water and they turn into

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
angelic figures and the entire continent

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
is lifted high above

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
and it's revealed that Atlantis was underneath Australia

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
the whole time

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
crown of thorns starfish

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
rise up and form into one giant

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
crown of thorns Godzilla starfish

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
a robot comes out

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
it's huge dick goes into the crown of thorns starfish

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
pumps it full of milk and air

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
it's poisoned and the crown of thorns starfish

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
explodes into a million

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
pieces of starfish

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
which as you know regenerate

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
a lone starfish rises

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
and sings its sad song

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I am a starfish

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
and I want to be loved

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
as well as you

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I have five fingers

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:35.000
instead of hands

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I have no head

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I just have five fingers

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
no hands

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I cartwheel

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
instead of walking

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I suck onto the sides

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
of everything

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
my life is doomed

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
to be the villain

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
of the ecosystem

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I like it fucked by robot

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000

there wasn't enough show

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I had to fill in some at the end there

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
