{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, The NerdMelt Leader, the 100-Harmontown episode.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:36.000\nOur centepa, our centipodial centepasos.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:39.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:45.000\nLet's welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, forever young, forever fit, forever charming,\n\n00:45.000 --> 01:08.000\nJen Harmon. Thank you. Centepasodial. 100 episodes. Tonight will be, I promise, at least 1% as entertaining as the sum of all of our podcast parts.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:15.000\nNothing really special planned, except for, sorry, goodnight.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:20.000\nWhat do you meant to say? It's, boy, do we have a show for you people tonight.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:26.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'll make it special in any way that you want me to make it special, but it's not like the show is...\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nTake a shirt off.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:43.000\nI mean, the show is not famous for its preparation. I was afraid, you know, in doing things, special things that we would just be...\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:50.000\nI think that would run kind of, what's the word? Anathema? Yeah, yeah. It wouldn't really be a Harmontown episode.\n\n01:50.000 --> 02:01.000\nWe've got to make this 100 times the Harmontown episode, which means we have to plan 100 times less than we ever do.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.000\nHow could you plan 100 times less than zero?\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:12.000\nIt's just, that's it. It's just a regular episode, see? The math checks out.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:22.000\nHey, Jeff, what do you make of these? What do you make of these people? I've been watching some more true crime shows with Aaron.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:25.000\nYou're, what, you're...\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:38.000\nI used to watch the Forensic Files and the FBI Files and the extreme forensics, Solved, Colon, Forensics Gone Wrong, Wild Crime,\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:43.000\nSnapped, Semicolon, Women of Forensics...\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nLike the Dateline kind of things? Those murders?\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:55.000\nYeah, that gets a little polished for me, but we started watching this show, which I think we're done with now.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:59.000\nI think there's only six episodes of it. It's called Murder Comes to Town.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:08.000\nAnd it's just like every other show, it's all the same murders and stuff, but the focus is on the town, so it's just sort of like...\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:15.000\nIt's just like any other kind of like crime show where there's just interviews with these police that couldn't figure out who killed somebody until someone called and told them that they did it,\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:22.000\nwhich is, if you really watch these shows, that's what always happens, like there's always, there's always three quarters of the way into the episode.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nAnd then they got a break.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:32.000\nThen police got the break they were looking for. And it's always like a phone call from either a nearby police enforcement agency saying,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:38.000\nlike, we found a finger, or it's just a guy going, like, my cousin did it.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:46.000\nBut anyways, not to digress. Tonight, no tangents, 100 times less tangents than the normal Armageddon.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nI was just watching because we were watching because there's always the reenactments in these things.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:58.000\nThey show people, there's people talking to the camera, and then sometimes there's people that they hired to play those people.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:09.000\nBut then sometimes, as in murder comes to town, and I think it's at a case-by-case basis, I'm assuming it's based on the participants' willingness,\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:16.000\nsometimes the person that's being interviewed is then in the reenactments.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nWhat?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nYeah.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nNo.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nI'm like, well, yeah, my daughter, then my daughter was missing. She was gone.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:26.000\nAnd then they'll show that woman waking up in a bed.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:27.000\nWhat?\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:32.000\nYou know, and there's like a Johnny Mnemonic poster on the wall to make it period or whatever.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nBecause it's 10 years later.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:38.000\nThis poor woman is like answering a phone going, hello?\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:39.000\nNo.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nNo.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:41.000\nOkay, I'll be right there.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nAnd like hanging up the phone.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:46.000\nIt's like there's a director telling her, okay, your daughter's missing.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nIt's a cop on the other end of the phone. Sweetie, sweetie, work with me.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nThe director, what's my motivation?\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:59.000\nAnd then including like really like tripping out on this one, it was this good natured,\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nseeming like loving mother whose daughter had been abducted and eventually murdered,\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nbecause the show's called Murder Comes to Town.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nDon't hit me with your spoiler shed.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nThe show's called Murder Comes to Town.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nThe daughter's missing and she's, she's gonna murder her.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:20.000\nAnd the woman is like, so they show her re-enacting the moment where she found out her daughter's missing.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:26.000\nThen they also show her like the day that she last saw her daughter alive.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:31.000\nSo they show her like walking down a hall, opening a bathroom door and going, sweetie,\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nI'm going to work.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nOkay, mom.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nBye.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:40.000\nLike the director then calling her, hey Monica, could you stop crying in the middle of this?\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:45.000\nAt the time this scene takes place, your daughter's still alive.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nI don't know why you keep bursting into tears.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:52.000\nWhere were those in the last scene?\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:58.000\nIt's just, I can't even, to be a fly on the wall of that production, these people are just,\n\n05:58.000 --> 05:59.000\njust random people.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\nAnd sometimes it's like cops, like the cops, you know they're into it when the cop is like\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:08.000\nputting the guy in the hood and he's like, don't move pal, don't even breathe.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:13.000\nAnd he's all, you know, he's playing himself and trying to act like he was like, you know,\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:14.000\ndie hard.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nIs that the character's name?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nYou're thinking of Jaws.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nYeah.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nDo you have a question, Jeff?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.000\nYes.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:30.000\nDan, what does it all mean?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nThere was a quote in the show that there was a murder that took place in Kansas or something.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.000\nAnd then the narrator said, the narration is like incredibly poorly written.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nLike they'll do things like they'll go, there was this one I had to rewind.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:46.000\nIt was like, did they just use suspicion as the dramatic button on the end of two sentences\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nin a row?\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:54.000\nSo it was like, but then there's only a matter of time before hope gives way to suspicion.\n\n06:54.000 --> 07:01.000\nAnd the hopes and dreams that were pinned on the former family members give rise to suspicion.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nLike he acted like he never said suspicion before.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\nLike they're just, they're just fucking, they're like, we don't have time.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nJust say shit about murder.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nI know it's been done a million times.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nWho's that white-haired guy, Keith, you know, what's the fucking, the creepy...\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nThe ghoulish guy that they've done on SNL.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nYeah.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nYeah.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nBill Hader does.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nHe's the worst writing in the world because it's all questions.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nBut why did she go there?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nAnd if she went in there, why did she do it?\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nWell, listen, I always wonder too about the people that participate in these shows, they're\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\ndoing these interviews and they're talking about their beloved person being killed and\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nwhat it was like to find their brains in the thing.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nAnd then they're doing these interviews and they're crying during them.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:49.000\nAnd then sometimes the show is called like, peek-a-boo, I killed you.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nYou know, like it's like not quite on the side of the victim exactly.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nIt's more on the side of murder kind of.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nLike that's where the murder comes to town.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nThe narration is like, the guy is like decidedly, he's like, but what happened?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nShe went jogging.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nThat's the last time anyone saw her.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:14.000\nBut no amount of jogging would keep her alive during her rape and murder.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:18.000\nIt was like, what are you making fun of her for dying?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nOh, she was jogging, get it?\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:25.000\nLike what if you were the mom and you saw that and you'd be like, I cried in that interview.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nThey told me to look at the camera and cry.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nYou say that you watched all these episodes meaning it had there been more.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nThere were six of them.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nI think they canceled it, but yeah, I'll do more.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nBecause the other ones are all, I feel like I've seen the same murders and stuff.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nAnd it reduces the viewer to this weird thing.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:46.000\nLike Aaron and I were like, you know, going through the menu and we're like,\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\ntwo elderly people missing in a truck.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nThat's a hitchhike.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:58.000\nWell, this is one girl, but you know, you know, you know an ex-boyfriend just murdered her.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:03.000\nLike, you're kind of like, you know, you're reduced to fictionalizing human beings.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nBut anyways, one more thing about this.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nThe horrible narration, I wrote this down.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nThe guy said, he was talking about the town.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nIt's always about the town is, the town couldn't, that's the gimmick of this show.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nThe town couldn't believe it.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:20.000\nThis town and the size of this town, this kind of murder, you never, you don't forget it.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nLike in New York, everyone's like, hey, Glenn's missing.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:28.000\nFuck it.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:32.000\nI think that's why they break New York into like smaller subsections, right?\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:38.000\nSo that, you know, it's an appeal to the people outside New York for a little bit of humanity.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nLike, look, we're not just a giant city full of people.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:44.000\nIf my neighbor gets killed, I care.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nBecause I'm from Brooklyn.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nSection three.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nAnyways.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nDid they ever find Glenn?\n\n09:52.000 --> 10:00.000\nThe guy was saying, but it, you know, Boner Hurt, Kansas.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nBoner Hurt?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nOkay, we'll get back to you.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nIt was close to that.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nYou're naming it.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nBoner Hurt.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nThey'll show a shot of the water tower and then a cornfield.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:15.000\nBoner Hurt, Kansas is a quiet town full of church going folk.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:23.000\nAnd this is what the guy said, he said, you could call it the core of the American heartland.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:27.000\nYou could call the word heartland synonymous with core.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nYou could call a heart a core.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nYou could call a core a heart.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nYou could clean up this sentence, motherfucker.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nYou could call this town in Kansas the core of the big apple.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nBut not, but very far away from that, from that apple.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nYou could call it the center of the epicenter.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:51.000\nA kind of confluence of nexuses.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:57.000\nBoner Hurt, Kansas lies at the intersection of crossroads.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nIs it five o'clock yet?\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nAll right.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:08.000\nSo, well, we have special shit to do and I know it's going to, you know, it's going to eat away at us.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nIt's going to eat away at our time.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nIt's not going to eat away at us.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:16.000\nBefore we go real quickly, I've been reading these books that are, like, by Philip Kerr.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:20.000\nThey're all these detective novels set in World War II Germany.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:23.000\nIt's a detective, like, kind of a la Raymond Chandler.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nAnd he is a cop during World War II.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nIt's great shit.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nIt's like awesome schlock.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:33.000\nBut also, like, I love World War II documentaries and I love Nazi documentaries.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:37.000\nAnd I feel, like, in my, I know this is not a charming admission,\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:43.000\nbut, like, is it wrong to wish that World War II had gone on longer so there'd be more documentaries about it?\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nI mean, that's what TV does to us.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nYeah.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:52.000\nBecause it just, like, some channels should just be called just, like, we love Hitler documentaries.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nI saw, I Instagrammed it.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nThere was a, I swear to God, I did.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nHow can we prove this, Dan?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:05.000\nThere was a, I was going through, I was looking for a new app to play on my fucking fat slob pad\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nthat I sit in bed and eat donuts on while I watch murder shows.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:14.000\nAnd I came across a review of this Sims game where this woman was like,\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:19.000\nshe was, it was just like an eight paragraph essay about how they had,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:24.000\nthey had updated the free Sims game that she had been, that she had raised her grandchildren on.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nBecause she's like, my grandchildren would come over and when they were three,\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nthey used to like to just watch the people walk around.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nAnd as they grew older, they learned about how to interact.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:38.000\nSo she's like, she's, believe me, her opinion matters the most about this free game\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:41.000\nthat she's been fucking because she uses it to raise children.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd then they released an update that makes the Sims die of old age.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nThey used to be immortal, Jeff, and now they die of old age.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:56.000\nAnd I was talking to them about it and someone was putting photos of the Grim Reaper on their Facebook pages\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nand they saw them and they started to cry.\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nNow my grandchildren are crying.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nI don't understand why these Sims have to die.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nI thought they could live forever.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:07.000\nAnd she's like having a fucking nervous breakdown in a review under the app.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nWas this review helpful?\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nYes.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:17.000\nIt has summed up our universe entirely.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:24.000\nI don't know if it's helpful to anyone, but maybe Nietzsche or Kafka.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:30.000\nI mean, she was like, she had become more sim than human because the Sims were now capable of dying\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:34.000\nand she was just this weird program complaining.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nOh boy, anyways.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nBut yeah, I'm just a hop from that with these murder shows now.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nAh, Teenage Hitchhiker.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nThe Sims couldn't die.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nI played the Sims for like three days.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:49.000\nAnd the woman that was my avatar, my gal or whatever,\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:52.000\nshe just kept getting bummed out and there's flies in the kitchen and I hated it\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nbecause I thought I'd kill her.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nSo I just stopped doing it.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nYou couldn't kill her?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nShe would just sit there and be miserable for the rest of time?\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nI can't answer anyone's questions about the Sims.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nHow do they die now?\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nLike, old days?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nLike, do you have to wait 80 years?\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nOr do you have to like...\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nI never played a Sims game.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nI'm neither proud nor ashamed to say.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nI love, like, I play like Gardening Mama 2 and the...\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nI'm not above reproach.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nErin bought me a New York room to the Nintendo Star.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nShe said, you'll like this game and give me Gardening Mama 2.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nAnd I was like, fuck you, I get your joke and then I kind of liked it.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.000\nShe always leans over and looks at my screen at the wrong times.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:36.000\nLike, I'm always in the middle of changing a diaper or helping a stork grow.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nWhat?\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nYou know, I like time management games and like Gardening.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nI like Gardening and not in real life.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:49.000\nAlright, speaking of bad writing, we were driving here and Erin played Rocket Man.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.000\nSo you'll know how to finish these lyrics.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nMars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nIn fact, it's cold as hell.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nAnd there's no one there to raise them.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nIf you did.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nIf you did what?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nRaise them?\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nYeah.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nYou just said it's no place to raise your kids.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nThere's no one there to raise them if you raise them.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nWell, except you.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nWhat is it?\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:16.000\nIs it just Elton John doesn't know a life outside of the nanny system?\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:21.000\nIt's like, oh, then Mars ain't the kind of place to have your nanny raise your kids for you.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nThere's no nannies on Mars.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nMars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nIn fact, it's cold as hell.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:30.000\nAnd there's no one there to raise them.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nIf you did.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nDot, dot, dot.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nIf you raise your kids there.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:41.000\nIf you did choose that lifestyle.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nMars ain't the kind of place to settle down and raise your kids.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nNo, still not.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nStill bad writing.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:52.000\nMusicians, 6,000 years are getting away with bad writing and counting.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nThey bang on things while they do it.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nThere's a hand being raised out there.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nIf you dig?\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nIf you dig?\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nAre you just guessing that?\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nThat's what I always thought it was.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nYou always thought it was if you dig.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nSomeone look it up.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nLook up lyrics for us right now.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nI mean, if you know what I mean, there's no one there to raise them.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nIf you dig.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nIf you dig.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nI mean, there's no one there to raise them.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nIf you dig.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nHe's just checking it.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nI'll fucking give you.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nIt's the Elton John equivalent of, you know what I mean?\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nI'm gonna give you a $10 bill if that's correct.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\n$10 is yours, sir.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nDid.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nThank you.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:30.000\nWe saved me $10.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nThis is a sea of iPhones.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nIf you dig.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nI wish that was it.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nYeah.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:37.000\nOkay.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nAll right.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nI think that's better.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nAll right.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nLet's move on.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nTo Crocodile Rock.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nNow this song.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nCrocodile Rock.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:49.000\nI get so mad at musicians because they get away with\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:53.000\nlike stuff that, you know, I don't know.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:57.000\nThey're just kind of like, they're so fancy and free with their goddamn lyrics.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nIt seems like it's part of their success.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:03.000\nLike people don't want my overwrought fucking meticulous bullshit in there when\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nthey're tapping their toes.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nPeople just write these songs.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nThey're like, they change tenses.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nThey change like from first person to third person.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nI don't know who he is and who you are.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nSomeone's stealing someone's girl.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nWho the fuck is?\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nWho are we?\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nAgain, like, I might make it in this wrong.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nI love the movie by The Who, Quadrophenia.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nAnd it's a great rainy day, depressing movie.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nAnd it's all the soundtrack, of course, is by The Who.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:31.000\nAnd Sting is in it when he was young and not a complete twat.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nAnd he was just great in a silver suit.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nHe was great.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:39.000\nBut they thought Quadrophenia meant like, what if you had four personalities?\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:42.000\nThey thought Schizophrenia meant two personalities.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nAnd they're like, okay, we kind of, we kind of.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nI thought it was just a rip.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nI never saw that movie.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nI just assumed it was like some kind of like product placement\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nfor the new speaker system or something.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nQuadrophonics.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nWell, I think that was the riff they were trying to do.\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:00.000\nRock and roll music, lyrics shouldn't be looked at too closely.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nWriters and musicians.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nWhy can't they get along?\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.000\nYou know, they do in like Christina Aguilera songs or something.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nBecause people that aren't singer-songwriters,\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nthey have like a nice 45-year-old man sit down\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nand write a little ditty.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:19.000\nHand it off to a young sexy urchin whose voice is good for two years.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nAnd then they go, I'm a genie in a bow to rub it.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nOh, the metaphors all work.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nOh, you rub me the right way.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nI'm a genie and make a wish.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nI wish the genie was happening.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nOh, this is great.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nIt's like William Goldman wrote this.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nHe did.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nHe did.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nAn old guy in a log cabin wrote that.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nHe had A-cups.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nHe's not someone that you want to rub the right way.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nWell, guess what?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nBeauty's only skin deep.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nHave we talked about...\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nWe need to work together.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nUgly people are smarter than you.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nHave we talked about in this show a piano man?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nThe regular crowd shuffles in.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:00.000\nThe man in the bar sit next to me making love to his tonic and gin.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nNo.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nGross.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nNo.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nYou don't get to change the name of the drink to suit your purposes.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:08.000\nOh, I thought you meant it was gross because it sounds like he's coming in his drink.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nMaking love to his tonic and gin.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nHe's scary over there with his dick in the jar.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:18.000\nYou can see the strands floating to the top.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:22.000\nAnd he swizzles his drink with his balls and his stink in it.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nJanitor's getting him up.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:35.000\nWe're getting played off by the ghost of Jebediah Nerdmelt.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nGet out of here.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nYour show doesn't have a script.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nIt's terrible.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nGreg Barrett did that joke 20 years ago.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:51.000\nYou've conditioned these people via systemic deprivation to applaud rhyming mop with whatever you rhymed it with.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nOther people have acts.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nTonic and gin.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nMaking love to his jelly and peanut butter.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nThat's fucking...\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:00.000\nThat's just lazy bullshit.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nAlso, the gambler.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nI like Kenny Rogers a lot.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nI love Kenny Rogers.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nWhen I was nine in Acapulco, so I love the guy.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nAnd the gambler.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:14.000\nHe rhymes sleep and keep twice.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nI think that's lazy bullshit.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nYou don't do the same rhyme twice.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:23.000\nWell, how about he did the same song four times?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:30.000\nEverybody saw the farmer with the magic peanuts.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nHow does that the gambler?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:35.000\nFuckin' they're all just like...\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:39.000\nI don't know the musical terms, but I know the fucking guy just sits down and writes a fucking...\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:46.000\nwrites the charge of the light brigade and puts it to like...\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nIt's always about a guy.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nCan you sing me...\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:53.000\nI don't know your knowledge of the Battle of Balaclava.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nOr Alfred Lloyd Tennyson.\n\n20:56.000 --> 21:01.000\nWould you please do me a country version of the charge of the light brigade?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:04.000\nCanons to the left of them.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nCanons all around them.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:13.000\nBut the man with one leg came to town and said that he had found them.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:16.000\nOut of Misty River's country night.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nThis character broke even.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:25.000\nAnd that's the story of Kenny Rogers of a guy named fucking Stephen.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nIt's always a guy.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nAlright, I'm thinking of two sides.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nCoward of the county and the gambler.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nCoward of the county is a good one.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:34.000\nBut you know if we brought up Kenny Rogers' album, you'd see a bunch of failed attempts.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nHe started off in a psychedelic hippie band called First Edition.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nFirst or second edition?\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nFirst edition.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:44.000\nI just dropped in to see what condition my condition is.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nAnd that's him.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nAnd when he left that band, they're like, you're never going to make it, baby.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nHe said, no, I'm going to make country music.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nHe's like, you'll never make it.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nAnd he went off and wrote some of the biggest hits.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nYou know he's a Scientologist.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nIs he?\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:57.000\nA Psych Guy.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nYou never know.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nWho would have thought Beck, you know?\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:05.000\nWho would have thought Will Smith?\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:11.000\nIf I found out Kenny Rogers was Scientologist, I would give Scientology a second glance.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:16.000\nWell, I don't want to bring this up again, but you should read that book going clear.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:21.000\nYou would, AI, you come away from it with a respect for...\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:26.000\nYou don't dehumanize people just because they're Scientologists anymore after reading that book.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nI wouldn't either if I ever met a Scientologist who would sit down and explain what it is that they do.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nBut it's so goddamn private.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nWell, then read this book going clear.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nIt's like 700 pages.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nI can't talk to a person that's a...\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nI don't know.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nMaybe you can.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nWell, yeah, you can.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nThere's independent Scientologists.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nThere's also that guy Marty Rathben.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nWe just watched a documentary about him.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nThere's a lot of people that were raised on this religion.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nHow much more ridiculous is anything?\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nYou know, we've had Mormons on stage talking to us about Mormonism.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:57.000\nWe've had... I think we had a Jew once.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nSpeaking of which, I'm assuming he's Jewish because of his last name.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:05.000\nAdam Goldberg has a special surprise for us.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:08.000\nThat's pretty anti-Semitic, you guys.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nHe's a human being.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:14.000\nOh, you hate him the person.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:17.000\nI'm sorry, I connected those dots wrong.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:22.000\nNo, Adam Goldberg, he went on to Reddit.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nAnd he... Do you believe that?\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nI'm going to suspend my disbelief.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:35.000\nHe culled together through rigorous research and conversation with Harmontown fans\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:42.000\nin honor of our centipestodial spectacular.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:49.000\nHe has an 18-question trivia quiz.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:53.000\nIt gets better.\n\n23:53.000 --> 24:00.000\nWe were thinking that you and I would go up against a Harmontown superfan from the audience.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:06.000\nAnd see if one of you could get more answers right about our show than Dan and I.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nIs that right?\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:10.000\nYeah, given the fact that we're always in a blackout drunk.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nOh, they're going to win.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nI already know the results.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:17.000\nSo should we have them elect one of their own to be that representative?\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nYeah, well, I don't know how they'll do that.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:22.000\nLet's set them against themselves.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:28.000\nWho here thinks that they would probably be the best at answering Harmontown trivia?\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nWe have a few hands up.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:38.000\nAnd it's Holy, but he's so hard to understand.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:43.000\nWhat does fuck y'all mean?\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:48.000\nWho do we got?\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nMC?\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nYou think you got the goods?\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nMC, bring it up here.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nFuck it.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nI like the look of this guy.\n\n24:54.000 --> 25:03.000\nWe're going to give MC a chance here.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:08.000\nOh, it's good.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:12.000\nYeah, we'll try to lightning through this.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nWhere's Goldbug?\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nGoldberg, are you here?\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:22.000\nAdam Goldberg, everybody.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nHi, MC.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:27.000\nMC, what is your curriculum vitae?\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:32.000\nWhat are your credentials that you think that qualifies you to beat Dan and I at our own game here?\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:36.000\nWell, I recently binge listened to the whole show.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nOkay, you already got us.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nYou already got us.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nAll 100 episodes?\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nAll 99 episodes?\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nHow long did it take you to get through all 100?\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:47.000\nWell, I started listening when I started a new job.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:50.000\nAnd that job was about like two months.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:54.000\nAnd with the exception of like Breaking to Watch whatever was like new on Lulur or whatever,\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:57.000\nit would be like the only source of entertainment.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nAnd I caught up.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:03.000\nOh God, he's got to hate me more than the rest of you combined.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nHave you been to the live show before?\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nOh yeah, totally.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nI think I've seen you here before.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:11.000\nBasically, once I caught up, that's when I started attending.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nOkay, so how many times have you been here live?\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI think this would be like my fifth or sixth?\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nYeah.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:19.000\nCan you describe the nature of that job without getting in trouble?\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nYeah, it was an animator.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:26.000\nSorry, a storyboard artist on a show called Bojack Horseman.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:27.000\nIt's going to be on Netflix.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nIt's genuinely good.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nAnd that was the only thing keeping me from like...\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nDan, what do you think of myself out of window?\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nWhat do you think the pitch the log line is for Bojack Horseman?\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nBojack Horseman.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:43.000\nHow the West was won on the side.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:46.000\nLike it's got to have some kind of like misfit cowboys.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:50.000\nIt's actually got Alison Brie from Community on it.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:53.000\nFuck the show.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nLike there's no actors looking for work, right?\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:59.000\nGive Alison Brie another job.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nNo, what is it?\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nCan you give us the kind of conceit of it?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:13.000\nIt's about like a out of work actor who's like trying to like cope with his like self-loathing and depression.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nBut like he's a horse.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nHe's a horse.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nHe's like a horse man.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nHe's a horse man.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:24.000\nIs he a centaur?\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nHe's like a reverse centaur.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nHe's like horse from the neck top.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:32.000\nOh, he's a horse centaur.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\nIs it live action or animated?\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\nIt's animated.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nIt's live action.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nWell, he said he's a storyboard artist.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nIt could be live action.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:43.000\nThey would have to plan the horse composites.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:47.000\nWell, also it's cast entirely of the people that you don't know for being in cartoons.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:53.000\nLike it's like Amy Starris is in it and the friggin from Breaking Bad.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nJesse.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nYeah, Tim.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nAll right.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nWell, sounds good.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nLet's kick this off.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nSo Adam Goldberg, tell us what the rules are with what we're doing here.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nWell, there are three answers to every question.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nOne of them or two of them is correct.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nDid one of them is correct?\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:14.000\nI want to say that I had a story about the Sims, actually.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:18.000\nAdam, what are the rules to the game that we're about to play?\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nMy brother went up.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nWhat are the rules?\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nYou are here for one task, Adam.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nI'm married.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nIt's our hundredth fucking show, Adam.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nWe're not going to do this.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nI will shout you down.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:29.000\nI will play the game.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nPlay the game.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:32.000\nHe can't.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nHe's actually...\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nYou're going to make me lie and put yourself in your thing.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nOkay.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nSo I'm going to ask questions.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:40.000\nI thought he was going to wax rhapsodic about Sims for a while.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nYeah.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nThe only story is my brother is married.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nMy sister is into their family.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nYou're compulsive.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nFor money.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nFor money.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:51.000\nYou know, I normally don't get to give my two cents because I'm usually just listening to it,\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nbut I'm pro Goldberg.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nI'm cool with hearing the story.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:58.000\nDon't suck up to the judges.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:02.000\nI mean, I always go back and forth because the minute someone says,\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:05.000\nI'm pro Goldberg and 150 people boo,\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:10.000\nand he doesn't pull out a rifle or run from the station,\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nthen I become pro Goldberg because I'm like,\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:15.000\nwhat the fuck is this?\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nI don't need your pity.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nCan you just say you're pro Goldberg?\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nAnd then look at his face.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nI'm anti Goldberg.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nBoo.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:27.000\nThank you.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nI mean, we discussed this forever.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nHarmontowns for Misfits.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:36.000\nHe's clodious.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:39.000\nAre we going to go start a colony on the moon for Misfits?\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nAnd we're just going to start.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nAs soon as we get off the spaceship,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nwe're going to go, all right, where's the nerd?\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nGet out of here.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nI need a space suit.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.000\nGet out of here.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nYeah.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nThere's 99 spacesuits.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nAll right.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nAdam, tell us the rules if you would please.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:57.000\nI'm going to ask the question either of team Dan Jeff or team Guy\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nwho worked on the Centaur Show.\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\nMC.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nMC.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nThat's easy to remember.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:05.000\nAnd apparently not.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nI don't like suck ups.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nIt immediately changes my opinion.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nYeah.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:10.000\nI'm back with these guys.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.000\nDon't care.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:12.000\nYeah.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nOh, come on.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nYou just go where the wind blows, man.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:21.000\nAnd if you just don't know, the other team can steal.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:24.000\nIf you're like, but it's multiple choice.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nSo that's unlikely.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.000\nAll right.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nWho wants it first?\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nTeam Dan or team MC?\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nI'll take it.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nMC.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:32.000\nMC.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:35.000\nSo if I get it wrong, like do I get knocked out and someone else has to,\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nlike we need to round around and sell like that or?\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nNo.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nOkay.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.000\nHow does the scoring work?\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nMost out of 18 questions.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nMost out of 18.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nAll right.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nLet's fire through these.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nIt's only a four hour show.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nOkay.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nReal Obed proposed a restaurant where everything is really small.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:51.000\nWhat was it called?\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nA real Obed's real food for real people?\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nB bites or C mini mine?\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nB bites.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nThat is correct.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nOne point for MC.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nI knew that.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nI knew that.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:05.000\nI almost feel like you could have eliminated the multiple choice out of that and had us\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\ntry to freestyle.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nBut let's see what goes.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nIf he gets into the lead, he'll hop to freestyle.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nOkay.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nThis is a challenge.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:12.000\nOkay.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nYeah.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:14.000\nHe's already in lead.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nSo that doesn't apply.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nMC has jumped out to commanding one zero lead.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nOkay.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:25.000\nGive each person that you ask, give them the option of, if they can get it without getting\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nthe multiple choices.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nThat's two points.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nTwo

how many times he said it versus how many times it was.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nBecause there are some times where I was like, yeah, it should.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:03.000\nOh, it's not, though.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nIt's something else completely.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:08.000\nThat's some homework for you guys to do.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:12.000\nOne of MC's tires is going to be

those lines.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.000\nI think that ring a bell.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:36.000\nWhy would words like Azusa Pacific ring a bell?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:37.000\nI go with that

get...\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:03.000\nYou let him do it.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:09.000\nThe correct answer is he died choking on a rod, he ate in some stew in an art gallery.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nHe choked on a rod.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:12.000\nThat was a Harmontown episode?\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:13.000\nOh, no, that's comedy bang bang.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:14.000\nI thought you guys...\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nWhat the fuck are you doing?\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:17.000\nThey haven't had me on yet.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nI need to suck up.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nNo, that one's just stricken from the record.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:21.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:22.000\nDoesn't count.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nNext, the final question.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:25.000\nOkay, thank God.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nAnd then the final one will be a top up.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:28.000\nTop up.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:29.000\nConvertible.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:34.000\nHow can Chicken Noodle Man of the eponymous song Make His Troubles Go Away?\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nWho's this for, by the way?\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nThis is for Jeff.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:38.000\nAll right.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:39.000\nI know it's not.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nI guarantee you, I know the Chicken Noodle Man question.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nI helped write the mother.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nWait, is it an MC's turn or Jeff's turn?\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:46.000\nAre you sure?\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nI'll give it to MC, because I feel Jeffness.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.000\nOne more time.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:50.000\nThat's the question.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:57.000\nHow can Chicken Noodle Man of the eponymous song Make His Troubles Go Away?\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:58.000\nSo easy.\n\n41:58.000 --> 41:59.000\nHe feeds the devil's soup.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:00.000\nThat is correct.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:03.000\nHe feeds the devil's soup from his penis.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:04.000\nAll right.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nThat was a lob.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nMy girlfriend knows that song.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:09.000\nHe's pretty much tied up.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:12.000\nThe audience has fallen behind, but this is the last one.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:15.000\nYou're going to have to buzz in for this one, because it is the tiebreaker.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:16.000\nAll right.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:17.000\nIt would break.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:20.000\nMC is winning, but this one could break the tie in favor of Team Dan Jeff.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:21.000\nAll right.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:22.000\nAll right.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.000\nDuncan Trussell.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:24.000\nWe buzz in.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:25.000\nWhat do we do?\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:26.000\nSay buzz?\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:27.000\nYeah.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:30.000\nChristopher twice, once chopped off Christopher's ding dong.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:33.000\nHe also carved something into Chris's arm.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nWhat was it?\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nBzzz.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:37.000\nYep.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:40.000\nA pentagram.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:41.000\nNope.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nAll right, MC, if you get this one, you've got the game.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nIf not, I am out of questions.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:46.000\nShit, man.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:51.000\nIt was about something Camille said on his own show about a game, and I cannot remember\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.000\nwhat game it was.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:56.000\nHe said, how can you have a gaming podcast and not talk about Starcraft 2?\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nI'm going to count for MC in the audience.\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nMC!\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nAll right.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nMC wins.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:06.000\nThank you, sir.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:09.000\nThank you, Adam.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:12.000\nThank you, Adam Goldberg, everybody.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:20.000\nIt was a lot of hard work for both Adam and all of us, right?\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nWe all deserve a round of applause.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:25.000\nNo, but thank you for putting in the research, Adam.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:31.000\nWithout that segment, we really would not have had a hundredth episode special at all,\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nyou know?\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:35.000\nIt felt like something you would do in a hundredth episode special.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:36.000\nYeah.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nOtherwise, it would just be me talking about what?\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nCrime shows?\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:41.000\nWhat am I?\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:44.000\nThe what am I guy?\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:51.000\nIf you went to another planet and there was only one of the three possibilities available\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:54.000\nto you that women could do or you could watch on porn.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:58.000\nHeel popping, dipping, or dangling?\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nYou had to pick one.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:03.000\nWhat is my favorite out of heel popping, dipping, or dangling?\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:08.000\nWhat's your desert island heel fetish thing?\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:17.000\nWell, you get dangling out of there right away because there's no activity to that.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:20.000\nDangling is what follows a heel pop.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:23.000\nIt's built into the heel pop.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:26.000\nAnd heel popping is built into a dipping.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.000\nWas dipping again?\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nWell, dipping could be like a lot of things.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:35.000\nIt could be like a woman like, well, no, no, that's just heel popping.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nOkay.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:42.000\nWell, dipping is like the shoe is on the floor and the foot is going in and out.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nDipping.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:48.000\nYeah, like the woman is lost in thought.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:52.000\nShe's just casually dipping her foot in and out of her shoe.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:55.000\nI'm presuming that a lot of foot fetishists are heel fetishists,\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:58.000\nbut I'm presuming that you'd want a little bit of all of those.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nYeah, I think that's why they all come together.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nIt's like eyes, ears, nose, and throat.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nYou don't bother to...\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nBut again, you have to pick one.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:09.000\nWell, tell that to an eyes, ears, nose, and throat guy.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nIt's like, oh, I'm an optometrist.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nI mean, who needs those?\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nAll right.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nWhat about that?\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:18.000\nWhat is that?\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nWhat do you go to an eyes, ears, nose, and throat guy?\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nThere's such a thing as an optometrist.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nIt's like, just an eye guy.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:35.000\nI'm trying to picture all three separate somehow\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:38.000\nand give you an actual sincere answer.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nI guess...\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nI guess dipping.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:47.000\nAll right, dipping.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:51.000\nOn our 200th episode, that would be a trivia question.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:57.000\nAll right, let's bring out my fiancé,\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nErin McGathy.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nAll right.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nHello.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:17.000\nHi, Scoops.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:18.000\nHi.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:19.000\nScoops?\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nIt's a dipping reference.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:27.000\nScoops Johnson was the evil Keneval of Dippin.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:35.000\nAnything you want to address or anything?\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:41.000\nWell, I was trying to think of my own fetishes.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:46.000\nI guess not.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:47.000\nI don't know.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:48.000\nNo, doing great.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nDo you have any fetishes?\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nI like smoking.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:56.000\nI know it's really bad for people that I do things with.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nThat's just called an addiction.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nBut if we're talking about...\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nYou mean you look at how guys look when they smoke?\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nYeah, not people I know,\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:07.000\nbecause the only person I know who smokes is Dustin Marshall.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nI imagine him back there being like,\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\noh no, oh no.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:17.000\nNo, I like fetishes outside of...\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:21.000\nI missed the first part of the exchange\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nthat you just had about the dipping,\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:29.000\nand Jeff asked you what your favorite pornographic foot thing was.\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:32.000\nOut of it, because there's this...\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:36.000\nDipping dangling heel popping,\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nit's kind of like I'm saying,\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:45.000\nthat's a more specific long-winded way of saying shoe play.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:50.000\nShoe play is under the branch of foot fetish,\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nwhich is, I don't know, then there's...\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nThat's a big tree.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nThe real tragedy of this,\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:59.000\nand if you guys have been to the show while I've ever seen pictures,\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nI usually wear these boots and these tights.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:04.000\nIt's because I don't have feet.\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:07.000\nAnd backstage listening to this...\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nIt's actually...\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nThat's the best reaction to it ever.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nIt's when I acquired my foot fetish.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nThis is when we became intimate,\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nand I realized you had no feet.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:20.000\nI pine for feet now.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nShe can't help it.\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:27.000\nI mean, I have one fetish for saying last name, Dan Harmon.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:30.000\nJust all my sexualities wrapped up.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nMen and women, I think, work differently.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nI don't have...\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nI think a foot fetishism is a very male thing.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nAre there a lot of women foot fetishes?\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nSo they're gals?\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:43.000\nWould anybody admit to it? Any gals?\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nIt seems like women wouldn't have a fetish,\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nbecause guys' feet are like, wow.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nWe're a foot fetish.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nOnce we go down this road,\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nwe're going to run into this millennial L.A.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nI have a listening fetish.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:58.000\nYeah.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nI have a...\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:03.000\nI have a compassion fetish.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:07.000\nI have a thoughtfulness fetish.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nSo why me?\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nWell, because it's, you know...\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nAre you also a...\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nThat's what makes it funny.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nIn the same way that she has no feet.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:20.000\nNo, but I do like smoking.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nI did once sleep with a man,\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\njust because he looked like David Bowie,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:27.000\nand I requested that he smoked while he had sex with me.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nAnd then I felt very ashamed,\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nbecause I did very much use him for that.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:34.000\nAnd because he sustained a lot of burns on his face, right?\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:37.000\nNo, no, he was smoking.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nHe was smoking.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nHe had to smoke a cigarette while having sex with you?\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:45.000\nI made him put on...\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nI'm going to regret this immediately,\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:51.000\nbut I asked that he...\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nHe didn't know that I was going out with him\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\njust because he looked like David Bowie,\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nand we got back to his...\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nWhich era, David Bowie?\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:01.000\nModern love, David Bowie.\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:05.000\nAnd I asked him to put on a David Bowie record.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nAnd then he had cigarettes because he was a smoker,\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:08.000\nand I said,\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nyou probably have to smoke right now, right?\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:11.000\nHe was like, what? No, no.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nHe was very dumb. He was very, very dumb.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:16.000\nIt was not a proud moment,\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nbut I asked if he could smoke a cigarette\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:21.000\nwhile making love to me.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:25.000\nAnd holding a glass ball on the other hand.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nAnd asking you or telling you\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nthat you remind him of the babe.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.000\nYeah.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nWhat babe? What babe?\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:35.000\nWhat babe? What babe?\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:38.000\nSarah.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nOh, my God.\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nThe 100th anniversary episode guest,\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:42.000\nDavid Bowie's here.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nWow!\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nAaron.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nAaron.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:53.000\nI'm here because you asked me to be Aaron.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nSheriff, I...\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nI set my fiancé here.\n\n50:58.000 --> 50:59.000\nSo, when David Bowie comes out...\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.000\nShut up!\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:04.000\nHis name is David.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:08.000\nI'd like to make love to you\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:12.000\nwhile smoking and eating a cake\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:17.000\nor offering you bites of crumbs and sauces.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nI'm a musician.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:22.000\nI don't have to write well.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nOh, Dan.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:28.000\nDan, you have not returned your books on time.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nAre you calling David Bowie Dan now?\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:31.000\nI'm confused.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:32.000\nNo.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:33.000\nShe's countering with...\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:34.000\nOh, I see.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nYou have not returned your books on time.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:40.000\nUgh, these stockings make my shoes slide off.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nUgh.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:43.000\nIt's so embarrassing.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:47.000\nIt makes my shoes slide off.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:51.000\nCan I hit pause on this?\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:54.000\nThat's like the equivalent of just an irregular porn\n\n51:54.000 --> 52:00.000\nand an actor saying, like, God, my vagina is so penis-shaped.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nIt's like an inverted penis.\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nLike, one would just fit in like a...\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nI mean, Dan, I've never seen any of these.\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:07.000\nI've never seen any of these videos.\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:10.000\nCan we just attempt the talking version of this?\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nWell, I don't watch it for the talking.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:13.000\nIs there...\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nIn your shoe play video...\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:18.000\nIn your average, like, just run-of-the-mill,\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:21.000\nwork-a-day shoe-play film or scene.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nI mean, there's no such thing in it.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:24.000\nOh.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nOh, Krippendorf's Tribe.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:27.000\nKrippendorf's Tribe.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:28.000\nNo.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nThere's no run-of-the-mill...\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.000\nThe Casablanca.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:32.000\nThere's a lot of...\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.000\nRemember, you were telling me once about a pantyhose video,\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:36.000\nand you said...\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:40.000\nWe both knew that they were called challenges.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nOkay, you were cleaning out my shit,\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nand you found a VHS tape, and it said,\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:47.000\nlike, summer's pantyhose challenge.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:48.000\nYeah, I found one.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nI found one.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:52.000\nAll right.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:55.000\nI found one with many other friends.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nThere was, you know, Christina's pantyhose challenge.\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:58.000\nBut you were like,\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:01.000\nlook, I knew when I was cleaning up stuff,\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:02.000\nI'd find stuff.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nI'm not here to judge you,\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nmake you feel awkward in front of 200 people,\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:07.000\nor anything like that.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:08.000\nLike, you said all that.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:09.000\nAnd then he said,\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nbut for my own edification,\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nbecause there's no such thing as a VCR anymore,\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:16.000\ncould you please tell me what does that mean?\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:17.000\nWhat is the challenge?\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:18.000\nWhat is the challenge?\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:19.000\nAnd I said,\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:23.000\nI think it just means, like, how many pair can she put on\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nin one video?\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:26.000\nAnd then you started laughing,\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nand it was like, yeah, it is ridiculous,\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:29.000\nthe idea that it's a challenge.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:30.000\nBut then I found out, like,\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\n45 minutes later, that the whole time,\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:35.000\nyou thought that meant all over each other.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nLike, that she was just, like,\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nhad these giant legs, like,\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:42.000\nnumber 58.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:43.000\nAnd she was,\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:46.000\nshe was on That's Incredible.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nI had continued cleaning,\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nand I came back in, and I was like,\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:51.000\nI could do that.\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:52.000\nI mean, how many?\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nI was like, what was the most?\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nYou know, like...\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:57.000\nYou saw the word challenge.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:58.000\nThat's your fetish.\n\n53:58.000 --> 53:59.000\nIt's competitiveness.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.000\nYou're like, challenge, challenge.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:03.000\nI'll win that.\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:04.000\nAnyways.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nIs there dialogue in a shoot play video?\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:07.000\nOr is it all from the table down?\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nI mean, it depends on what you're talking about.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nLike, I'm 41 years old.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nI predate the internet.\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nThere's, I have seen,\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nthere's candid stuff,\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nwhere it's, like, actual creepy, like,\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nlike, I'm on a train, and here's, like,\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nthere's a woman seat ahead of me,\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:24.000\nand she was, she was\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nheel-poppin' dippin' or whatever.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:27.000\nThere's people that have websites,\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:28.000\nor there's videos like that.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nThen there's...\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:30.000\nDo you think people like their shoes,\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\nor hate them?\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:34.000\nWhat?\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:35.000\nIn the video.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:36.000\nNo, there's no narrative.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nThere's no Bruce Banner of heel-poppin'\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:39.000\nthat's like,\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:40.000\noh, if only I could find out\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.000\nhow to get these shoes off,\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.000\nor the shoes are...\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nI think the whole thing comes from,\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:45.000\nlike, a probably,\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nthere's probably the root of the tree\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nthat has to do with leg and foot fetishry.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nI don't wanna offend anybody\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nwho shares this stuff,\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nbut I would hazard a guess\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nthat there's a root\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:58.000\namong that tree.\n\n54:58.000 --> 54:59.000\nThere's a trunk of that tree\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:00.000\nthat has a little bit to do\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:01.000\nwith self-loathing,\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nand, you know,\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nmore voyeurism and less intimacy,\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\njust to, like, like,\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nmaybe little kids playing under the table\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nwith their matchbox cars\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:14.000\nthat were raised in the 70s and 80s,\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:17.000\nwhose first sexual thought\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nhappened at the same time as, like,\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:22.000\nyou know, just looking at a woman's\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:26.000\nfully clothed legs,\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nas opposed to, like...\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:29.000\nI don't know if there's women out there,\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nlike, wishing there were more videos of men,\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nlike, like, croc-dippin', you know,\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:34.000\nor, like, like...\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:35.000\nI mean, this is like...\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:36.000\nBootslide.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:37.000\nFor this audience,\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:40.000\nas soon as you were to say anything gender-specific,\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nthere's somebody that's gonna be the exception.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nThere's always, and it's like, like,\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:47.000\nwe're trying to learn not to draw these gigantic circles,\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:50.000\nbut the conventional wisdom has it\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:53.000\nthat men are a lot more visually,\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:57.000\nlike, we're a lot more given to this thing\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\ncalled fetishes that are visual\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nbecause there's something that's more,\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:05.000\nlike, we're more able to associate imagery\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:08.000\nthat goes right to our libido,\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nand women aren't like that.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:13.000\nI don't know if that's a passe now,\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nif that's, like, just something that we've become,\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nthat we became accustomed to thinking about men and women\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nin the 70s and 80s, or 90s,\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:22.000\nand now we're starting to actually second-guess that.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nI know for sure there's always gonna be\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:25.000\nsomebody that's gonna stand up and go,\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:29.000\nI'm a woman, and I'm totally visually stimulated,\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:30.000\nand they're not gonna be lying,\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nbut I also, like,\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:35.000\nhow can you have general conversations about sex?\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:38.000\nRemember that Ray Fiennes movie, that guy?\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:39.000\nWhat's that guy?\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:40.000\nWhat did he find out?\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nHe found out we're fucking insane, we're all insane,\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nbecause none of us talk about sex with each other,\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nso we don't, you know, we...\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nHave you guys ever watched porn together?\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:49.000\nYou and Aaron?\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:50.000\nTell me about Liam Neeson.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nLiam Neeson, right, that's where he finds.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:55.000\nLiam Neeson's here, everybody, for the 100th...\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:58.000\nAre you gonna come up with a little pop in the video\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nand watch a little porn together?\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:04.000\nWell, in the way that Dan's established that his porn is just\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:10.000\nladies that are, that have like a ledger,\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:13.000\nand no, no, we have never, we have never watched,\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nwe have never watched, we have never watched.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:16.000\nPorn together.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:17.000\nWe have never watched porn together.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nNever watched porn together.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nAnyways, do you watch porn with your girlfriend?\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:22.000\nNo.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\nI don't know what kind of,\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:27.000\nand I think it's great when couples do,\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:30.000\nI think it's great.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:33.000\nI don't care whether or not they do,\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nI think if they do, I think that's...\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nI don't know if I talked about it when I did your,\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nthis feels terrible, but I dated a girl a long time ago\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:43.000\nand she brought home, we dated for like 45 minutes, I think,\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nbut she brought home some porn and she wanted,\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nshe's like, I've never watched porn with a guy before.\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:50.000\nI went to a video store, I bought some porn,\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:54.000\nand one of the titles was Let's Play Pussy Darts.\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nHow do you win, how do you win, how do you win?\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nThat's Aaron's next question.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.000\nHow did they know who won?\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nI'm assuming that's the guy saying it to the woman,\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nlike wait, am I the dartboard? That's the worst.\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:15.000\nLet's play pussy.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nOh, it's just a euphemism?\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nI was actually trying to picture it.\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:20.000\nThey probably started playing,\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nand then they got caught up in the moment\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nand they didn't finish.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:25.000\nLet's play pussy.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nI've been misled by these titles before.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nWe'll never know who's the bastard pussy darts.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nYou know what, you know what buns me out\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:34.000\nis the new thing in the 21st century,\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:37.000\nthe new porn thing where they don't,\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:41.000\nthey don't have to come up with pun titles anymore\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:44.000\nwhen they do the Flint Bones and the Robocock and stuff.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:48.000\nLike now it's just, now it's just like the new thing\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nis it just says like, you know,\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:55.000\nXXX Brady Bunch or this is not Flash Gordon,\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nI don't know what the fuck.\n\n58:57.000 --> 59:00.000\nGodzilla, Godzilla the porn version.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nLike the titles aren't clever anymore.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nGodzilla the porn version.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nWait, are the pussy darts in that movie just penises?\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nI didn't watch the movie.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nI think pussy darts, pussy darts must be\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:13.000\njust a euphemism for regular old missionaries.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:16.000\nAnd I will forever call penises pussy darts.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:17.000\nForever.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nLook at all the pussy darts.\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nEveryone can always feel like a winner, yeah.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nIt's like bullfrog again.\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:27.000\nBut then women just have targets.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:32.000\nThen it's a bummer.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:35.000\nWe got to, let's get Spencer up here for this conversation.\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:43.000\n100th episode, Spencer.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:47.000\nHe's a hundred times the Spencer.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:50.000\nSpencer comes as Geared 100 times.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:51.000\nWhat's up you guys?\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:52.000\nHey.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:53.000\nPussy darts.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nSpencer and I have watch porn together, though.\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:56.000\nI throw them.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:57.000\nYeah.\n\n59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nYou throw pussy darts once in a while?\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nI guess.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nI guess that's what I said, yeah.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nAt the end of that movie does the woman look\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nat the guy slash the camera and say, nice grouping.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nThe camera just pans out or pulls back\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nand there's just a bunch of penises.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nSome are like on stomach.\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nSome are in the hand.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nThat one's a redo.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nThey just shake hands at the end and say good game.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nIt all takes place in a pub.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nThere's a chalkboard off to the side.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nI told you the thing.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nThis is a second hand, but it's not like anyone's not\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000\ngoing to believe me because it's like somehow the topic\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nof porn came up and then from there the topic\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nof these gang bang videos came up where there's these\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000\ngang bang videos where it's just like let's set the record.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nLet's make sure the most men ever can have sex\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nwith this one woman and it's very like, you know,\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nshe's on a vinyl ottoman and it's just like a warehouse\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nfull of men and it couldn't be less sexual\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nif you made it just the weather.\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nBut it's like then the top of the DVD case would say\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nlike 150 or 200, you know, it's like an arms race.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nSomebody was talking about one of those videos that they saw\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nand it's just men.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nWho was this person?\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nI can't even remember.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nI was your ex-girlfriend.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nSorry, sorry.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nAll I remember is the punchline.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nLet's not get too distracted by all the particulars.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nThe punchline's not even that good.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nThe guy that we were talking about those videos\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nwhere there's just like these lines of guys\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nand then you can see a guy, like two friends\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nand yes, race is important to this story.\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nOne of them was white and one of them was black\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nand they were like whispering to each other and giggling\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nand then they both got into the line and came up\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nand then the black guy went first and he finished\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nand then his white friend that you could see off camera\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nlike out of focus like giggling with him\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nthen ran up as his black friend went away\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nand announced in a kind of stilted like nervous\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nlike this is what we agreed we'd do.\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nVoice said, you've had the chocolate.\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nNow here comes the milk.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nAnd I was like, wait a minute, what?\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nAnd I was like, I have 500 questions.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nWhy is that the dichotomy?\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nIs his skin the chocolate?\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nBecause his cum looks like milk and so does yours\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nand that should have made you realize that race\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nis an artificial construct while you were gang-banging.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nThis woman, how about class systems and fucking misogyny?\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nWhat are you trying to break down the wrong barriers here, man?\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nThese guys were only 30 in line.\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nIf they had been 200 or so, they would have had time\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nto kind of workshop that thing.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nSomething about the breakfast.\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nI'm going to say this, I'm going to say this.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nNo, no, we can push that up.\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nThere's milk in both of you.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nWork with that if you want to focus\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000\non the color of his skin.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nThere's got to be some kind of right Oreo M&M.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nI don't know what...\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nI'm not going to think about it because I'm not racist.\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nI care about this lovely young lady\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nwho only committed the crime of staying up past curfew.\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nYou know, her dad's wondering where she is.\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nHere comes the milk.\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nYou've had the chocolate.\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nI mean, you should have just said white chocolate, I guess.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nI don't know what he should have said.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nHe should have said...\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nHe should have been at home thinking of ways to...\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nHe should have said all government is a lie.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nI mean, that's your...\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nThis is your one chance to be heard.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nProperty is theft.\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nSilence is consent.\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nWe've all been marginalized\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nin a military industrial complex to believe\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nthat we're participating in a democratic system,\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nbut revolution doesn't happen in a curtain booth.\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nIf voting was powerful and illegal, ah!\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nHe just gave you liberty.\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nNow I'm going to give you death.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nNo, that's weird. That's bad.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nThat's bad.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nAnd silence is consent is complicated.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nThat one I just...\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nYeah, that one was just in a drawer of aphorisms about...\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nHow do they find...\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nI feel like Spencer might know this,\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nbut you know fun facts like this.\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nI'll take it from here.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nSpencer after dark.\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nWhat's the question?\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nIn a gangbang video.\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nHow do they get all those guys, do you think?\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nWhy do you suppose Spencer knows?\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nBecause Spencer knows how people message board each other.\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nYou've been in the Tarzana area.\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nYou've been approached by one of these vans\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nwhere you've seen eight dudes huddled up in the back\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nand there's the driver going, hey, you want to be in a porno?\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nUsually when there's eight dudes in a van,\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nthey're selling vacuum cleaners.\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nWait, what?\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nThose are just ladies.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nWhy does it take eight guys to sell a vacuum cleaner?\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nIt's a very rigorous process.\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nThat's your first mistake, Jeff.\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nIt takes eight guys to sell eight vacuum cleaners.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nI'm the Alec Baldwin of this vacuum cleaner company,\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nand there's David Manit play called, suck and profit,\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nalways be suck and profit.\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nSuck and profit.\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nHas anyone ever seen a poster that's like,\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000\ngangbang this Thursday, please come and clean?\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nI think there's a lot of corn insiders, right?\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nIt's a whole industry.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nThey probably have a lot of bunnies and stuff.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nI think it is a whole industry.\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nBut there's giant gangbangs.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nThose guys aren't all professionals.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nThose are the roommates and neighbors of the guys\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nthat are professionals.\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nHave you guys ever gone to Sardos for a porn star karaoke\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nup in the valley?\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nWow.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nHalf our audience.\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nYeah, I went there once.\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nIt was a long time ago, and I didn't know that's what it was.\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nI went to meet some friends.\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nI go, this is porn star karaoke.\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nThese are mostly porn stars,\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nand there was little leaflets,\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nlittle flyers on each table,\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nand it almost had\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nthe drawing of two people fucking,\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nlike a walk-don't-walk, like spec-stick people.\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nIt didn't go that far,\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nbut it said like, please,\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nI think it had like a clip art thing of people kissing\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nor maybe bent over and fucking.\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nBut it said like, please do not\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nhave sex in the neighbors' yards.\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nOkay?\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nWhich was like,\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nwe've had a lot of complaints.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nLike, this is karaoke people.\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nYeah, we know the phrase,\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nporn star karaoke could possibly mean,\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nhey, try fucking.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nGive it a shot.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nI think these porn stars, they just get together,\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nand they all just find a bush,\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nand they all just start doing it.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nWait, do they sing?\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nOh yeah, they get up and they sing.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nThey turn around brown eyes and all kinds of shit.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nThat was all confusing.\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nHey, Spencer and I were driving.\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nSpencer kind of drives me around a lot.\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nIt's cool.\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nBecause I found out\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nthrough the Uber Revolution,\n\n01:07:29.000 -->
