00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, The NerdMelt Leader, the 100-Harmontown episode.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
Our centepa, our centipodial centepasos.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Let's welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, forever young, forever fit, forever charming,

00:45.000 --> 01:08.000
Jen Harmon. Thank you. Centepasodial. 100 episodes. Tonight will be, I promise, at least 1% as entertaining as the sum of all of our podcast parts.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
Nothing really special planned, except for, sorry, goodnight.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
What do you meant to say? It's, boy, do we have a show for you people tonight.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'll make it special in any way that you want me to make it special, but it's not like the show is...

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Take a shirt off.

01:28.000 --> 01:43.000
I mean, the show is not famous for its preparation. I was afraid, you know, in doing things, special things that we would just be...

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
I think that would run kind of, what's the word? Anathema? Yeah, yeah. It wouldn't really be a Harmontown episode.

01:50.000 --> 02:01.000
We've got to make this 100 times the Harmontown episode, which means we have to plan 100 times less than we ever do.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
How could you plan 100 times less than zero?

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
It's just, that's it. It's just a regular episode, see? The math checks out.

02:12.000 --> 02:22.000
Hey, Jeff, what do you make of these? What do you make of these people? I've been watching some more true crime shows with Aaron.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
You're, what, you're...

02:25.000 --> 02:38.000
I used to watch the Forensic Files and the FBI Files and the extreme forensics, Solved, Colon, Forensics Gone Wrong, Wild Crime,

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Snapped, Semicolon, Women of Forensics...

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Like the Dateline kind of things? Those murders?

02:46.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, that gets a little polished for me, but we started watching this show, which I think we're done with now.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I think there's only six episodes of it. It's called Murder Comes to Town.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
And it's just like every other show, it's all the same murders and stuff, but the focus is on the town, so it's just sort of like...

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
It's just like any other kind of like crime show where there's just interviews with these police that couldn't figure out who killed somebody until someone called and told them that they did it,

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
which is, if you really watch these shows, that's what always happens, like there's always, there's always three quarters of the way into the episode.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
And then they got a break.

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
Then police got the break they were looking for. And it's always like a phone call from either a nearby police enforcement agency saying,

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
like, we found a finger, or it's just a guy going, like, my cousin did it.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
But anyways, not to digress. Tonight, no tangents, 100 times less tangents than the normal Armageddon.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I was just watching because we were watching because there's always the reenactments in these things.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
They show people, there's people talking to the camera, and then sometimes there's people that they hired to play those people.

03:58.000 --> 04:09.000
But then sometimes, as in murder comes to town, and I think it's at a case-by-case basis, I'm assuming it's based on the participants' willingness,

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
sometimes the person that's being interviewed is then in the reenactments.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
What?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
No.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm like, well, yeah, my daughter, then my daughter was missing. She was gone.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And then they'll show that woman waking up in a bed.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
What?

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
You know, and there's like a Johnny Mnemonic poster on the wall to make it period or whatever.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Because it's 10 years later.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
This poor woman is like answering a phone going, hello?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
No.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
No.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Okay, I'll be right there.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
And like hanging up the phone.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
It's like there's a director telling her, okay, your daughter's missing.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
It's a cop on the other end of the phone. Sweetie, sweetie, work with me.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
The director, what's my motivation?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
And then including like really like tripping out on this one, it was this good natured,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
seeming like loving mother whose daughter had been abducted and eventually murdered,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
because the show's called Murder Comes to Town.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Don't hit me with your spoiler shed.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
The show's called Murder Comes to Town.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
The daughter's missing and she's, she's gonna murder her.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
And the woman is like, so they show her re-enacting the moment where she found out her daughter's missing.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Then they also show her like the day that she last saw her daughter alive.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
So they show her like walking down a hall, opening a bathroom door and going, sweetie,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm going to work.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Okay, mom.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Bye.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Like the director then calling her, hey Monica, could you stop crying in the middle of this?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
At the time this scene takes place, your daughter's still alive.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I don't know why you keep bursting into tears.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Where were those in the last scene?

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
It's just, I can't even, to be a fly on the wall of that production, these people are just,

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
just random people.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
And sometimes it's like cops, like the cops, you know they're into it when the cop is like

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
putting the guy in the hood and he's like, don't move pal, don't even breathe.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
And he's all, you know, he's playing himself and trying to act like he was like, you know,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
die hard.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Is that the character's name?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
You're thinking of Jaws.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Do you have a question, Jeff?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Dan, what does it all mean?

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
There was a quote in the show that there was a murder that took place in Kansas or something.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And then the narrator said, the narration is like incredibly poorly written.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Like they'll do things like they'll go, there was this one I had to rewind.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
It was like, did they just use suspicion as the dramatic button on the end of two sentences

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
in a row?

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
So it was like, but then there's only a matter of time before hope gives way to suspicion.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
And the hopes and dreams that were pinned on the former family members give rise to suspicion.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Like he acted like he never said suspicion before.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Like they're just, they're just fucking, they're like, we don't have time.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Just say shit about murder.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I know it's been done a million times.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Who's that white-haired guy, Keith, you know, what's the fucking, the creepy...

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
The ghoulish guy that they've done on SNL.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
What's his name?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Bill Hader does.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
He's the worst writing in the world because it's all questions.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
But why did she go there?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And if she went in there, why did she do it?

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Well, listen, I always wonder too about the people that participate in these shows, they're

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
doing these interviews and they're talking about their beloved person being killed and

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
what it was like to find their brains in the thing.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
And then they're doing these interviews and they're crying during them.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
And then sometimes the show is called like, peek-a-boo, I killed you.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
You know, like it's like not quite on the side of the victim exactly.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
It's more on the side of murder kind of.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Like that's where the murder comes to town.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
The narration is like, the guy is like decidedly, he's like, but what happened?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
She went jogging.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
That's the last time anyone saw her.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
But no amount of jogging would keep her alive during her rape and murder.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
It was like, what are you making fun of her for dying?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Oh, she was jogging, get it?

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
Like what if you were the mom and you saw that and you'd be like, I cried in that interview.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
They told me to look at the camera and cry.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
You say that you watched all these episodes meaning it had there been more.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
There were six of them.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I think they canceled it, but yeah, I'll do more.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Because the other ones are all, I feel like I've seen the same murders and stuff.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And it reduces the viewer to this weird thing.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Like Aaron and I were like, you know, going through the menu and we're like,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
two elderly people missing in a truck.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
That's a hitchhike.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
Well, this is one girl, but you know, you know, you know an ex-boyfriend just murdered her.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Like, you're kind of like, you know, you're reduced to fictionalizing human beings.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
But anyways, one more thing about this.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
The horrible narration, I wrote this down.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
The guy said, he was talking about the town.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
It's always about the town is, the town couldn't, that's the gimmick of this show.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
The town couldn't believe it.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
This town and the size of this town, this kind of murder, you never, you don't forget it.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Like in New York, everyone's like, hey, Glenn's missing.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Fuck it.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I think that's why they break New York into like smaller subsections, right?

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
So that, you know, it's an appeal to the people outside New York for a little bit of humanity.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Like, look, we're not just a giant city full of people.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
If my neighbor gets killed, I care.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Because I'm from Brooklyn.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Section three.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Anyways.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Did they ever find Glenn?

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
The guy was saying, but it, you know, Boner Hurt, Kansas.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Boner Hurt?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay, we'll get back to you.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It was close to that.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
You're naming it.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Boner Hurt.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
They'll show a shot of the water tower and then a cornfield.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Boner Hurt, Kansas is a quiet town full of church going folk.

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
And this is what the guy said, he said, you could call it the core of the American heartland.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
You could call the word heartland synonymous with core.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
You could call a heart a core.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
You could call a core a heart.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
You could clean up this sentence, motherfucker.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
You could call this town in Kansas the core of the big apple.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
But not, but very far away from that, from that apple.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
You could call it the center of the epicenter.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
A kind of confluence of nexuses.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
Boner Hurt, Kansas lies at the intersection of crossroads.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Is it five o'clock yet?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
All right.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
So, well, we have special shit to do and I know it's going to, you know, it's going to eat away at us.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
It's going to eat away at our time.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's not going to eat away at us.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Before we go real quickly, I've been reading these books that are, like, by Philip Kerr.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
They're all these detective novels set in World War II Germany.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
It's a detective, like, kind of a la Raymond Chandler.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And he is a cop during World War II.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
It's great shit.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's like awesome schlock.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
But also, like, I love World War II documentaries and I love Nazi documentaries.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
And I feel, like, in my, I know this is not a charming admission,

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
but, like, is it wrong to wish that World War II had gone on longer so there'd be more documentaries about it?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I mean, that's what TV does to us.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Because it just, like, some channels should just be called just, like, we love Hitler documentaries.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I saw, I Instagrammed it.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
There was a, I swear to God, I did.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
How can we prove this, Dan?

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
There was a, I was going through, I was looking for a new app to play on my fucking fat slob pad

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
that I sit in bed and eat donuts on while I watch murder shows.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
And I came across a review of this Sims game where this woman was like,

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
she was, it was just like an eight paragraph essay about how they had,

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
they had updated the free Sims game that she had been, that she had raised her grandchildren on.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Because she's like, my grandchildren would come over and when they were three,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
they used to like to just watch the people walk around.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
And as they grew older, they learned about how to interact.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
So she's like, she's, believe me, her opinion matters the most about this free game

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
that she's been fucking because she uses it to raise children.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
And then they released an update that makes the Sims die of old age.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
They used to be immortal, Jeff, and now they die of old age.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
And I was talking to them about it and someone was putting photos of the Grim Reaper on their Facebook pages

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and they saw them and they started to cry.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Now my grandchildren are crying.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
I don't understand why these Sims have to die.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I thought they could live forever.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
And she's like having a fucking nervous breakdown in a review under the app.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Was this review helpful?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Yes.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
It has summed up our universe entirely.

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
I don't know if it's helpful to anyone, but maybe Nietzsche or Kafka.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
I mean, she was like, she had become more sim than human because the Sims were now capable of dying

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
and she was just this weird program complaining.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh boy, anyways.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
But yeah, I'm just a hop from that with these murder shows now.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Ah, Teenage Hitchhiker.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
The Sims couldn't die.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I played the Sims for like three days.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
And the woman that was my avatar, my gal or whatever,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
she just kept getting bummed out and there's flies in the kitchen and I hated it

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
because I thought I'd kill her.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So I just stopped doing it.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
You couldn't kill her?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
She would just sit there and be miserable for the rest of time?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah, I don't know.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I can't answer anyone's questions about the Sims.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
How do they die now?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Like, old days?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Like, do you have to wait 80 years?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Or do you have to like...

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I never played a Sims game.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm neither proud nor ashamed to say.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
I love, like, I play like Gardening Mama 2 and the...

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I'm not above reproach.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Erin bought me a New York room to the Nintendo Star.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
She said, you'll like this game and give me Gardening Mama 2.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
And I was like, fuck you, I get your joke and then I kind of liked it.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
She always leans over and looks at my screen at the wrong times.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Like, I'm always in the middle of changing a diaper or helping a stork grow.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
What?

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
You know, I like time management games and like Gardening.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
I like Gardening and not in real life.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
Alright, speaking of bad writing, we were driving here and Erin played Rocket Man.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
So you'll know how to finish these lyrics.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
In fact, it's cold as hell.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And there's no one there to raise them.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
If you did.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
If you did what?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Raise them?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Yeah.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
You just said it's no place to raise your kids.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
There's no one there to raise them if you raise them.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, except you.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
What is it?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Is it just Elton John doesn't know a life outside of the nanny system?

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
It's like, oh, then Mars ain't the kind of place to have your nanny raise your kids for you.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
There's no nannies on Mars.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
In fact, it's cold as hell.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And there's no one there to raise them.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
If you did.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Dot, dot, dot.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
If you raise your kids there.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
If you did choose that lifestyle.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Mars ain't the kind of place to settle down and raise your kids.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
No, still not.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Still bad writing.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Musicians, 6,000 years are getting away with bad writing and counting.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
They bang on things while they do it.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
There's a hand being raised out there.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
If you dig?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
If you dig?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Are you just guessing that?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
That's what I always thought it was.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You always thought it was if you dig.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Someone look it up.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Look up lyrics for us right now.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I mean, if you know what I mean, there's no one there to raise them.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
If you dig.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
If you dig.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean, there's no one there to raise them.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
If you dig.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
He's just checking it.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I'll fucking give you.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's the Elton John equivalent of, you know what I mean?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm gonna give you a $10 bill if that's correct.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
$10 is yours, sir.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Did.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Thank you.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
We saved me $10.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
This is a sea of iPhones.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
If you dig.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I wish that was it.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
All right.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I think that's better.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
All right.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Let's move on.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
To Crocodile Rock.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Now this song.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Crocodile Rock.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
I get so mad at musicians because they get away with

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
like stuff that, you know, I don't know.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
They're just kind of like, they're so fancy and free with their goddamn lyrics.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
It seems like it's part of their success.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Like people don't want my overwrought fucking meticulous bullshit in there when

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
they're tapping their toes.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
People just write these songs.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
They're like, they change tenses.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
They change like from first person to third person.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I don't know who he is and who you are.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Someone's stealing someone's girl.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Who the fuck is?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Who are we?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Again, like, I might make it in this wrong.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I love the movie by The Who, Quadrophenia.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
And it's a great rainy day, depressing movie.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
And it's all the soundtrack, of course, is by The Who.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
And Sting is in it when he was young and not a complete twat.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And he was just great in a silver suit.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
He was great.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
But they thought Quadrophenia meant like, what if you had four personalities?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
They thought Schizophrenia meant two personalities.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
And they're like, okay, we kind of, we kind of.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I thought it was just a rip.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I never saw that movie.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I just assumed it was like some kind of like product placement

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
for the new speaker system or something.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Quadrophonics.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Well, I think that was the riff they were trying to do.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
Rock and roll music, lyrics shouldn't be looked at too closely.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Writers and musicians.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Why can't they get along?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
You know, they do in like Christina Aguilera songs or something.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Because people that aren't singer-songwriters,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
they have like a nice 45-year-old man sit down

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
and write a little ditty.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
Hand it off to a young sexy urchin whose voice is good for two years.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
And then they go, I'm a genie in a bow to rub it.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh, the metaphors all work.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Oh, you rub me the right way.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm a genie and make a wish.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I wish the genie was happening.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, this is great.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It's like William Goldman wrote this.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
He did.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
He did.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
An old guy in a log cabin wrote that.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
He had A-cups.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
He's not someone that you want to rub the right way.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, guess what?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Beauty's only skin deep.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Have we talked about...

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
We need to work together.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Ugly people are smarter than you.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Have we talked about in this show a piano man?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
The regular crowd shuffles in.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
The man in the bar sit next to me making love to his tonic and gin.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
No.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Gross.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
No.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
You don't get to change the name of the drink to suit your purposes.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh, I thought you meant it was gross because it sounds like he's coming in his drink.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Making love to his tonic and gin.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
He's scary over there with his dick in the jar.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
You can see the strands floating to the top.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
And he swizzles his drink with his balls and his stink in it.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Janitor's getting him up.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
We're getting played off by the ghost of Jebediah Nerdmelt.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Get out of here.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Your show doesn't have a script.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
It's terrible.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Greg Barrett did that joke 20 years ago.

19:42.000 --> 19:51.000
You've conditioned these people via systemic deprivation to applaud rhyming mop with whatever you rhymed it with.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Other people have acts.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Tonic and gin.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Making love to his jelly and peanut butter.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
That's fucking...

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
That's just lazy bullshit.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Also, the gambler.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I like Kenny Rogers a lot.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I love Kenny Rogers.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
When I was nine in Acapulco, so I love the guy.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
And the gambler.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
He rhymes sleep and keep twice.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I think that's lazy bullshit.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You don't do the same rhyme twice.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, how about he did the same song four times?

20:23.000 --> 20:30.000
Everybody saw the farmer with the magic peanuts.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
How does that the gambler?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Fuckin' they're all just like...

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
I don't know the musical terms, but I know the fucking guy just sits down and writes a fucking...

20:39.000 --> 20:46.000
writes the charge of the light brigade and puts it to like...

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
It's always about a guy.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Can you sing me...

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
I don't know your knowledge of the Battle of Balaclava.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Or Alfred Lloyd Tennyson.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Would you please do me a country version of the charge of the light brigade?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Canons to the left of them.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Canons all around them.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
But the man with one leg came to town and said that he had found them.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Out of Misty River's country night.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
This character broke even.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
And that's the story of Kenny Rogers of a guy named fucking Stephen.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It's always a guy.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Alright, I'm thinking of two sides.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Coward of the county and the gambler.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Coward of the county is a good one.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
But you know if we brought up Kenny Rogers' album, you'd see a bunch of failed attempts.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
He started off in a psychedelic hippie band called First Edition.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
First or second edition?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
First edition.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition is.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
And that's him.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And when he left that band, they're like, you're never going to make it, baby.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
He said, no, I'm going to make country music.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
He's like, you'll never make it.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
And he went off and wrote some of the biggest hits.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You know he's a Scientologist.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Is he?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
A Psych Guy.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
You never know.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Who would have thought Beck, you know?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Who would have thought Will Smith?

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
If I found out Kenny Rogers was Scientologist, I would give Scientology a second glance.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
Well, I don't want to bring this up again, but you should read that book going clear.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
You would, AI, you come away from it with a respect for...

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
You don't dehumanize people just because they're Scientologists anymore after reading that book.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
I wouldn't either if I ever met a Scientologist who would sit down and explain what it is that they do.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
But it's so goddamn private.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Well, then read this book going clear.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's like 700 pages.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I can't talk to a person that's a...

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
I don't know.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Maybe you can.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Well, yeah, you can.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
There's independent Scientologists.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
There's also that guy Marty Rathben.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
We just watched a documentary about him.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
There's a lot of people that were raised on this religion.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
How much more ridiculous is anything?

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
You know, we've had Mormons on stage talking to us about Mormonism.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
We've had... I think we had a Jew once.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Speaking of which, I'm assuming he's Jewish because of his last name.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
Adam Goldberg has a special surprise for us.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
That's pretty anti-Semitic, you guys.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
He's a human being.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh, you hate him the person.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I'm sorry, I connected those dots wrong.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
No, Adam Goldberg, he went on to Reddit.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And he... Do you believe that?

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
I'm going to suspend my disbelief.

23:27.000 --> 23:35.000
He culled together through rigorous research and conversation with Harmontown fans

23:35.000 --> 23:42.000
in honor of our centipestodial spectacular.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
He has an 18-question trivia quiz.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
It gets better.

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
We were thinking that you and I would go up against a Harmontown superfan from the audience.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
And see if one of you could get more answers right about our show than Dan and I.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Is that right?

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Yeah, given the fact that we're always in a blackout drunk.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Oh, they're going to win.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I already know the results.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
So should we have them elect one of their own to be that representative?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah, well, I don't know how they'll do that.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Let's set them against themselves.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
Who here thinks that they would probably be the best at answering Harmontown trivia?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
We have a few hands up.

24:30.000 --> 24:38.000
And it's Holy, but he's so hard to understand.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
What does fuck y'all mean?

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Who do we got?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
MC?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
You think you got the goods?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
MC, bring it up here.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Fuck it.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I like the look of this guy.

24:54.000 --> 25:03.000
We're going to give MC a chance here.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
Oh, it's good.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah, we'll try to lightning through this.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Where's Goldbug?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Goldberg, are you here?

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
Adam Goldberg, everybody.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Hi, MC.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
MC, what is your curriculum vitae?

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
What are your credentials that you think that qualifies you to beat Dan and I at our own game here?

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
Well, I recently binge listened to the whole show.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Okay, you already got us.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
You already got us.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
All 100 episodes?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
All 99 episodes?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
How long did it take you to get through all 100?

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, I started listening when I started a new job.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
And that job was about like two months.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
And with the exception of like Breaking to Watch whatever was like new on Lulur or whatever,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
it would be like the only source of entertainment.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And I caught up.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
Oh God, he's got to hate me more than the rest of you combined.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Have you been to the live show before?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh yeah, totally.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I think I've seen you here before.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Basically, once I caught up, that's when I started attending.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Okay, so how many times have you been here live?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I think this would be like my fifth or sixth?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Can you describe the nature of that job without getting in trouble?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah, it was an animator.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Sorry, a storyboard artist on a show called Bojack Horseman.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
It's going to be on Netflix.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
It's genuinely good.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
And that was the only thing keeping me from like...

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Dan, what do you think of myself out of window?

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
What do you think the pitch the log line is for Bojack Horseman?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Bojack Horseman.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
How the West was won on the side.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Like it's got to have some kind of like misfit cowboys.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
It's actually got Alison Brie from Community on it.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Fuck the show.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Like there's no actors looking for work, right?

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Give Alison Brie another job.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
No, what is it?

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Can you give us the kind of conceit of it?

27:03.000 --> 27:13.000
It's about like a out of work actor who's like trying to like cope with his like self-loathing and depression.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
But like he's a horse.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
He's a horse.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
He's like a horse man.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
He's a horse man.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Is he a centaur?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
He's like a reverse centaur.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
He's like horse from the neck top.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
Oh, he's a horse centaur.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Is it live action or animated?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
It's animated.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It's live action.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Well, he said he's a storyboard artist.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
It could be live action.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
They would have to plan the horse composites.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
Well, also it's cast entirely of the people that you don't know for being in cartoons.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
You know what I mean?

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
Like it's like Amy Starris is in it and the friggin from Breaking Bad.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
What's his name?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Jesse.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah, Tim.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
All right.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Well, sounds good.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Let's kick this off.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
So Adam Goldberg, tell us what the rules are with what we're doing here.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Well, there are three answers to every question.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
One of them or two of them is correct.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Did one of them is correct?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
I want to say that I had a story about the Sims, actually.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Adam, what are the rules to the game that we're about to play?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
My brother went up.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
What are the rules?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
You are here for one task, Adam.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I'm married.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
It's our hundredth fucking show, Adam.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
We're not going to do this.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
I will shout you down.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I will play the game.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Play the game.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
He can't.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
He's actually...

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
You're going to make me lie and put yourself in your thing.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Okay.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
So I'm going to ask questions.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I thought he was going to wax rhapsodic about Sims for a while.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
The only story is my brother is married.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
My sister is into their family.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
You're compulsive.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
For money.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
For money.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
You know, I normally don't get to give my two cents because I'm usually just listening to it,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
but I'm pro Goldberg.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I'm cool with hearing the story.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Don't suck up to the judges.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
I mean, I always go back and forth because the minute someone says,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
I'm pro Goldberg and 150 people boo,

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
and he doesn't pull out a rifle or run from the station,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
then I become pro Goldberg because I'm like,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
what the fuck is this?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I don't need your pity.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Can you just say you're pro Goldberg?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And then look at his face.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I'm anti Goldberg.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Boo.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Thank you.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, we discussed this forever.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Harmontowns for Misfits.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
He's clodious.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Are we going to go start a colony on the moon for Misfits?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
And we're just going to start.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
As soon as we get off the spaceship,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
we're going to go, all right, where's the nerd?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Get out of here.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I need a space suit.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Get out of here.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Yeah.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
There's 99 spacesuits.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
All right.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Adam, tell us the rules if you would please.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm going to ask the question either of team Dan Jeff or team Guy

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
who worked on the Centaur Show.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
MC.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
MC.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
That's easy to remember.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
And apparently not.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I don't like suck ups.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
It immediately changes my opinion.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Yeah.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
I'm back with these guys.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Don't care.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Yeah.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Oh, come on.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
You just go where the wind blows, man.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
And if you just don't know, the other team can steal.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
If you're like, but it's multiple choice.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
So that's unlikely.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
All right.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Who wants it first?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Team Dan or team MC?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
I'll take it.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
MC.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
MC.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
So if I get it wrong, like do I get knocked out and someone else has to,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
like we need to round around and sell like that or?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
No.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Okay.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
How does the scoring work?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Most out of 18 questions.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Most out of 18.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
All right.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Let's fire through these.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
It's only a four hour show.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Okay.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Real Obed proposed a restaurant where everything is really small.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
What was it called?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
A real Obed's real food for real people?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
B bites or C mini mine?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
B bites.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
That is correct.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
One point for MC.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I knew that.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
I knew that.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
I almost feel like you could have eliminated the multiple choice out of that and had us

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
try to freestyle.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
But let's see what goes.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
If he gets into the lead, he'll hop to freestyle.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Okay.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
This is a challenge.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Okay.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Yeah.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
He's already in lead.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
So that doesn't apply.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
MC has jumped out to commanding one zero lead.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Okay.

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
Give each person that you ask, give them the option of, if they can get it without getting

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
the multiple choices.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
That's two points.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Two points.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
All right.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
There we go.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
All right.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Okay.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Which is not a fiction.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
I can't do that for this.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
This is which is not.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Okay.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Which, how many episodes did Dan wear the eye Harmon?

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Do you want the multiple choice?

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
It's my, yes, I want the multiple choice.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
The multiple choice.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Okay.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
A is two to three.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
B is four to five.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
And C is exactly six.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
B, four to, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
A, A, two to three.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
That is correct.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
One point for Dean Dan.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
All right.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I would have gotten it wrong.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
I wrote it down.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
That's why I knew.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Two against one.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Two against one?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Because he's listening to them all.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I never listen to any of them.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Oh, I wasn't using Jeff.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
You're saying I'm cheating by using Jeff?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
No, she's saying that we have two heads or better than one theory.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
But believe me, he just listened to them all recently.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
So he has access to this more recent information in his head.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Also, I wasn't thinking that Jeff and I were like both.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Thanks.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Thanks.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I was going to say sweetie, but it's 2014.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
I might see a blog entry tomorrow.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Dan Harmon called me sweetie.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
The story of humanity versus the asshole.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
MC, which is not a fictional Harmontown character?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
A, Death Row inmate O'Malley.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
B, Jerry McSeinfeld or C, Coomail 2.0.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
I'm going to go with A.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Death Row inmate O'Malley, that is incorrect.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
We're all tied up at 1-1.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
All right.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
In the episode, everyone's a rapper.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
Comedian Misha complains that everyone in his family calls him the same name.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
What is it?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Give me multiples.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
A, snap the Jeff.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
B, Misha Kwan or C, Jackie Chan?

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Everyone in his family?

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Everyone in his family gets called the same name.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Oh, I'll try C.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
C is correct, Jackie Chan.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Nice.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
I'm on the team with you, Dan, but I'm laying low.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
Oh, okay, I'm laying low because I have no idea what's going on.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
MC, what's ill-tempered skeleton did the gang piss off to start the Trial of Tormod Tour?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I'm going to need the choices.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
A, Lenev, B, Lannister and C, Fornheim.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Lenev.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
That is correct.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
I hope it's no one's first time here tonight.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
We'll have him come up and give a review after I answer.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
It's kind of a fun show, I guess.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
I'm going to go play Peanuckle with my uncle now.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It's called Peanuckle.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Go ahead.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
How many times has Jeff said...

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
It's not starting, I'm sorry, what?

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
How many times has Jeff said that should be the title of the episode or some variant?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I'll take multiple choices.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
A, 12 times, B, 15 times, or C, there's no way I would look that up.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
Well, knowing you, you looked it up.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
12 times.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Nope, I didn't look it up.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Oh, he's fine.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
I mean, looking it up would entail hundreds and hundreds of hours.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
I would have been curious how many times he said it versus how many times it was.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Because there are some times where I was like, yeah, it should.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Oh, it's not, though.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
It's something else completely.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
That's some homework for you guys to do.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
One of MC's tires is going to be flat and there's going to be a note that says,

35:12.000 --> 35:19.000
why don't you run the game?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Then you will not be Pro Goldberg.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
One person on the side.

35:23.000 --> 35:31.000
All right, MC, which episode manages the earliest episode naming coming in less than 72 seconds into the episode?

35:31.000 --> 35:40.000
A, push the button, pull the chain, B, dudes and goo, or C, felicity whack-a-mole?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
This is for us, right?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
That's for me.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Oh, for MC.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
I'm going to fill this one.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I think I know this one.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I'm going to say A.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
That is correct.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
I was wrong.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
Daniel, Shoney's loving audience member, Big Red, went to this college.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
We're a team, right?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Yeah, you can chime in if you know.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
He and I are together, right?

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
Yes.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I'm not going to guess, but I want to hear the multiple choice.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
I think I might know it, but I'm not confident about it.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
A, Azusa Pacific, B, L.A. City College, or C, UCLA?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
I was wrong again.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I think it's Azusa.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Because I was going to say something kind of along those lines.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
I think that ring a bell.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Why would words like Azusa Pacific ring a bell?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I go with that one.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
All right, that is also correct.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
The first thing I thought came to mind was San Luis Obispo, and then Azusa Pacific seemed like, yeah.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah, he was from San Luis Obispo.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Oh, is he related?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
I don't care.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I'm a fucking genius.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
MC, name three sentient beings that Quark has had sex with.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
Name three, he hasn't.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
That is actually a harder question.

37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
We'll move that to the bonus round.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I feel like I could, but go ahead and give me the multiple choice.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
The name three things?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Yeah.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
I have a list of four things.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Oh, shit.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Okay, so I can't write.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
All right.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
A horse?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Yep.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
A giant spider?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Yep.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
A squirrel.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Did you have sex with a squirrel, Jeff?

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Did I?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Yeah.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
That's it.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
He summoned the squirrel to have sex with it.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
I also would have accepted Sharpie Buttsalot and Quark.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Oh, well.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
And Robobreffy.

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
Hey there, lonely squirrel.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Spencer once appeared on community as Annie Edison's brother.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
What was his first name, Dan?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Isn't that a trick question?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Didn't it get changed?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Would I ever trick you?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Going with the canon of the show.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
In other words, what his name was on screen.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
God damn it.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Oh, I know what it was.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
It was the opposite because I wanted it to be Andy originally.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
Because if their parents had named them after Raggedy Ann and Andy.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
But that didn't legally clear.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
So his name was Anthony.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
All right, that's correct.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I would have also accepted Spence Word.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
So you would have accepted what?

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Spence Word.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Spence Word.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
I thought this was going to be a question for Herman, but I don't want to show it.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
All right.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Okay.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Before breaking out, this is MC.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
Before breaking out in Backbrace Dynasty, Adam was a production manager on a terrible

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
shark movie.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
What movie was it?

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Is it us?

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
No, it's MC.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Oh, shit.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
I know this one.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Give me the choices.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Okay.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
Avalanche Sharks, Sharkano, and Shark Island 2 Sharkbite.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Shark Island 2 Sharkbite.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Nope.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
I meant that one out.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Oh, all right.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
It's getting close.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
What's the score?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Oh, I can steal it?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
I know it.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
You can steal it.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Avalanche Sharks.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Right?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
No.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Is it?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Okay, you can't.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Okay, next question.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
It wasn't Sharknado or whatever.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
No, Sharkano.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
It wasn't Sharknado.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Oh, sorry.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Avalanche Sharks.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
Which turned into Avalanche Shark once they didn't have enough shark puppets.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
Two people got carbon monoxide poisoning because they got really, really low quality

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
trailers.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
All right, next question.

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
No, because the audience shouted out, audience got a point.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
You guys are now in it.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Okay.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Audience, you're now in third.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
All right.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
In the episode, frequently I am a woman in my dreams.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
Who admits to frequently being a woman in their dreams?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Is that MC's or ours?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Yours.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Oh, okay.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Me.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, Jeff.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
That's correct.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
I would have also accepted Aaron.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
I bet you would.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Oh, is that insulting?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
I don't.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
All right.

39:59.000 --> 40:08.000
All right, MC, for two points, two of Dan's foot fetishes.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I'm going to name one of Dan's foot fetishes.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
You can name the other two for two points.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Or I'll give you one more and you can get it for one point.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The first one is dangling.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Right.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
There are two more that start with that letter.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Heel popping.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Yep.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Dipping.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Yep.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
You got it.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Thank you.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Wow.

40:27.000 --> 40:38.000
We have the worst podcast in the world.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
But the best listeners.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Certainly the best listeners.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Boy.

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
In the Neil Hamburger, Tim Heidecker segment, Dead or Alive, how did Hosni Mubarak die?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:51.000 --> 40:58.000
In episode 108, in the Neil Hamburger, Tim Heidecker segment, how did Hosni Mubarak die?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I mean, you get...

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
You let him do it.

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
The correct answer is he died choking on a rod, he ate in some stew in an art gallery.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
He choked on a rod.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
That was a Harmontown episode?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Oh, no, that's comedy bang bang.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
I thought you guys...

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
What the fuck are you doing?

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
They haven't had me on yet.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
I need to suck up.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
No, that one's just stricken from the record.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah, okay.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Doesn't count.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Next, the final question.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Okay, thank God.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
And then the final one will be a top up.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Top up.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Convertible.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
How can Chicken Noodle Man of the eponymous song Make His Troubles Go Away?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Who's this for, by the way?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
This is for Jeff.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
All right.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
I know it's not.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I guarantee you, I know the Chicken Noodle Man question.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I helped write the mother.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Wait, is it an MC's turn or Jeff's turn?

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Are you sure?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I'll give it to MC, because I feel Jeffness.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
One more time.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
That's the question.

41:50.000 --> 41:57.000
How can Chicken Noodle Man of the eponymous song Make His Troubles Go Away?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
So easy.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
He feeds the devil's soup.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
That is correct.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
He feeds the devil's soup from his penis.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
All right.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
That was a lob.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
My girlfriend knows that song.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
He's pretty much tied up.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
The audience has fallen behind, but this is the last one.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
You're going to have to buzz in for this one, because it is the tiebreaker.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
All right.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
It would break.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
MC is winning, but this one could break the tie in favor of Team Dan Jeff.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
All right.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
All right.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Duncan Trussell.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
We buzz in.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
What do we do?

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Say buzz?

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Yeah.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Christopher twice, once chopped off Christopher's ding dong.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
He also carved something into Chris's arm.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
What was it?

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Bzzz.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Yep.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
A pentagram.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Nope.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
All right, MC, if you get this one, you've got the game.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
If not, I am out of questions.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Shit, man.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
It was about something Camille said on his own show about a game, and I cannot remember

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
what game it was.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
He said, how can you have a gaming podcast and not talk about Starcraft 2?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I'm going to count for MC in the audience.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
MC!

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
All right.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
MC wins.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
Thank you, sir.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Thank you, Adam.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Thank you, Adam Goldberg, everybody.

43:12.000 --> 43:20.000
It was a lot of hard work for both Adam and all of us, right?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We all deserve a round of applause.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
No, but thank you for putting in the research, Adam.

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
Without that segment, we really would not have had a hundredth episode special at all,

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
you know?

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
It felt like something you would do in a hundredth episode special.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Otherwise, it would just be me talking about what?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Crime shows?

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
What am I?

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
The what am I guy?

43:44.000 --> 43:51.000
If you went to another planet and there was only one of the three possibilities available

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
to you that women could do or you could watch on porn.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Heel popping, dipping, or dangling?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
You had to pick one.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
What is my favorite out of heel popping, dipping, or dangling?

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
What's your desert island heel fetish thing?

44:08.000 --> 44:17.000
Well, you get dangling out of there right away because there's no activity to that.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
Dangling is what follows a heel pop.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
It's built into the heel pop.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
And heel popping is built into a dipping.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Was dipping again?

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Well, dipping could be like a lot of things.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
It could be like a woman like, well, no, no, that's just heel popping.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Okay.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
Well, dipping is like the shoe is on the floor and the foot is going in and out.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Dipping.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
Yeah, like the woman is lost in thought.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
She's just casually dipping her foot in and out of her shoe.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
I'm presuming that a lot of foot fetishists are heel fetishists,

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
but I'm presuming that you'd want a little bit of all of those.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Yeah, I think that's why they all come together.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's like eyes, ears, nose, and throat.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
You don't bother to...

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
But again, you have to pick one.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Well, tell that to an eyes, ears, nose, and throat guy.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
It's like, oh, I'm an optometrist.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I mean, who needs those?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
All right.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
What about that?

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
What is that?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
What do you go to an eyes, ears, nose, and throat guy?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
There's such a thing as an optometrist.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It's like, just an eye guy.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
I'm trying to picture all three separate somehow

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
and give you an actual sincere answer.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I guess...

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I guess dipping.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
All right, dipping.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
On our 200th episode, that would be a trivia question.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
All right, let's bring out my fiancé,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Erin McGathy.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
All right.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Hello.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Hi, Scoops.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Hi.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Scoops?

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
It's a dipping reference.

46:21.000 --> 46:27.000
Scoops Johnson was the evil Keneval of Dippin.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
Anything you want to address or anything?

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
Well, I was trying to think of my own fetishes.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
I guess not.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
I don't know.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
No, doing great.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Do you have any fetishes?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I like smoking.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
I know it's really bad for people that I do things with.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
That's just called an addiction.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
But if we're talking about...

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
You mean you look at how guys look when they smoke?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Yeah, not people I know,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
because the only person I know who smokes is Dustin Marshall.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I imagine him back there being like,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
oh no, oh no.

47:11.000 --> 47:17.000
No, I like fetishes outside of...

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
I missed the first part of the exchange

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
that you just had about the dipping,

47:23.000 --> 47:29.000
and Jeff asked you what your favorite pornographic foot thing was.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
Out of it, because there's this...

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
Dipping dangling heel popping,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
it's kind of like I'm saying,

47:38.000 --> 47:45.000
that's a more specific long-winded way of saying shoe play.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
Shoe play is under the branch of foot fetish,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
which is, I don't know, then there's...

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
That's a big tree.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
The real tragedy of this,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
and if you guys have been to the show while I've ever seen pictures,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
I usually wear these boots and these tights.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
It's because I don't have feet.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
And backstage listening to this...

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It's actually...

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
That's the best reaction to it ever.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
It's when I acquired my foot fetish.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
This is when we became intimate,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
and I realized you had no feet.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
I pine for feet now.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
She can't help it.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
I mean, I have one fetish for saying last name, Dan Harmon.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
Just all my sexualities wrapped up.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Men and women, I think, work differently.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't have...

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I think a foot fetishism is a very male thing.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Are there a lot of women foot fetishes?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
So they're gals?

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Would anybody admit to it? Any gals?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
It seems like women wouldn't have a fetish,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
because guys' feet are like, wow.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
We're a foot fetish.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Once we go down this road,

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
we're going to run into this millennial L.A.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I have a listening fetish.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I have a...

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
I have a compassion fetish.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
I have a thoughtfulness fetish.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
So why me?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Well, because it's, you know...

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Are you also a...

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
That's what makes it funny.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
In the same way that she has no feet.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
No, but I do like smoking.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I did once sleep with a man,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
just because he looked like David Bowie,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
and I requested that he smoked while he had sex with me.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
And then I felt very ashamed,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
because I did very much use him for that.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
And because he sustained a lot of burns on his face, right?

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
No, no, he was smoking.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
He was smoking.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
He had to smoke a cigarette while having sex with you?

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
I made him put on...

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I'm going to regret this immediately,

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
but I asked that he...

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
He didn't know that I was going out with him

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
just because he looked like David Bowie,

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
and we got back to his...

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Which era, David Bowie?

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
Modern love, David Bowie.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
And I asked him to put on a David Bowie record.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
And then he had cigarettes because he was a smoker,

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
and I said,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
you probably have to smoke right now, right?

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
He was like, what? No, no.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
He was very dumb. He was very, very dumb.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
It was not a proud moment,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
but I asked if he could smoke a cigarette

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
while making love to me.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
And holding a glass ball on the other hand.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
And asking you or telling you

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
that you remind him of the babe.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
What babe? What babe?

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
What babe? What babe?

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
Sarah.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Oh, my God.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
The 100th anniversary episode guest,

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
David Bowie's here.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Wow!

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Aaron.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Aaron.

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
I'm here because you asked me to be Aaron.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Sheriff, I...

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I set my fiancé here.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
So, when David Bowie comes out...

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Shut up!

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
His name is David.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
I'd like to make love to you

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
while smoking and eating a cake

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
or offering you bites of crumbs and sauces.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I'm a musician.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
I don't have to write well.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Oh, Dan.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
Dan, you have not returned your books on time.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Are you calling David Bowie Dan now?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
I'm confused.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
No.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
She's countering with...

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Oh, I see.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
You have not returned your books on time.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
Ugh, these stockings make my shoes slide off.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Ugh.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
It's so embarrassing.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
It makes my shoes slide off.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Oh, yeah.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Can I hit pause on this?

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
That's like the equivalent of just an irregular porn

51:54.000 --> 52:00.000
and an actor saying, like, God, my vagina is so penis-shaped.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It's like an inverted penis.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Like, one would just fit in like a...

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I mean, Dan, I've never seen any of these.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
I've never seen any of these videos.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Can we just attempt the talking version of this?

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Well, I don't watch it for the talking.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Is there...

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
In your shoe play video...

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
In your average, like, just run-of-the-mill,

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
work-a-day shoe-play film or scene.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I mean, there's no such thing in it.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Oh.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Oh, Krippendorf's Tribe.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Krippendorf's Tribe.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
No.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
There's no run-of-the-mill...

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
The Casablanca.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
There's a lot of...

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Remember, you were telling me once about a pantyhose video,

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
and you said...

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
We both knew that they were called challenges.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Okay, you were cleaning out my shit,

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
and you found a VHS tape, and it said,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
like, summer's pantyhose challenge.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
Yeah, I found one.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
I found one.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
All right.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
I found one with many other friends.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
There was, you know, Christina's pantyhose challenge.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
But you were like,

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
look, I knew when I was cleaning up stuff,

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
I'd find stuff.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I'm not here to judge you,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
make you feel awkward in front of 200 people,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
or anything like that.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Like, you said all that.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
And then he said,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
but for my own edification,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
because there's no such thing as a VCR anymore,

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
could you please tell me what does that mean?

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
What is the challenge?

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
What is the challenge?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
And I said,

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
I think it just means, like, how many pair can she put on

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
in one video?

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
And then you started laughing,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
and it was like, yeah, it is ridiculous,

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
the idea that it's a challenge.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
But then I found out, like,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
45 minutes later, that the whole time,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
you thought that meant all over each other.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Like, that she was just, like,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
had these giant legs, like,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
number 58.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
And she was,

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
she was on That's Incredible.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I had continued cleaning,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
and I came back in, and I was like,

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
I could do that.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
I mean, how many?

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I was like, what was the most?

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
You know, like...

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
You saw the word challenge.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
That's your fetish.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
It's competitiveness.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
You're like, challenge, challenge.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
I'll win that.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Anyways.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Is there dialogue in a shoot play video?

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Or is it all from the table down?

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I mean, it depends on what you're talking about.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Like, I'm 41 years old.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I predate the internet.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
There's, I have seen,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
there's candid stuff,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
where it's, like, actual creepy, like,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
like, I'm on a train, and here's, like,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
there's a woman seat ahead of me,

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
and she was, she was

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
heel-poppin' dippin' or whatever.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
There's people that have websites,

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
or there's videos like that.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Then there's...

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Do you think people like their shoes,

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
or hate them?

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
What?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
In the video.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
No, there's no narrative.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
There's no Bruce Banner of heel-poppin'

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
that's like,

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
oh, if only I could find out

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
how to get these shoes off,

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
or the shoes are...

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I think the whole thing comes from,

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
like, a probably,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
there's probably the root of the tree

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
that has to do with leg and foot fetishry.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I don't wanna offend anybody

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
who shares this stuff,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
but I would hazard a guess

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
that there's a root

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
among that tree.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
There's a trunk of that tree

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
that has a little bit to do

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
with self-loathing,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
and, you know,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
more voyeurism and less intimacy,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
just to, like, like,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
maybe little kids playing under the table

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
with their matchbox cars

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
that were raised in the 70s and 80s,

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
whose first sexual thought

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
happened at the same time as, like,

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
you know, just looking at a woman's

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
fully clothed legs,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
as opposed to, like...

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
I don't know if there's women out there,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
like, wishing there were more videos of men,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
like, like, croc-dippin', you know,

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
or, like, like...

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
I mean, this is like...

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Bootslide.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
For this audience,

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
as soon as you were to say anything gender-specific,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
there's somebody that's gonna be the exception.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
There's always, and it's like, like,

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
we're trying to learn not to draw these gigantic circles,

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
but the conventional wisdom has it

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
that men are a lot more visually,

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
like, we're a lot more given to this thing

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
called fetishes that are visual

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
because there's something that's more,

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
like, we're more able to associate imagery

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
that goes right to our libido,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
and women aren't like that.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
I don't know if that's a passe now,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
if that's, like, just something that we've become,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
that we became accustomed to thinking about men and women

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
in the 70s and 80s, or 90s,

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
and now we're starting to actually second-guess that.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
I know for sure there's always gonna be

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
somebody that's gonna stand up and go,

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
I'm a woman, and I'm totally visually stimulated,

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
and they're not gonna be lying,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
but I also, like,

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
how can you have general conversations about sex?

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Remember that Ray Fiennes movie, that guy?

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
What's that guy?

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
What did he find out?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
He found out we're fucking insane, we're all insane,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
because none of us talk about sex with each other,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
so we don't, you know, we...

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Have you guys ever watched porn together?

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
You and Aaron?

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Tell me about Liam Neeson.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Liam Neeson, right, that's where he finds.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
Liam Neeson's here, everybody, for the 100th...

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
Are you gonna come up with a little pop in the video

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
and watch a little porn together?

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
Well, in the way that Dan's established that his porn is just

57:04.000 --> 57:10.000
ladies that are, that have like a ledger,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
and no, no, we have never, we have never watched,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
we have never watched, we have never watched.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Porn together.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
We have never watched porn together.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Never watched porn together.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Anyways, do you watch porn with your girlfriend?

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
No.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I don't know what kind of,

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
and I think it's great when couples do,

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
I think it's great.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
I don't care whether or not they do,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I think if they do, I think that's...

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I don't know if I talked about it when I did your,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
this feels terrible, but I dated a girl a long time ago

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
and she brought home, we dated for like 45 minutes, I think,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
but she brought home some porn and she wanted,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
she's like, I've never watched porn with a guy before.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
I went to a video store, I bought some porn,

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
and one of the titles was Let's Play Pussy Darts.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
How do you win, how do you win, how do you win?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
That's Aaron's next question.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
How did they know who won?

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I'm assuming that's the guy saying it to the woman,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
like wait, am I the dartboard? That's the worst.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Let's play pussy.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Oh, it's just a euphemism?

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I was actually trying to picture it.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
They probably started playing,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and then they got caught up in the moment

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
and they didn't finish.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Let's play pussy.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I've been misled by these titles before.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
We'll never know who's the bastard pussy darts.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
You know what, you know what buns me out

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
is the new thing in the 21st century,

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
the new porn thing where they don't,

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
they don't have to come up with pun titles anymore

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
when they do the Flint Bones and the Robocock and stuff.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
Like now it's just, now it's just like the new thing

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
is it just says like, you know,

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
XXX Brady Bunch or this is not Flash Gordon,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
I don't know what the fuck.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
Godzilla, Godzilla the porn version.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Like the titles aren't clever anymore.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Godzilla the porn version.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Wait, are the pussy darts in that movie just penises?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I didn't watch the movie.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
I think pussy darts, pussy darts must be

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
just a euphemism for regular old missionaries.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
And I will forever call penises pussy darts.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Forever.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Look at all the pussy darts.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Everyone can always feel like a winner, yeah.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
It's like bullfrog again.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
But then women just have targets.

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
Then it's a bummer.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
We got to, let's get Spencer up here for this conversation.

59:35.000 --> 59:43.000
100th episode, Spencer.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
He's a hundred times the Spencer.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
Spencer comes as Geared 100 times.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
What's up you guys?

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Hey.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Pussy darts.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Spencer and I have watch porn together, though.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
I throw them.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Yeah.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
You throw pussy darts once in a while?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I guess.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I guess that's what I said, yeah.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
At the end of that movie does the woman look

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
at the guy slash the camera and say, nice grouping.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The camera just pans out or pulls back

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and there's just a bunch of penises.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Some are like on stomach.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Some are in the hand.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That one's a redo.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
They just shake hands at the end and say good game.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It all takes place in a pub.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
There's a chalkboard off to the side.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I told you the thing.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
This is a second hand, but it's not like anyone's not

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
going to believe me because it's like somehow the topic

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
of porn came up and then from there the topic

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
of these gang bang videos came up where there's these

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
gang bang videos where it's just like let's set the record.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Let's make sure the most men ever can have sex

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
with this one woman and it's very like, you know,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
she's on a vinyl ottoman and it's just like a warehouse

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
full of men and it couldn't be less sexual

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
if you made it just the weather.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But it's like then the top of the DVD case would say

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
like 150 or 200, you know, it's like an arms race.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Somebody was talking about one of those videos that they saw

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and it's just men.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Who was this person?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I can't even remember.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I was your ex-girlfriend.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Sorry, sorry.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
All I remember is the punchline.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Let's not get too distracted by all the particulars.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
The punchline's not even that good.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
The guy that we were talking about those videos

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
where there's just like these lines of guys

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and then you can see a guy, like two friends

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
and yes, race is important to this story.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
One of them was white and one of them was black

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and they were like whispering to each other and giggling

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and then they both got into the line and came up

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and then the black guy went first and he finished

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and then his white friend that you could see off camera

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
like out of focus like giggling with him

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
then ran up as his black friend went away

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
and announced in a kind of stilted like nervous

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
like this is what we agreed we'd do.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Voice said, you've had the chocolate.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Now here comes the milk.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And I was like, wait a minute, what?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And I was like, I have 500 questions.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Why is that the dichotomy?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Is his skin the chocolate?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Because his cum looks like milk and so does yours

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
and that should have made you realize that race

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
is an artificial construct while you were gang-banging.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
This woman, how about class systems and fucking misogyny?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
What are you trying to break down the wrong barriers here, man?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
These guys were only 30 in line.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
If they had been 200 or so, they would have had time

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
to kind of workshop that thing.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Something about the breakfast.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I'm going to say this, I'm going to say this.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
No, no, we can push that up.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
There's milk in both of you.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Work with that if you want to focus

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
on the color of his skin.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
There's got to be some kind of right Oreo M&M.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I don't know what...

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I'm not going to think about it because I'm not racist.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I care about this lovely young lady

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
who only committed the crime of staying up past curfew.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
You know, her dad's wondering where she is.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Here comes the milk.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
You've had the chocolate.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I mean, you should have just said white chocolate, I guess.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I don't know what he should have said.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
He should have said...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
He should have been at home thinking of ways to...

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
He should have said all government is a lie.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I mean, that's your...

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
This is your one chance to be heard.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Property is theft.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Silence is consent.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
We've all been marginalized

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
in a military industrial complex to believe

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that we're participating in a democratic system,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
but revolution doesn't happen in a curtain booth.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
If voting was powerful and illegal, ah!

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
He just gave you liberty.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Now I'm going to give you death.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
No, that's weird. That's bad.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
That's bad.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And silence is consent is complicated.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
That one I just...

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah, that one was just in a drawer of aphorisms about...

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
How do they find...

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I feel like Spencer might know this,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
but you know fun facts like this.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I'll take it from here.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Spencer after dark.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
What's the question?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
In a gangbang video.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
How do they get all those guys, do you think?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Why do you suppose Spencer knows?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Because Spencer knows how people message board each other.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
You've been in the Tarzana area.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You've been approached by one of these vans

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
where you've seen eight dudes huddled up in the back

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and there's the driver going, hey, you want to be in a porno?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Usually when there's eight dudes in a van,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
they're selling vacuum cleaners.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Wait, what?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Those are just ladies.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Why does it take eight guys to sell a vacuum cleaner?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
It's a very rigorous process.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
That's your first mistake, Jeff.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It takes eight guys to sell eight vacuum cleaners.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I'm the Alec Baldwin of this vacuum cleaner company,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
and there's David Manit play called, suck and profit,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
always be suck and profit.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Suck and profit.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Has anyone ever seen a poster that's like,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
gangbang this Thursday, please come and clean?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I think there's a lot of corn insiders, right?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It's a whole industry.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
They probably have a lot of bunnies and stuff.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I think it is a whole industry.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
But there's giant gangbangs.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Those guys aren't all professionals.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Those are the roommates and neighbors of the guys

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
that are professionals.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Have you guys ever gone to Sardos for a porn star karaoke

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
up in the valley?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Wow.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Half our audience.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah, I went there once.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
It was a long time ago, and I didn't know that's what it was.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I went to meet some friends.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I go, this is porn star karaoke.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
What do you mean?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
These are mostly porn stars,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and there was little leaflets,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
little flyers on each table,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
and it almost had

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
the drawing of two people fucking,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
like a walk-don't-walk, like spec-stick people.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It didn't go that far,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
but it said like, please,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I think it had like a clip art thing of people kissing

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
or maybe bent over and fucking.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
But it said like, please do not

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
have sex in the neighbors' yards.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Okay?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Which was like,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
we've had a lot of complaints.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Like, this is karaoke people.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Yeah, we know the phrase,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
porn star karaoke could possibly mean,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
hey, try fucking.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Give it a shot.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I think these porn stars, they just get together,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
and they all just find a bush,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and they all just start doing it.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Wait, do they sing?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Oh yeah, they get up and they sing.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
They turn around brown eyes and all kinds of shit.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
That was all confusing.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Hey, Spencer and I were driving.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Spencer kind of drives me around a lot.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
It's cool.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Because I found out

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
through the Uber Revolution,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
that I really don't like driving.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And then after Uber got lame,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I just realized,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
well, Spencer's on the payroll.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I could pay for his mileage,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
and he could come pick me up for work.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Where am I going?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So I really just like being driven around.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
It's fun.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So we were driving,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and there was this guy picking his nose

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
next to us.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Have we discussed this?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
There was a guy picking his nose,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and by the way,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
does everybody use their pinky?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I know this is going to freak people out

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
when I said that I wiped standing up,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
but...

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You still wiped standing up?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Yeah, I didn't change

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
because I found out that

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
everyone does this other thing for 40 years.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I'm fucking like...

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
If there's one thing...

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I'll never get over that.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I know, I looked it up now,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
and it was like 40% of the public

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
wiped standing up.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And we're human beings,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and we're among you.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
According to the statistics...

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
When you wipe standing up,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
do you sway back and forth ever?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Yeah, I imagine it's like...

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I'm a little cloud baby

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
making my poop

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
just gotta get it out

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
of my cloud, cloud, doof poop.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So listen,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
and you pick your nose with your pinky.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I pick my nose with my thumb.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I pick my nose with my thumb.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I use every finger at my disposal.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I don't know how I would use a pinky.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
To me, that would be like

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
trying to open my...

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
like use my foot

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
to put my car key in.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I don't know.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I use my thumb because then you have a shield.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Yeah.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I'm doing it right now.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That's what you've been doing every time you do that?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
What's the shield in this equation?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
In this equation,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
the shield is my fingers.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Oh, so they block vision.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I got you.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You meant that your thumb had a shield on it.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And I was like,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
a thumbnail? All fingers have that.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So I'm sorry.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
So there was a guy picking his nose

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
in the car next to our car.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And I was like, yeah.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And he was clearly like

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
when you see somebody picking their nose

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
on the road

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
in the car next to you,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
it's not like

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
it's either one or the other.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Either you see someone that's not willing to pick their nose

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
in a car next to you,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
or you're seeing someone that is totally willing

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
and they don't care about shields.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
You're seeing what they're doing

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
because they don't give a fuck.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And I've always been curious about that

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
and I'm sure so has Seinfeld.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
But,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Hey, what's up

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
with your 100th episode?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
So I say to Spencer,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
a guy picking his nose is weird.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And then Spencer says,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I don't care.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Those are the people I would pick my nose in front of strangers

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
on the road.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And I said,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I would myself say it and then I realized

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I'm really fucked up.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I would pick my nose in front of people I knew

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
way before I would pick my nose

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
in front of someone that I would never see again in my life.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Because their opinion

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
is what really matters.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And I was like, wow, I have like

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
syphilis of the soul.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I would tend to feel the same way that Spencer does,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
but I wonder if maybe that

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
the way that you feel makes you a better person, Dan,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
because you want to

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
respect the people that you know.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But I agree, I've done grosser things

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
around people that I don't know

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
than people that I do know.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
But wait, I want to respect the people that I do know?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
No, he's willing

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
to gross the people that I know.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And disrespect the people that you do know, I guess.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
But you're less worried about the...

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Well, wait.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I feel like each person is like a character

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
that's like...

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I feel like I have 100 tries with Jeff

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
to be a decent person.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
If a stranger,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
that's why I'm always really freaked out

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
in public about

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
people like

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
in the next booth over.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
You're a worse person.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Because I feel like those people...

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Yeah, you really care about their opinion.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
They're God or something. Those are God's eyes.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Because I'm never going to see them again.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Yeah, you'll yell at me if I'm being too loud

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
in public, or being too

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
womanly.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Or just like...

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I was trying to make a joke

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
about you telling me what to do in public.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
But you do care about the way that...

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I don't know, it goes back and forth with you.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
When you took your flight with Dino

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
a couple of days ago, you didn't care about

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
the people around you, but the other times...

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I did, though. That was my worst nightmare.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
But I was having a good time with Dino

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
on the flight out to New York, and I knew

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
at the outset. And I had a witness this time

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
because it was for the adult swim up front.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
So that guy JJ that had

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
drilled in his teeth at the

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
up front, that he was sitting a couple

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
rows back, and he came up to me at the up front

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
and said, what the fuck did you do on that flight?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
We were laughing, we were having a good time.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
He's like, god damn, I was watching the whole thing.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I'm like, they're not doing anything. Jesus, Dan Harmon

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
can't not get into trouble.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
People just don't like him.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
What happened? Well, just this, you know,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
flight attendant came and crouched down

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
in the midst of Dino, and I just like...

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
We were just being happy.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Remember our flight? Yeah, but we were

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
shit good. Well, we were...

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
We were in Vegas for 17 years,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
and we like, should have left a long

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
time before. We

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
looked like trouble, I believe. She came and

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
squatted next to me and she said, you see,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
you know, somebody asked

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
me to tell you guys, could you please keep the volume down?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
You know,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I think that was the...

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Someone's working. Just a minute.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I think maybe that information came later, because

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I was just like, I just get devastated.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I'm going from the height

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
of my happiness to having a great

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
time. I'm laughing.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Were we the loudest people in

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
first class? Probably,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
if you're going to bother to chart it.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
But...

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Everyone else had headphones on.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It was like, we were

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
also not being very loud, in my

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
opinion. I'm pretty self-conscious

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
about this stuff, because

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
my worst nightmare is what happened, which

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
always happens to me, which is this

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
woman squatting down next to me and saying,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
could you guys pipe it down?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
You know, like you're bumming.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Someone on this plane who will forever remain

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
nameless and faceless wishes you would

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
fucking die and go to hell.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And then just...

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I can't go from

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I'm having a good time,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I love my life, to

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm having kind of a good time.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I'm going to go from that

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
to fucking I want to slash my wrist.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I hate it when people say that they're going to play devil's

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
advocate, but I'm going to play devil's advocate.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
You just said that this happens to you

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
all the time.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Are you maybe the common denominator

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
in this? This happens to you all the time.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Do you think that just the world is against you?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Wait, do you

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
tell me, you've been with me for three years,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
do you perceive me as a loud

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
person in public? No, I don't.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
If I told you that I get

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
chastised a lot

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
in public, and I get

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
stared at a lot in public, and

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
if I told you how many

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
times per year someone

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
in a restaurant stops

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
what they're doing and leans over their booth

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
and says, excuse me, I'm listening

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
to what you're saying.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I myself

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
am in an improv troupe.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It's a good

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
it was a helpful workshop for me

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
and I don't think it's fair to say.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
The thing you said that really...

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
How often does that happen to you per year?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
If I told you six times per year for me

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
would you go like, okay something's weird

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
or would you just... I mean, my...

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
What did I ever do?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I was telling you

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
it just happens to me all the time and I'm telling you...

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Do you guys remember when we were in Scotland

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
when we were talking about this, we went to the

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
my girlfriend's from a small town called South Queens Ferry

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
and went to this little museum

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
on the high street, this small street

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and we had gone to a pub.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
We'd woken up and said, we're going to go to a pub crawl, there's seven bars

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
along the street and we're going to start

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
at one end and we're going to do all the pubs

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
and we did them all and it was great fun

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
and there's this cute little quaint street

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
that's unchanged for hundreds of years

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
very quiet and quaint and cutesy

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
and it's like pub, antique shop

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
pub, antique shop, restaurant pub

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
and there's a little museum

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
tiny little two-story affair, we go up there

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
and there's a little old lady who looks like a librarian

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
in Ghostbusters and she's on a typewriter

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
and she's just like quiet and not talking

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and Dan goes, I got to go pee

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
so he's like, as far as I know

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
you go out to look for a restroom

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
and then you've gone for like 15, 20 minutes

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
and we're like, I don't know

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and then we found out that there was no restroom

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
in the museum so Dan had gone elsewhere

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
so Erin says, I'm going to go look for him

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
so Kate and I are upstairs

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
with the little cute old lady on a typewriter

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
which is amazing

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
and it's graveyard silence

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
midday along South Queen's Ferry High Street

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
and then I just hear

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Dan!

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
What are you doing?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I lost my wallet!

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Get over here!

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Get back here!

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I lost my wallet! What are you doing?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
You couldn't have been far enough away

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
that you couldn't have walked and had that conversation

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
and the little old lady just

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
did he just say he lost his wallet?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I said, we all heard it

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
and it says that the whole city

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
heard this conversation

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I couldn't

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I was standing outside

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
a bar that I had attained

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
special permission to walk out of

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
because there was no cell phone coverage

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I hadn't paid for my drink

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
because Erin had my wallet

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I had bought a drink

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And I always do

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
A big part of the story is that

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
on the street no cell phone coverage

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I had bought a drink because I felt

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
like a homeless person using their bathroom

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I didn't know if things were like

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
if that was a trans-cultural thing

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
but I felt very

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
awkward walking in

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
and using a place's bathroom and then walking out

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
so I went to the bar, ordered a pint

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
used their bathroom, came back

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
couldn't pay for the pint

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
my phone has

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I can't text Erin, the phone has no coverage

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
and then I explained

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
the whole thing to this poor woman

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
who did not buy a ticket

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
to that ride

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
but now everyone's

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
like eyeing me because it's like American Werewolf

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
in London, I'm just like

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
this guy that's got this fucking

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
story and I'm like I'm just gonna step outside

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I just got cell phone coverage

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I know I can't pay for the drink now

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
and it's like I just seem like a very suspicious character

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
at this point

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
and I see you walking out of the pub and I'm just waving at you

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
so I'm tethered to this place

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
by virtue of financial accountability

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I have told

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I have made a big deal out of

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
if I make a break for it grab the pitchforks

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
so I'm like staying

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
so I'm just like and there's Erin

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
and she just keeps

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
she's tethered by

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
outrage, the burry man

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
to a museum

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
and she's just screaming at me and I'm screaming at her

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
and that's what you heard

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
so the next day

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
so dad comes back, we find out

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
he had to go back to all the bars we went to that day to find his wallet

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I never lost my wallet

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I thought you did lose your wallet

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
he had given me his wallet

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I was holding onto his wallet, he went to the pub

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
he came outside, I didn't know where I went

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
we were about to just hear a weird

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
what was the story gonna be

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
and then we met a man with a red hat

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I thought you actually lost your wallet

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
you actually had to go look for your wallet after that

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
but you had it in your purse

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
yeah he had given me his wallet

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
for some reason

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
and then the yeah

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
so there was this moment when Dan and I

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
are a hundred yards away from each other

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
and I'm in the most angry way

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
possible

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
waving and yelling because I really wanted him to see

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
my reason was

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
dumber than his because I was like

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
you have to see this exhibit

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I really wanted

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
him to see the burry man

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
and so I was screaming the burry man is here

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
which must have been even weirder for the museum lady

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
because she was like no one has ever been this excited

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
about that

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
no one's ever been in that museum before

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
but Dan was

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
well someone was in there and took a piss

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
and had some cats with him

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Dan was fuming on the other side

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
based on the smell

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
it does smell like a cat pee in there

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I think the difference is that

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
you nobly so this is something I admire about you

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Dan

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
is that like you have a lower tolerance for people

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
like strangers trying to

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
like get their own

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
fun out by telling people to stop

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
doing stuff and I'm more

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
willing to be like oh I'm so sorry I'm so sorry

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I fucked up but you stand up for yourself

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and for the people you're with

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
well I couldn't decode that

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I'm terrified of strangers

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
in general so I get more

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
mad at them when they fuck with

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
other strangers

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I tend

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
to do what they say over my own best

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
friends like I'll just go like fuck it

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
it's not worth it this total

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
stranger is being high maintenance

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
let them have their high maintenance moment

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
don't let this moment be about us

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
in a bumper car ramming into them

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
don't give them that story

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
let them be this ignorant

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
blustery person that's just

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
speeding through our lives

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
path of least resistance, Taoism

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
let them through

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
and so sometimes that ends up with me

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
like actually

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
like being more respectful

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
to total strangers

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
than to the people

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
closest to me

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
what you just

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
spent the last eight seconds of me

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
talking making these weird plastic

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
man faces like your

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
turbo teen you're gonna turn into a car

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
what were you going to say?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I don't know I guess I disagree

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
you disagree

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
with what I was just saying?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I do, yeah

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
you disagree that I have respect for

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
no I think you're a respect for other people

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
but I haven't seen this behavior that you're talking about

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
this like that

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
you're talking about when I get mad at like bouncers

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
bartenders, waiters

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
people

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
old guardians, parasites

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
people who are

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
those people don't count

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I understand what you're saying

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
you're thinking of specific stuff

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
these people are a blight

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
people who have put themselves

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
in a station where they have decided

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
to lord over one little section of earth

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
and make everyone else miserable

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
yeah I don't like those people

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
tried to keep my dad poor

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I think it's fair to make them feel bad

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
about themselves

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
flight attendants

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
waiters, DMV clerks

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
cops, pedestrian

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
lawyers, on our flight you and I were pretty

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
incensed by the fact because we thought we were having just a good old time

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
we weren't like barfing and

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
stumbling down the aisles we got in our seats on a southwest flight

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
from Vegas back to LA

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
and yeah we were drunk

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I didn't think that we were causing any trouble

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
we were giggling like mad

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
but it's a flight back from Vegas

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I've done that flight a million times

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I've been a little bit drunk and everyone's giggling

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
and the flight attendant came up to us

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
or was it the fucking pilot

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
somebody

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
somebody with some fucking epilotes came over

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
you guys good?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
it was the flight attendant first

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
flight attendant came over first

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I think we told the story already

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
the flight attendant came over first and said

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
would you guys like something to drink

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
asked us that and then I said

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
oh do you have a kettle one

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
vodka

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
and then you ordered something and she's like

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
have you guys already been drinking though

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
a little bit

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
let us down this canal

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
it was so fucking rude we had to

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
adjust the citrus

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
in our mind

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
she conjured images of cocktails

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
in our thought balloons

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
we were Mario and Luigi trying to grab a

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
magic hamburger

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
and then poof made it go away

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
you're drunk

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
fuck off

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
can I get you a soda or anything

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I was like no I was like kind of chasing

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
and just felt bad

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and then she walked away

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
five minutes later some dude comes up

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I think it was just another flight attendant

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
but she was like in the front of the plane

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
maybe going like

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
now her sensitivity is an issue

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
she feels like chasing

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
so he came back and said

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
but we made a joke when she walked away

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
it wasn't like oh we have a bomb on the plane

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
we didn't do that

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
we kind of went like oh

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
we did crack wise

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
as she was walking away

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I think we gathered up with little shards of our integrity

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
fucking like cradled them in our

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
little pathetic palms

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
in a post 9-11 world where these bureaucrats

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
are newly empowered

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
it was a fucking worst man we didn't do anything wrong

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and I never do anything wrong

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
and anyone that says I do

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
is an enemy of

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
the people

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
and the people don't include anyone in the

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
service industry

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
alright anyways

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
it'll be in my blog

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
okay I don't know

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I don't have any rules

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
strangers opinions are important to me

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I don't know why

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
that's the weird thing

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
the isolating weird thing the scientific experiment

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
of the car next to you

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
is a unique one because as Spencer pointed out

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
you're literally never going

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
to see those people ever again

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
and there are some people who are liberated

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
by that enough that they'll just

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
jam their pinky up their nose

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
while they idly stare by there are some people

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
who are just like fuck with you

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
look over at you and make weird faces

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
they're kind of like hey it's like an aquarium

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
like who would have

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
and I struggled through the logic of it

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
well we're on Los Feliz Boulevard

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and these people take the same route and I was like

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
no I don't really think I'm ever going to see these people again

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
their opinion is valuable to me precisely because

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I am never going to see them again

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
strangers that's why I sit on twitter

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and people go like I love you

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
thank you thank you so much

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
six seasons and I was thinking about it

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
and then the one person goes like you douche

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
and I go alright stop it everybody stop

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
what's your name

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Samantha

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Samantha what the fuck

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
what makes me a douche

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I wanna know what makes me a douche

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
you tell me you tell everybody

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
step right up everybody

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
the douche detector is here

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
please

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
for your enjoyment

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
planet earth I present to you

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Samantha the douche expert

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
what was your first inclination

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
that I was a douche

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I just

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
was bored

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
you were bored

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
and then everyone else was always like

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
how come you never just say thanks

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
when I say I love you

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
is it because you hate me for loving you

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
no I just like

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
what is that

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
there's a dead pixel on my screen

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I gotta fix it

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
every person you contact

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
is like you're running your fingers

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
your life is running your fingers over

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
this harp

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
the billion strings

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
what if you found out that someone who is nice to you on twitter was a server

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
bartender

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I was being glib about that

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
are you saying Dan that you feel more defined

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
by the opinions of anonymous people

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
strangers than the people that you're close to

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
friends, family

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
yeah because it's like the backscatter machine

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
are you trusting

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
the waves that are being

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
objective and moving through your body

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
and probably giving you cancer

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
when we x-ray ourselves

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
when we take measurements of ourselves

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
we trust the strangers

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
among the particles and things

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
we don't trust the things that are stuck to us

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
we don't define our

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
when we measure things we seek objectivity

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
so friends

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
opinions of you can't be valid

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
because they're too subjective

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
well yeah they've entered into a relationship with you

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
they have a covalent bond now

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
their electrons are sharing

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
orbits and things

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
in your ideal world your family would be

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
every stranger that you met

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
but then the second that you had a conversation with them

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
they would drop away

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
they would just fall away

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
well I hope not

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
cause I mean you're not close to your family

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
yeah but they, I mean you gotta ask them about that

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
they waited on me once

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
and

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
they brought me

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
a lot of wrong water

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
wrong water

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
wrong water

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
it was ice

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
yeah it was solid

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
what's up with that

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I don't know

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
your reactions

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
to what I'm telling you guys

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
in a confessional state

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
almost sounds

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
subjective

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
well no

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
persecutorial

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
like you guys are not only

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
just seeking information

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
you're actually trying to get me to feel something about this

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I think we're trying to get to the bottom of it

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I do think that you

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
perceive any kind of probe

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
and question as persecution sometimes

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I feel like you feel accusation when there isn't one sometimes

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I've definitely

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
yeah I'm definitely airing on the side

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
of people wanting me to change

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
when I'm talking to them

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
well I mean

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
we love you

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
it's all nice

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
we just talk a man

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
we just chat

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I mean it is funny

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
like

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
you look so bummed out right now

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I mean the speech that you made about

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
strangers and stuff

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
it's confusing to me I don't want you to feel bad

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
or change or whatever

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
but your perception of the way that you interact

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
with the world is

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
great

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
it's great

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
it's certainly very different than me

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
because I don't give a fuck about strangers

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I don't care about anybody that thinks about me

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
not completely

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
but like

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
someone I don't know

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I definitely would chart my course

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
by people that I'm close to

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I really don't give much of a fuck

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
about

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
the

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I mean

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I don't know

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
one of the things I really appreciate about you

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
is I feel like you're less stressed out

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
about

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
getting the approval of strangers

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
in small moments like that

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I don't know

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
we're all saying

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
the opposite thing in every other sentence

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
and between the three of us

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
is virtually identical

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
and I feel like if I just said what you guys say

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
instead of what I say

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
that you wouldn't be able to

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
it's not that different

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I'm not trying to bring you down

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
but with bartenders

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I've been a server and I've been a thing

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
so I have a certain sensitivity

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
to people who are waiting on me

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
and

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
not that you're insensitive

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
because you're not

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
you're very very kind

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
you're a wonderful person

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
but we have a different

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
idea of what it is to be

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
mean to a server

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
or a bartender or a flight attendant

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
or whatever

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I feel like you're quicker to dislike

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
one of those people than I am

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
and maybe I'm more prejudiced than you are

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
maybe you're doing the right thing

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I'm quicker to dislike

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
but you're more prejudiced

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I'm more biased

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
this is a little boring

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I'm more sensitive if it was about nothing

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
and also

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
twice as long as 60 minutes

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I apologize, I just don't want you to think about it

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I think it was about something

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
we kind of fell off of it

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
talk about gender

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
to the extent that it has

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
the possibility of getting specific

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
it feels like we're getting caught up

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
in these general semantics

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I'm more concerned

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
with strangers' opinions

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
than I am with the people closest to me

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
it's a very intimate, interesting

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
thing to delve into

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
that's not true at all

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
what do you mean that's not true?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
now we're just back out into static

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
now we're talking about nothing

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
sorry

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
sorry, I had a reaction to it

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
but your reaction to it

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
was

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
disbelief, you thought I was lying

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
do you really want to talk about this more?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I thought you want to move on

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
talk about it later

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
yes, it's disbelief

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I have a different perception

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
but it's silly

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
sorry, I'm very sorry

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I always feel like the things I say

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I can count on one hand

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
the times that I'm thinking one thing

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
deceiving people

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
talk about what you said this morning at breakfast

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
when you said I like my race more than the other races

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
let's go from there

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
that's just because

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
we were eating cornflakes and it was a metaphor

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
it's crying in the corner

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
yeah, well, he's free to jump in

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
what?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
what do you want, Spencer?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
well

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I just, I really gotta go about that

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
wow, 100 episodes

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I was gonna go

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
but then I was like, don't want to miss

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
my big moment

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I'm not trying to be

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I'm not trying to be difficult

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I just really have to be

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
should we play a little D&D?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
can I get Adam Goldberg

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
to read

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
to read the D&D thing

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
while I go to the bar?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Spencer

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I didn't hear you say you had to pee

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
that's what I want to have happen

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
go pee, Spencer

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
can I get Adam to read the D&D?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Spencer, go pee

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
if we had a wireless microphone

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
we could play P&P

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
right there out of paper towels

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
that would be great

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Spencer could go in and describe his peeing

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
emptying your bladder into the poor

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
this is gonna be great

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Spencer just handed over

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
his D&D

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Game Master monologue to Adam Goldberg

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
who has appointed himself

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Seattle 2104

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
it's a goof, it's a gag

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
should we get the music in?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
wow

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Adam

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Adam, serious question

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
not joking

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
will you hear this audience

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
kind of bristle and boo

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
when you kind of lay an egg

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
like a planned word that doesn't quite work

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
or simply coming up on stage

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
hang on

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
kind of coming up on stage unheralded

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
like when you hear that audience reaction

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
like Adam was saying

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
that he is more affected by strangers

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
than by people

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I'm the opposite of that

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I think you and I are opposites in many ways as well

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
no, no, no

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I'm not trying to be cute

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
if I walked up on stage

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
17,000 times

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
or even 3 or 2

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
or maybe even 1 and I heard that reaction

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I would leave the country

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
there needs to be a bad guy

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
and being a bad guy because I like my life

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I'm happy with who I am

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
and it's easy to have someone

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I'm going to get cheered ironically

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
but I'm saying if it's got to be someone

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I'd rather be me than Aaron who spends a lot of time

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
on stage or damn

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
who shows about

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I'd rather be like oh it's this guy

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
boo this guy

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
but you don't mind the boo's

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I know that they're not going to

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
probably jump me shouldn't have said that sentence

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
but you're not

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
you're not hurt or negatively affected

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
it is what it is it used to bother me

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
but ideally you'd probably rather people be

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
specials back

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
now audience

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
what I just did was called

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
stalling for time

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
because I'm a god damn showman

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I worship you people let's do this fucking thing

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
he didn't read it huh

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
no I fuck

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I kept them talking like a hostage

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
a hostage negotiator

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
when we last met

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
our heroes had broken into

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Bill Mardigan's cigarette museum

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
hoping to steal up some cigarettes

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
but no sooner had they gotten

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
inside than they encountered

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Bill Mardigan the patron god of the city

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
a massive head of cigarettes

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
after some smooth talking

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Sharpie Buttsalot managed to convince

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Bill Mardigan to share a sacred smoke

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
which healed our party and cured

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
their curses

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
while Lorraine had to convince Bill Mardigan

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Bill Mardigan to help them

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
find the tarragon of virtue

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
but the police arrived

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
forcing our heroes to escape through

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Whizbulb's magic bucket

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
into a gnomish bathroom

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Sharpie had to poop and did so with great gusto

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
while Lorraine watched on

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Quark left the room like a normal person

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
and came upon a gnome

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
a gnome named Flizdan who was alarmed

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
by the sudden trio shitting in his house

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
after a lengthy and flimsy explanation

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
the gnome was calmed down

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
and revealed himself to be a member

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
of a secret order of gnomes

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
obsessed with discovering the floating isle

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
of paradise

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I'm so out of breath

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Jesus Christ ain't exercising

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
you just peed, you're dehydrated

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
and ran, I'm not dehydrated

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
but would Flizdan truly be able to aid the party

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
you're dehydrated, Spence

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
hopefully we'll find out this time

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.000
on Harmontown

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I think it's extra hot

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I think it's a hot summer

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
L.A. night

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I'm just fat and gross

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
because I keep thinking like

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I'm gonna wear a hoodie all the time

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
because there's a sweat rag on the back of my

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I keep using my hood

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
to wipe the back of my gross neck

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
if you didn't wear a hoodie

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
you wouldn't be sweating that much

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
it's a weird irony

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I don't think it's irony, it's called mathematics

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
it's not irony, yeah

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
it's the opposite of irony

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
total perfect congruence

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
with expectation

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I'm wearing a big

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
hot sweater

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
with a sweat flap on the back

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
that I used to wipe my sweater

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
sweat

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
sweat

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I used my ponytail for that

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
do you really?

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
and to SWAT it flies

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
is the ponytail absorbent enough

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
to take sweat off of your neck?

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I don't know, it probably has the same

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
hoodie effect that you were discussing earlier

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
which I would have brought up

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
if you didn't bring it up, Jeff

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
if you didn't have long, luscious, flowing

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
gorgeous romance

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
novel cover hair, Spence

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
what kind of haircut would you fancy?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I don't know, that's the reason why I have it

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
because I don't know what it would look like

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
short

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Anne Winthrop, Bob

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
do you remember any of those things I said earlier?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
yes

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
are we in Flizdem's apartment

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
or house right now?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Flizdem, you work for a secret society

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
of gnomes that want to find the Isle of Paradise?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
yes, that's a good summation

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
thank you

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I hate to be so expository

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
my friend, we just took a shit in your house

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
and we have a lot of fighting to do

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
it has to be done

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
we need to get there because we seek to tarragon of virtue

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
we're told that exists on the Isle of Paradise

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
yeah, you know

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I hear that's true

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
is it a sidebar with my adventurers

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
and I will clean this up

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
this is a little handle

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
oh, it does?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
yeah

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I'll be damned

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
this is Bill Martigan's son

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
you're a crafty bastard

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
you've invented indoor plumbing

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
guys, I use the flush

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
to mask the sound of my voice

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
wasn't the point of the tarragon of virtue

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
to remove the curses?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
yeah

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
from Christopher

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
didn't we get that removed now?

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
did we?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Christopher is still on

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
we're good, but Christopher

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
our soul bound

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
smoky chain curses

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
sorry about the sidebar

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I made a match

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I walked back out

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
and said

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
take us there

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I can take you to our secret hideout

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
ooh

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
is it on the Isle of Paradise?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
no

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
is it just your friend's restaurant and you get kickbacks?

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
yeah

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
what's at the secret hideout?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
that's where we hang out and gather

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
and talk about our exploits

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
let's go to the secret hideout

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
if you really think we'll be welcome

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
oh yeah

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
you're with me

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Flizdamn

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
you're a lot cheerier

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
than you were a few minutes ago

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I shook it off

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Flizdamn, what's your rank?

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
do you have a certain kind of standing in your society?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I'd say, I mean society

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
like, you're no...

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm an acolyte

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
yeah, it's an important...

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
that's good, that's good

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
we should go, okay, let's do it

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
later, that's the secret hideout

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
you arrive at a building called

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
the Burning Sycamore

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
it looks like a tree

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
it doesn't look like a flaming tree though

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
it just looks like a tree

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
but it is flaming?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
no, it's called that though

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
it's confusing

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
so Flizdamn, he knocks on the door

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
and he goes, it is I, Flizdamn

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
who seeks

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
a smoking zone

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
alright

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
and then he gives a series of complicated knocks

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
on the door and it slides open

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
and...

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
just like that

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
that didn't seem that complicated

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
it's kind of identical to a dead bird

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
just draped from...

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
and you see stairs going up

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
style

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
finally

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
I guess

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
so, let's go!

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
your shirt's cool that we're here

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
oh, yeah

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
right

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
the secret part makes us feel like

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
intruders

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
that's a good point actually

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
remember when we were in that fish for so long

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
yeah, the Infinifish

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
yeah, that was ridiculous

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
what?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I thought it would take like

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
maybe a couple

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
episodes

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Flizdamn, how do you know about the Infinifish?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
what are you talking about?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
metaflism

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
so, he goes up

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
he goes up the stairs

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
he goes up them

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I follow him

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
he leads you up these stairs

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
it's pretty shitty

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
it looks like a tree house

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
there's posters on the wall

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
there's props that are crudely drawn

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
and you just see a bunch of old gnomes

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
it just looks kind of like a gnome bowling club

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
or something

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
they're hanging out on these lounge chairs

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
that are all old and messed up

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
and they're just talking

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
and some of them are holding these weird flutes of liquid

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
it's probably a beverage

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
but um

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
as Flizdamn gets in

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
he introduces himself

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
he says, I am here!

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Flizdamn, I am

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
he looks at him

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
and one of the guys speaks up

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
hey, who are these guys?

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
and he looks at you

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I think we just realized we were taking Flizdamn's word

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
for it that he's totally cool here

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
we are friends of

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Flizdamn

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
and gnomes in general

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
we're adventurers and we're seeking help

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and passage to the Isle of Paradise

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
well, you've come to the right place

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
may I have a flute of liquid?

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
sure!

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Flizdamn, he brings you one

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
he's like, you should tell him your names!

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I'm Quark Pfft

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I am Mulray and Sedotta

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I am Sharpie

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Buttsalot

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
of the clan Buttsalot

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
seeker of knowledge

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
really?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
wielder of belts

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
mother of dragons

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
breaker of chains

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
seer of supplicants

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
misser of tonight's episode

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
hater of spoilers

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
DVR of

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
of it

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
watcher of it later

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
recorder of it on Sunday

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
nothing can be doneer about her

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
everyone looks at you

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
in silent judgment

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Flizdamn, he speaks up

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
this is Grax

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Thorax

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Limpa

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Lim Tong

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Lim Snog

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
and our leader Charles Hoffman

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Charles Hoffman

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
we are but weary travelers and adventurers

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
long ago we seek a cure

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
for our stricken friend

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
who is a curse that laid upon him

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
that only the tarragon of virtue

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
a lay and a swage

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
and a seeking passage

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
are we to the Isle of Paradise

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
then you and I are of two minds

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
if I understood most of that

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
which I think I do

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
because we're gnomes, you and I

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
oh yeah

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
can I borrow a cigarette?

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
you're a gnome I bet you love jokes as much as I do

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
you know, you'd think that

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
but we here at the Seekers of Paradise

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
seek a very particular kind of paradise

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
that our people call the

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Smoking Zone

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
you see, we believe that

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
smoking poisons our culture and our bodies

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
and we hope to seek

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
a paradise free from the evils

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
of smoke

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
it's unhealthy

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
okay, I don't need a cigarette, I'm good

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
that's very good to hear

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
alright, you know

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
but you said that we're of two minds

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
are you also gonna

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
you know

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
not sure what I said back there

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Charles Hoffman was saying that

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
yeah

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
about that tarragon

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
yeah, you know

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
I'm sure it grows up there

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
everyone says that, right?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
how do we get there Charles Hoffman?

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
you seem like a guy that knows

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
because everyone else has given us the real dick around

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
yeah man, we've been searching it

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
you see, it goes around in the sky

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
all over the place, it's hard to chart its position

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
but we've uncovered a relic

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
that we think could lead

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
us to paradise

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
what is that?

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
we don't understand it, it's a stone

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
tablet with strange markings

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
and we just can't decipher it

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Charby, you eat

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
strange markings don't you?

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
absolutely

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
semester at sea

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
can you show us this tablet?

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
you never know with us tall folk

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
up here

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
higher than you guys, we get exposed to different languages

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
that's what I was hoping

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
would happen

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
because you see, I have this stone

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
this stone tablet here

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
and I will present it to you

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
if you could solve

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
the riddle therein

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
it looks like a simon from the 80s

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I don't know, what are you talking about?

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
what are the 80s?

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I think the listener

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
needs to know that

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Spencer is holding up his iPad

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
on it

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
it's great for the 100th episode of a podcast

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
it's a...

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
can you solve it?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I reach over and I touch the red

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
part of the simon looking thing

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
the tablet cracks

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
into 100 pieces

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I thought it was a simon

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
and in its space

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
you see a magical rippling portal

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
that threatens

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
it doesn't even threaten, it begins consuming

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
everything in the room

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
it just looks like a game

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
if only we had been here when the game started

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
you just hit a random one

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
25% chance

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
so you feel yourself

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
being compelled into this portal

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
to who knows where

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
it's terrifying

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
it hurts in fact

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
you feel pain

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
we wait to see what happens next

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
can I

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
throw my rope

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
around

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
gross

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I throw my rope around

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
a sconce

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
and

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
tie the rope

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
I have the rope around my waist

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
and I throw it to

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Sharpie

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
and Quirk

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
so as to anchor ourselves

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
you throw the rope

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
and one of you has to catch it

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
which one of you wants to catch it I guess

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
can we both?

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
you can both try I guess

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
but you don't throw a rope at two people that's weird

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
well yeah I do

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
because I loop two loops that's called a Mickey Mouse throw

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
throw

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
okay

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
that doesn't work

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
fair enough

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
wasn't there a sconce?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
that worked

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
and Erin is holding on to this rope

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
but the rest of you guys

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
it's been me the whole time

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
but the rest of you guys

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
take some damage as you guys

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
feel yourself pulling into this portal

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Quirk you take two

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Quirk you take eight damage

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Jesus Christ I didn't know the goal was to get out of the portal

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
it seemed very transitional

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
well it was very suctiony

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
and damaging

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
am I still getting sucked?

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
you get sucked through the portal

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
as Mulraine watches on

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
tied to a sconce

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
hundred episodes

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
no one bought that

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I wasn't trying to end the show

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
that was too thin

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I just wanted to lace

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
we're building to

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
what I can only call a great

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
100 episode ending

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
alright so you guys get sucked

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
through this portal then right?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
alright this sounds up so high

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
on this thing

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
there's ads from the Simon game

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
it was a Simon game

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I just hit the wrong god damn thing

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
well you should have pressed start

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
yeah

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
you don't start with a color

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
that's crazy

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
if the game was already on

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
no the whole game is to

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Simon whatever is happening

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
nothing had happened yet you had to press start

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
well look

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
the dies cast motherfuckers

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
flying through the portal

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
like one would fly through the portal

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
like Mario and Luigi

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
searching for a magic hamburger

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
yeah

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
thank you so much

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
for calling that up

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I wanted to say

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
why are you only searching

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
for a magic hamburger

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
that would be so ridiculous

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
in the mario luigi universe

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I just want that to be a level

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
alright so

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
we're fast being sucked into the hideous portal

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
yeah and you're sucked through

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
and now you find yourselves in a magical

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
you see colors brighter

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
than any colors you've seen before

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
and colorful flowers

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
and happy little trees and bushes

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
dot the pasture

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
looks like a comfortable place

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
other than standing in the middle

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
imposingly

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
is a 12 foot tall angel

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
with dazzling wings and bronze skin

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
he holds a flaming shovel

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
and stands guarding your path

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
wait and I'm still tied to a light

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
it just happened through the portal

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
but you're like yeah

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
oh and the gnomes

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
are getting sucked through too

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
some of them are dying

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
oh Jesus Christ

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
so I was just supposed to

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
if I hit start instead of the red button

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I would have saved a lot of my kids

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
you guys feel gnome giblets on your back

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
oh Jesus Christ

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
god damn it

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I feel

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
really bad about that

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
well I mean

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
they handed it to you

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I know I love games

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
they had never touched it ever

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
they just handed it to us

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
it was the first color

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
here's what I think they did

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I think they fucking I think they false started you

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I think they hit a couple buttons

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
yeah because if the game hadn't started

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
and I just hit red it wouldn't do anything

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
the game was already going

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I don't want to

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
in order for you hitting

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
a button to make the game be over

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
I agree

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
that means the game had started

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
it's a set up that's what you're saying

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
it was not your fault

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
hey 12 foot angel shovel man

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
what's your name?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
over in your part of the woods

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
nothing for sale man

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I just guard the herb

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
you don't speak of the tarragon

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
of virtue by any chance

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
we probably got that

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
could we just have a slice of that action?

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
nah man

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I don't know how worthy you fools are

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
you haven't had a game of simon on you do you?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
no

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
what's that? that's a long story

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
sounds fun

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
you're fools

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
sharpie sharpie

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
he was just making conversation

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
don't fucking he might be a friend

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
weird way to start a conversation

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
we're not going to do this

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Yomiji

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
we are friends we come here in peace

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
we would love

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
what's your price for some access

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
into the garden

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
hey man you want to get access to the garden

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
that's cool

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
you could sample whatever you want

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
just tell me

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
tell me you're worthy

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
with the best joke in the universe

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
8 year old kids walking down the street

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
and he finds a welder's mask

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
and he puts the welder's mask on

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
he's playing with it he's flipping it up and down

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
the car pulls up older gentlemen in the car

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
the guy rolls down the window and says

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
the kid flips up the welder's mask

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
and looks at the guy and says

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
do you want to ride?

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
the guy is driving down the road

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
and the kid is playing with the welder's mask

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
flipping it up and down

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
and the guy says hey kid do you know what

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
sodomy is?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
and the kid flips the welder's mask up

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
and looks at the guy and says no I don't

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
and the guy is driving along

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
and he says hey kid do you know what

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000

what glacio is

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
do you know what a pedophile is

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
and the kid flips the mask up and says
