It's dumb.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nNobody!\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nEspecially Brooklyn, what an unhip burrow.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nAnyways, Jeff, improv was invented here.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.000\nIs it true?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:54.000\nYeah.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nHow many people in the crowd are improvisers or have improvised?\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:03.000\nWell, get out your notepads.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:11.000\nBecause historically, for the very first time tonight's Harmontown will be 100% pulled out of my ass.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:19.000\nI am tired, I'm tired of the countless rehearsals, I'm tired of the effort, I'm tired of going over this shit with people.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nI am a bit of a taskmaster.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:27.000\nAt 8 a.m. every day, Dan and I get up and I make him rehearse and rehearse the show.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nWork on your raps.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:34.000\nHow many times do I have to tell you?\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:41.000\nIt's a-a-a-a-a-a. Not a-a-a-a-a-a.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:44.000\nPussy rhymes with pussy, Dan. Just say it!\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nWe found out last night that Pussy can possibly rhyme with Gary Bucey.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nYes.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:51.000\nIf you sell it.\n\n02:51.000 --> 03:00.000\nSomeone in Bloomington, Indiana called out, like I said for the third time, because of course you would be rapping about fucking people's momma as I want to do.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:02.500\nyou end up talking about her pussy.\n\n03:02.500 --> 03:05.700\nIf you make the mistake, Chicago, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n03:05.700 --> 03:08.700\nFirst level workshops, this is taught in.\n\n03:08.700 --> 03:12.100\nIf you make the mistake of ending with pussy in your first line,\n\n03:12.100 --> 03:13.400\nwhere are you gonna go?\n\n03:13.400 --> 03:15.300\nAnd I was lamenting that on stage\n\n03:15.300 --> 03:17.900\nand someone in Bloomington, Indiana called out,\n\n03:17.900 --> 03:20.100\nGary Busey.\n\n03:20.100 --> 03:22.700\nAnd I ended the show and I took him in the green room\n\n03:22.700 --> 03:25.700\nand I said, I don't know what the fuck you're trying to pull.\n\n03:25.700 --> 03:29.700\nBut if you ever want me or Rob Schneider to ever come here,\n\n03:29.700 --> 03:33.500\nagain, you take your fucking snotty little Midwestern bullshit\n\n03:33.500 --> 03:36.700\nback to the Midwest.\n\n03:36.700 --> 03:40.300\nI'm going to Chicago, which is also in the Midwest,\n\n03:40.300 --> 03:42.500\nbut it's like a New Yorkie kind of city\n\n03:42.500 --> 03:43.900\nwhere they invented improv.\n\n03:43.900 --> 03:46.200\nAnd if I want to hear what rhymes with pussy,\n\n03:46.200 --> 03:49.100\nI'll find out at Second City.\n\n03:49.100 --> 03:50.700\nYou little piece of shit.\n\n03:50.700 --> 03:55.300\nYou little fuck Todd Jacobson.\n\n03:55.300 --> 03:59.900\nAge 19, whose address is 4-3-2-8.\n\n03:59.900 --> 04:02.300\nI'm reading this off of a piece of paper.\n\n04:02.300 --> 04:03.700\nViewing podcast land.\n\n04:03.700 --> 04:05.500\nWilshire Boulevard.\n\n04:05.500 --> 04:07.700\nWait, there's a Wilshire Boulevard.\n\n04:07.700 --> 04:09.300\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n04:09.300 --> 04:13.000\nLet's start over.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.400\nSo Chicago invented improv.\n\n04:17.400 --> 04:19.000\nSo we're gonna make up the whole show tonight.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.500\nThey invented wind.\n\n04:22.500 --> 04:25.400\nSo that doesn't really have any effect on us.\n\n04:25.400 --> 04:26.900\nWe're indoors.\n\n04:26.900 --> 04:30.900\nThe typewriter was invented here.\n\n04:30.900 --> 04:35.100\nGeorge Washington died here.\n\n04:35.100 --> 04:43.300\nIllinois, the 50th state to leave the Union in the pre-Civil War.\n\n04:43.300 --> 04:44.700\nA lot of people don't know this.\n\n04:44.700 --> 04:47.900\nI'm sure Chicago knows because they were here.\n\n04:47.900 --> 04:50.700\nThere was a pre-Civil War where the North North\n\n04:50.700 --> 04:56.300\nand the North South fought to see who would attack the South first.\n\n04:56.300 --> 04:57.800\nDid you know that?\n\n04:57.800 --> 05:00.000\nI knew that.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.200\nA lot of these assholes didn't know.\n\n05:01.200 --> 05:02.500\nObviously, they're not there.\n\n05:02.500 --> 05:05.600\nThey're staring at me like I'm some kind of fat idiot\n\n05:05.600 --> 05:10.300\nwho got fired from his own show, came to Chicago\n\n05:10.300 --> 05:12.900\nto try to get people to make him sign stuff\n\n05:12.900 --> 05:14.700\nso he could feel better.\n\n05:14.700 --> 05:15.700\nI have an essence, Dan.\n\n05:15.700 --> 05:18.500\nYou got two new shows in the works.\n\n05:18.500 --> 05:19.700\nNo, I don't.\n\n05:19.700 --> 05:21.800\nWell, you have a CBS show and a Fox show.\n\n05:21.800 --> 05:24.100\nI conned two giant corporations\n\n05:24.100 --> 05:27.300\nthat are giving me a great deal of money.\n\n05:27.300 --> 05:32.000\nThey love corporations.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:36.000\nI wanted Bob Greenblatt to know I was employable.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.600\nI'm sure he really keeps himself up at night going,\n\n05:38.600 --> 05:41.600\nI hope I can prove him wrong by firing him\n\n05:41.600 --> 05:43.300\nand then I wanted him to read in the press\n\n05:43.300 --> 05:45.800\nthat I could work for two networks at once.\n\n05:45.800 --> 05:46.900\nLet's say that...\n\n05:46.900 --> 05:48.600\nSo I took their money and then I got in a bus\n\n05:48.600 --> 05:50.800\nand I came out here.\n\n05:50.800 --> 05:52.500\nAnd you've been shirking your responsibilities.\n\n05:52.500 --> 05:53.800\nYou turned in the CBS thing,\n\n05:53.800 --> 05:55.600\nbut you have not turned in the Fox thing, right?\n\n05:55.600 --> 05:56.500\nI have not.\n\n05:56.500 --> 06:00.700\nWhen was that due?\n\n06:00.700 --> 06:04.700\nDecember-ish.\n\n06:04.700 --> 06:06.200\nBut, you know, in my defense,\n\n06:06.200 --> 06:10.800\nlike what I do isn't really a schedulable thing.\n\n06:10.800 --> 06:15.000\nYou don't go up to a plumber and say,\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nunclog my toilet.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.900\nYes, you do.\n\n06:17.900 --> 06:21.200\nThat's exactly what you say to a plumber.\n\n06:21.200 --> 06:23.000\nBecause there's a leak, can you say?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.400\nMy basement is flooded.\n\n06:24.400 --> 06:27.500\nYeah, but he tells you I'll be there between 10 and 9.\n\n06:27.500 --> 06:29.100\nYeah, and then he comes.\n\n06:29.100 --> 06:31.900\nWell, yeah, but he gives you a big wide thing and then...\n\n06:31.900 --> 06:32.600\nBut it's a day.\n\n06:32.600 --> 06:34.300\nHe does come, yeah.\n\n06:34.300 --> 06:38.600\nAll right, so I'm like a plumber that doesn't come.\n\n06:38.600 --> 06:40.700\nBut I unclog more than a toilet, Jeff.\n\n06:40.700 --> 06:44.400\nI unclog America's lack of entertainment.\n\n06:44.400 --> 06:48.700\nAnd that's worth waiting a couple of extra months.\n\n06:48.700 --> 06:49.900\nThank you, Chicago.\n\n06:49.900 --> 06:52.900\nI knew you'd get me.\n\n06:52.900 --> 06:55.500\nNow, let's say that both shows, you know,\n\n06:55.500 --> 06:58.200\nin a magical, perfect universe,\n\n06:58.200 --> 07:00.600\nyour CBS show, your Fox show, both get picked up.\n\n07:00.600 --> 07:01.700\nThat's not going to happen.\n\n07:01.700 --> 07:02.400\nBut let's just say...\n\n07:02.400 --> 07:03.200\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\n07:03.200 --> 07:03.900\nLet's just say...\n\n07:03.900 --> 07:07.400\nLet's all join Jeff's weird peppermint world.\n\n07:07.400 --> 07:11.800\nWhere gum drops are shoes.\n\n07:11.800 --> 07:13.800\nWhat happens there?\n\n07:13.800 --> 07:17.200\nA deer licks my balls and the salt makes him strong\n\n07:17.200 --> 07:19.400\nand he gets accepted by his dear friends.\n\n07:19.400 --> 07:20.600\nI don't even...\n\n07:20.600 --> 07:22.600\nWhy are you saying what you're saying?\n\n07:22.600 --> 07:23.200\nSorry, I didn't...\n\n07:23.200 --> 07:25.000\nI can't believe you're wasting this good stuff\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.100\nand you haven't turned in your fast strip yet.\n\n07:29.100 --> 07:31.100\nPippermint shoe balls.\n\n07:31.100 --> 07:31.900\nWhat do you want to know?\n\n07:31.900 --> 07:35.200\nI'm saying in a world where both of your shows get picked up\n\n07:35.200 --> 07:38.000\nand now you're forced to be a guy that you can't do both.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:38.900\nBut let's say that you could.\n\n07:38.900 --> 07:41.100\nLet's say that you were the showrunner and creator\n\n07:41.100 --> 07:43.600\nof both a CBS multi-camera show\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:45.700\nand a Fox single-camera show.\n\n07:45.700 --> 07:48.200\nWhich...\n\n07:48.200 --> 07:51.900\nWould you get fired off one or more of them?\n\n07:51.900 --> 07:52.200\nI went...\n\n07:52.200 --> 07:53.200\nWell, my hope...\n\n07:53.200 --> 07:56.300\nThe supposition was that I wouldn't get fired from any of them\n\n07:56.300 --> 07:57.800\nbecause remember how I was on an adult swim show\n\n07:57.800 --> 07:59.000\ncoming in 2014?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.600\nSo there was a hope.\n\n08:01.600 --> 08:05.700\nThe hope was that by diversifying my asshole folio\n\n08:05.700 --> 08:08.300\nthat I would now create a situation\n\n08:08.300 --> 08:11.300\nbecause at the risk of sounding defensive\n\n08:11.300 --> 08:14.700\nand self-aggrandizing and possibly psychotic\n\n08:14.700 --> 08:17.900\na little Mansonian and perhaps a little Koreshian\n\n08:17.900 --> 08:21.500\nand with just a pinch of Busey...\n\n08:21.500 --> 08:25.500\nI think as far as I can tell in my crazy brain\n\n08:25.500 --> 08:27.500\nthe reason I keep getting fired\n\n08:27.500 --> 08:31.700\nis because I have too much time to focus on the job\n\n08:31.700 --> 08:33.300\nand I keep, you know, going like,\n\n08:33.300 --> 08:36.700\nyeah, but what if it could be a really, really, really good show?\n\n08:36.700 --> 08:38.900\nAnd then after a while like it's very annoying\n\n08:38.900 --> 08:40.700\nto people around me, you know?\n\n08:40.700 --> 08:44.700\nSo you're saying by scattering your focus this much...\n\n08:44.700 --> 08:48.100\nSo here was my fantasy, okay, in your gumdrop world.\n\n08:48.100 --> 08:53.100\nI wake up, okay, it's Monday, it's 9 a.m.\n\n08:53.100 --> 08:55.900\nAnd I wake up.\n\n08:55.900 --> 08:57.900\nAll right, so I'm going to take the mic out\n\n08:57.900 --> 09:00.900\nso I can move around and give this space work.\n\n09:00.900 --> 09:07.400\nWatch this Improv Olympic students.\n\n09:07.400 --> 09:09.900\nIt's 9 a.m.\n\n09:09.900 --> 09:13.300\nWhat time did I get to bed last night on this clock\n\n09:13.300 --> 09:15.100\nthat I'm holding up?\n\n09:15.100 --> 09:17.900\nGot home at 3 and made love to my girlfriend\n\n09:17.900 --> 09:20.300\nwho I'm able to maintain a relationship with\n\n09:20.300 --> 09:21.500\nwhile running three shows\n\n09:21.500 --> 09:24.700\nbecause I'm able to get an erection\n\n09:24.700 --> 09:26.300\nbecause none of these three networks\n\n09:26.300 --> 09:32.300\nare run by Bob Greenblatt.\n\n09:32.300 --> 09:35.300\nSo my dick gets hard mysteriously out of nowhere.\n\n09:35.300 --> 09:37.700\nI'll just be sitting around and my dick will get hard\n\n09:37.700 --> 09:44.100\nand my blood is allowed to go into the little valves.\n\n09:44.100 --> 09:47.700\nTime to go to work in my giant car\n\n09:47.700 --> 09:50.100\nwith a cow catcher on the front.\n\n09:50.100 --> 09:53.300\nI don't know what...\n\n09:53.300 --> 09:57.100\nIt's got diamonds on the thing.\n\n09:57.100 --> 10:00.300\nYou know, entering your car.\n\n10:00.300 --> 10:02.700\nIt's 2014.\n\n10:02.700 --> 10:06.900\nYou have three new messages in your car.\n\n10:06.900 --> 10:08.300\nSorry. Sorry.\n\n10:08.300 --> 10:10.500\nI'm programmed to make you feel better about yourself\n\n10:10.500 --> 10:13.900\nby stumbling over words.\n\n10:13.900 --> 10:17.300\nThat'll do amazing AI car.\n\n10:17.300 --> 10:19.300\nLet's hear those three messages while I drive\n\n10:19.300 --> 10:22.100\nto my first, the first job.\n\n10:22.100 --> 10:27.100\nFirst, new message sent today at 8.30 a.m.\n\n10:27.100 --> 10:29.300\nHey, Dan, it's your masseuse.\n\n10:29.300 --> 10:31.500\nJust wanted to let you know, man.\n\n10:31.500 --> 10:36.700\nDude, it was so relaxing massaging you.\n\n10:36.700 --> 10:40.100\nSent, 8.47 a.m.\n\n10:40.100 --> 10:42.500\nOh, no.

You're 16 15\n\n01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.940\nMaybe you can figure it out. You've you've just started mutilating yourself and here you go. Here's the microphone\n\n01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.740\nSo are we you know fish? Yeah, have you ever played before? No, okay?\n\n01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:49.900\nso basically you pretend what I'm saying is true and\n\n01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:56.900\nAnd you act accordingly just like church. Yeah, just like church\n\n01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:10.140\nThis is great. Dan. He's he's Dan. He's funnier than you\n\n01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.160\nYeah, but my trick is since I framed it with like he's me\n\n01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160\nI\n\n01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.420\nBecome freedman Dan. I don't want to get super gross\n\n01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:29.220\nIf I did ever go a little something Ben looks identical to my first boyfriend Eric Eldard who showed me his penis in the shower\n\n01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.800\nidentical identical\n\n01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.080\nLet a woman show you how to do things\n\n01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:50.360\nI'm just kidding. How do we get these stripes off the sweater? I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. Please stop me\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.680\nWow, well, like I don't go to jail. Yeah, so\n\n01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.480\nYou know, I mean, I'm not I'm it's your fault\n\n01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.840\nAre we playing the Indian we are\n\n01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.720\nThat won't stop me teaching your things now, okay\n\n01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.160\nSomething terrible is about to happen\n\n01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.040\nAll right, so Spencer we got the Prince Val valescent was his name valescent\n\n01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.600\nYes, and so he has the sword knowledge. He is the far sword capabilities the the power of the far sword\n\n01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:32.880\nI say we you it's probably the right idea to go destroy this animal from the inside and let's march towards the heart of this beast\n\n01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:39.000\nAbsolutely positively. All right. Thank you, Ben. I mean I mean Sharpie Sharpie. Thank you, sir\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.640\nThank you Sharpie. Yes valescent grumbles\n\n01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.480\nI don't know about killing this thing, but you do have to do some damage if you're gonna want to escape\n\n01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.200\nLet's head fish West\n\n01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.760\nFish West I had fish West you guys had fish West\n\n01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.360\nAt the far wall of a vision visual the village you're met with what appears to be a largest meat curtain\n\n01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:10.200\nThis is your education wait, these things will happen. Don't worry about it. Okay. Yeah, it's a curtain of me\n\n01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:17.200\nIt's a curtain of me. All right. Don't think there was a sentience about it. It is part of a sentient being. Okay, because we're in fish\n\n01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.160\nYeah\n\n01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:24.800\nThey're not I'm almost certain. We're breaking some sort of law. Yeah. No, I understood. I understood that\n\n01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.720\nI'm not bashful, but I think this is this is illegal\n\n01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.840\nWait, haven't we already but for the lack of a better word penetrated this meat curtain before\n\n01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.720\nThis is actually a different meat curtain. That's a new meat curtain. Okay. It's a new one meat curtains\n\n01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:47.120\nAll right. I have I approached the meat curtain boldly because I've I'm no stranger to the meat curtain and\n\n01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960\nand I\n\n01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.560\nBoldly press myself through it\n\n01:18:53.560 --> 01:19:00.240\nWe all press ourselves boldly through the meat curtain. Oh, right. Yeah, let's do it together as a team\n\n01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.840\nYou stride through the folds of the meat curtains\n\n01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:10.640\nBehind the curtain is a passage. It's relatively narrow, but still quite the wide considering it's inside of a living creature\n\n01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:17.800\nFrom far off you can hear the thumping of hearts and the sloshing of blood being pumped through great veins and arteries\n\n01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.480\nIt's just like mine. Mm-hmm. I'd know apparently\n\n01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.440\nThe floor is slick and squishy and you find it quite difficult to stand up straight let alone move\n\n01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.440\nYou can see circular holes in the ground full of bubbling green acid\n\n01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.200\nThrough the passage is a larger curtain of meat\n\n01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.800\nWe have to cross a floor that's slick and it's got holes in it and acid is bubbling through it\n\n01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.800\nYeah, so it's full of acid holes\n\n01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.320\nSo Spencer, we need to go across\n\n01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.000\nThis this acid hole area, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.160\nCan I can I take my rope and tie it to an arrow and shoot it across the yeah, like in the ceiling and then swimming across like Star Wars?\n\n01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.160\nOh, okay, so do you want to attempt that?\n\n01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880\nYes, yeah\n\n01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.400\nNope\n\n01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.400\nSpencer Spencer. Yeah. No, I was about to\n\n01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:17.000\nSpencer sorry game of Dungeons and Dragons you can take a 10 or a 20 a 10 is when you have a short amount of time devoted to a task\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.280\nLike if you're tying your shoes and you had 20 minutes you could take a 10\n\n01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.440\nYou know that'll give you a decent success rate if it's not very difficult\n\n01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:30.040\nYou'll automatically pass if you have plenty of time like an hour or two you can take a 20\n\n01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.640\nThat means you automatically, you know as if you rolled a 20\n\n01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:40.360\nBut you require a long period of time and it can't be a task that you can fail at for instance falling and slipping in a pile of acid I\n\n01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360\nApplaud your efforts, sir\n\n01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.840\nSo is this a time to take a 20?\n\n01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.360\nSo if I take a 20, what's the what's the consequence in this case?\n\n01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.480\nI'm gonna rule you can't take a 20 because the the the stakes are life and death\n\n01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.760\nYou don't have time to mess up and fix it wait. I got you. Yeah, go for it hypothetically\n\n01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:08.960\nI have like a ray of frost thing because I listen to the podcast so can I\n\n01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.400\nTry to cast a spell and build a bridge across the lava or whatever\n\n01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.120\nAll right, you can attempt it ray of frost is a rather weak spell. You're the best you can manage and make your bridge\n\n01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:26.960\nI'm not literate. So that's fine. I mean, I'm there. There's tiny writing. Where are my skills your skills or your spells?\n\n01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:30.480\nYeah, go help them stand stand mentor. I'm gonna do something Dan\n\n01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320\nBe a father to your child\n\n01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.960\nI'm so sorry\n\n01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.820\nIt's like adaptation. It's I think I think\n\n01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.580\nDan are you actually afraid of Ben a little bit?\n\n01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:53.440\nThere's all right, you're your spells your special abilities the spells are on a different page\n\n01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.600\nYeah, okay, that back page is all your spells, man\n\n01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360\nI'm helping\n\n01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960\nHere's a problem with the bet you can't yes\n\n01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:21.120\nOkay, so all right, so can I I'm actually I've never I've never looked at sharpies. Yeah, you don't have\n\n01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:28.200\nSpells, no, I don't have spells. Is there a way for me to make a bridge? There is no way for you to make a bridge\n\n01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.980\nSpencer I have the I may I'm a plus nine for jump. Yep\n\n01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:41.320\nCan I jump can I jump I try to jump across this expanse? Okay, the things 30 30 feet long\n\n01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.000\nLike you can jump over individual puddles definitely, but I'm not sure\n\n01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.140\nOkay, I'll say you can jump about a 30% of the way\n\n01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:56.060\nWell, I jump I jumped to the first part of the to the first lily pad of whatever that is\n\n01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.420\nYou jump successfully\n\n01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:14.500\nOkay, I have one more question never had a lesson my future self from the future\n\n01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:20.780\nAppeared to me and suggested I use tensors floating disc. Yeah possible for me to like put that ahead of\n\n01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:26.660\nQuark quark so that when he next jumps he can land on it and then like somehow move it again\n\n01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:31.460\nSo that we sort of hopscotch McRoss. Yeah, I were to advise that strategy\n\n01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:37.180\nI'd put it right over one of those holes of acid so like he could just like step lightly upon it, okay, so I\n\n01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:44.100\nCast tensors floating disc waving your hands in a magical manner a shimmering disc appears\n\n01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:47.580\nOkay, Ben today you are a man\n\n01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.660\nThank you\n\n01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.180\nThis is your harm mince for\n\n01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.660\nTrademark\n\n01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:07.420\nThe court the quark, that's your name. Yes, yeah court you see a tensors floating disc\n\n01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.140\nI\n\n01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.900\nIs I jump upon it you jump upon it?\n\n01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:17.520\nYou are upon a tensors floating disc above a pile of acid. I can I jump to the next to the next place?\n\n01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:23.100\nYou're struck by a tentacle that whips out of a wall with a flash\n\n01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:29.980\nOh, it grabs you by the ankle. I take an arrow. You take an arrow. I shoot the arrow at the tentacle\n\n01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.180\nHe won't appreciate it, but I'll do it\n\n01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.460\nCritical hit\n\n01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.100\nYeah, because you shot one arrow\n\n01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:50.380\nYour arrow slices through the air cleaving the tentacle in twain\n\n01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:57.860\nSharp or quark is released falling on to the tensors floating disc. Okay. I cast the thing against we lands on it\n\n01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:03.900\nOh, it's already there. It's still there. It just falls. So what's in front of me? Can I jump to the end of the expanse?\n\n01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.820\nYou can jump most of the way\n\n01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.980\nSounds like a bad idea wait\n\n01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.780\nIs there a way for me to simultaneously move the thing forward as he jumps so they're both in there at the same time\n\n01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:21.940\nSo he lands on it as he lands and then can then jump and finish you can move it with him on it without\n\n01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:29.220\nSharpie you you move it. I don't have to jump so much. Okay. All right\n\n01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.580\nHow about this you move it? I'll jump\n\n01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.780\nI said, I'll wait until half of the movement and I'll jump the rest of the way time it so that\n\n01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.980\nJust Kenny. Can I move just moving forward? I have arrows\n\n01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.780\nYes\n\n01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.780\nWhat?\n\n01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:49.260\nYeah, yeah, he could just move you could just move me all the way across\n\n01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:53.420\nHey, Ben, your dad's cool, right?\n\n01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:02.660\nAll right, yay, okay cool quark is across the passage. I'm across the passage\n\n01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.860\nYou see a large curtain of meat. Thank you, sir\n\n01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:12.340\nBut what about you guys what just happened? Oh, fuck them. Can we wait? Can I?\n\n01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:18.780\nCan we just like various back and forth with the floating disc? Yeah, I I said I\n\n01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.500\nHarness all of my training at frisbee golf and I send the floating disc. Yay\n\n01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.980\nBack towards Sharpie and Mulraine\n\n01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:32.220\nYou take five hot shot\n\n01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:38.180\nThat happens, okay, so they have a disc now. Yeah, all right\n\n01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:45.740\nYep, so but they have to get on it. I think Mulraine is still reduced by the way like you're short right now\n\n01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:52.060\nOkay, is that we both fit? That's cool. Yeah, it's fine. I'm a little pocket. Can you put me in your pocket? Not that small\n\n01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:55.420\nCalm down. Oh, you're quark-sized but in any case\n\n01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:59.380\nWe're both small people because I'm young Dan Harmon now the young Sharpie Buttsalot now\n\n01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:06.020\nSo, I don't know what game you're playing but the time continuity marches on you you're Sharpie Buttsalot\n\n01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.940\nI jump on I jump on Sharpie's back. Okay, and okay. We go across. Yeah\n\n01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.540\nThat happens. Yay\n\n01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:17.780\nAre they across are we all together?
