00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Hello Chicago, how are you?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm fine too.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Guess what everybody?

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
Harmontown is a session.

00:34.000 --> 00:50.000
Won't you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Chicago!

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh, alright.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Theater town, finally.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
My people.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Fuck all those other cities.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So tired of fakin' it, Jeff.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Oh Austin, I love it because we're in Texas.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Safe to say it because they won't hear us anymore.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Fuck those people.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
I felt like I was doing mental sit-ups, you know?

01:25.000 --> 01:35.000
Pretending to be happy in all those cities when Chicago is the only reason we came out.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, up here is New York.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Who wants to perform in New York? It's dumb.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Nobody!

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Especially Brooklyn, what an unhip burrow.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Anyways, Jeff, improv was invented here.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Is it true?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
How many people in the crowd are improvisers or have improvised?

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Well, get out your notepads.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
Because historically, for the very first time tonight's Harmontown will be 100% pulled out of my ass.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
I am tired, I'm tired of the countless rehearsals, I'm tired of the effort, I'm tired of going over this shit with people.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I am a bit of a taskmaster.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
At 8 a.m. every day, Dan and I get up and I make him rehearse and rehearse the show.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Work on your raps.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, I know.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
How many times do I have to tell you?

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
It's a-a-a-a-a-a. Not a-a-a-a-a-a.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Pussy rhymes with pussy, Dan. Just say it!

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
We found out last night that Pussy can possibly rhyme with Gary Bucey.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Yes.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
If you sell it.

02:51.000 --> 03:00.000
Someone in Bloomington, Indiana called out, like I said for the third time, because of course you would be rapping about fucking people's momma as I want to do.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.500
you end up talking about her pussy.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.700
If you make the mistake, Chicago, you know what I'm talking about.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.700
First level workshops, this is taught in.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.100
If you make the mistake of ending with pussy in your first line,

03:12.100 --> 03:13.400
where are you gonna go?

03:13.400 --> 03:15.300
And I was lamenting that on stage

03:15.300 --> 03:17.900
and someone in Bloomington, Indiana called out,

03:17.900 --> 03:20.100
Gary Busey.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.700
And I ended the show and I took him in the green room

03:22.700 --> 03:25.700
and I said, I don't know what the fuck you're trying to pull.

03:25.700 --> 03:29.700
But if you ever want me or Rob Schneider to ever come here,

03:29.700 --> 03:33.500
again, you take your fucking snotty little Midwestern bullshit

03:33.500 --> 03:36.700
back to the Midwest.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.300
I'm going to Chicago, which is also in the Midwest,

03:40.300 --> 03:42.500
but it's like a New Yorkie kind of city

03:42.500 --> 03:43.900
where they invented improv.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.200
And if I want to hear what rhymes with pussy,

03:46.200 --> 03:49.100
I'll find out at Second City.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.700
You little piece of shit.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.300
You little fuck Todd Jacobson.

03:55.300 --> 03:59.900
Age 19, whose address is 4-3-2-8.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.300
I'm reading this off of a piece of paper.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.700
Viewing podcast land.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.500
Wilshire Boulevard.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.700
Wait, there's a Wilshire Boulevard.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.300
It doesn't matter.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.000
Let's start over.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.400
So Chicago invented improv.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.000
So we're gonna make up the whole show tonight.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.500
They invented wind.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.400
So that doesn't really have any effect on us.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.900
We're indoors.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.900
The typewriter was invented here.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.100
George Washington died here.

04:35.100 --> 04:43.300
Illinois, the 50th state to leave the Union in the pre-Civil War.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.700
A lot of people don't know this.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.900
I'm sure Chicago knows because they were here.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.700
There was a pre-Civil War where the North North

04:50.700 --> 04:56.300
and the North South fought to see who would attack the South first.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.800
Did you know that?

04:57.800 --> 05:00.000
I knew that.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.200
A lot of these assholes didn't know.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.500
Obviously, they're not there.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.600
They're staring at me like I'm some kind of fat idiot

05:05.600 --> 05:10.300
who got fired from his own show, came to Chicago

05:10.300 --> 05:12.900
to try to get people to make him sign stuff

05:12.900 --> 05:14.700
so he could feel better.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.700
I have an essence, Dan.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.500
You got two new shows in the works.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.700
No, I don't.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.800
Well, you have a CBS show and a Fox show.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.100
I conned two giant corporations

05:24.100 --> 05:27.300
that are giving me a great deal of money.

05:27.300 --> 05:32.000
They love corporations.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I wanted Bob Greenblatt to know I was employable.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.600
I'm sure he really keeps himself up at night going,

05:38.600 --> 05:41.600
I hope I can prove him wrong by firing him

05:41.600 --> 05:43.300
and then I wanted him to read in the press

05:43.300 --> 05:45.800
that I could work for two networks at once.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.900
Let's say that...

05:46.900 --> 05:48.600
So I took their money and then I got in a bus

05:48.600 --> 05:50.800
and I came out here.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.500
And you've been shirking your responsibilities.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.800
You turned in the CBS thing,

05:53.800 --> 05:55.600
but you have not turned in the Fox thing, right?

05:55.600 --> 05:56.500
I have not.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.700
When was that due?

06:00.700 --> 06:04.700
December-ish.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.200
But, you know, in my defense,

06:06.200 --> 06:10.800
like what I do isn't really a schedulable thing.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.000
You don't go up to a plumber and say,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
unclog my toilet.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.900
Yes, you do.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.200
That's exactly what you say to a plumber.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.000
Because there's a leak, can you say?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.400
My basement is flooded.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.500
Yeah, but he tells you I'll be there between 10 and 9.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.100
Yeah, and then he comes.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.900
Well, yeah, but he gives you a big wide thing and then...

06:31.900 --> 06:32.600
But it's a day.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.300
He does come, yeah.

06:34.300 --> 06:38.600
All right, so I'm like a plumber that doesn't come.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.700
But I unclog more than a toilet, Jeff.

06:40.700 --> 06:44.400
I unclog America's lack of entertainment.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.700
And that's worth waiting a couple of extra months.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.900
Thank you, Chicago.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.900
I knew you'd get me.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.500
Now, let's say that both shows, you know,

06:55.500 --> 06:58.200
in a magical, perfect universe,

06:58.200 --> 07:00.600
your CBS show, your Fox show, both get picked up.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.700
That's not going to happen.

07:01.700 --> 07:02.400
But let's just say...

07:02.400 --> 07:03.200
Okay, okay, okay.

07:03.200 --> 07:03.900
Let's just say...

07:03.900 --> 07:07.400
Let's all join Jeff's weird peppermint world.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.800
Where gum drops are shoes.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.800
What happens there?

07:13.800 --> 07:17.200
A deer licks my balls and the salt makes him strong

07:17.200 --> 07:19.400
and he gets accepted by his dear friends.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.600
I don't even...

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
Why are you saying what you're saying?

07:22.600 --> 07:23.200
Sorry, I didn't...

07:23.200 --> 07:25.000
I can't believe you're wasting this good stuff

07:25.000 --> 07:29.100
and you haven't turned in your fast strip yet.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.100
Pippermint shoe balls.

07:31.100 --> 07:31.900
What do you want to know?

07:31.900 --> 07:35.200
I'm saying in a world where both of your shows get picked up

07:35.200 --> 07:38.000
and now you're forced to be a guy that you can't do both.

07:38.000 --> 07:38.900
But let's say that you could.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.100
Let's say that you were the showrunner and creator

07:41.100 --> 07:43.600
of both a CBS multi-camera show

07:43.600 --> 07:45.700
and a Fox single-camera show.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.200
Which...

07:48.200 --> 07:51.900
Would you get fired off one or more of them?

07:51.900 --> 07:52.200
I went...

07:52.200 --> 07:53.200
Well, my hope...

07:53.200 --> 07:56.300
The supposition was that I wouldn't get fired from any of them

07:56.300 --> 07:57.800
because remember how I was on an adult swim show

07:57.800 --> 07:59.000
coming in 2014?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.600
So there was a hope.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.700
The hope was that by diversifying my asshole folio

08:05.700 --> 08:08.300
that I would now create a situation

08:08.300 --> 08:11.300
because at the risk of sounding defensive

08:11.300 --> 08:14.700
and self-aggrandizing and possibly psychotic

08:14.700 --> 08:17.900
a little Mansonian and perhaps a little Koreshian

08:17.900 --> 08:21.500
and with just a pinch of Busey...

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
I think as far as I can tell in my crazy brain

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
the reason I keep getting fired

08:27.500 --> 08:31.700
is because I have too much time to focus on the job

08:31.700 --> 08:33.300
and I keep, you know, going like,

08:33.300 --> 08:36.700
yeah, but what if it could be a really, really, really good show?

08:36.700 --> 08:38.900
And then after a while like it's very annoying

08:38.900 --> 08:40.700
to people around me, you know?

08:40.700 --> 08:44.700
So you're saying by scattering your focus this much...

08:44.700 --> 08:48.100
So here was my fantasy, okay, in your gumdrop world.

08:48.100 --> 08:53.100
I wake up, okay, it's Monday, it's 9 a.m.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.900
And I wake up.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.900
All right, so I'm going to take the mic out

08:57.900 --> 09:00.900
so I can move around and give this space work.

09:00.900 --> 09:07.400
Watch this Improv Olympic students.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.900
It's 9 a.m.

09:09.900 --> 09:13.300
What time did I get to bed last night on this clock

09:13.300 --> 09:15.100
that I'm holding up?

09:15.100 --> 09:17.900
Got home at 3 and made love to my girlfriend

09:17.900 --> 09:20.300
who I'm able to maintain a relationship with

09:20.300 --> 09:21.500
while running three shows

09:21.500 --> 09:24.700
because I'm able to get an erection

09:24.700 --> 09:26.300
because none of these three networks

09:26.300 --> 09:32.300
are run by Bob Greenblatt.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.300
So my dick gets hard mysteriously out of nowhere.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.700
I'll just be sitting around and my dick will get hard

09:37.700 --> 09:44.100
and my blood is allowed to go into the little valves.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.700
Time to go to work in my giant car

09:47.700 --> 09:50.100
with a cow catcher on the front.

09:50.100 --> 09:53.300
I don't know what...

09:53.300 --> 09:57.100
It's got diamonds on the thing.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.300
You know, entering your car.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.700
It's 2014.

10:02.700 --> 10:06.900
You have three new messages in your car.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.300
Sorry. Sorry.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.500
I'm programmed to make you feel better about yourself

10:10.500 --> 10:13.900
by stumbling over words.

10:13.900 --> 10:17.300
That'll do amazing AI car.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.300
Let's hear those three messages while I drive

10:19.300 --> 10:22.100
to my first, the first job.

10:22.100 --> 10:27.100
First, new message sent today at 8.30 a.m.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.300
Hey, Dan, it's your masseuse.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.500
Just wanted to let you know, man.

10:31.500 --> 10:36.700
Dude, it was so relaxing massaging you.

10:36.700 --> 10:40.100
Sent, 8.47 a.m.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.500
Oh, no. Not going to worry about it.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.300
Got a cow catcher.

10:46.300 --> 10:50.900
8.47 a.m.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.700
Hey, Dan, it's CBS.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.900
It's calling you to let you know.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.700
Great job. Great job in the script.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.100
Great idea with the dog.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.300
8.50.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.500
All right, so getting out.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.100
Third message from my girlfriend.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.100
She'll understand. Work comes first.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.900
All right.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.700
Here I am.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.300
I'm here at CBS for my first day of work.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.300
Bzzz. Bzzz.

11:19.300 --> 11:22.900
Oh, God, I felt so bad about hitting that cow

11:22.900 --> 11:27.300
that we brought it into the writer's room

11:27.300 --> 11:28.700
and it's working for us now.

11:28.700 --> 11:35.300
And actually, we won an Emmy.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.900
We just milked it onto a piece of paper

11:37.900 --> 11:41.300
and let it dry and it was amazing.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.300
I had to sweeten the laughs a little bit.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.900
You know, everything needs coaxing.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.100
What's going on?

11:48.100 --> 11:52.100
Gary, fuck nuts.

11:52.100 --> 11:55.700
My showrunner, because I'm just the creator.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.500
I just fucking hang out and I'm creative.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
Amazing.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
Got a great idea for a pitch.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.500
What if Douglass decides to change the way he dresses

12:06.500 --> 12:08.500
for an episode and he wants to go basketball

12:08.500 --> 12:09.500
but he's allergic to shrimp

12:09.500 --> 12:11.500
so he ends up dressing totally different

12:11.500 --> 12:12.500
and then we'll...

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
Thought balloon over my head.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.500
That sounds like a really shitty idea.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.500
I'd kill myself before I watched that.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.500
Second thought balloon over my head.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.500
You keep getting fired.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.500
Stop it.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
Stop it.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.500
Gary, you're promoted.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.500
I want to take a quick nap in my office.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.500
Hey, that gives me a great idea for an episode.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.500
Hey, what if his voice trail's off?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.500
What if so-and-so took a nap in his office?

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
Open the window in my office.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.500
Climb out.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
Natalie, AI car.

13:00.500 --> 13:04.500
Pulling up to your predetermined escape route.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
Take me to Fox, Natalie.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.500
Hey, play that third message.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.500
I heard play turd massage.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
God damn it, it's just fucking technology.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.500
That's the most stressful thing that'll happen to me all day.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.500
Play the third message.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
Hey, it's Erin McGathy.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.500
I published another random collection of your babblings

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
and it made a million dollars.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.500
Oh, great.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.500
Hey, get yourself a dildo.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.500
Now arriving at Fox Studios.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.500
Hey, hey.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.500
Whoa, did you hear the news?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
Golden Globe.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.500
Yeah.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.500
Dude, I was just over at my CBS job.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
Those fucking assholes,

13:55.500 --> 13:57.500
they think they're making a good TV show

13:57.500 --> 14:00.500
just because it's eight times as many people watch it.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.500
We're making art over here, right?

14:04.500 --> 14:08.500
Because only 17 million people are watching.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
So what do you got?

14:10.500 --> 14:13.500
Well, we had this idea that Spookless

14:13.500 --> 14:16.500
would want to dress differently.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.500
But then he'd dress differently

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
and because he's allergic to squid,

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
that then he would say,

14:22.500 --> 14:25.500
but then he'd stop because I remember that Obed character

14:25.500 --> 14:27.500
and he would look at the camera

14:27.500 --> 14:29.500
and he'd go, what am I doing?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.500
What am I, Douglas from CBS?

14:31.500 --> 14:33.500
You're amazing.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
That's great. It's a little meta.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
It's still Fox. It's got an edge.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
I like it.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.500
I'm going to go in my office and take a nap.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.500
Hey, you gave me a great idea.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.500
What if he said he was taking a nap

14:45.500 --> 14:47.500
but he knew he was taking a nap?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.500
No.

14:49.500 --> 14:54.500
Bessie, just go in there and punch up the script.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.500
Natalie, bring the cowcatcher mobile around.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.500
Take me to Adult Swim.

15:04.500 --> 15:09.500
Wait, stop on 3rd and Dope Dealer Street.

15:09.500 --> 15:13.500
Hey, Mike. Hey, Mr. Harmon.

15:13.500 --> 15:17.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mike, what race are you?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.500
I'm an Eskimo, Mr. Harmon.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.500
Just checking.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
Just checking and clarifying.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.500
You sounded a little sky-cappy there.

15:28.500 --> 15:32.500
Now make with the drugs and the blubber.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.500
Thank you.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.500
Because I'm going to Adult Swim

15:36.500 --> 15:39.500
where 30 people are going to watch.

15:39.500 --> 15:43.500
But it's all about fucking excitement.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.500
Hey, everybody. Hey, it's me, your friends.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.500
We're all your friends now.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.500
We don't know what the fuck we're doing, but we're your friends.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
What do you got for me?

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
We don't have shit. We don't know what to do

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
and you're not here. We're your friends.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.500
What the fuck's happening?

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
We just got high the whole time and we're gone.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
We're really freaking out.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
Hey, guys, take it easy.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
What if we did an episode about people freaking out

16:05.500 --> 16:07.500
drawing a circle on the board?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
Yeah, we're freaking out.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.500
We're causing a threshold. God is telling us to follow.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.500
Who's saying you're fucking genius?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.500
Please give me a job every time. Holy shit.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
I can't believe it. I'm so fucking high.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.500
I'm freaking out.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
It's fucking great, man. Fading. I'm freaking out.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
Hey, you got a phone call from the president of Adult Swim.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
Hey, Lazzo, how's it going?

16:25.500 --> 16:27.500
Hey, man, I just want to let you know I'm so fucking high.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.500
I love this fucking show, man.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
I love everything on Adult Swim.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.500
I don't give a shit. Nobody's watching.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.500
I don't give a fucking fucking...

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
I got a fucking pickle in my ear.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.500
I got an antenna on my head.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.500
I'm in Atlanta. I don't have any political reason

16:41.500 --> 16:43.500
to fuck around with anybody.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
I'm just having a great life and fucking living my dreams.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
It's fucking great.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
Television's for fun.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
Hey, you weren't speaking for the whole time.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.500
We were rubbing our dicks in the front. I love that.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.500
I love that. We didn't mean to do it.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
We weren't doing it out of disrespect.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
We just love rubbing our dicks and stuff. We're so high.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.500
All right, guys.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.500
Whoa, what time is it? 3 p.m.?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.500
That's about as my fantasy.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
So, here was the...

17:15.500 --> 17:17.500
Here was the reality, really.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
Hey, can I have a bazillion dollars

17:21.500 --> 17:23.500
to write a show?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.500
Yeah, yeah, we're really excited

17:25.500 --> 17:27.500
because we really respect you here at Fox.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
And, yeah, we really respect you here at CBS, too.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
We'll slow down, Fox, at CBS.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.500
I can only write one show

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
for one network, right?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.500
I guess I should go with Fox,

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
because I'll probably fuck up more at CBS

17:39.500 --> 17:41.500
because, you know, tastes are so different.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.500
All right, Fox, I'll take a bunch of money from you.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.500
All right, CBS, okay.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.500
Sorry, I said yes to Fox.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
Yeah, but you can write one for us, too.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.500
I can?

17:51.500 --> 17:53.500
Jesus Christ, that's really going to piss Bob Greenblatt off,

17:53.500 --> 17:55.500
I think, in my weird dumb mind

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
like he ever thinks about me.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
Okay, thank you.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
Thank you for all the money, guys.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.500
When are you going to be done with the script?

18:03.500 --> 18:05.500
Dude, I'm so fast and fucking crazy.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.500
It only took me a week to write a community episode

18:07.500 --> 18:09.500
because it had to be done in a week

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
and I had 20 people helping me.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.500
As far as I can remember,

18:13.500 --> 18:15.500
I'm a really fast writer.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.500
I can't remember past two and a half years

18:17.500 --> 18:19.500
because I'm always high.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.500
I'm a really fast writer.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
Okay, I'll give you guys a script.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.500
I'll have to be done before Christmas

18:25.500 --> 18:27.500
because after Christmas, I only have a week

18:27.500 --> 18:29.500
to prepare for going on a tour

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
where I go and masturbate to audiences

18:31.500 --> 18:33.500
and do shit like this

18:33.500 --> 18:35.500
that inevitably gets me fired

18:35.500 --> 18:37.500
because when they hear it, they're going to be mad

18:37.500 --> 18:39.500
because it sounds disrespectful.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
Okay, all right, but it won't matter

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
because I'll have to turn in these great scripts,

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
so who cares?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.500
Okay, bye, bon voyage, we love you.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.500
Let's see, just unbutton my pants.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
Put on the internet.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
30 days later.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
Almost finished.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
Oh, I'm still coming.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
No!

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
I didn't know I was into that.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.500
Oh, it burns.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
Oh.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
Oh, the creative process.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
It shapes and it burns.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.500
I had to come up with new ways

19:11.500 --> 19:13.500
to get hard.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.500
Oh, every drop.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.500
All right, 12 hours left.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.500
Let's start on that CBS thing.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.500
Time to go to Europe.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
Oops, okay, well...

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
CBS, hey man, fucking genius, you're amazing.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.500
We love you, we're very supportive of you.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.500
We're good people, we make good television.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
Just want to check in with you.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
Guys, it's almost done. What the fuck?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500
Uh...

19:35.500 --> 19:37.500
Like...

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
CBS, Dan just made a jerk-off motion

19:39.500 --> 19:41.500
if you're listening on the podcast.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.500
It suckers tongue out and it made a jerk-off thing.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
Bit of a snag.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
I'll have to write it on the plane.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.500
I mean, fuck it.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.500
You know, the altitude gets me high.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.500
Uh...

19:53.500 --> 19:55.500
It also gets me horny. I'm going to go in the bathroom

19:55.500 --> 19:57.500
of the airplane.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.500
12 hours later, oh, international flight.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.500
I can't come anymore. Oh, I'm coming so hard.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
Now landing in London.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.500
Hey, good day, mate.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.500
What?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.500
Welcome to...

20:09.500 --> 20:11.500
That's where the flight took so long.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
You got rerouted to Brisbane.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.500
Go back, you got 28 hours

20:15.500 --> 20:17.500
to write your screenplay now.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.500
You landed in Brisbane.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.500
Oh, I'm jerking off tomorrow.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.500
Oh, I never...

20:23.500 --> 20:25.500
I didn't know Matthew McConaughey was in this many movies.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.500
I'm going to watch all of them.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
Now arriving in London.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
Oh, cheerio!

20:31.500 --> 20:33.500
Uh... Dan.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.500
Dan, it's Christmas time.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.500
We agreed to spend this time

20:37.500 --> 20:39.500
at Christmas with Rob and Kate.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.500
We were going to go eat

20:41.500 --> 20:43.500
Christmas dinner in London.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.500
Do you understand what it's like to be a genius?

20:45.500 --> 20:47.500
Do you understand how fucking creative I am?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.500
Why can't you be a better girlfriend?

20:49.500 --> 20:51.500
What the fuck?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
You think I wanted to be behind deadline?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.500
Merry Christmas to me.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.500
Go have fun.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.500
Go eat your figgy pudding.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
I'm going to be here trying to write this script.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.500
Okay, all right, fine.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.500
We'll try to make our own fun in London.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
Jesus Christ, going to fucking fade in

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
on me jerking off!

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
Oh!

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
They have the Internet in London too.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.500
I'm going to be here.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
They have the Internet in London too.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.500
Oh!

21:19.500 --> 21:21.500
It's just clear what's coming out.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.500
I'm feeling...

21:23.500 --> 21:25.500
Ah!

21:25.500 --> 21:27.500
I had to use a coat hanger.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.500
Um...

21:29.500 --> 21:31.500
I don't know.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.500
I don't know what it means either.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.500
You guys reacted like you do know what it means.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
There must be a way to jerk off

21:37.500 --> 21:39.500
with a coat hanger.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.500
Did you get yourself pregnant and had a weird...

21:41.500 --> 21:43.500
I don't know.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.500
Chicago reaction, but...

21:45.500 --> 21:47.500
I mean, I think it just might be a

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
revulsion rather, a gross...

21:49.500 --> 21:51.500
I could have said fire hydrant.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.500
Maybe they would have reacted that way.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
I think they would have gone, huh?

21:55.500 --> 21:57.500
I said coat hanger and they were like,

21:57.500 --> 21:59.500
whoa, not the number 52!

21:59.500 --> 22:01.500
Chicago style, whoa!

22:01.500 --> 22:03.500
Deep dish jerking off with a coat hanger.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.500
It's the secrets in the water.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.500
We ship it in from New York.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.500
Um, all right.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.500
So, yeah, whatever.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.500
Just react for the sake of it.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.500
It doesn't matter.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.500
So, skip the Christmas vacation.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.500
I ruined Christmas because I'm like,

22:21.500 --> 22:23.500
look, I would have loved to have not taken

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
where I got two scripts to write.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.500
I got two scripts to write.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.500
Get back home.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
Okay, I'll just finish them up

22:31.500 --> 22:33.500
right before we go on this tour.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.500
Okay, we're going on the tour.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.500
All right, I'll write the scripts on the tour.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
Yeah, I'm being filmed.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.500
Oh, it's a movie.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
Am I making a movie? Yeah!

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
Hey, what's it like to be so smart?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
I don't know. Yeah, I'm producing the movie.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
Am I being smart? Yeah, I'm paying for the whole thing.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.500
Uh, here you go, CBS.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.500
Hey, I did it. I did it.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.500
I did it. I wrote a script.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
Okay, we have a couple notes.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.500
Yeah, that should be easy. I can knock that out in a day.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.500
Do you promise? What do you mean?

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
Chris, you'll be done in a day.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.500
Six days later.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.500
Yeah!

23:09.500 --> 23:11.500
Okay, there you go.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.500
We're on the tour bus most of the time.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.500
Is that what's going on when you close a little bunk curtain?

23:15.500 --> 23:17.500
At this point, it's become a figurative...

23:17.500 --> 23:19.500
No, I haven't...

23:19.500 --> 23:21.500
The irony is that the masturbation only began

23:21.500 --> 23:23.500
when the physical masturbating stopped.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.500
Okay.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.500
When you're in a giant phallic bus

23:27.500 --> 23:29.500
containing you and a camera crew

23:29.500 --> 23:31.500
asking you questions about yourself,

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
you really don't need your dick

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
to be involved anymore.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
You're just...

23:37.500 --> 23:39.500
The whole world is your pussy right now.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.500
Yeah.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.500
So,

23:43.500 --> 23:45.500
CBS script gets finished.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.500
Fox one is not.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.500
There's a point where Fox says,

23:49.500 --> 23:51.500
listen, really, it has to be done.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.500
Okay, can I have two more days?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.500
We'll...

23:55.500 --> 23:57.500
In one and a half days,

23:57.500 --> 23:59.500
they're going to start making a lot of their decisions.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
It's a practical answer.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.500
Okay, so I'll try to get to one and a half days.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.500
Yeah, because really, at that point,

24:05.500 --> 24:07.500
you're kind of, you know,

24:07.500 --> 24:09.500
we'll have to, you know, take it a slower path,

24:09.500 --> 24:11.500
meaning that, you know, all these other scripts

24:11.500 --> 24:13.500
are going to get picked up and you'll be kind of behind the flock.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
Okay, all right, good.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.500
So, one and a half days later, I'm like,

24:17.500 --> 24:19.500
fuck it, it's not finished.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
So, party time.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.500
When was this, a couple days ago?

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
Yeah, it was like, Saturday afternoon

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
was the day that I kind of, like, you know,

24:27.500 --> 24:29.500
if I had a shot, I would have, like,

24:29.500 --> 24:31.500
turned something into them.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.500
And then I didn't, so then I was like,

24:33.500 --> 24:35.500
okay, the upside of that

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
is that let's stop

24:37.500 --> 24:39.500
burdening the tour with...

24:39.500 --> 24:41.500
And so I started, I was just like,

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
let's have a glass of Kettle One and let's do

24:43.500 --> 24:45.500
some of these shows, like, unburdened.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.500
Then today, I was at a bar

24:47.500 --> 24:49.500
here in Chicago and I got an email from Fox

24:49.500 --> 24:51.500
that was like, script?

24:51.500 --> 24:53.500
And I was like,

24:53.500 --> 24:55.500
I can't really, I don't have

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
any right to be outraged by any of this.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.500
So, it's like, this whole thing reminds

24:59.500 --> 25:01.500
me of being in college.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.500
I'm a procrastinator and I'm always behind

25:03.500 --> 25:05.500
schedule and everything,

25:05.500 --> 25:07.500
but your professor is Fox.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
Like, that's...

25:09.500 --> 25:11.500
And it's not getting an A or an F.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.500
I think it's just being eight years old

25:13.500 --> 25:15.500
and, like, not cleaning your room

25:15.500 --> 25:17.500
which is festooned with your own

25:17.500 --> 25:19.500
shitty diapers, which you shouldn't

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
be shitting in anymore because you're eight.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.500
And, like, you smearing

25:23.500 --> 25:25.500
them all over your own walls

25:25.500 --> 25:27.500
and then your parents coming in and going,

25:27.500 --> 25:29.500
this is like shit. You might have

25:29.500 --> 25:31.500
a better time in your life

25:31.500 --> 25:33.500
if you stopped, like, shitting

25:33.500 --> 25:35.500
everywhere and raping it out.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.500
And you sucking your thumb and going,

25:37.500 --> 25:39.500
it hurts when you say that!

25:39.500 --> 25:41.500
But we're podcasting this show every night.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.500
Presumably, somebody at each of those networks

25:43.500 --> 25:45.500
is listening to all of this, right?

25:45.500 --> 25:47.500
Yeah, I know, but that's more shit on the wall.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.500
That's self-destruction. It's like,

25:49.500 --> 25:51.500
something's gonna get...

25:51.500 --> 25:53.500
So, you could get fired before these shows ever get picked up.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.500
That could set a new record, yes, is what you're saying.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.500
I have to be the Chuck Yeager

25:57.500 --> 25:59.500
of something, Jeff.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.500
It's not gonna be quality television.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.500
It's gonna have to be,

26:03.500 --> 26:05.500
like, I have to, like...

26:05.500 --> 26:07.500
My hope is by the age of 45

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
I will be able to write backwards

26:09.500 --> 26:11.500
and get fired in reverse.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.500
Like, I'll actually

26:13.500 --> 26:15.500
enter a parallel universe where I'm

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
promoted all the time.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.500
Because everything is, like, I've inverted,

26:19.500 --> 26:21.500
like, some kind of balloon.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.500
Now, it'll be fine. I'm exaggerating.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.500
I think CBS is very happy with their script.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.500
It's probably gonna be a big hit.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.500
I don't care.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
And I'll edit all this out.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
I went a little overboard with the honesty tonight.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.500
It's a little self-destructive.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
And nobody...

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
There's a gal engaging you over here.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.500
This lady works at Fox.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.500
Okay.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.500
She said she got a message from Eric Acosta

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
who works on the Adult Swim show

26:51.500 --> 26:53.500
and they need me back immediately.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.500
Is that true?

26:55.500 --> 26:57.500
Wait, are your friends with Eric Acosta?

26:57.500 --> 26:59.500
Yeah?

26:59.500 --> 27:01.500
Did he send you here as his minion?

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
No.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.500
Okay.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.500
I mean, nobody needs me back there immediately.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.500
It's a very fun show. It's a right.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.500
The more they feel that way,

27:11.500 --> 27:13.500
the funner the show will get.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.500
Someone had a question over here?

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
A very well-spoken gentleman

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
over here has a question.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.500
All right.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.500
I mean, well, number one,

27:23.500 --> 27:25.500
I kind of make a wish.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
You're kind of a make-a-wish?

27:27.500 --> 27:29.500
That's neither a question nor a statement.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.500
Well...

27:31.500 --> 27:33.500
But it does sound like entertainment dynamite.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.500
Get out of here.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
Do you want me to just come up and come up before?

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
Because...

27:45.500 --> 27:47.500
Make-a-wish implies that he's dying.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.500
I'm going to get pretty grim up here.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
I already brought you down talking about my career.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
I'm prepared to share the tears.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.500
It's not good.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.500
I have a make-a-wish,

28:07.500 --> 28:09.500
but it's just because I want you to make me a drink.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.500
Oh.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.500
That's one. I have two drinks.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.500
Because you're dying of thirst.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.500
I would play that up.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.500
He's dying of thirst, you guys.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.500
I just kind of want...

28:21.500 --> 28:23.500
Well, you know, I was really...

28:23.500 --> 28:25.500
Honestly, I came here.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.500
I was just like...

28:27.500 --> 28:29.500
I mean, I have...

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
Go on.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
I have a situation.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.500
I have a situation called alcoholism.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.500
All right.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.500
Me too.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.500
And I was just really hoping

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
that Dan Harmon would make me a drink.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
That's not the cure for alcoholism.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.500
He doesn't know that.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.500
It's part of the affliction,

28:45.500 --> 28:47.500
is you don't know that.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.500
I have a different question besides that.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.500
Okay.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.500
And I don't know if this will...

28:53.500 --> 28:55.500
I don't want to get deep or whatever,

28:55.500 --> 28:57.500
but friends.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.500
Okay, here's my question.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.500
Friends.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.500
How can you make friends with the audience?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.500
No, no, no, no.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.500
Reveal.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
You have routine that and ask for world peace.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.500
Not that at all.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
My question was,

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
obviously, I mean,

29:11.500 --> 29:13.500
you portray yourself as an asshole.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.500
And I think of myself as an asshole.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
Like, I am shitty to people.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.500
Like, left and right.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.500
And now...

29:21.500 --> 29:23.500
And you portray yourself as that.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.500
And whatever.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.500
But so, how...

29:27.500 --> 29:29.500
How have you been able

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
to surround yourself

29:31.500 --> 29:33.500
with people that are actually talented?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.500
Like, Rob Chrop is...

29:35.500 --> 29:37.500
He's a smart man.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.500
And then you got

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
all the channel 101 crowd.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
And they're all...

29:43.500 --> 29:45.500
I mean, you've got a lot of good people

29:45.500 --> 29:47.500
in your situation.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.500
So you're asking Dan

29:49.500 --> 29:51.500
what makes him less of an asshole than you?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.500
Not quite.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.500
Close.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.500
Very close.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.500
More like, why...

29:59.500 --> 30:01.500
Why are you able

30:01.500 --> 30:03.500
to have talented people around you?

30:03.500 --> 30:05.500
And the...

30:05.500 --> 30:07.500
Are you saying...

30:07.500 --> 30:09.500
Am I getting your...

30:09.500 --> 30:11.500
Come on, you know...

30:11.500 --> 30:13.500
I don't...

30:13.500 --> 30:15.500
Are you guys the worst?

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
If I'm getting your question right,

30:17.500 --> 30:19.500
what you're asking is,

30:19.500 --> 30:21.500
you watch what I do,

30:21.500 --> 30:23.500
and you say to yourself,

30:23.500 --> 30:25.500
well, I've got the I'm an asshole part down.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.500
And you want to know where the success comes in.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
What am I not doing right?

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
I'm tapping my nose.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.500
Like, straight.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.500
I mean, my answer is going to sound

30:35.500 --> 30:37.500
self-aggrandizing.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.500
I'm going to say, I have good taste in people,

30:39.500 --> 30:41.500
or I'm going to say...

30:41.500 --> 30:43.500
I've seen you like at...

30:43.500 --> 30:45.500
I went to Wisconsin,

30:45.500 --> 30:47.500
so I've seen your brother's ad even,

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
like when you did the Brothers Subs

30:49.500 --> 30:51.500
bullshit.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.500
Right, Cousins Subs, yeah.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.500
Yeah, sorry.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.500
No, it was...

30:57.500 --> 30:59.500
Yeah, exactly.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
No, he was a young pimply dude,

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
talented people.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
So...

31:05.500 --> 31:07.500
Well, how does that explain

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
this moment right now?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
I obviously don't have

31:11.500 --> 31:13.500
like, untalented repellent.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.500
I don't just say it.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
I'm not just saying it.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.500
So,

31:19.500 --> 31:21.500
you're a talented person,

31:21.500 --> 31:23.500
and also awful.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.500
Right. I mean, by your own

31:25.500 --> 31:27.500
admission.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.500
So you've been able to find a community.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.500
The answer, my friend...

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
It's a rap battle!

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
It's a rap battle!

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
Breakdown, Chicago style.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.500
I'm rapping weak, I'm rapping wild.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
Got my man, I can't remember his name

31:49.500 --> 31:51.500
on the stage.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.500
Yo, rage.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.500
Doesn't matter what I do.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.500
Bars set so low, I can...

31:57.500 --> 31:59.500
shoot.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.500
Gonna rap a while, gonna hand him the mic

32:01.500 --> 32:03.500
and hear his rapping style.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.500
Go right.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.500
So,

32:07.500 --> 32:09.500
I just wanted to ask you about

32:09.500 --> 32:11.500
the mean of operation.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.500
And then I thought that

32:13.500 --> 32:15.500
I just wanted to give you a little bit

32:15.500 --> 32:17.500
of fashion

32:17.500 --> 32:19.500
with my dick.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.500
Because, apparently, that's how it goes.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
And that might be kind of sick.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.500
Wait! Hold up!

32:25.500 --> 32:27.500
Just wanted to say

32:27.500 --> 32:29.500
I woke up this morning

32:29.500 --> 32:31.500
and thought I'd get some food

32:31.500 --> 32:33.500
and then I thought, what might be kind of good, dude?

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
I thought it might go

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
on home.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
And I...

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
Ran, your question was what?

32:51.500 --> 32:53.500
I just ruined everything.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
No, you didn't.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
I mean, for yourself alone, really.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
There is no...

32:59.500 --> 33:01.500
They're not...

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
They're booing you because

33:03.500 --> 33:05.500
that's part of the story.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.500
You're not the hero, you're not the hero.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.500
They're cheering you

33:09.500 --> 33:11.500
by booing Darth Vader.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.500
Darth Vader owns it.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
Darth Vader goes, yes, keep booing.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.500
He doesn't go like, right?

33:19.500 --> 33:21.500
What? I didn't close someone's throat

33:21.500 --> 33:23.500
and shut with the force.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.500
I'm not. I don't.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.500
How do you...

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
on Tatooine?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.500
What's your secret with the...

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
How do you...

33:33.500 --> 33:35.500
I'm evil. I want to suck the fucking life

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
out of your show and your universe.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.500
I want control.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.500
I want power.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.500
I have a fucking face shaped like a skull

33:43.500 --> 33:45.500
with a Nazi helmet on it.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.500
That makes him a hero

33:47.500 --> 33:49.500
to his own people, at least.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.500
I'm going to curl into a ball with Jeff

33:51.500 --> 33:53.500
right now.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.500
Like, I...

33:55.500 --> 33:57.500
I can't find it.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
Like...

34:01.500 --> 34:03.500
This is the only comfort I find.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.500
You're doing it wrong.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.500
Ryan, everybody.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
Thank you for Ryan.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.500
Ryan.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.500
Fuck it.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.500
Here, Ryan.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.500
Really?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.500
What do you think of what I'm thinking?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.500
What?

34:21.500 --> 34:23.500
Okay, all right.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
Yeah.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
Discretion.dot.vowler.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.500
I was just thinking like,

34:29.500 --> 34:31.500
like, you know, like if you...

34:31.500 --> 34:33.500
you know, if you just...

34:33.500 --> 34:35.500
into the spin, you know,

34:35.500 --> 34:37.500
like when you're driving on the ice.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.500
Where did you get the little Dorothy Parker hat

34:39.500 --> 34:41.500
you had on there for a while?

34:41.500 --> 34:43.500
The Eric Acosta messenger had a little

34:43.500 --> 34:45.500
Dorothy Parker hat which doubled as a can go

34:45.500 --> 34:47.500
to hit the fan.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.500
All right, so enough about my career.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.500
Let's bring Spencer up right now, everybody.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.500
Yeah.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
Yeah.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
Yeah.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
Yeah.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.500
Yeah.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.500
Yeah.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
Yeah.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.500
Chicago.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.500
Right? Yeah.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.500
Yeah.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.500
He is the dungeon master.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
The earlier, yeah.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.500
We should have brought him up moments ago.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.500
Yeah.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.500
They love you, Spencer. We love you.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.500
God. Thanks, guys.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.500
Spencer, I see you're wearing pants.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
He can wear shorts all day today and not be bothered by it.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.500
I got nothing but tweets from people saying

35:29.500 --> 35:31.500
wear pants, bundle up.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.500
You're a pussy.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
Like, I'm just like over it.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
Well, people take their weather seriously.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.500
I don't take your guys's weather seriously.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.500
I could be rocking shorts.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
I'm concerned about your own well-being.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
People care about your health now, Spencer.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.500
Well, fuck them.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.500
Wow.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.500
No, no, thanks. I appreciate your concern.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.500
Spencer, I understand that you had

35:53.500 --> 35:55.500
your first deep dish pizza today.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
I said...

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
I said Spencer did.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.500
Yeah.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
I also took my first shit in Chicago.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.500
No, no, your pizza's good.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.500
Your pizza's good.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.500
I like you guys and your pizza.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
So flattered.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
They rolled up the red carpet for us here.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
This is the warmest audience I've ever...

36:15.500 --> 36:17.500
It's amazing. What a cool room.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.500
In front of...

36:19.500 --> 36:21.500
It's like being in the actual Second City Main Stage,

36:21.500 --> 36:23.500
but without all the political shame.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.500
No.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.500
Speaking of which,

36:27.500 --> 36:29.500
I met somebody outside before the show

36:29.500 --> 36:31.500
that I wanted to roll the dice on,

36:31.500 --> 36:33.500
so to speak, like, bringing up.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.500
I wanted the audience to meet him

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
and see if he provides as much joy

36:37.500 --> 36:39.500
for them as he...

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
I was very entertained

36:41.500 --> 36:43.500
by this guy.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
Is it Ben? Ben, are you here?

36:45.500 --> 36:47.500
The...

36:47.500 --> 36:49.500
Over here. He's over here.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
Oh, there you are. Okay.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
Are you willing to come up?

36:53.500 --> 36:55.500
Can you come up?

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
This is Ben.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
This one on. Check, check, check.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
You take that one.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.500
Do however you want. I want you to do your thing.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.500
Thank you.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
I feel like marionette strings have been attached

37:11.500 --> 37:13.500
and now the monkey has to dance.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
Being exploited is fine.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
It's cool.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.500
It's good. It's like...

37:21.500 --> 37:23.500
It's the rigor. It's what people do now.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.500
That's how the world works.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
How old are you?

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
16.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
They're good.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
They're good.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
You're aspiring filmmaker.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
I have to turn the crowd against you.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
Yeah, absolutely.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.500
The marionette strings have been attached.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.500
But really, it was your...

37:43.500 --> 37:45.500
Like...

37:45.500 --> 37:47.500
I don't know how to not put you on the spot,

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
but I wanted to kind of...

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
I just wanted to talk to you a little bit,

37:51.500 --> 37:53.500
because you were very flattering before the show

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
and I also thought the audience might be a little charmed with you,

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
but now they're going to feel compelled to.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.500
But then again, your lead-in couldn't have been better.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.500
Um...

38:01.500 --> 38:03.500
Yeah.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.500
You're safe and secure here.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
It's not...

38:07.500 --> 38:09.500
Yeah.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
You could lift up your shirt

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
and Hitler's face could be tattooed

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
on you and start speaking

38:15.500 --> 38:17.500
and he would still kill.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
Um...

38:19.500 --> 38:21.500
But I just want to...

38:21.500 --> 38:23.500
I don't know.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.500
I'm not a good interviewer, Ben.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.500
No, that's okay. I can babble.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.500
That's totally fine.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
It's like building upon the babbling.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
You know, it's weird that

38:33.500 --> 38:35.500
when I started, you know, watching community

38:35.500 --> 38:37.500
and started...

38:37.500 --> 38:39.500
You know, there's...

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
It's a culture of obsession.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
And I like being...

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
And just speaking generally,

38:45.500 --> 38:47.500
I think...

38:47.500 --> 38:49.500
I like the whole geek concept bothers me,

38:49.500 --> 38:51.500
because I think it's more important to

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
like things than to like the concept of liking things.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.500
So that's why...

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
I, you know...

38:57.500 --> 38:59.500
There's fetishization that's occurred,

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
you know, where it's like, I don't like...

39:01.500 --> 39:03.500
You know, I'm not passionate about filmmaking.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
I'm not passionate about Hitler.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.500
Or, you know,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
whatever. I'm just...

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
I just like liking things, you know.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.500
And so, like, on top of that,

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
part...

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
And so that's, you know, I kind of...

39:17.500 --> 39:19.500
You sort of grew up on that wavelength when I read about...

39:19.500 --> 39:21.500
You know, when I read about you.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
And so I think that's fascinating

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
and that's great.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.500
But, like, I was reading it.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.500
There was like this

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
bizarre sense of

39:31.500 --> 39:33.500
empathy building that I...

39:33.500 --> 39:35.500
It's like, oh, I don't idolize Dan Harmon.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.500
There's like this weird empathy.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.500
And I realized, you know, that's not like,

39:39.500 --> 39:41.500
oh, I'm so flattered thing.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.500
Oh, I'm an obnoxious 15-year-old boy.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
What that means, though, is that

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
for whatever reason...

39:47.500 --> 39:49.500
Were you 15, though?

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
Oh, sorry. Well, my birthday was on January 7th.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
So there's a time fluctuation.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.500
I had to figure out where I was 16 years ago.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
And if I...

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
Where would you have been 16 years ago?

39:59.500 --> 40:01.500
Oh, when you were 16.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.500
No, exactly. Very much so.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
I mean, he would have...

40:05.500 --> 40:07.500
He would have...

40:07.500 --> 40:09.500
Ben, your name? Yeah.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
Is your mama here tonight? No.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
Thank heavens for that. Thank heavens.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.500
But, like, building on top of that,

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
so we have the general mutilation

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
and the liking general mutilation,

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
not liking general mutilation.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.500
Back it up. Back it up.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
You can generalize it. Back that thought up.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
I'm sorry. It's like I associated

40:27.500 --> 40:29.500
filmmaking or whatever

40:29.500 --> 40:31.500
with general mutilation. I don't know why.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
Jeff, Jeff,

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
control him.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.500
Can I...

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
It's out of control right now, man.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
Well, so am I sometimes.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
I want to go back to the point.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.500
Ben, you met Dan in line today?

40:45.500 --> 40:47.500
I absolutely did, yeah.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.500
And how did you make the leap from what he was doing

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
with general mutilation?

40:51.500 --> 40:53.500
I thought he was masturbating so much.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
Yeah, well, here's the thing, though, that...

40:55.500 --> 40:57.500
Ben, have you started masturbating?

40:57.500 --> 40:59.500
Absolutely, I have.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.500
You have? Yeah.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
Prove it.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
We're all going to jail tonight, everybody.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.500
And CBS is going to bail us all out.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
Yeah.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.500
Now, are you sorry?

41:17.500 --> 41:19.500
I want to introduce a possibility

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
because you're a Joseph Campbell fan.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.500
And that's like the heuristic

41:23.500 --> 41:25.500
through which, you know, you view the world.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.500
Which is great. So like, here's the thing.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.500
In your heuristic,

41:29.500 --> 41:31.500
at least the personas heuristic,

41:31.500 --> 41:33.500
you're Jango, right?

41:33.500 --> 41:35.500
Except you're not Black

41:35.500 --> 41:37.500
and you're not Jamie Foxx.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.500
But you're sort of...

41:39.500 --> 41:41.500
It's like that narrative, right?

41:41.500 --> 41:43.500
Of freeing yourself.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
And I am, you know, self-actualizing.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.500
But here's the thing.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.500
Have you entertained the possibility

41:49.500 --> 41:51.500
that you're actually Samuel L. Jackson

41:51.500 --> 41:53.500
and that...

41:53.500 --> 41:55.500
Or like, as a point, someone else is going to become Jango.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.500
Have you entertained the possibility

41:57.500 --> 41:59.500
that you are me?

41:59.500 --> 42:01.500
No, no, no, no, no.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.500
That's why I brought you up.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
I am so narcissistic

42:05.500 --> 42:07.500
that I'm so entertained by you.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.500
Because...

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
You're in the middle of the stage, Dan.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
I'm sitting stage left, he's stage right.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.500
It's like perspective is shrinking you.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.500
Yeah.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.500
And sending you back in time.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.500
We just need...

42:21.500 --> 42:23.500
In his right, we just need a six-year-old child going...

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
I mean, I don't mean...

42:25.500 --> 42:27.500
I mean, I don't mean...

42:27.500 --> 42:29.500
Give me a bottle.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.500
I just mean...

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
Because the world being what it is now,

42:33.500 --> 42:35.500
he's an earlier...

42:35.500 --> 42:37.500
He's a prodigy, you.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
Like, if you're a chess champion,

42:39.500 --> 42:41.500
he's a chess champion in an earlier age than you are.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.500
He got his shit more together, yeah.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.500
I mean, ladies, come on, Ben.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.500
I have to push him off the acropolis tonight.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.500
On my pointy.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.500
He's 16, ladies.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.500
He likes to mutilate those genitals.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.500
He's already started masturbating.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.500
That means...

42:57.500 --> 42:59.500
Yeah.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.500
Biologically, you can get out on the ground.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.500
Ben, I hate to tell anybody sexual advice,

43:03.500 --> 43:05.500
but you don't have to mutilate yourself

43:05.500 --> 43:07.500
to masturbate right.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.500
There's lotions and whatnot.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.500
Oh, dear. His coke just fell off.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.500
I can't know that.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.500
But my point was, like,

43:15.500 --> 43:17.500
the idea is to sort of...

43:17.500 --> 43:19.500
Ben, are you carrying a gun right now,

43:19.500 --> 43:21.500
by any chance?

43:21.500 --> 43:23.500
Well, the easy thing to do is to come up and...

43:23.500 --> 43:25.500
and...

43:25.500 --> 43:27.500
See, he's already learned...

43:27.500 --> 43:29.500
Sometimes you just blow past your...

43:29.500 --> 43:31.500
The easy thing to do is to come up and idolize you.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
And I wanted to insult you first

43:33.500 --> 43:35.500
so that the idolizing felt more personal

43:35.500 --> 43:37.500
and more true.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.500
The 25-year-old dude didn't get that.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.500
Like...

43:41.500 --> 43:43.500
He came up and was like...

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
Well, I'm gonna gain his respect, please.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.500
He's gonna...

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
Well, it's like, you know,

43:49.500 --> 43:51.500
the community is great

43:51.500 --> 43:53.500
because it's like, you know, how to relate to people.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.500
And...

43:55.500 --> 43:57.500
You know, and so, you know,

43:57.500 --> 43:59.500
you're huge. You provide

43:59.500 --> 44:01.500
people like me...

44:01.500 --> 44:03.500
Like, it's like, here, I'm...

44:03.500 --> 44:05.500
Wait, let me... Can I...

44:05.500 --> 44:07.500
No, I...

44:07.500 --> 44:09.500
I'm an obnoxious...

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
This is like a matter and anti-matter.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
Yeah.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.500
I'm 16, which means that I'm obnoxious

44:15.500 --> 44:17.500
and narcissistic, and then I see someone

44:17.500 --> 44:19.500
who is publicly obnoxious

44:19.500 --> 44:21.500
and narcissistic, and also...

44:21.500 --> 44:23.500
40.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.500
So, like I am

44:25.500 --> 44:27.500
at 15, and I think, hey,

44:27.500 --> 44:29.500
I, you know, filmmaking

44:29.500 --> 44:31.500
is really hard to do and really hard to be successful in,

44:31.500 --> 44:33.500
but if me with a

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
dashing beard, Pirate Man,

44:35.500 --> 44:37.500
can do it, maybe I can,

44:37.500 --> 44:39.500
you know, and so that's the thought.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.500
Yeah, thank you. That's why I want to...

44:41.500 --> 44:43.500
Yeah, that's amazing.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.500
I'm leaving town with...

44:45.500 --> 44:47.500
Give us a...

44:47.500 --> 44:49.500
Ryan, before we do that, Ryan,

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
you're 15, 16, we can't get a straight

44:51.500 --> 44:53.500
answer out of you on that.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.500
Where do you see yourself at

44:55.500 --> 44:57.500
40 years old with Danis right now?

44:57.500 --> 44:59.500
If you had your pie-in-the-sky dreams,

44:59.500 --> 45:01.500
where would you be at 40?

45:01.500 --> 45:03.500
Well...

45:03.500 --> 45:05.500
Aim big, like, shoot for the moon.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.500
Yeah, well...

45:07.500 --> 45:09.500
Don't be bashful.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.500
I know that you're normally

45:11.500 --> 45:13.500
a very bashful fellow,

45:13.500 --> 45:15.500
but I want you to come out of your shell

45:15.500 --> 45:17.500
for once in your life, and tell us

45:17.500 --> 45:19.500
where you think you, like, if you could have your dream,

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
where would you be at 40 years old?

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
Well, you know,

45:23.500 --> 45:25.500
again, I think Joseph Campbell again.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.500
Well, you know,

45:27.500 --> 45:29.500
was it Joseph Campbell who said

45:29.500 --> 45:31.500
all your bliss, so the dream shouldn't be

45:31.500 --> 45:33.500
I want to have all the money,

45:33.500 --> 45:35.500
all the cars, all of the mamas.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
The dream...

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
This is the effect I'm having

45:39.500 --> 45:41.500
with the podcast. This is the new generation coming out.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.500
Yeah, the dream that the person you...

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
The generation of mama fuckers.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
Yeah, you're corrupting the youth,

45:47.500 --> 45:49.500
but the, you know, the dream is you...

45:49.500 --> 45:51.500
with the vodka,

45:51.500 --> 45:53.500
you seem happy. You seem to have followed

45:53.500 --> 45:55.500
the bliss, you know.

45:55.500 --> 45:57.500
That's a good takeaway for a 16-year-old.

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
I'm glad. You have the vodka.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
I mean, you seem, you know,

46:01.500 --> 46:03.500
you seem to be happy

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
and surround by people who like what they're doing.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.500
But what do you want, Ben? What do you want for yourself?

46:07.500 --> 46:09.500
Exactly. You want to be an alcoholic 40-year-old

46:09.500 --> 46:11.500
with a beard?

46:11.500 --> 46:13.500
If that's what...

46:13.500 --> 46:15.500
If you're following your bliss, and if this is, like, you know,

46:15.500 --> 46:17.500
living as closely as you can

46:17.500 --> 46:19.500
to being happy and feeling like

46:19.500 --> 46:21.500
you're, you know...

46:21.500 --> 46:23.500
If... Hold on.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.500
Yeah, no, I'm gonna... If life is essentially

46:25.500 --> 46:27.500
being... I feel like you'd be...

46:27.500 --> 46:29.500
I feel like you'd be very good selling newspapers

46:29.500 --> 46:31.500
in the corner in the 30s.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.500
Yeah.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.500
Get you a little hat.

46:35.500 --> 46:37.500
Just give us a topic.

46:37.500 --> 46:39.500
Do you think you could talk simultaneously with me?

46:39.500 --> 46:41.500
We'll just both address the topic at the same time.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.500
Yes. Fun fact.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.500
So just ignore him. Don't listen

46:45.500 --> 46:47.500
to me, and I won't listen to you.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.500
But just talk to them. Yeah.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.500
Leave more. Just open your mind.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.500
Talk straight out. Don't listen to Dan.

46:53.500 --> 46:55.500
Don't listen to Ben.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.500
Precisely.

46:57.500 --> 46:59.500
40 years, and I've been doing this for 16 years, so it's like...

46:59.500 --> 47:01.500
Okay.

47:01.500 --> 47:03.500
Wait, what's the...

47:03.500 --> 47:05.500
Do we get a topic?

47:05.500 --> 47:07.500
Yeah, what's the topic? Narcissism.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.500
Oh!

47:09.500 --> 47:11.500
Yeah, yeah. Yourself.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.500
Narcissism is the word that I

47:13.500 --> 47:15.500
use most often because

47:15.500 --> 47:17.500
it's from a myth that

47:17.500 --> 47:19.500
someone is looking into a stream

47:19.500 --> 47:21.500
at themselves.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.500
And the myth is originally

47:23.500 --> 47:25.500
turned into a plant by doing it,

47:25.500 --> 47:27.500
which means that you never

47:27.500 --> 47:29.500
close your eyes

47:29.500 --> 47:31.500
when you look at me

47:31.500 --> 47:33.500
anymore.

47:33.500 --> 47:35.500
And figuring

47:35.500 --> 47:37.500
into the extent that you're honest about it,

47:37.500 --> 47:39.500
if you knew how to be honest about it,

47:39.500 --> 47:41.500
you would be able to liberate yourself.

47:41.500 --> 47:43.500
Like, there's a version of Narcissism

47:43.500 --> 47:45.500
that doesn't have to be a plant.

47:45.500 --> 47:47.500
He could get up and walk around and be Narcissist,

47:47.500 --> 47:49.500
but not be a plant.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.500
And then this is...

47:51.500 --> 47:53.500
It's not really sad and existential.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.500
Ben and Dan, everybody.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.500
Thank you, Ben.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.500
Ben, that was magnificent.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.500
Thank you, Ben.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.500
Of course you can ask me

48:03.500 --> 48:05.500
a question after the show.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.500
Can I ask you a question after

48:07.500 --> 48:09.500
everything I do so that I

48:09.500 --> 48:11.500
can not kill myself?

48:11.500 --> 48:13.500
I want to check in

48:13.500 --> 48:15.500
with Ben after every

48:15.500 --> 48:17.500
decision I make.

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
Any time.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.500
Where are you sitting?

48:21.500 --> 48:23.500
Okay, go back there.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.500
His brother is cool too. Don't get too jealous.

48:25.500 --> 48:27.500
He's one year older and he's getting all the attention,

48:27.500 --> 48:29.500
but it's just because

48:29.500 --> 48:31.500
next year I'll have you up.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.500
His brother wants to be a graphic designer

48:33.500 --> 48:35.500
and Ben wants to be a director.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.500
It's Ryan, right?

48:37.500 --> 48:39.500
Richard. I knew that.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.500
We both know Richard's a cooler name

48:41.500 --> 48:43.500
and that graphic designers are more creative

48:43.500 --> 48:45.500
than directors.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.500
You're an unsung hero.

48:47.500 --> 48:49.500
You're going to have more of an impact than him,

48:49.500 --> 48:51.500
but he'll be over there garnering all the attention

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
and then probably

48:53.500 --> 48:55.500
auto-erotic asphyxiation.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.500
Auto-erotic mutilation.

48:59.500 --> 49:01.500
Wow.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.500
I mean, I think he meant

49:03.500 --> 49:05.500
manipulation, genital manipulation.

49:05.500 --> 49:07.500
I don't think he did, Dan.

49:07.500 --> 49:09.500
That guy doesn't strike me

49:09.500 --> 49:11.500
as somebody who misspeaks.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.500
I think

49:13.500 --> 49:15.500
we're talking about a mutilated penis.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.500
Was I wrong to bring him up?

49:19.500 --> 49:21.500
Was that a bad instinct?

49:21.500 --> 49:23.500
If you met him before a show,

49:23.500 --> 49:25.500
wouldn't you be like,

49:25.500 --> 49:27.500
could you come up and meet a couple of friends of mine?

49:27.500 --> 49:29.500
I thought you might.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.500
If you're walking out of beach and you stub your toe

49:31.500 --> 49:33.500
on an old-timey lantern,

49:33.500 --> 49:35.500
you have to rub it.

49:35.500 --> 49:37.500
You have to mutilate it.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.500
Until there's nothing left.

49:39.500 --> 49:41.500
All right.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.500
Should we

49:43.500 --> 49:45.500
put Spencer on the spot?

49:45.500 --> 49:47.500
Excuse me, I'm burping.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.500
You okay, Dan?

49:49.500 --> 49:51.500
You need some prilosec, you all right?

49:51.500 --> 49:53.500
No, I don't need prilosec.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.500
Since the night we asked for it,

49:55.500 --> 49:57.500
people have been bringing prilosec

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
like just ancient people

49:59.500 --> 50:01.500
to some druidic temple.

50:01.500 --> 50:03.500
It's a very expensive drug.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.500
Prilosec, it's heartburn medicine.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.500
I mentioned that I needed some

50:07.500 --> 50:09.500
in Somerville,

50:09.500 --> 50:11.500
and then people

50:11.500 --> 50:13.500
are bringing prilosec

50:13.500 --> 50:15.500
like a weird

50:15.500 --> 50:17.500
druidic ritual.

50:17.500 --> 50:19.500
It's shameful and amazing

50:19.500 --> 50:21.500
and cool.

50:21.500 --> 50:23.500
Why do you have such a bad heartburn?

50:23.500 --> 50:25.500
I don't know, I have to go in and get it checked out

50:25.500 --> 50:27.500
because I was just noticing today I saw a commercial for it

50:27.500 --> 50:29.500
and Larry the Cable Guy is the new spokesman for it.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
So I was like,

50:31.500 --> 50:33.500
I got to get off this train.

50:33.500 --> 50:35.500
That certainly is a signpost.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.500
I never bothered to read the box,

50:37.500 --> 50:39.500
but I bothered to read the fine print

50:39.500 --> 50:41.500
on the commercial.

50:41.500 --> 50:43.500
It said,

50:43.500 --> 50:45.500
don't take it for 14 days

50:45.500 --> 50:47.500
and don't take it for more than

50:47.500 --> 50:49.500
four months. I've been taking prilosec

50:49.500 --> 50:51.500
for like fucking, I don't know,

50:51.500 --> 50:53.500
season two of Community Like I Started.

50:53.500 --> 50:55.500
I got to go to the doctor again.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.500
I'm sure it's related to

50:57.500 --> 50:59.500
Popeye's spinach here.

50:59.500 --> 51:01.500
I'm sure it's not great on your epiglottis.

51:01.500 --> 51:03.500
It probably wore down maybe the flap

51:03.500 --> 51:05.500
above the Bip Bap

51:05.500 --> 51:07.500
and then maybe stomach acid

51:07.500 --> 51:09.500
gets up more. That's a guess.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.500
I'm not a doctor, but

51:11.500 --> 51:13.500
here's what the doctors did when I went to them.

51:13.500 --> 51:15.500
I went to my regular doctor. I said,

51:15.500 --> 51:17.500
I'm having frequent heartburn. He said,

51:17.500 --> 51:19.500
how frequent? I said, it's this frequent.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.500
He said, okay, you should go to a specialist.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.500
I'm like, great, that's what I expected you to say

51:23.500 --> 51:25.500
and that's how it goes. He gave me a referral.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.500
I went to this guy, the specialist.

51:27.500 --> 51:29.500
I went into the specialist.

51:29.500 --> 51:31.500
The specialist said, what do you have?

51:31.500 --> 51:33.500
This is frequent. He said, okay,

51:33.500 --> 51:35.500
get up on the table, take down your pants

51:35.500 --> 51:37.500
and I was kind of like, he didn't

51:37.500 --> 51:39.500
say, I mean, I could have said no.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.500
He just

51:41.500 --> 51:43.500
kind of took charge and was like,

51:43.500 --> 51:45.500
get up on the table, take down your pants

51:45.500 --> 51:47.500
and I was like, okay, and I took down my pants

51:47.500 --> 51:49.500
and he's like, roll over

51:49.500 --> 51:51.500
and he stuck his finger.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.500
Are you sure he was a doctor? He stuck his finger

51:53.500 --> 51:55.500
up my ass and felt around

51:55.500 --> 51:57.500
and said, everything

51:57.500 --> 51:59.500
seems fine.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.500
No sign of external hemorrhids.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
Two things I know aren't true.

52:03.500 --> 52:05.500
The only things,

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
I know everything's not fine in my butthole.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.500
It's my butthole.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.500
I'm Dan Harmon.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.500
I'm the butthole of people.

52:13.500 --> 52:15.500
I know my butthole isn't fine.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.500
It's not like, if you're

52:17.500 --> 52:19.500
a butthole expert, you know,

52:19.500 --> 52:21.500
I know that there's, I don't want to...

52:21.500 --> 52:23.500
What part of heartburn

52:23.500 --> 52:25.500
didn't you understand?

52:25.500 --> 52:27.500
How does your butthole affect heartburn?

52:27.500 --> 52:29.500
I don't know.

52:29.500 --> 52:31.500
But after he did it, he gave me a

52:31.500 --> 52:33.500
referral to a specialist.

52:33.500 --> 52:35.500
And I didn't go, Jeff.

52:35.500 --> 52:37.500
And, well, because

52:37.500 --> 52:39.500
it fooled me twice.

52:39.500 --> 52:41.500
I did the first...

52:41.500 --> 52:43.500
The first guy did nothing. The second

52:43.500 --> 52:45.500
guy raped me.

52:45.500 --> 52:47.500
I'm going to send you to a guy named Ray Ray

52:47.500 --> 52:49.500
and, uh...

52:49.500 --> 52:51.500
Yeah, who's that guy refer you to?

52:51.500 --> 52:53.500
The real doctor sent me to a rape

52:53.500 --> 52:55.500
doctor.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.500
And I don't mean a doctor that helps

52:57.500 --> 52:59.500
rape victims. Obviously, I told you the story.

52:59.500 --> 53:01.500
I meant, well, don't groan it. It's not a pun.

53:01.500 --> 53:03.500
It's not he-haw.

53:03.500 --> 53:05.500
Uh...

53:05.500 --> 53:07.500
It's rape.

53:07.500 --> 53:09.500
Whoever groaned that, you take rape too lightly.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.500
Spencer, I'm going to try to...

53:11.500 --> 53:13.500
I know you hate it. We're going to put you on the spot.

53:13.500 --> 53:15.500
Spencer has a gift of creating monsters as

53:15.500 --> 53:17.500
a Dungeon Master out of thin air.

53:17.500 --> 53:19.500
The, uh...

53:19.500 --> 53:21.500
Spencer?

53:21.500 --> 53:23.500
Freestyle monster

53:23.500 --> 53:25.500
DMing, uh...

53:25.500 --> 53:27.500
The Proctologist.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.500
With a creak, the door

53:29.500 --> 53:31.500
opens.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.500
Immediately, you feel something's not

53:33.500 --> 53:35.500
right.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.500
Take off your pants, he says.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.500
It's all right, he says.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.500
I'm a doctor, he says.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.500
But no.

53:45.500 --> 53:47.500
The Proctologist.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.500
Yeah. He's good.

53:49.500 --> 53:53.500
Thank you.

53:55.500 --> 53:57.500
Spencer,

53:57.500 --> 53:59.500
you're becoming a national treasure. You know that, right?

53:59.500 --> 54:01.500
Yeah.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.500
Oh, that's awesome.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.500
But...

54:07.500 --> 54:09.500
Come on, give me a job.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.500
Oh, yeah, we haven't asked you this.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.500
If you had any job in the world, what would

54:13.500 --> 54:15.500
your dream job be?

54:15.500 --> 54:17.500
No, no, no.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.500
Don't tell Apple this,

54:19.500 --> 54:21.500
but I'm a PC user.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.500
Nice.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.500
D-Dishonest...

54:25.500 --> 54:27.500
Dishonest Apple employee.

54:27.500 --> 54:29.500
Wearing a smile that can only

54:29.500 --> 54:31.500
be described as practiced.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.500
The blue shirt

54:33.500 --> 54:35.500
at a point, in process, asking

54:35.500 --> 54:37.500
if you found everything okay.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.500
But behind his eyes,

54:39.500 --> 54:41.500
you can tell he doesn't really care.

54:41.500 --> 54:47.500
That's all.

54:49.500 --> 54:51.500
But, uh,

54:51.500 --> 54:53.500
career, I don't know, man.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.500
You should be a writer.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.500
Do you ever write anything down? Do you write stuff?

54:57.500 --> 54:59.500
I used to, like,

54:59.500 --> 55:01.500
I can write when I'm prompted and I enjoy it,

55:01.500 --> 55:03.500
but, like, unless I'm prompted

55:03.500 --> 55:05.500
or have some reason to do it, I just won't do it at all.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.500
Looks like Dan Harmon.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.500
Yeah.

55:09.500 --> 55:11.500
That's how I get the big bucks, baby.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.500
I guess I'm on the right track.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.500
Spencer, I'm being attacked.

55:15.500 --> 55:17.500
I'm on a path and I'm attacked

55:17.500 --> 55:19.500
by a writer's block.

55:19.500 --> 55:21.500
What does it sound like?

55:21.500 --> 55:23.500
A large block

55:23.500 --> 55:25.500
interposes your path.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.500
Looking around, you see

55:27.500 --> 55:29.500
no obvious exits.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.500
You sit down and see if you might

55:31.500 --> 55:33.500
be able to hammer out a solution,

55:33.500 --> 55:35.500
but none arrives.

55:35.500 --> 55:43.500
It'll be a long night.

55:43.500 --> 55:47.500
Your chinitals are mutilated.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.500
Looking at the dripping mess

55:49.500 --> 55:59.500
between your legs.

55:59.500 --> 56:01.500
That's all.

56:01.500 --> 56:03.500
That's all the time we have, folks.

56:03.500 --> 56:05.500
Tim your way, staff.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.500
Dripping mess, good heavens.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.500
Yeah, it's a dungeon.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.500
Spencer, I'm being attacked

56:11.500 --> 56:13.500
by procrastination, specifically.

56:13.500 --> 56:15.500
I'm a writer. I'm on an adventure.

56:15.500 --> 56:17.500
I'm being attacked by the procrastination monster.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.500
Sitting at your desk,

56:19.500 --> 56:21.500
you come across a flash of insight,

56:21.500 --> 56:23.500
but then

56:23.500 --> 56:25.500
a tweet.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.500
All right.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.500
All right.

56:29.500 --> 56:31.500
That was it, yeah.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.500
He's Cal Ripken.

56:33.500 --> 56:35.500
Yeah.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.500
He really is.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.500
The Sixler.

56:39.500 --> 56:41.500
Sixler is an LL.

56:41.500 --> 56:43.500
Guys keep saying Sixer.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.500
Some guy in Germany is going to be getting

56:45.500 --> 56:47.500
all these tweets.

56:47.500 --> 56:49.500
We love you.

56:49.500 --> 56:51.500
As in one who sixles.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.500
What is the significance of Sixler?

56:53.500 --> 56:55.500
It's time, you guys.

56:55.500 --> 56:57.500
We're going to...

56:57.500 --> 56:59.500
All right.

56:59.500 --> 57:01.500
Let's reveal

57:01.500 --> 57:03.500
Spencer's conjoined twin, the Fiveler.

57:05.500 --> 57:07.500
Open your mind.

57:07.500 --> 57:09.500
The funny thing is there is a Fiveler,

57:09.500 --> 57:11.500
but the Sevenler doesn't exist.

57:11.500 --> 57:13.500
Anyway,

57:13.500 --> 57:15.500
we were playing a game that was kind of like

57:15.500 --> 57:17.500
D&D, like a free form RPG

57:17.500 --> 57:19.500
that my friend ran.

57:19.500 --> 57:21.500
And he was trying

57:21.500 --> 57:23.500
to be interesting and offbeat,

57:23.500 --> 57:25.500
so for character creation, he drew

57:25.500 --> 57:27.500
what was kind of like one of those

57:27.500 --> 57:29.500
speaking, I don't know what they're called.

57:29.500 --> 57:31.500
It was a circle with fucking drawings on it.

57:31.500 --> 57:33.500
You can spell?

57:33.500 --> 57:35.500
That's what I was thinking, but that's not what it is.

57:35.500 --> 57:37.500
A C&C.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.500
Like a farm animal noise machine.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.500
C&C, right?

57:41.500 --> 57:43.500
The cow goes moo.

57:43.500 --> 57:45.500
Yeah, that's the one.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.500
But it had objects, like it had a baseball

57:47.500 --> 57:49.500
and a head of lettuce and a colander

57:49.500 --> 57:51.500
and master chief from Halo.

57:51.500 --> 57:53.500
And

57:53.500 --> 57:55.500
so the idea was you pick two elements

57:55.500 --> 57:57.500
and then he forms your character.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.500
So I picked a bagel

57:59.500 --> 58:01.500
and a burglar, and I became the bagler

58:01.500 --> 58:03.500
and I didn't like that.

58:03.500 --> 58:05.500
So I chose a six and a bagel

58:05.500 --> 58:07.500
and I became the sixler.

58:07.500 --> 58:09.500
And we played the game, and my friend was the colander,

58:09.500 --> 58:11.500
and

58:11.500 --> 58:13.500
it was a good game, like instead of rolling dice to hit,

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
we'd have to throw paper balls

58:15.500 --> 58:17.500
through like his move outstretched arms,

58:17.500 --> 58:19.500
like a circle.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.500
And so it was actually kind of interesting, but

58:21.500 --> 58:23.500
anyway, the sixler was

58:23.500 --> 58:25.500
just a pretty cool dude

58:25.500 --> 58:27.500
and a volcano exploded,

58:27.500 --> 58:29.500
but he was fine, like he was right next to it

58:29.500 --> 58:31.500
and was just like, I'm a cool dude.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.500
And the lava didn't affect him.

58:33.500 --> 58:35.500
And that just kept going on, like I'd step into traps

58:35.500 --> 58:37.500
and the trap wouldn't affect me because I was a cool dude.

58:37.500 --> 58:39.500
And

58:39.500 --> 58:41.500
it wasn't my game, like

58:41.500 --> 58:43.500
this was someone else's choice too, I could have died.

58:43.500 --> 58:45.500
But

58:45.500 --> 58:47.500
yeah, so and then I thought the sixler sounds

58:47.500 --> 58:49.500
cool, like it's got an X, it's got

58:49.500 --> 58:51.500
the X sound, it's got

58:51.500 --> 58:53.500
L sounds, R sounds, S sounds, all your good sounds.

58:53.500 --> 58:55.500
And

58:55.500 --> 58:57.500
it's original enough to be an online

58:57.500 --> 58:59.500
handle. It's not the sixler

58:59.500 --> 59:01.500
42 or the sixler heart, you know,

59:01.500 --> 59:03.500
one, four, three, seven,

59:03.500 --> 59:05.500
but it was just the sixler. So

59:05.500 --> 59:07.500
anytime I sign up for an internet,

59:07.500 --> 59:09.500
I don't need, you know, numbers after it.

59:09.500 --> 59:11.500
So I just kind of stuck.

59:11.500 --> 59:13.500
Alright, that was practical and

59:13.500 --> 59:15.500
practical and sentimental and

59:15.500 --> 59:17.500
alright.

59:17.500 --> 59:19.500
What do you think?

59:19.500 --> 59:21.500
Is it time to

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
shift into the

59:23.500 --> 59:25.500
oh god, yes.

59:27.500 --> 59:29.500
Are you saying we should play D&D

59:29.500 --> 59:31.500
right now?

59:31.500 --> 59:33.500
Aaron

59:33.500 --> 59:35.500
McGathey to the stage.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.500
Erin McGathy.

59:37.500 --> 59:39.500
And

59:45.500 --> 59:47.500
wherever you want to make yourself

59:47.500 --> 59:49.500
at home, you won't

59:49.500 --> 59:51.500
be the first person to do

59:51.500 --> 59:53.500
to wherever you want to be.

59:53.500 --> 59:55.500
Did you throw a die up on stage?

59:55.500 --> 59:57.500
I threw a die.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.500
People are throwing

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.500
panties. Yeah, people are throwing

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500
a multi-sided die.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500
He's the Tom Jones of D&D.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.500
A pair of panties

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
is less of a threat than

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.500
hard, round objects.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.500
You could choke on those.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
And even if you don't,

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500
there's a fine line between a die

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500
and a rock. How many people

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.500
in this audience of about, I would say

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.500
300, how many of you have ever played

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.500
D&D?

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.500
All the people that got here first.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.500
All those

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
who lined up.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
Spencer has dispensed

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
the character sheets.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.500
We should do a, D&D

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500
has also become a chance to do a

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.500
relationship check-in with Aaron.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.500
For those of you who listen to the

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.500
Pittsburgh show, it was a doozy.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.500
Dan, I got

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500
two more emails in the last

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500
30 minutes. From the same person?

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.500
No, from different people

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500
regarding the show. Three very

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.500
audience about the whole...

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.500
I did want to say to the person that wrote

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.500
Aaron an email, the subject line dial it

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.500
back.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.500
Where they gave her a bunch of notes

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500
along the lines of

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.500
whatever. Fuck you.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.500
It was fair.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500
Only I get to

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.500
suggest

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.500
that Aaron needs to be somehow

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.500
psychologically broken.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.500
She's the greatest

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500
hero on the face of the earth forever

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.500
to hear me with her vagina

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.500
let alone her mind

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
and her soul.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
It took

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.500
that, you reading that email to me

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500
where someone was kind of on my side

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.500
in quotes for me to go, fuck

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.500
her, fuck me, fuck

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.500
everyone, you're the best.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.500
You endure a lot and I'm so sorry.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.500
Do we talk about those

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.500
emails or do we not want to engage

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.500
that person? You could read it, it's pretty interesting.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.500
I could read it.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.500
It seems like a dangerous path to one day.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500
That is true.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500
It's like serial killer rights to the

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500
New York Times.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500
Read this or I'll kill again.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500
It's like, well, wait a minute.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500
I also, I don't think that

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500
just to clarify, I don't think that this

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500
email is unreasonable.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
It's possible to be on this person's side

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500
but don't write a fucking email

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.500
to a stranger and tell them they're business.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.500
Why does a stranger is writing

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.500
emails?

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500
How do they get your email address?

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.500
It's my podcast email.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.500
Oh boy.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500
So I have several emails.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500
This one's about the Rhode Island show.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500
Goodness.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
All right.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500
Hey everybody.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500
Sit back, relax. We're going to read a negative

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500
email.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500
Hi, Erin McGathy.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500
Yes, I know I don't actually know you

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.500
but I am feeling compelled to write you after

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.500
listening to Harmontown in Rhode Island

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500
because it sounds like you are about to

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
self-destruct.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500
You have to dial it back

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500
with the needing constant affirmation

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.500
of Dan's unflinching love for you.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
You will drive him crazy and this will

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500
totally undermine your relationship.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500
Asking about his dirty comments

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.500
to the ladies at the previous show.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500
I'm not sure what she's referring to.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500
And then asking the audience if you should

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500
feel bad about if Jeff

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.500
asking Dan.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500
If this was a nice email, I'd correct her

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500
if she didn't.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.500
If you should feel bad

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500
about if Jeff asking Dan

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500
about fetishes is a reflection of his lack

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.500
of respect for your relationship.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.500
Sounds really ugly and petty and unnecessary

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500
on your part.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500
I am almost the same age as Dan and got that Dan

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.500
was just joking and being dirty because

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500
he has a dirty mind and that shit's funny.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.500
I deserve him more than

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.500
you.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.500
I deserve him

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500
sitting in a room full

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.500
of people.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.500
I got dumped by a writer

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.500
taking it out on Dan's

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.500
girlfriend.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500
Also Jeff

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.500
bring up fetishes is just

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500
good controlling because it's a titillating

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500
and taboo subject and therefore intriguing.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500
I agree, I agree, I agree.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.500
Besides he didn't exclude the possibility

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.500
he

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500
didn't exclude the possibility that maybe

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.500
you and Dan are working out new fetishes

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.500
together.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.500
I don't think anything they say or do on stage personally.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.500
It's just for the funny

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.500
and to make people think and possibly some sort

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.500
of therapy for Dan.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.500
He sounds like he's feeling good on stage.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.500
I think this may have been written by a zebra.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.500
I started listening

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500
to your podcast at the same time last year

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.500
and I am definitely a fan.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.500
So I guess I'm just rooting for you and Dan

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.500
to continue through life together.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500
I really think you just don't

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.500
need to worry so much about his feelings for you.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.500
He sounds way into you and that he

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.500
would be straight up if something was a problem.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.500
So just relax and have fun.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.500
Brace could go crazy about my new show

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.500
that isn't really important in the bigger picture

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500
and it is a waste of time to dwell on it.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.500
Signed the relaxation master.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.500
Or signed Adam Schmoldberg.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500
Fascinating phenomenon where it's like you go

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.500
okay none of that I

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.500
disagree with, whatever.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.500
That's exactly all the shit I would say to Aaron

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
like hey relax it's just a show.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.500
Don't stop the track.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500
But fuck you lady.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.500
It's a full time job being my girlfriend.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.500
It's a horrible, horrible, did you see

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.500
backdraft? It's worse than that.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.500
It's so much worse.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.500
Fire is a living thing.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500
I won't read it.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.500
I'll just paraphrase it.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.500
I did get another email

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.500
which hit home.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.500
From somebody who just

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500
who heard the Pittsburgh show.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.500
I got another email

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.500
about the Pittsburgh show in which

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500
I

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500
expressed some insecurity

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.500
but as Dan and I discussed earlier

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.500
today Dan and I had this really big fight

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.500
and...

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.500
No.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.500
In a world

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.500
Dan and I had a really big fight

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.500
Dan talked about it on stage

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.500
and as I was sitting backstage I was thinking

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.500
about the fight and I was feeling very sad.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.500
Went on stage and Dan said

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.500
hey was I dishonest about anything?

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.500
You've been backstage.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.500
You haven't had a chance to say your side of the story.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.500
Dan hadn't said anything dishonest

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.500
but I felt like just hearing

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.500
him talk about it again made me feel

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.500
upset but instead of saying

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.500
yeah that fight made me feel upset.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.500
I latched on to something that was more

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.500
shallow. This bit about

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500
masturbating to a 17 year old

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500
volleyball player.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500
Which I

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.500
got an email saying

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.500
hey like Harmontowns for fun

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.500
and this feels terrible as for sadness.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.500
So.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
Which I was like

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.500
I think my podcast is fun sometimes. It's sad fun.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500
It's a lot of sad. It's a fun sad.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500
Right?

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
We laugh through our tears.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.500
But they were worried

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.500
that and this is Dan's worry

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500
they were worried that because I had said

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500
it hurt my feelings that you talked about this

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
that Dan would stop talking about things like that

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.500
or he would censor himself.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500
And I wanted to say to that person

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500
and every listener that

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500
no he can talk about whatever he likes

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
and that's why I'm crazy in love with him

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500
and I'm going to have all of his little weird babies

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500
and

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.500
it's fine

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500
and Duly noted.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500
But he talked about something

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.500
and it made you cry. You came out on stage and said

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
it's fine.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500
It's not fine.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500
It's not fine for someone crying.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.500
I mean her coming out crying is fine.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.500
Did someone say she's going to pay for it?

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500
No.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.500
No.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500
They're just ordering wings.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.500
They're here with their mom

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.500
and they're ordering wings.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.500
Dan and I were just in London

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500
and I fainted two times on the Jack the Ripper tour

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.500
so when I hear something like she's going to pay for it

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.500
I'm like holy fuck.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500
Stay out on the streets.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500
Yeah.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500
So Dan can say whatever he wants.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.500
Here are some things we've been on the road

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500
totally great

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500
and wonderful

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.500
and it's been a lot of fun

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.500
but there are some unseen stresses.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.500
She fell down you guys.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.500
She fell down the stairs.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500
I thought that joke was obvious

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500
because you're on my side now

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.500
and you're going everybody, Dan's great.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.500
Great time

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.500
but clearly I'm an abusive boyfriend.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500
I'm a terrible person.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500
I'm a bad person.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.500
You're not an abusive boyfriend.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500
Thank you.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.500
You psychologically fell.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500
I don't want to continue this.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.500
On to the doorknob

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.500
of Dan Harmon.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.500
I don't want to blame things on my

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.500
hormones endlessly

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
because I don't want to fuck things up

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500
for my sisters.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
But if I did, if I go a little something

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500
I like this.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500
Like the period wrap.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500
Oh shit.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
Period wrap.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
Keep it going.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
I got to find it.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.500
Keep it going.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500
Where the fuck is it?

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.500
Period wrap.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.500
Period.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.500
I'm hitting it.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.500
Ladies, I'm sorry

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500
but I've been emotional.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500
Had my period and it wasn't casual.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.500
I felt really bad and my stomach felt deep

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.500
like I had someone stomping

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500
on my stomach. You know what I mean.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500
It feels terrible.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500
Sorry, this feels terrible.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500
A podcast that you can get on iTunes.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500
Find the host of that. Please listen to that.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.500
Anyway, maybe I'm sorry.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500
Sorry about being emotional.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500
Hormones go up and down.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
They're not casual.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500
Repeated rhyme, repeated rhyme.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.500
Now that you're sorry

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.500
it forces me to beat on me

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500
whereas you have ever beat on me

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500
because I have to be self-loathing

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.500
so you figured out how to get the upper hand

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.500
with me all the time.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500
Which is by taking the low road.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.500
So congratulations

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500
and welcome to owning me forever.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500
I love you. Please don't dump me.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500
Breakdown.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.500
Period wrap.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500
Period. Period.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500
Period.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500
I'm 6 months.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.500
Period.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.500
3 to 5 days.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500
3 to 5 days.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.500
3 to 5 days.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500
Make some space.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.500
Is it over?

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500
Period.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.500
And Franks.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500
And Franks.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500
I wanted to...

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500
It was such a mainstream wrap,

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500
I wanted to add a tinge of indie

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500
just threw in a random thing.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.940
Make it more of a Lena Dunnamie kind of fact and Frank died before she could have a period. Yeah

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.180
Maybe I don't know what being in love is but you're

01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:00.900
Your guys version of being in love is fucking complex. I think it looks a lot

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:06.580
I think it's when two people love each other and themselves so much

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.340
They don't care about the entertainment of the whole world

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.220
I

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:18.660
I would like to conclude this bit and then to enter into Dungeons and Dragons

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.940
I would like to read the final email that I got very short

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:25.700
This is gonna be the one that says fuck Dan and you're gonna lose everybody

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:30.140
This is this is from a nice gentleman named Rob. Hi, Erin

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:34.500
I just wanted to let you know that the podcast apartment town from Pittsburgh brought me to tears

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:39.780
Not because you and Dan fought but because I recently got divorced and part of the reason we didn't stick together

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.500
Is that we never talked about how we really felt with each other like you and Dan are able to do

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.460
I know you feel insecure about your relationship with him

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:51.300
But I think you have a huge advantage and that you were able to express yourselves and let each other know how you feel

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:55.660
If you can do that, I'm sure that love will carry you carry you the rest of the way, Rob

01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.100
Unsolicited email advice

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:06.020
But the kind you like it's the kind you like because it enables

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:10.860
Solicit it enables you complain about everything else with this be

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.940
Just tell me I'm pretty and I look thin today. I'll be fine

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.740
Spencer we're being attacked by menstruation

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:24.060
Looking at the calendar with a start you realize it's her time

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.780
Tiptoeing past the door you think you can make it down the stairs

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:34.300
But then you hear the shattering sound of porcelain on drywall

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.300
Oh, that's it

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:44.220
I know that the next round of emails is gonna be subject headings like just let Spencer talk and

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.580
Stop get Dan and Aaron off the stage

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.300
Yawn about the relationships

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:54.700
Send your emails to emegathy at gmail.com. Is that right?

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.700
Yeah

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:03.980
All right Spencer if you will at long fucking last take us up to date for the D&D campaign

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:13.500
After meeting up with a group of fish dwelling humans and stopping by their small village

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:21.180
This the group headed to the store to pick up some potions and some paralyzing injectors as well as a length of rope

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:28.700
They set off down in esophageal tube to fish south where the fabled Kenny either died or never existed in the lake of acid

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:33.980
Crossing the lake on tensors floating disc and entering a dangerously speedy sphincter

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:39.620
The group found themselves on a narrow ledge with a small campsite there. They met I can't remember his name

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.620
I'm gonna call him Thomas

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:46.180
The prince of some fiefdom or other I can't remember the list that valiscent

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:51.660
Valisthen, yeah, okay. Wait. Are you making this up? No, it's just I didn't write down names

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:57.580
I never do name his name is hardly the stage Spencer. I wrote it down to be improvised Spencer. I

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.580
Dan mocked me in Bloomington, but I wrote down as if it's valiscent was his name

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:09.820
See, yeah, see even that's mess up on my on my note behalf so valisthen the prince of the fiefdom

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.020
You gave yourself a jazz

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:21.260
It's hard as I've had many of my fingers are huge. How do you have time to take all those notes between creating all those anonymous email accounts I?

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.820
Would never reveal my secrets, mr. Harmon

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.180
Hey, Dan, uh, doll it back. Would you I?

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:36.980
Would love to

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:43.660
After being lured by talk of swords valisthen returned with the heroes to the small inner fish village

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.460
They were off to free themselves from the confines of the infinite fish

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:53.340
So you guys are in that village again remember you kind of went in a big circle after finding a valisthen

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:56.700
Okay, here's the deal. I just want to say something as a player at the table. All right

01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.860
We are at the point the tour we're past the meeting of the goddess that much is probably clear

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.940
It's time to atone with the father that means accepting your own death

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:10.460
There's no better way to accept your own death than to give way to to to the you know

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:15.740
Like the father chrono slim the baby new year and the you know that like the snake sheds its skin

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:21.060
I want the part of Sharpie Buttsalot to be played for this segment in Chicago by Ben

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.060
My 16 year old self

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.140
15 and a half year old Ben, please come to the stage your sharpie Buttsalot

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:35.860
But I've been I've been stuck in this fish for three episodes. You're 16 15

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.940
Maybe you can figure it out. You've you've just started mutilating yourself and here you go. Here's the microphone

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.740
So are we you know fish? Yeah, have you ever played before? No, okay?

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:49.900
so basically you pretend what I'm saying is true and

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:56.900
And you act accordingly just like church. Yeah, just like church

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:10.140
This is great. Dan. He's he's Dan. He's funnier than you

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.160
Yeah, but my trick is since I framed it with like he's me

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160
I

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.420
Become freedman Dan. I don't want to get super gross

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:29.220
If I did ever go a little something Ben looks identical to my first boyfriend Eric Eldard who showed me his penis in the shower

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.800
identical identical

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.080
Let a woman show you how to do things

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:50.360
I'm just kidding. How do we get these stripes off the sweater? I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. Please stop me

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.680
Wow, well, like I don't go to jail. Yeah, so

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.480
You know, I mean, I'm not I'm it's your fault

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.840
Are we playing the Indian we are

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.720
That won't stop me teaching your things now, okay

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.160
Something terrible is about to happen

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.040
All right, so Spencer we got the Prince Val valescent was his name valescent

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.600
Yes, and so he has the sword knowledge. He is the far sword capabilities the the power of the far sword

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:32.880
I say we you it's probably the right idea to go destroy this animal from the inside and let's march towards the heart of this beast

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:39.000
Absolutely positively. All right. Thank you, Ben. I mean I mean Sharpie Sharpie. Thank you, sir

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.640
Thank you Sharpie. Yes valescent grumbles

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.480
I don't know about killing this thing, but you do have to do some damage if you're gonna want to escape

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.200
Let's head fish West

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.760
Fish West I had fish West you guys had fish West

01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.360
At the far wall of a vision visual the village you're met with what appears to be a largest meat curtain

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:10.200
This is your education wait, these things will happen. Don't worry about it. Okay. Yeah, it's a curtain of me

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:17.200
It's a curtain of me. All right. Don't think there was a sentience about it. It is part of a sentient being. Okay, because we're in fish

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.160
Yeah

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:24.800
They're not I'm almost certain. We're breaking some sort of law. Yeah. No, I understood. I understood that

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.720
I'm not bashful, but I think this is this is illegal

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.840
Wait, haven't we already but for the lack of a better word penetrated this meat curtain before

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.720
This is actually a different meat curtain. That's a new meat curtain. Okay. It's a new one meat curtains

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:47.120
All right. I have I approached the meat curtain boldly because I've I'm no stranger to the meat curtain and

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960
and I

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.560
Boldly press myself through it

01:18:53.560 --> 01:19:00.240
We all press ourselves boldly through the meat curtain. Oh, right. Yeah, let's do it together as a team

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.840
You stride through the folds of the meat curtains

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:10.640
Behind the curtain is a passage. It's relatively narrow, but still quite the wide considering it's inside of a living creature

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:17.800
From far off you can hear the thumping of hearts and the sloshing of blood being pumped through great veins and arteries

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.480
It's just like mine. Mm-hmm. I'd know apparently

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.440
The floor is slick and squishy and you find it quite difficult to stand up straight let alone move

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.440
You can see circular holes in the ground full of bubbling green acid

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.200
Through the passage is a larger curtain of meat

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.800
We have to cross a floor that's slick and it's got holes in it and acid is bubbling through it

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.800
Yeah, so it's full of acid holes

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.320
So Spencer, we need to go across

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.000
This this acid hole area, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.160
Can I can I take my rope and tie it to an arrow and shoot it across the yeah, like in the ceiling and then swimming across like Star Wars?

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.160
Oh, okay, so do you want to attempt that?

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880
Yes, yeah

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.400
Nope

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.400
Spencer Spencer. Yeah. No, I was about to

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:17.000
Spencer sorry game of Dungeons and Dragons you can take a 10 or a 20 a 10 is when you have a short amount of time devoted to a task

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.280
Like if you're tying your shoes and you had 20 minutes you could take a 10

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.440
You know that'll give you a decent success rate if it's not very difficult

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:30.040
You'll automatically pass if you have plenty of time like an hour or two you can take a 20

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.640
That means you automatically, you know as if you rolled a 20

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:40.360
But you require a long period of time and it can't be a task that you can fail at for instance falling and slipping in a pile of acid I

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360
Applaud your efforts, sir

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.840
So is this a time to take a 20?

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.360
So if I take a 20, what's the what's the consequence in this case?

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.480
I'm gonna rule you can't take a 20 because the the the stakes are life and death

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.760
You don't have time to mess up and fix it wait. I got you. Yeah, go for it hypothetically

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:08.960
I have like a ray of frost thing because I listen to the podcast so can I

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.400
Try to cast a spell and build a bridge across the lava or whatever

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.120
All right, you can attempt it ray of frost is a rather weak spell. You're the best you can manage and make your bridge

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:26.960
I'm not literate. So that's fine. I mean, I'm there. There's tiny writing. Where are my skills your skills or your spells?

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:30.480
Yeah, go help them stand stand mentor. I'm gonna do something Dan

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320
Be a father to your child

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.960
I'm so sorry

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.820
It's like adaptation. It's I think I think

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.580
Dan are you actually afraid of Ben a little bit?

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:53.440
There's all right, you're your spells your special abilities the spells are on a different page

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.600
Yeah, okay, that back page is all your spells, man

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360
I'm helping

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960
Here's a problem with the bet you can't yes

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:21.120
Okay, so all right, so can I I'm actually I've never I've never looked at sharpies. Yeah, you don't have

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:28.200
Spells, no, I don't have spells. Is there a way for me to make a bridge? There is no way for you to make a bridge

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.980
Spencer I have the I may I'm a plus nine for jump. Yep

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:41.320
Can I jump can I jump I try to jump across this expanse? Okay, the things 30 30 feet long

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.000
Like you can jump over individual puddles definitely, but I'm not sure

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.140
Okay, I'll say you can jump about a 30% of the way

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:56.060
Well, I jump I jumped to the first part of the to the first lily pad of whatever that is

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.420
You jump successfully

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:14.500
Okay, I have one more question never had a lesson my future self from the future

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:20.780
Appeared to me and suggested I use tensors floating disc. Yeah possible for me to like put that ahead of

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:26.660
Quark quark so that when he next jumps he can land on it and then like somehow move it again

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:31.460
So that we sort of hopscotch McRoss. Yeah, I were to advise that strategy

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:37.180
I'd put it right over one of those holes of acid so like he could just like step lightly upon it, okay, so I

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:44.100
Cast tensors floating disc waving your hands in a magical manner a shimmering disc appears

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:47.580
Okay, Ben today you are a man

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.660
Thank you

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.180
This is your harm mince for

01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.660
Trademark

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:07.420
The court the quark, that's your name. Yes, yeah court you see a tensors floating disc

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.140
I

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.900
Is I jump upon it you jump upon it?

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:17.520
You are upon a tensors floating disc above a pile of acid. I can I jump to the next to the next place?

01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:23.100
You're struck by a tentacle that whips out of a wall with a flash

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:29.980
Oh, it grabs you by the ankle. I take an arrow. You take an arrow. I shoot the arrow at the tentacle

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.180
He won't appreciate it, but I'll do it

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.460
Critical hit

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.100
Yeah, because you shot one arrow

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:50.380
Your arrow slices through the air cleaving the tentacle in twain

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:57.860
Sharp or quark is released falling on to the tensors floating disc. Okay. I cast the thing against we lands on it

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:03.900
Oh, it's already there. It's still there. It just falls. So what's in front of me? Can I jump to the end of the expanse?

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.820
You can jump most of the way

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.980
Sounds like a bad idea wait

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.780
Is there a way for me to simultaneously move the thing forward as he jumps so they're both in there at the same time

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:21.940
So he lands on it as he lands and then can then jump and finish you can move it with him on it without

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:29.220
Sharpie you you move it. I don't have to jump so much. Okay. All right

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.580
How about this you move it? I'll jump

01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.780
I said, I'll wait until half of the movement and I'll jump the rest of the way time it so that

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.980
Just Kenny. Can I move just moving forward? I have arrows

01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.780
Yes

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.780
What?

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:49.260
Yeah, yeah, he could just move you could just move me all the way across

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:53.420
Hey, Ben, your dad's cool, right?

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:02.660
All right, yay, okay cool quark is across the passage. I'm across the passage

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.860
You see a large curtain of meat. Thank you, sir

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:12.340
But what about you guys what just happened? Oh, fuck them. Can we wait? Can I?

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:18.780
Can we just like various back and forth with the floating disc? Yeah, I I said I

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.500
Harness all of my training at frisbee golf and I send the floating disc. Yay

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.980
Back towards Sharpie and Mulraine

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:32.220
You take five hot shot

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:38.180
That happens, okay, so they have a disc now. Yeah, all right

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:45.740
Yep, so but they have to get on it. I think Mulraine is still reduced by the way like you're short right now

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:52.060
Okay, is that we both fit? That's cool. Yeah, it's fine. I'm a little pocket. Can you put me in your pocket? Not that small

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:55.420
Calm down. Oh, you're quark-sized but in any case

01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:59.380
We're both small people because I'm young Dan Harmon now the young Sharpie Buttsalot now

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:06.020
So, I don't know what game you're playing but the time continuity marches on you you're Sharpie Buttsalot

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.940
I jump on I jump on Sharpie's back. Okay, and okay. We go across. Yeah

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.540
That happens. Yay

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:17.780
Are they across are we all together? All right, so what are we looking at now a meat curtain a meat curtain?

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:20.820
another meat curtain yep, I

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.820
I

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.820
lubed myself up and I I

01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:28.740
I I gently insert myself inside the meat curtain

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500
easing yourself in

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:39.740
What what word a cleave cleave, okay, I I cleave the meat curtain

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:46.060
Easing yourself through the meat curtain you find yourself in a circular green room

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:52.320
Three bluish holes mark either or mark the wall ahead of you left right and center

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.840
Are

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.680
We all together

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.400
No, it's just you right now

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:03.440
Standing in the middle of the room is a strange tendril of flesh sprouting out of the ground on the end of which is a large eye

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:07.440
With a multicolored iris the eye sways back and forth ponderously

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.800
Where that's not an anatomy

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:17.080
So that I saw I'm in a room right now inside the meat curtain chamber three bluish holes

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:24.600
Yep, left right and center. Yeah, there's a giant tendril with a multicolored iris. I swaying ponderously in front of yeah

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.600
Yeah, I'm ponderously. I

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.680
Did it look like a foe it might very well be

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.320
Well, I think it's I should I invite the rest of the gang and I yell through the meat curtain

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.320
No, come on in the water is great

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:46.360
No, you slickly slide through the meat curtain sleep slickly you slide

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.720
You too see the thing same thing that I mentioned earlier

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:59.960
Can we can we try to communicate with it? Yeah, you have parts of charisma. Yeah, I'm like weirdly good at like this is like I

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:07.800
You understand I used if I use diplomacy on the on the the eyeball. Yeah, you don't speak the same language fuck. I

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.800
Should say it does not speak any language

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.280
Staring when I use wild empathy. Yeah, I do that

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.680
You can't get a read on it. Normally you tend to use body language to determine how an animal is feeling

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.200
But this is a giant eyeball on a staff or a stock Sharpie use one of your skills

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.200
Um

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:37.800
Wait, I can't make it sleep because do we need it extrapolate information from it or something?

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.040
It shoots a blue re being striking mole rain directly in the chest

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.760
You only take one damage calm down

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.560
All right, sorry, let me redo that sound effect

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:57.960
Ah, uh, I sleep sleep. Yeah sleep eyeball. He's entitled to a will-save

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.680
He passes. Oh

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.720
He shrugs off the sleep

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.480
All right, I'm gonna have to do this and I I try not to

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.840
Try not to fly off in a rage, but I go into a berserker rage and I

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:20.800
Go into berserker rage you hear the voice of Vellice it in your ears. Yes use the rage harness the rage

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.800
flaming sword

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.720
You strike directly on the eyelid

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:35.640
With a reflex it manages to shut its eyes. So you haven't damaged its eye. However, you do deal

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.040
11 damage 11 damage

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.680
Hey Sharpie really quick while we're alone. Are we cool?

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:55.840
Okay, okay, okay, I'll buy you a bouquet of giant fish monster flowers. Okay, sounds like you really understand women. I do

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.280
Look at the sweater look at this sweater

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:10.000
Is is he still hitting the eye with the sword he's he's completed his strike. It's your turn Sharpie Sharpie, okay

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:17.560
Scorching all right. Thank you. My Obi-Wan conscious appears to me once again in a ghostly haze to my they're out of my vision

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.800
It's not the voices again. It's the ghostly conscious. I

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.600
What burning burning gray?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.680
scorching ray

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.720
Casting your arms in a magical manner several bursts of fire streak forts

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:39.200
Oh, they strike it directly in the stock. It's engulfed in flames for a brief moment

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.200
Before taking five damage

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.660
Five damage, so it's got 16 hits right now. Yep. All right Mulrainee. Yeah, nope

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:52.800
The eye sways ponderously and its iris changes to green

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.440
Quark

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:02.440
Even though you're in the throes of a barbarian rage, you can't help but stare longingly at the eye

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:06.720
You find yourself compelled to attack your friends. No

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.520
I already rolled the will save you got a four

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.320
Is he attacking us now?

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.800
Is there anything I can do in my defense you can attack the you know your friends I

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.320
Don't attack my friends. All right. Well, you kind of have to I

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.040
I

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.920
Wait, I have to attack my friend being compelled by the magical eye to attack your friends

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.400
It seems like a good plan. I cast sleep. Can I make him sleep?

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.440
You cast a spell it would be him Mulrainee and then you again

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:45.400
What so it's quark's turn then Mulrainee then you can cast spell wait, but I don't want to attack my friends, right?

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:51.440
Well, that's the great thing about being charmed and compelled by other worldly forces. You could do things you don't want to I

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.160
throw a

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.840
Portable hole in front of me and fall into it. So I can I miss my attack

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.480
No, oh dice you fall into a portable hole

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.000
Two people just intercepted my air high five

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.440
We're cool Jeff. All right, cool. Mulrainee

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.440
Go

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.440
gosh, well, I

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.000
I shoot an arrow

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.080
I

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:43.800
That I still like looking around right yeah, can I use wild empathy? No, I already did that. Can I I'll shoot gosh

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.160
I'm sorry guys. I I I shoot two arrows at the eye

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:54.680
One at the island and one at the eyeball and as I'm shooting I slow-motion say

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.520
Both of your arrows hit their mark

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.440
Dealing 13 damage to the eye

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.020
I

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:14.200
Summon monster. Okay, which monster would you like to summon?

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.320
Someone my thank you someone monster, too

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:23.880
I think last time you had a fiendish squid and a celestial be

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.600
so

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:32.040
Either one what fiendish. All right, if you give me a second look up other things you can summon

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.320
Wait, does the squid is it doesn't like then die in front of me. Yeah, well

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.280
that's

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:46.060
That's me. That's they love it common morality's influx

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.880
Oh, is there a bad

01:34:52.880 --> 01:35:00.200
I'm waiting is there not or like a cuddly furry animal. I'm gonna say yes gonna say okay, so I

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.760
Well, no, it makes sense because

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:08.000
You know that the animals never die. They never you never you never kill the dog

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.920
So that's in most media works, but you know, it's David

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:16.960
Yeah, okay. Do I have that do you have what a mannequin leg? Nope

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.320
Then what okay? All right. Well, then I summon Badger. Okay. You summon a dire Badger

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.360
Standing before you the divide the Divire Badger waits for its orders

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.800
We could take care of him

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:44.400
The Badger adorably hits the eye with its finger tail. Oh, bye. It attempts to claw the eye, but fails

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.040
All that

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:54.320
Spencer, what is my power bracelet do it gives you plus two to strength? I see

01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.440
What is how to have disguise it lets you disguise yourself is another humanoid?

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.080
That's not gonna work

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.080
You feel compelled to attack your teammates

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:14.440
Again, what do I keep doing that because you're still compelled. Oh, I don't you

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.400
Seeing as how you're stuck in a pit that that works. Okay good

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
That would put it at the eye stocks turn

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:33.680
It's eyeball turns red and it stares directly at Sharpie

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.280
It shoots a red gaze at you, but you shrug it off

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:49.280
Who's turn is it sharpies sharpies. Yeah, sorry. Oh, okay, so I charm

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:58.000
The the small the the quark quark. Yep. Yep. All right quark can willingly fail his

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:02.480
Will save to be afflicted by your charm spells. So he's back on your side

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.960
Although still in a portable hole

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.800
All right, I shoot

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.040
To sleep arrows to sleep arrows at the eye

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.960
Both of this sleep arrows impact the creature

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:26.600
You feel its eyes grow heavy and it falls to the ground

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Little it's asleep

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.640
I have a question is she still reduced through all of this. Yep. Okay, cool. I was just being bothered by the power attack

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.960
You're in a hole. Huh? You're in a hole. I get out of the hole

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.960
Wait, how does he do?

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.240
Sharpie a little help get me out of the hole. I wait just to just reach down and pull me out of the hole

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.920
Yeah, I reached on and pull him out of the hole. Oh, I have a rope

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:02.280
You pull him out of the hole. All right. Yeah, I take my sword my great sword and go into a power attack

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760
All right, automatically confirm critical hit

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:14.040
Whoa, you deal 20 damage severing the eye

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.080
Excellent

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.080
There could be only one I

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.160
Smell Sharpie's hair and smile

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:30.760
It smells kind of like fish guts so to so do we kill the eye stock you killed the eye stock

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.760
All right

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.440
Do you want to pick like there's three paths if you want to like pick or a

Pringles some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out why I

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.960
Don't really have a Pringles dick. I just keep my dick inside

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:09.040
Bow bow bow I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.400
Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.520
We're becoming Van Halen minus the play the heads my

All right, what lessons have we learned it? What are you crying? Where are you crying out?

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.880
Ragnarack was it was a mama rap. Oh mama rap. I

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:55.480
Mean, I don't know if you guys are all caught up on the podcast history. I'm getting worse and worse at

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.480
Wrapping

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.760
Partly because you know like my uno cards of rhyming like mouth and south. We know that

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.400
balls Niagara Falls

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.680
Maybe that means you guys can help me out. Maybe that's

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:17.200
There's a really good chance if I say mouth I'm probably gonna say then don't say mouse vice versa

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:24.080
Don't say but if I if I think twice about anything then it's all fucked like that. Is anybody here an actual rapper

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.080
Is it any freestyle? Where's Chicago?

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:32.520
That's an ancient shot of this guy's hand shot. He's got blonde Eminem Harry's a little bit of an early early Eminem luck

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.080
All right, let's

Well, I mean do you want to give it a shot though? Yeah, I do give me some free. Do you ever freestyle or are you just both?

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.120

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:26.520
Holy fuck, it is Shytown

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:27.320

Don't wanna let Brooklyn take you alive

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.240
Got my wallet in my pocket

01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.000
Got my dick in my hand

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.600
Kaleel made me feel good

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:37.640
Feel like a man

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:41.400
I got one more black friend to put in my entourage

01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:44.520
I wanna fuck your mama with a Thai massage

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.680

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.800
Fuck your mama five times the bitch still wanted more

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:53.560
Come on down to Harmontown

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:53.960

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:56.360
Turn that frown upside down

01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:56.920
Sorry

01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:59.240
Pia's yellow poop is brown

01:52:59.240 --> 01:52:59.880
Really sorry

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.280
Come on down to Harmontown

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:02.840

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.080
