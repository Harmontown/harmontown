Thank you.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nI'm very flattered by your attendance numbers, very flattered by your enthusiasm.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nLet's see what we can do to just punish it, right?\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:15.000\nCertainly, I don't have an act, but you guys are fans of the podcast, so you know that.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:20.000\nSo if we do nothing but get drunk and ramble for two hours,\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:23.000\nthat's a little slice of Los Angeles for our friends in San Francisco.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:27.000\nSo you guys are obviously, there's a lot of people from San Francisco here,\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:32.000\nbut there's always a tremendous amount of you that are from the outlands,\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:35.000\nwho have pilgrimageed here to see all kinds of stuff.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nHow many people in the latter group? How many non-San Franciscoites?\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:46.000\nI'm just curious about that. It feels like roughly 40%?\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nYeah, or more 50, I don't know.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nI think this is our third time doing a San Francisco sketch fest.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:57.000\nBut our first time here in this room, it seems like a lovely room.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:02.000\nI don't know. It's a little intimidating. It feels kind of like a cattle auction.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nSee, I'm not that intimidated because the only times I've ever been here is...\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:10.000\nNo. I'm telling you why is because I've only ever been out in the audience\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nwatching the highest Doug Benson you've ever seen in your life.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:17.000\nAnd he's hilarious, but the stakes are low because he's so mellow.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:21.000\nYou can just kind of be delightful out here.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nNo, I'm not going to ruin it by second guessing.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nIt's interesting the dynamic that shifts between different rooms.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nWe sit in the back of a comic book store in Los Angeles,\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:36.000\nkind of like it's different acoustics and different things, and Doug Benson,\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:39.000\nas high as he is, always has an act to fall back on,\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:41.000\nor a joint in his pocket or something.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:44.000\nAll I've got is my Evernote notepad.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:51.000\nI wanted to make an announcement that I've been having a very successful experiment\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nsince I stepped foot into San Francisco.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:57.000\nIt's a two-fold thing, and I don't know how to describe it.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.000\nIt seems kind of contradictory.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nOne thing is called owning it.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nI'm owning it.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nWhat?\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nIt. I'm owning it.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nIt's like I'm owning everything.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:14.000\nI'm not apologizing for anything anymore.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nFor instance, the fact that I'm fat.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nI'm owning it.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nYou can't tell I'm fat because I'm owning it.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt seems like I'm supposed to be fat.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nLike Santa Claus owns it.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:32.000\nSanta Claus is technically fat, but that one guy, that one dick,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\ndescribes him as fat in his first poem about Santa Claus.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nBut from then on, we're just like, he's awesome.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nHe owns it.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nYour sweater has a suspicion about it.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:49.000\nIt's got some secrets.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:53.000\nI chose a color that absorbs light rather than reflects it,\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:58.000\nhoping that somehow the enterprise of your eyeballs would slingshot\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:03.000\naround the sun of my stomach and go back in time to when I was 25.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:08.000\nDidn't you make a decision to go on a diet since you got engaged\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:12.000\nthat you would become slim and live and sexy for your wedding?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\nWell, you have to back into a number.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:22.000\nI'm going to be thin by my wedding, so you just keep pushing the date.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nEvery day becomes, you know, I had two quarter pounders yesterday\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nthat I didn't tell Erin about.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nIt's fucked up. It's fucked up.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nShe doesn't know I haven't talked to her about it.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nHow many did you have that you did tell her about?\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nI've had like 90 that I told her about and 160 that I haven't.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nI've discussed this before.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:50.000\nErin and I, my betrothed Erin McGathy, it's a dream relationship.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:55.000\nWe share, the interests that we share are going to kill us.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nThe interests that we share are, you know, we are passionate\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nabout our pursuit of a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nWe just think that people should be sedentary.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nWe love it. We love watching movies that we don't even enjoy.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nI got one of those special pillows.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nThat's the first thing I did when I started when Erin moved in.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:19.000\nI got one of those, they call them boyfriend pillows.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nThey're a technical name for them.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nThey're those pillows that are shaped like a little easy chair.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nI don't know what I'm expecting, like you're all going to nod.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\n200 people are going to nod their head.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nWait, wait, wait. These are for in bed so you can sit up.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nYeah, you know those pillows that they have, like, you know,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nwhen you sit up in bed.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nNo, we don't know, Dan. Explain it to us.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nOh, because you all are rock climbing. Fuck off.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nYou all know.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nWhen you sit up in bed, the headboard hurts, you know?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nIt's like, you put some pillows behind your back and those pillows\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nshift around and all that stuff.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nAnd these things are called boyfriend pillows and they have\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nthese little nubs that come around and it's just enough to\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nkind of anchor you.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nAnd it just cements you like a little barnacle against the\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nheadboard and are you quitting?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nAre you that outraged about my physical fitness?\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nIs the pillow supposed to be your boyfriend?\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nWhy is it a boyfriend pillow? Boyfriend for whom?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nI think it's, well, my theory is that the reason it's called\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\na boyfriend pillow, and by the way, there's other things,\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\nthe nomenclature is confusing because women have,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nI don't know if I should refer to them as a gender,\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nI don't know if a guy invented this or a woman,\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nand I know the gender didn't invent them,\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nso I shouldn't say women have, but for women,\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:42.000\nthey have those simulated boyfriend pillows.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nThey're like body pillows for snuggling.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:50.000\nAnd God knows men have all kinds of things that have\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nnothing to do with sleeping that are simulations,\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nbut the thing that's technically called a boyfriend pillow,\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nI believe the reason it's called a boyfriend pillow,\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nI would imagine is because this is not a romantic thing,\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:04.000\nthis is a relationship thing, this is a guy's over at your\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\nhouse, but he doesn't, you know, he might not fuck you,\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nyou might just watch like Ironside or something.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:16.000\nSo it's a boyfriend pillow, it's a nesting pillow.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nIt has a time machine that goes back when Ironside is\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\non the air.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nYou don't even know, he doesn't even know.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nThey redid Ironside.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nThey did?\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nYeah.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nDan, I don't have a boyfriend.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nWait, so it's got little arm rests, right?\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nYeah, Ironside does, otherwise he'd fall out of his chair.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nNo, no, no, I know.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nI know Ironside has arm rests.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nOh, now he's an Ironside expert.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:45.000\nWell, if you had been to Iron Con, you would know that\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nthey remade the series.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nIt's now canceled, but they...\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nThey rebooted Ironside?\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nFor about three weeks, they gave it a shot.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nThey thought the reason the first Ironside failed was maybe\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nbecause the guy was fat and white.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nSo they put a very sexy black man in a wheelchair,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nbut they kept flashing back to when he had use of his legs,\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nas if to apologize, like, he's not always crippled.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd they would do scenes like...\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nI only know about this because I was actually on the soup,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nso I saw one of these clips.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nThey would...\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:27.000\nHe would roll into a room and be investigating a crime scene,\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nand then he says, he goes,\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:33.000\nyeah, so and so was scared all right,\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nbut not because of the drugs, because of that gun.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nAnd he points at a gun that's under a pillow on a couch,\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nand all the other cops at the crime scene go,\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nhow did you see that?\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nAnd he goes like, I got a different view of the world from down here.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nI'm not fucking kidding.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nIt was one of the soup's clip of the years,\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nbecause it's so fucking insane.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:03.000\nThe idea that forensic science is somehow altitude biased.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nGuys, get in here.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nI'm the chief of police.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nI want everyone to enter every crime scene at a different level.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nI need two six-year-olds, a Chihuahua,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\na great Dane, and a giraffe.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nI want a really tall guy on another guy's shoulders,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nwearing the world's longest trench coat.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:25.000\nJust walk through, don't touch anything, but just look around.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:31.000\nGet a gun, tell me. Someone teach this giraffe how to recognize guns and speak.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nI don't want to...\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nAll right, get rid of these eucalyptus leaf pillows.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:42.000\nIt's going to defeat the whole purpose when the koala comes in.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nI don't know what I'm looking back at this for.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nThere's a structure to the show.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nHave you guys ever amazed yourself at how sedentary you've become?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nIs there a moment when you look at each other and go, oh Jesus Christ.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nEvery fucking minute.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nYeah, we are so happy.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd then it's just like...\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nSometimes there's just the weekends, they just go...\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.000\nWe just watch nine movies in a row.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nThat's what heaven should be.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nSo you never look at that...\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:14.000\nI don't want you to, I root for your happiness at all times,\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nbut you don't ever look at those moments with a sense of alarm.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:22.000\nThat maybe is terrible?\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:28.000\nI'd rather you just come out and say whatever you're trying to say\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nthan this deposition.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nJust charge me with whatever you're going to charge me with.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nI mean, I love a woman, I don't love hiking.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:42.000\nI love her, she loves me, we love...\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nI would rather watch 27 dresses than exercise.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nShe would rather watch...\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nWhat's 27 dresses?\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nBuckaroo Banzai than exercise.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nSo even though she hates Buckaroo Banzai and I hate 27 dresses,\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nwe both love not moving.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:02.000\nWe share each other's favorite movies with each other, it's heaven.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnd then every once in a while, the doorbell rings,\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nand bing-bong, our sausages are here.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nAnd is it like a Mexican standoff of who has to get out of bed?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nAbsolutely, yes.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:19.000\nThat'll be our undoing.

I go like, oh, I ate a bunch of lasagna yesterday.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nI was just fucking pigged out, I love lasagna.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nAnd you go like, yeah, overeating.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nI don't like overeating.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nI was like, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off!\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI've never said that.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nI know you never have.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nIt's a fucking ersatz example.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nIt's a reconstruction of, like, I'm running a Jeff simulator.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nI'm in the jeffitorium.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:42.000\nLike, I just go like, oh, I was in the bathroom,\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nand then the guy...\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nWe were trying to both get out the men's room door,\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nand we did one of those dances of awkwardness before we could go,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nand you're like, I always know how to get through a bathroom door.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nFuck off, fuck off!\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:58.000\nWhy do you always know?\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nShe's perfect.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nBecause I don't have a boyfriend pillow.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nLife is my boyfriend pillow, Dan.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nI have a challenge for you, Jeff, because you're a music fan.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nThis is a new segment.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nPeople like segments.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nThat's what I've learned recently.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nEven though it's fake, it kind of enhances your enjoyment.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:18.000\nPeople like segments.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:21.000\nSo this segment is called Music...\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nBefore you say a segment, do I need a music cue for this musical segment?\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nSo give me a genre, so let me know.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nThematically, what are you going for here?\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:35.000\nIt's about music, and investigation, and just America.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:41.000\nAnd Auschwitz.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:47.000\nOkay, music, investigation, America, Auschwitz.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nOh, you heard that.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nThat last one was a joke.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nA hilarious joke.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nWe all heard it.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nBut it's funny she's saying, I think I have all those covered.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nAll right.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nAre you ready?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nJohn Denver.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:09.000\nMusic corner, music corner, music.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nHey, there's another guy singing.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nOh, you didn't say instrumental.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nWell, I didn't know I...\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nOkay, let's do a...\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:23.000\nThis segment's called Picking a Song for this segment.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:28.000\nJustin, I got no audio down here.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.000\nSomething weird going on?\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nI heard...\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nThere we go.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.000\nFuck it.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nOh, okay.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:40.000\nIt's music theory segment.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:45.000\nWe're going to talk to Jeff about some music questions.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:50.000\nAnd nothing rhymes with Jeff, except for chef and treble clef.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:57.000\nWell, that's two asshole.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nI was going to say your chin was clef.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nBut I stopped the song, so go fuck yourself.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nAll right.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nSo musical segment.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nAll right, Jeff.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nThe Dolly Parton song, Jolene.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nYes.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nSan Francisco native Dolly Parton.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nI'm pretending that this is related to...\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nSan Francisco born Dolly Parton.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:31.000\nInventor of the typewriter and friend of Abby Hoffman.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:37.000\nHate Ashbury frozen yogurt pioneer and singer-songwriter Dolly Parton.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nRight.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nShe wrote this song, performed this song, Jolene.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nRight.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nOkay, so we're familiar with the song Jolene.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:53.000\nIt's Dolly Parton pleading with the object of her lover's desire.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nIn other words, the woman that's going to take her man.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nShe's pleading with her.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nPlease, Jolene, don't do this.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nPlease.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nMy betrothed and I were discussing this song earlier.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:10.000\nErin was saying when she was in a situation where she was very jealous of a young lady,\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:15.000\nshe felt like her relationship was in the crosshairs of a succubus.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:22.000\nThe Jolene came on at Vesuvio and she had this flashback to when she was playing Jolene\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:26.000\nso much that her friend asked her to stop.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:30.000\nYou can't listen to Jolene anymore.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:35.000\nIt made me curious because it's interesting.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:43.000\nWomen and men, they different.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:51.000\nWomen drive like this.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:56.000\nWomen and men both, we all have love songs.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:01.000\nWe all have painful songs.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:06.000\nThere's people of both genders on both sides of the listener-singer relationship.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:11.000\nWe're all very familiar with the idea of a song about how somebody broke my heart.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nSomebody's fucking with me.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:18.000\nWe're also familiar, but more especially on the male side, I think.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nI'll probably get corrected on this.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:26.000\nOn the male side, there's a heavy tradition of guys talking to guys,\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nbut it's usually about sniping.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nYou're going to lose that girl.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nI'm going to fuck your girl.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nYes, I'll make a point of fucking that girl instead of you.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nYes, yes, I will.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:42.000\nI wish that I had Jesse's girl.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.000\nHow come Jesse gets to fuck that girl instead of me?\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nIt's like, when guys are referring to other guys-\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:55.000\nBy the way, the goodness is we can air that and we won't get sued.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nTone deafness has its legal advantages.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nThere's a guy from ASCAP.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nDamn it!\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:07.000\nSo, five notes, four notes, six notes, shit.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nHe doesn't know what he's doing.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nCan't pin him down.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:17.000\nIt'd be like if Al Capone was so bad at bookkeeping that the IRS could never-\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nShit, he doesn't know how to add anymore.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nIt just says he bought a bunch of cookies.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nBoth sets of books.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nHis cooked books and his real books.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nCookies. He loves cookies.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nThey're actual cookbooks.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:36.000\nHis cooked books are cookbooks.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nThat's what I just said.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nI know that's what you said. I'm refining it.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nIt feels like a challenge.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nStop challenging me.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:48.000\nEvery time we come to San Francisco, the city of brotherly love.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:52.000\nAs it is known, birthplace of Dolly Parton.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nEpicenter of the typewriter.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nWasn't invented here.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nIt's just where the most typewriters live.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nYeah.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nAnyways, where the fuck was I?\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nJolene.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nBy the way, I'm riveted to find out where you're going with this.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nI think it's very interesting.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nI ran this over my head.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nI'm interested to find out if there's an answer to this.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nI'll cut to the chase.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nJolene is a very special song.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:22.000\nI started talking to Aaron about it.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nIt's a very interesting song.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:28.000\nMen are all caught up in their testosterone politics.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:32.000\nIf a man feels threatened sexually by another man,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nhe's not typically, in a songwriting sense,\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\ngoing to tend to express that by going,\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nKevin, hey, take it easy on me.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:45.000\nI know you got a bigger dick, but maybe explore other options\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nbecause I love my wife so much.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:51.000\nI'm just begging you, Kevin, come on.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.000\nDo me a solid this one time.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nIt's not an instinctive choice for a man.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nAaron immediately said, well, women,\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:06.000\nI don't want to mischaracterize her as making sweeping generalizations,\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nbut we were just generally talking about this.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:13.000\nWomen are socialized to communicate.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:20.000\nIf you're a woman and you have that sort of competitive relationship\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:27.000\nwith another woman, the woman who leaps into aggressiveness\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\ndoesn't do herself any favors.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nThere's a sort of trapped, claustrophobic, helpless feeling about it.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:36.000\nAnd the reason that song is a hit song and resonates with all of us,\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:40.000\nof all genders, including the third secret one,\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:48.000\nis because we all know what it's like to feel like\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:51.000\njust fucking at the mercy of another human being.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:56.000\nSo my question to you is, as a fan of music,\n\n20:56.000 --> 21:00.000\nis there a male equivalent to Jolene,\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:06.000\nspecifically a man, songwriter, singer, addressing another man?\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nYes. Bird dog by Everly Brothers.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.000\nThat's a third person. He's a bird dog.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nHe's warning other people he's going to fuck your dog.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nJohnny is a joker. He calls him out by name.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nJohnny is a joker. He's a bird.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nHe's talking to the listener.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:22.000\nIs there a song where a guy calls out another guy?\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:28.000\nOne guy saying to another guy, hey, Tim, you're an ace coxman.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:32.000\nLet's agree on that.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nLet's prove it out back.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:37.000\nYou got a big turgid piece of drill bit down there.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:42.000\nI just appreciate you going somewhere else out of mercy.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:45.000\nI'm out of options. Signed Kevin.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nThe closest...\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nI will open that up to the floor.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:54.000\nI can get a bird dog where a guy says, Johnny is trying to bird dog my lady.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nBut he says, hey bird dog in the chorus.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nHe goes, hey bird dog, get away from my quail.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nHey bird dog, you're on the wrong quail.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nHe's like, hey bird dog, leave my lovey-dove alone.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.000\nBut he's also still warning him off.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nI want to open this up to the crowd.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:13.000\nIf anybody thinks that they know of a song, tell her no.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nTell her no by the zombies.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:20.000\nYou should tell you that she loves you.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nTell her no, no, no.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nAnthony, tell her no, no, no.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nWait, so you say, tell her no.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nCome up on stage.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nWell, if you want, if you want.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nLet's bring him up on stage.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:38.000\nGot a microphone here, would you?\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.000\nHans, that's a musical name. I love it.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:45.000\nThere's a line in Tell Her No by the zombies where he says,\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nspecifically, if she should tell you that I love you,\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\njust remember she said that to me.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nThere's another line I think where he says,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\ndon't take her love from my arms, stuff like that.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nOh, tell her no.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nIt's one guy talking to another guy saying,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:02.000\nif my girlfriend throws herself at you, do me a favor.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nAsk girlfriend.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:06.000\nAnd be a Teflon penis.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nPretty much, yeah.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nMan to man, that's all I can ask.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:13.000\nBut he's not saying, don't steal her away from me,\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nor let release her.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nI'm saying, if she comes to you.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nHe's saying, stop fucking my ex-girlfriend.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:22.000\nHe is. Or is he saying, in the event that she tries to fuck you,\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\ntell her no.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nIs he saying, stop fucking her,\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nor tell her no in the event that she comes and tries to?\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nRight, right, right.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nI was asking the question.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nNo, that's good.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\nYou were asking me.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nI think what it is is that, you know,\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nlet's say it's Tony and Johnny,\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nand Johnny is fucking Tony's ex-girlfriend,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nand he's not into it.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nHe's bummed.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nSo he's saying, hey, fucking stop it.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\nOr maybe he's just saying, hey, I love her,\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nand you're just fucking around with her.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.000\nAnd so, like, you know, if she says I love you,\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nthen take a hike, because I'm the one who really loves her.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nI don't know.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nThat's good, though.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nThat's close.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nThank you, Hans.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nThat's good.\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nHans, everybody.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nAnybody else got that beat?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nAll right.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nAnybody else that has that beat for man on man thwarting?\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:09.000\nMan on man, acquiescence and pleading\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nfor non-sexual intervention.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nI take a lot of long drives doing comedy shows\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nwith great groups and Ryan Stiles.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nWe were talking about the kind of weird...\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:22.000\nI mean, this is not going to win any awards for naming it,\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nbut we call it kind of like rape rock,\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:29.000\nwhere it's like, young girl, get out of my life.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nA guy yelling at an underage woman,\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:34.000\njust stop putting the sauce on him.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:37.000\nDon't stand so close to me.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nYou're just a baby.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nYou're talking specifically about men saying to young women,\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nlike, get away from me?\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:44.000\nYeah.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nLike the police son.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nDon't stand so close to me yet.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nBut then there's the other more horrible thing,\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:53.000\nwhich is I don't understand, like,\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:57.000\nshe's 16, she's beautiful, and she's like, what?\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nYou're 48.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nYes, she's 16.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nShe's beautiful, and in four years the laws will change\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nbecause of this song.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nHey, little sister, don't you?\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.000\nThat one.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nLike, he's talking about the girl he's dating.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nHe's more into the little sister.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nLike, I used to pull your pigtails,\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nand Twister turned up and goes,\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nnow I'm looking at your titties.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:23.000\nLike, now it's fucking on.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nAnd you get the feeling from little sister\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nthat it's because he's been rebuffed by the older sister,\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nand now he's just gone younger,\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nwhich is a fucking Elvis.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:34.000\nAlso, Elvis isn't a film, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\ncalled Kissin' Cousins.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nAnd there's a song about, like,\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nI forget how the lyrics go,\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nbut they're pretty fucking good,\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nin the sense that they're horrifying.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nAnd he says, like, she does this and she does that.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nWe hug and sneak.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:52.000\nWe don't hug and sneeze all night.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nBut we're Kissin' Cousins,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nand that's what makes it all right.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nLike, they're Kissin' Cousins.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:03.000\nI think it means legally allowed to fuck cousins?\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nOh, okay, the term, he's saying we're Kissin' Cousins,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nmeaning we're not first cousins.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:12.000\nWe're not blood-related cousins, and that's what makes it okay.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nSecond cousins, yeah.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nSee, I have a small family.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nI don't even know if I have a cousin.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nI probably do. I don't know them.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nI bet you'd make out with her if you did.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:27.000\nYou're not better than these southern people.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:32.000\nWe judge them, but they just have more cousins.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:37.000\nI think that we in the blue state metropolitan areas,\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nwe go like, oh, they all fuck each other.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nThey all fuck their cousins.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nWe just don't have many cousins.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:47.000\nIf once you get up to six, eight, nine cousins,\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:51.000\none of them's going to really sweep you off your feet.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nThat's what can happen down there where there's more room,\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:57.000\nand there's swing sets and stuff, and there's just fields.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nThey don't have...\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nThis potato sack race?\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nWho knows what goes on in those potato sacks?\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nYeah, where we have a YMCA or a Walmart,\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:09.000\nthey have just weathering heights of wheat.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nOkay.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:14.000\nWeathering heights.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nMixed a couple geological and cultural things there.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:22.000\nI kind of got sidetracked, and I want tonight to run cleanly,\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nand I don't want to get off on any tangents.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nNo tangents.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nBecause we're in San Francisco,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nand I don't want to create the false impression...\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nCan we talk real quick?\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nCan I go off on one?\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nIt's not really a tangent.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nIt's just a brief interjection.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:38.000\nWalking up Columbus, here in North Beach,\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\none of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco,\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\na town which I deeply love and adore.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nI love coming here.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.000\nWe were supposed to...\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nThe sketch fest people were going to bring us in tonight,\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nfly us back tomorrow morning,\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nand all of us agreed, separately,\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nthat we would stay an extra day\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\njust to be here in this lovely city.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nBecause it is the best.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:57.000\nBecause you can come to North Beach,\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nand I went to a bar,\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nand there was Frenette Bronca on tap,\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nlike next to the beers.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nAnd it was...\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nIt's serotonin just poured out of the back of my brain\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:06.000\ninto my butts.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:07.000\nIt was the best.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:08.000\nBecause that's how it works, right?\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nPour it out of your butt?\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nYes.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nWe'll get back to that.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nI'm walking up the road,\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nand I'm going...\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nYou guys were at Vesuvio having a drink,\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:16.000\nand I was...\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nI got to have a cab,\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nand I wanted to get a pizza to a certain place,\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nand I hopped out of the cab,\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nand I crossed the street,\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:25.000\nlike, near, like, Stockton, Green, Columbus, the run there.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nAnd there was a big black guy,\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nyoungish, you know, I would say not...\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:33.000\nMaybe just 30, maybe less, big guy.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nFootball jersey, I think, for some reason,\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nit was like Vikings or Green Bay,\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nbut something Midwest-y.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nIt wasn't like the Niners or anything local.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nAnd he had a football,\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nand he was standing, like,\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nwaiting at the crosswalk,\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nand he was, like, tapping the football...\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nJesus, he was, like, really out of his way.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nYeah, well, yeah.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nBut he was just standing there,\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nlike, you know, it's like this...\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:54.000\nLike, it didn't bother me at all,\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\ndidn't really pay much attention.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nLeft went and had pizza come back.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.000\nHe's still there at the same crosswalk,\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nand now I'm stuck at that crosswalk,\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nwaiting on a green light,\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nand he's still there,\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nand we're now waiting to cross the street,\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nbut I know this guy enough to know\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nhe's not crossing that street,\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nbecause he was there an hour ago,\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\ntapping that football,\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nkind of shifting from left to right,\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nand he looks over,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nand I'm wearing a suit,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nand I got a tie on,\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:17.000\nand I'm carrying a book\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nand a little zippy case from my iPad\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nthat I DJed the show with,\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nso he just looks over at me,\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:25.000\nand we're about...\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nLike, our heads are about a foot and a half apart,\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nwaiting next to each other,\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nand he goes,\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nfuck it, faggot.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nTapping the football,\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nnow more aggressively.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nFuck, look at this faggot.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.000\nLook at this faggot.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nFaggot.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nFaggot.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nAnd then the light turned green,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nand I just kept trucking.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:45.000\nAnd then he...\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.000\nI told it to Erin backstage,\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nshe's like,\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:50.000\nwrong city.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nI did not see that coming.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nNo.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:53.000\nWas he talking to you about it?\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nNo, I think he probably has Tourette's,\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:56.000\nbut it was for me,\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nit was certainly for my...\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nHe wasn't bonding with you,\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nlike, looking at, like...\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nHe looked at me,\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nand he didn't like what he was seeing,\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nbecause I had a suit on.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nI mean, look,\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nhe might have called everybody\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nthat moved to faggot.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nWell, I mean...\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nI'm the only person I heard him say that to.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nI love that he's so gay\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nthat he has to carry a football around\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nin order to get away\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.000\nwith calling people faggot.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:23.000\nBecause he's afraid that the absence of a football\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nwill be the equivalent of the presence of a dildo.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:29.000\nThat's how gay that guy is.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nI often hear rampant homophobia\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nas latent homosexuality,\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nbecause I think, like,\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nif you protest...\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nI'm a firm believer in it.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nYeah, and if this guy's cruising,\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nhe's doing it the most high-concept way\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nof all time.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nWell, I don't think...\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nI don't think they're all cruising.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nI think they're...\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nI mean, but no,\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nI am an absolute firm believer\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nthat if you are...\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:54.000\nwhen you are that energetically opposed\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:57.000\nto a victimous crime,\n\n30:57.000 -->

I don't know why.\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nWhat about your communication?\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nWhat was the slide that she made up about communication?\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nJeremy, grab the mic and just kind of eat it\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000\nso that you're free to...\n\n01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nYou can communicate however you want.\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nI cover my eyes with my hand.\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nWe very much loved each other,\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nbut we did not communicate.\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nAnd she was someone who did not talk,\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nand I was someone who would not listen.\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nAnd so there was a communication that just did not happen,\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000\neven though we were both good people\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nwho loved each other very much.\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nJeremy, you're a very handsome man.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nDo you know that you turn into Ray Charles\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nwhen you're talking about your feelings?\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nCome on! Hey, help town!\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nShe's good to me!\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nDid you know that you turn into Hank Williams II?\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nWhen someone says you're like Ray Charles?\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nYou have awakened all kinds of things in you.\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nAre you ready for some football?\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nAre you ready?\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nI'm actually not ready for football.\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nSo Jeremy, how are you feeling about it now?\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nWhere are you at?\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nYou know, it's been a couple weeks,\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nand you know, my friends have really been there for me,\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nand I'm feeling okay, you know?\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nMy friends have been really good to me, and so I feel okay.\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nWhy are people calling out lying?\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nOkay, there's a part of me that does not feel okay,\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nbut the rest of me feels great.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nWait, whoa, whoa, whoa!\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nShe's right there. Come on up.\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nCome on up. It's her. She's in the audience.\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nNo, no, no. We're going to bring them together right now.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nA woman just yelled out, he comes to my work all the time.\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nGet up here, get up here.\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nAnnie Hall, everybody.\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nI'm ready for some football.\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nAnd if we don't have a mic, we're finding enough mics\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nuntil we can all get on stage.\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nNow, you can share with me. What's your name?\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nI'm Eva.\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nEva.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nEva, you have a rebuttal?\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nI work at Boogaloo's, and this guy comes in all the time.\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000\nI've never seen him with a girlfriend once.\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nI worked there for two years.\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nOh, boy.\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nShe ordered the same thing every time.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nDoes Boogaloo sell protein?\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nGuy doesn't have to be with a girl to have a girlfriend.\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nI'm just saying this guy, he's awesome,\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nbut I don't believe he was in a long-term,\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000\ntwo-and-a-half relationship.\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nJesus Christ!\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nWhat in the world?\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nThis isn't helping the healing process.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nYou're calling...\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nThere's a chamber of commerce of like...\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nJeremy, why do you think she would say\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nthat she doesn't believe that you were in a two-year relationship?\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nWas this maybe a little unsighted?\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nShe would not believe what? I'm sorry.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nSay that again?\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nEva here doesn't believe you that you had a long-term girlfriend.\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nHi, Jeremy.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nSo first off, let the record state,\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nand you can back me up on this, I tip well.\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nI'm a good tipper. I'm not a deadbeat. I'm not an asshole.\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nNo, you are a great guy.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nI'm a good tipper.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nI was just wondering,\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nbecause I know that I've been in a relationship\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nfor well over two years.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nLiar!\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nI am with...\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nI am with the man today.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nNo, I was just...\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nWait, okay, now, Eva...\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nLet's get these two together.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nStay for a moment.\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nJeremy, she's accusing,\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nand so are more than one other people out in the audience.\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nThere was another female voice.\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nThere's at least one other...\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nIt almost feels like there's a consortium of local business owners\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nthat the team of commerce hates me.\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nDefinitely a counterproductive...\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nOkay, here's the thing.\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nShe said quite succinctly\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nthat she does not believe that you had a long-term relationship,\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nand you did not leap to your defense that quickly.\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nYou said you were a good tipper,\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nwhich seems like an odd rebuttal to that accusation.\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nI am a good tipper.\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nMoney talks, big hates!\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nThere's real pain out there,\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nand a fake relationship is not one of them.\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nThis is the best.\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nSo, world's best Harmontown!\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nIt ain't bad.\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nIt ain't wow.\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nJust to be...\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nJoel, this show might go three hours.\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nThe thing is that I actually live like half a block from Boogaloo's,\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nso once a week I have my work from home day,\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nand I usually go there.\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nAs we all do.\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nSo it's possible that half the time I have been there\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nwas without my girlfriend.\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nSo if she was an ex-girlfriend,\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nshe is not my girlfriend.\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nShe is a free woman now.\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nCan we put the focus back on you?\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nAlso, why would I lie about this?\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nLet's take a second and think about this.\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nWhy would I lie about this?\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nJeremy, I...\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000\nI wish I was lying about this.\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nThat's an incredibly...\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nI wish that she did not ever...\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nThat's not helping.\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nThat's not helping.\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nNo, that's not helping.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000\nThat's not true.\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nThat's not true.\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nThat's not helping.\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nThat's not true.\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nEva, Eva, I...\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nI'm glad she existed.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nEva may ask you.\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nI'm glad that she was with me,\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nand I'm glad that we had our...\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nEva, Jeremy, you're hanging yourself.\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nEva, why...\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nWhen you were in the audience and you felt motivated\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nto yell at that it wasn't real,\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nwhat part of you is angry about him claiming\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nthat he had a relationship?\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nLike, what does that...\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nWhat does that extend from?\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nWhat is that?\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nIs that a San Francisco thing?\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nDo you need a special certificate?\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nOr is there a...\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nYeah, give her the mic.\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nWell, I wasn't trying...\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nI never assumed you never had a girlfriend\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nbecause you came in all...\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nI go to restaurants probably every other day by myself.\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nAnd I have to...\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nYeah, I'm like, I have a boyfriend.\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nHe just works at night, you know, like...\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nBut just you could tell by his voice...\n\n01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nI could just tell.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nAnd most people that do have relationships\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nand that have been hurt,\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nyou can just hear it in their voice that,\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nyeah, no, I really love...\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nBut it's almost as if...\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nThis is the thing that I'm curious about\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nbecause the big question is, as he points out,\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nwhich I think is a valid rhetorical question,\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nwhy would he lie?\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nBut I'm even more intrigued.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nWhy would you...\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nWhy were you...\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nWithout accusing any of you of anything,\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nwhy were you compelled?\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nThat's what Aaron's asking because you...\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nIt seems to

that we were making each other happy\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nand not have to say anything.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nMan, it sounds like you just watched a Justin Long movie.\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nI'm sorry, my moment isn't cool enough for you.\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nEither she's real or he's a cuteness genius.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nOkay, okay, fine.\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nI will tell you the best moment of our relationship,\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nand it was when I had...\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nWe got to go to this random event for my company,\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nthis random charitable event,\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nand it was this casino night thing\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nthat neither of us knew was going to happen.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nAnd we just...\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nIt was a night of random frivolity,\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nand it's just funny because someone taught us\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nhow to play craps,\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nand it wasn't even that spectacular.\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nBut after all the time we spent,\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nall the vacations we went on,\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nand all the beautiful sunsets\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nand all that other shit.\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nMy best memory was this random ass night.\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nThis is so insane!\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nUh-oh.\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nOkay, wow.\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nI have a solution to get through this in the segment.\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nOkay, my relationship...\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nYeah, let's try.\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nMaybe we should have broken up.\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nMaybe you guys are right.\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nThere's a way to...\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nYou know, Schrodinger's girlfriend can remain...\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nI don't know, I think you guys are right.\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nI think we should have broken up.\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nI think this is good.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nI'm glad we broke up.\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nThe box doesn't have to overcome open.\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nSchrodinger's girlfriend can be\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\none thing or another.\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nI think the thing that we can all agree on,\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nalthough some people,\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nit seems like 70% of the audience\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000\ndoesn't think he deserves it,\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nI think we can all agree that Jeremy needs love.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nI do!\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nI'm not a bad guy!\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nThis is a challenge of definitely values.\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nSo the tragic truth might be\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nthat he has a cashew's speech impediment\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nhaving girlfriend that's a narcoleptic\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nand whose other two qualities are that\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nshe just likes to kiss and then stare at him.\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nIt was cute!\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nIn which case, bullet dodged.\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nLike, you're going to find a better girl than that.\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nTruthfully, you're already more interesting than that.\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nLet's thank Jeremy at Mackey.\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nJeremy at Eva.\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nDon't turn me!\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nYou love him!\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nI love you, Jeremy!\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nAnd thank you...\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nWhat was her name?\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nEva.\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nEva.\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nThank you, Eva.\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nI don't think...\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nI don't think there were any heroes or villains in that story.\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nI think that was one of the most interesting...\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nFucking heroes.\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nOh, thank you, buddy.\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nAnd while the music is playing...\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nGood bless you, Jeremy.\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nLet's bring our Dungeon Master, Spencer Christen.\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nSpencer Christen!\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nOh!\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nHey, can you guys hear me?\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nAm I audible?\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nI can't hear myself.\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nYou can't hear yourself?\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nWhen I was dating Mandy,\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nshe hated odd numbers.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nShe dotted all her ellipses with four periods.\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nShe loved to feed birds...\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nShe'd birds, crows, you know,\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nfrench fries in the park.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nAnd she had this really weird toe.\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nMan, when you're in love, obnoxious things are real cute.\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nThat was a very interesting moment.\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nAnd the beauty to me is,\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nI don't know that any of us...\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nI mean, maybe there's a few people in the audience.\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nJeremy will be one of them\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nthat knows the exact truth about this.\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nBut there was a division there,\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nand people felt it instantly.\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nAnd is it just that people\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\ninstantly got a vibe off of him?\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nOr there was truly something that was said\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nthat sounded like fallacious, or...\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nBoth, yeah.\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nIt was all of the above.\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nAlso, Jeremy, when he speaks,\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nhe has this kind of lightness\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nand this kind of laugh in his voice,\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nand that makes it hard to believe.\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nSome people mask pain that way.\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nAnd also, people coming up on stage,\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nmaybe for the first time,\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nor maybe not comfortable to come up here\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nunder that kind of scrutiny,\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nalthough he did seek it out himself,\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nto come up...\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nPeople do behave strangely on microphone\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nand under the light,\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nso I think you have to dispense\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\na little bit of leeway for that.\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nDefinitely, one thing we've learned\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nin Harmon Chat is that\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\neveryone's welcome up on stage,\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nbut you kind of...\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nBecause there's always a bunch of people\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nin the audience,\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nand they know that you can kind of come up on stage,\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nwhen you do come up on stage,\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nyou have two strikes against you,\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nbecause everyone in the audience is going,\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nthe fuck, I paid $20, I'm not coming up on stage.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nEven when we ask,\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nit's like, that's a thing that you have against you.\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nAnd I'm not saying that's right or it's wrong,\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nbut that's a thing you have against you.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nI feel like...\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nI've already said it,\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nbut he could have said,\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nI like chocolate chip cookies,\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nand if James Earl Jones came up from the back,\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nand was like, no, he doesn't.\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nThat's so interesting that\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nyour brain just goes like,\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nwhoa, I think he doesn't.\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nIt's not like we're in some small town.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nThis is a big city we're in,\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nand somebody came...\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nTurns out it's a little smaller than...\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nYeah, no.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nNo, this is like our town right now.\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nThis is funny.\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nI run the bike shop\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\ndown on Third and Walton,\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nand this young man's...\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nHe never seemed in love.\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nHe's been using his broken heart\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nto steal watches and coin purses\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000\noutside my malt shop\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nfor nine unto two harvests.\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nAnd then a gal with a sweater\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nand a fedora came up on stage,\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nand was just like kind of semi-to-fully convinced\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nthat it was just bullshit.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nShe was an intriguing character, too.\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nI wish the people that were listening could...\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nI don't know how they could see those people.\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nCan we all go to...\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nWhat was you supposed to call it?\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nBoogaloo's?\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nHoobie Doobies?\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nHoobie Doobies.\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nBoogaloo's?\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nIs it a restaurant?\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nBar?\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nWhat is it?\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nI imagine it's a place that sells balloons.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nI want you to know if you're listening in New Jersey,\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nMilwaukee, Kansas, wherever you're listening,\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000\njust know that Jeremy was not a bad-looking man\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nand also the girl that came up\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nand inexplicably accused him of being a sociopath.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nAlso, like, very put together.\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nIt was just weird.\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nIt was just weird to me.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nI thought they were going to...\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nI thought they were going to end up together.\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nDidn't it seem like they would end up like this?\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nThey both look like characters from like a CW show\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nor something.\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nOne of them didn't have an extra head\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nor leg braces or, like, you know,\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nit was obese or anything like that.\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nI just offended all of our...\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nLeg brace having obese listeners.\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nI'm not saying you're not worthy of being on a CW show.\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nI'm just saying that...\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nI just wish that happened so early on in the show\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nso we could do this for the next 17 hours.\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nOne tree telepathic.\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nI didn't know.\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nIt was like when Maury Povich realized\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nthat you could just do paternity tests all the time.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nNow I just...\n\n01:29:49.000

itself.\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nThe people...\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nSo much more interesting than us,\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nJohn, about Dolly Parton for two hours.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nBut the thing is, that's amazing.\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nLike, we do a show in Hollywood\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nat the back room of a comic book store,\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nand there's a team of people that come.\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nWe have our little Muppet show of regulars that come.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nAnd it's a guy named Adam Goldberg\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nthat certain people love and certain people don't love\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nand there's this and that.\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nBut like, you can come all the way up to Cobbs\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nand there's a fucking brand new Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nWe don't have much time.\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nWe should probably go to the D&D\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nwhile we still have a little bit of daylight.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nSo, should I hand these out?\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nYeah, let's hand out the character sheets if we

drunk as I've been in Harmontown since last year\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nwhen I was here at the punchline.\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nYeah, you were gone, man.\n\n01:31:04.000 -->

01:31:13.000\nI would read my notes from last week,\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nbut they're in Sanskrit.\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nOkay, so Joel, you're this character named Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nAside from being a rogue,\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nhe also created the song Lady in Red.\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nWow, these notes suck.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nFortunately, we have Spencer to recap for us\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nwhat happened last week.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nAre you ready to go on

up, liar.\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nNo, you didn't!\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nAnd then...\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nThe skeleton man from Tormod Tour.\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nOn the way to the city, Lenev began explaining\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nthe customs of the underworld\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nwhile Mulraine stabbed Quark for having too many hit points.\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nAfter hearing a noise,\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nQuark approached a battered hut,\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nslaying its undead occupants\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nand violating their corpses.\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nLenev led the gang into the broken city,\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\npassed the crumbling walls\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nand into the Forsaken Chapel.\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nThere they met the three bone sages of Tormod Tour,\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nwho revealed to our heroes\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nthe location of the Pteragon of Virtue,\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nhigh upon the Floating Isle of

the gang could leave,\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nLenev began...\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nbegan spitting and cussing,\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000\ndemanding that the party be brought to justice for their crimes.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nThe bone sages didn't seem so enthusiastic about this,\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nbut decided to enact\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nthe Rites of Televarna.\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nBut what were the Rites of Televarna?\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nAnd how could our party escape?\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nAnd what did it mean?\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nIs it some sort of name or something?\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nA historical figure?\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nNo

what?\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nTelevarna.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nYeah, the bone sages, they're looking at you.\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nThey're looking at you, and they're saying,\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nthese Rites, these Rites of Televarna.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nTelevarna!\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nChains as black as night fire from the shadowy rafters,\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nstriking you in the chest,\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nand sending a cold, clammy pressure into your bodies.\n\n01:33:51.000 -->

black,\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nfiling into the church,\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nstanding around you in a circle.\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nEveryone in the church is also chained by these black chains.\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nI go into a barbarian rage,\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nand Russell try to get free of my chains.\n\n01:34:14.000 -->

--> 01:34:41.000\nWith the black chains.\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nAs you rip the chain out of your body,\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nyou feel yourself die,\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nbut as you slump forward into the chain\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nthat you ripped out of your body,\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nyour soul re-enters, and you feel yourself

plinks off.\n\n01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000\nNo, no, I'm possessed.\n\n01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nCan I read my chart\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000\nif I'm possessed?\n\n01:45:08.000 -->

skeleton.\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nNo, it's not like syrup.\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000\nIt's not like tree sap.\n\n01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000\nYou don't know that.\n\n01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nIt's a weapon.\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nYou just need to fall addicted to a lot of old tiny pranks.\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000\nOh, excuse me.\n\n01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000\nI'm going to not use my weapon yet then.\n\n01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000\nIf it's not sap, I don't want to play.\n\n01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000\nSo...\n\n01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nAll right, fuck you, gashes form.\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000\nOkay.\n\n01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nGashes what?\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nWhat do you say, gashes

--> 01:45:58.000\nYou know, it turns me into like a fart.\n\n01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000\nYou do that.\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000\nYou become a gashes form.\n\n01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nThe one who cast it blasted.\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000\nGashes.\n\n01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nThe chain is still going into your gashes form,\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000\nand you see like a lighter glowing cloud\n\n01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000\ninside of your cloud.\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nThat's your soul, man!\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000\nChains, you got your soul, Jack!\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nI'm running around because I have a ten-minute fuse\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nin my chest, and I start running looking for exits\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nor any sort of egress.\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000\nFor some reason, you can't seem to break\n\n01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000\nthe barrier of standing hooded figures ringing you.\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000\nI do a cleave flaming sword attack\n\n01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000\nthrough the hooded figures around me.\n\n01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nAll right.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000\nIf your sword cuts them at all,\n\n01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000\nit doesn't seem to have any effect.\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000\nIt slices through it as easily as if they were\n\n01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000\na gashes form.\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000\nIt's embarrassing.\n\n01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000\nGuys who run along, we got to bring us into the station.\n\n01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000\nMod speaks up, Mod speaks up.\n\n01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000\nNow tell him Varna's happening.\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000\nI already said that.\n\n01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000\nYou must elect a defendant.\n\n01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nMe.\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nI'm the defendant.\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nDo it.\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000\nIt's not like a defendant in the other\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nusage of the terms.\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000\nIt's more like a\n\n01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000\ndefense attorney, really.\n\n01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nI defend myself.\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000\nAll right.\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000\nIf you shall be the defendant,\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nthen tell him Varna shall continue.\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000\nVarna shall continue.\n\n01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000\nWait, why are you telling me what to say?\n\n01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000\nI wasn't.\n\n01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000\nI am the defendant,\n\n01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000\nand I defend myself.\n\n01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000\nI am the guilty party.\n\n01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000\nPrepare your case, then.\n\n01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000\nAll right.\n\n01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000\nWhat is my crime?\n\n01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000\nThat's not how this works.\n\n01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000\nOkay.\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000\nWell, okay.\n\n01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nI'm still just running around stabbing gaseous people\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000\naround the room.\n\n01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000\nStill not doing anything.\n\n01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000\nI put cardboard paper\n\n01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000\nin Leviticus's head.\n\n01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nLeviticus?\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000\nAnd boy, what a mistake.\n\n01:48:04.000 -->

shadow\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000\nin the crowd.\n\n01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000\nWow.\n\n01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000\nI shall not apologize.\n\n01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000\nMy mother was a balloon.\n\n01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000\nI love popsicles.\n\n01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000\nLet's have a party.\n\n01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000\nI'll go underground.\n\n01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000\nI wrote him a pull of chains out of her chest.\n\n01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000\nAs hard as I can, I pull her chains out.\n\n01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:58.000\nI put my bag of nuts in her mouth.\n\n01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000\nI have an actual bag of nuts.\n\n01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000\nCan I cast mirror image?\n\n01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000\nAnd so there's another version of me\n\n01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000\nand the other side of the room.\n\n01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000\nThere's four more versions of you.\n\n01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000\nBut one of them steps forward and says,\n\n01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000\nall right, that will do.\n\n01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nI think they've learned their lesson.\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000\nAnd then we all wink and then we all jump in the air\n\n01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000\nand high five.\n\n01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000\nSet them free and let's proceed.\n\n01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000\nYou say those things.\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nBut, yeah.\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nI start swallowing my rope.\n\n01:49:42.000
