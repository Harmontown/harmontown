00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome on an all!

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
To pubs in San Francisco, California!

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
It is my pleasure to ask that Herman Cowan is now in session.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Will she please welcome in the stage the mayor of Herman Cowan!

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
Herman Cowan!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
What a delightful bunch you are. Thank you.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm very flattered by your attendance numbers, very flattered by your enthusiasm.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's see what we can do to just punish it, right?

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Certainly, I don't have an act, but you guys are fans of the podcast, so you know that.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
So if we do nothing but get drunk and ramble for two hours,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
that's a little slice of Los Angeles for our friends in San Francisco.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
So you guys are obviously, there's a lot of people from San Francisco here,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
but there's always a tremendous amount of you that are from the outlands,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
who have pilgrimageed here to see all kinds of stuff.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
How many people in the latter group? How many non-San Franciscoites?

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm just curious about that. It feels like roughly 40%?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, or more 50, I don't know.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I think this is our third time doing a San Francisco sketch fest.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
But our first time here in this room, it seems like a lovely room.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't know. It's a little intimidating. It feels kind of like a cattle auction.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
See, I'm not that intimidated because the only times I've ever been here is...

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
No. I'm telling you why is because I've only ever been out in the audience

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
watching the highest Doug Benson you've ever seen in your life.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
And he's hilarious, but the stakes are low because he's so mellow.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
You can just kind of be delightful out here.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
No, I'm not going to ruin it by second guessing.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
It's interesting the dynamic that shifts between different rooms.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
We sit in the back of a comic book store in Los Angeles,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
kind of like it's different acoustics and different things, and Doug Benson,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
as high as he is, always has an act to fall back on,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
or a joint in his pocket or something.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
All I've got is my Evernote notepad.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
I wanted to make an announcement that I've been having a very successful experiment

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
since I stepped foot into San Francisco.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
It's a two-fold thing, and I don't know how to describe it.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
It seems kind of contradictory.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
One thing is called owning it.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm owning it.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
What?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
It. I'm owning it.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It's like I'm owning everything.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm not apologizing for anything anymore.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
For instance, the fact that I'm fat.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm owning it.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
You can't tell I'm fat because I'm owning it.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
It seems like I'm supposed to be fat.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Like Santa Claus owns it.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
Santa Claus is technically fat, but that one guy, that one dick,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
describes him as fat in his first poem about Santa Claus.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
But from then on, we're just like, he's awesome.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
He owns it.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Your sweater has a suspicion about it.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
It's got some secrets.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I chose a color that absorbs light rather than reflects it,

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
hoping that somehow the enterprise of your eyeballs would slingshot

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
around the sun of my stomach and go back in time to when I was 25.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
Didn't you make a decision to go on a diet since you got engaged

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
that you would become slim and live and sexy for your wedding?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Well, you have to back into a number.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm going to be thin by my wedding, so you just keep pushing the date.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Every day becomes, you know, I had two quarter pounders yesterday

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
that I didn't tell Erin about.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
It's fucked up. It's fucked up.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
She doesn't know I haven't talked to her about it.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
How many did you have that you did tell her about?

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
I've had like 90 that I told her about and 160 that I haven't.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I've discussed this before.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
Erin and I, my betrothed Erin McGathy, it's a dream relationship.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
We share, the interests that we share are going to kill us.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
The interests that we share are, you know, we are passionate

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
about our pursuit of a sedentary lifestyle.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
We just think that people should be sedentary.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
We love it. We love watching movies that we don't even enjoy.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
I got one of those special pillows.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
That's the first thing I did when I started when Erin moved in.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
I got one of those, they call them boyfriend pillows.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
They're a technical name for them.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
They're those pillows that are shaped like a little easy chair.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Do you know what I mean?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
I don't know what I'm expecting, like you're all going to nod.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
200 people are going to nod their head.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Wait, wait, wait. These are for in bed so you can sit up.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah, you know those pillows that they have, like, you know,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
when you sit up in bed.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
No, we don't know, Dan. Explain it to us.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Oh, because you all are rock climbing. Fuck off.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
You all know.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
When you sit up in bed, the headboard hurts, you know?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
It's like, you put some pillows behind your back and those pillows

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
shift around and all that stuff.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
And these things are called boyfriend pillows and they have

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
these little nubs that come around and it's just enough to

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
kind of anchor you.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
And it just cements you like a little barnacle against the

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
headboard and are you quitting?

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Are you that outraged about my physical fitness?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Is the pillow supposed to be your boyfriend?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Why is it a boyfriend pillow? Boyfriend for whom?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I think it's, well, my theory is that the reason it's called

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
a boyfriend pillow, and by the way, there's other things,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
the nomenclature is confusing because women have,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I don't know if I should refer to them as a gender,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't know if a guy invented this or a woman,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
and I know the gender didn't invent them,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
so I shouldn't say women have, but for women,

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
they have those simulated boyfriend pillows.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
They're like body pillows for snuggling.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
And God knows men have all kinds of things that have

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
nothing to do with sleeping that are simulations,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
but the thing that's technically called a boyfriend pillow,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I believe the reason it's called a boyfriend pillow,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I would imagine is because this is not a romantic thing,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
this is a relationship thing, this is a guy's over at your

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
house, but he doesn't, you know, he might not fuck you,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
you might just watch like Ironside or something.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
So it's a boyfriend pillow, it's a nesting pillow.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It has a time machine that goes back when Ironside is

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
on the air.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
You don't even know, he doesn't even know.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
They redid Ironside.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
They did?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Dan, I don't have a boyfriend.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Wait, so it's got little arm rests, right?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, Ironside does, otherwise he'd fall out of his chair.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
No, no, no, I know.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I know Ironside has arm rests.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Oh, now he's an Ironside expert.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Well, if you had been to Iron Con, you would know that

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
they remade the series.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
It's now canceled, but they...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
They rebooted Ironside?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
For about three weeks, they gave it a shot.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
They thought the reason the first Ironside failed was maybe

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
because the guy was fat and white.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So they put a very sexy black man in a wheelchair,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
but they kept flashing back to when he had use of his legs,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
as if to apologize, like, he's not always crippled.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
And they would do scenes like...

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I only know about this because I was actually on the soup,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
so I saw one of these clips.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
They would...

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
He would roll into a room and be investigating a crime scene,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
and then he says, he goes,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
yeah, so and so was scared all right,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
but not because of the drugs, because of that gun.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And he points at a gun that's under a pillow on a couch,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
and all the other cops at the crime scene go,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
how did you see that?

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And he goes like, I got a different view of the world from down here.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I'm not fucking kidding.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
It was one of the soup's clip of the years,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
because it's so fucking insane.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
The idea that forensic science is somehow altitude biased.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Guys, get in here.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm the chief of police.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I want everyone to enter every crime scene at a different level.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I need two six-year-olds, a Chihuahua,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
a great Dane, and a giraffe.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I want a really tall guy on another guy's shoulders,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
wearing the world's longest trench coat.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Just walk through, don't touch anything, but just look around.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Get a gun, tell me. Someone teach this giraffe how to recognize guns and speak.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't want to...

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
All right, get rid of these eucalyptus leaf pillows.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
It's going to defeat the whole purpose when the koala comes in.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I don't know what I'm looking back at this for.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
There's a structure to the show.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Have you guys ever amazed yourself at how sedentary you've become?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Is there a moment when you look at each other and go, oh Jesus Christ.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Every fucking minute.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, we are so happy.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And then it's just like...

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Sometimes there's just the weekends, they just go...

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
We just watch nine movies in a row.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
That's what heaven should be.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
So you never look at that...

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I don't want you to, I root for your happiness at all times,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
but you don't ever look at those moments with a sense of alarm.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
That maybe is terrible?

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
I'd rather you just come out and say whatever you're trying to say

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
than this deposition.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Just charge me with whatever you're going to charge me with.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
I mean, I love a woman, I don't love hiking.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
I love her, she loves me, we love...

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
I would rather watch 27 dresses than exercise.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
She would rather watch...

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
What's 27 dresses?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Buckaroo Banzai than exercise.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
So even though she hates Buckaroo Banzai and I hate 27 dresses,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
we both love not moving.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
We share each other's favorite movies with each other, it's heaven.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And then every once in a while, the doorbell rings,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
and bing-bong, our sausages are here.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And is it like a Mexican standoff of who has to get out of bed?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Absolutely, yes.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
That'll be our undoing. It's like the treasure of Sierra Madre.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Oh, I see, as soon as I get up, you steal my pillow, huh?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Did you buy the boyfriend pillow or did she purchase that for you?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
No, I immediately... I didn't know what it was called.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I was like, I want one of those things, it's time now, it's finally time.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
I'm finally with a woman that I love enough that I want to just smuck up to the headboard.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Smuck up?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Smuck up!

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Smuck up, motherfucker!

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
You smuck up. See, I don't want to sit up in bed.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I've never won... I don't want a TV in my bedroom.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I don't want to sit up and read in my bedroom.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
I want to go to bed in my bedroom or do naked things in my bedroom.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Well, big deal. What do you want, a cookie?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I feel like... I don't know, I know something about...

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
something about when you say these things, it feels challenging.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
See, but you feel challenged by anything.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Like, you don't like when someone says,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
well, I feel challenged by getting out of bed, certainly.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
But that's how I felt.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
You always get... I go like, oh, I ate a bunch of lasagna yesterday.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I was just fucking pigged out, I love lasagna.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And you go like, yeah, overeating.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
I don't like overeating.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I was like, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off!

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I've never said that.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I know you never have.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
It's a fucking ersatz example.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
It's a reconstruction of, like, I'm running a Jeff simulator.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm in the jeffitorium.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Like, I just go like, oh, I was in the bathroom,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
and then the guy...

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
We were trying to both get out the men's room door,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
and we did one of those dances of awkwardness before we could go,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
and you're like, I always know how to get through a bathroom door.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Fuck off, fuck off!

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
Why do you always know?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
She's perfect.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Because I don't have a boyfriend pillow.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Life is my boyfriend pillow, Dan.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
I have a challenge for you, Jeff, because you're a music fan.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
This is a new segment.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
People like segments.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
That's what I've learned recently.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Even though it's fake, it kind of enhances your enjoyment.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
People like segments.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
So this segment is called Music...

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Before you say a segment, do I need a music cue for this musical segment?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
So give me a genre, so let me know.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Thematically, what are you going for here?

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
It's about music, and investigation, and just America.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
And Auschwitz.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Okay, music, investigation, America, Auschwitz.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh, you heard that.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
That last one was a joke.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
A hilarious joke.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
We all heard it.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
But it's funny she's saying, I think I have all those covered.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
All right.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Are you ready?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
John Denver.

13:58.000 --> 14:09.000
Music corner, music corner, music.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Hey, there's another guy singing.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Wait, wait, wait.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh, you didn't say instrumental.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Well, I didn't know I...

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Okay, let's do a...

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
This segment's called Picking a Song for this segment.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Justin, I got no audio down here.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Something weird going on?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
It doesn't matter.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
I heard...

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
There we go.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Fuck it.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, okay.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
It's music theory segment.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
We're going to talk to Jeff about some music questions.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
And nothing rhymes with Jeff, except for chef and treble clef.

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
Well, that's two asshole.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I was going to say your chin was clef.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
But I stopped the song, so go fuck yourself.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
All right.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
So musical segment.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
All right, Jeff.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
The Dolly Parton song, Jolene.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yes.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
San Francisco native Dolly Parton.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
I'm pretending that this is related to...

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
San Francisco born Dolly Parton.

15:20.000 --> 15:31.000
Inventor of the typewriter and friend of Abby Hoffman.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
Hate Ashbury frozen yogurt pioneer and singer-songwriter Dolly Parton.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Right.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
She wrote this song, performed this song, Jolene.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Right.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Okay, so we're familiar with the song Jolene.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
It's Dolly Parton pleading with the object of her lover's desire.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
In other words, the woman that's going to take her man.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
She's pleading with her.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Please, Jolene, don't do this.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Please.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
My betrothed and I were discussing this song earlier.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Erin was saying when she was in a situation where she was very jealous of a young lady,

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
she felt like her relationship was in the crosshairs of a succubus.

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
The Jolene came on at Vesuvio and she had this flashback to when she was playing Jolene

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
so much that her friend asked her to stop.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
You can't listen to Jolene anymore.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
It made me curious because it's interesting.

16:35.000 --> 16:43.000
Women and men, they different.

16:43.000 --> 16:51.000
Women drive like this.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
Women and men both, we all have love songs.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
We all have painful songs.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
There's people of both genders on both sides of the listener-singer relationship.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
We're all very familiar with the idea of a song about how somebody broke my heart.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Somebody's fucking with me.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
We're also familiar, but more especially on the male side, I think.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I'll probably get corrected on this.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
On the male side, there's a heavy tradition of guys talking to guys,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
but it's usually about sniping.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
You're going to lose that girl.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm going to fuck your girl.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Yes, I'll make a point of fucking that girl instead of you.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Yes, yes, I will.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
I wish that I had Jesse's girl.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
How come Jesse gets to fuck that girl instead of me?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
It's like, when guys are referring to other guys-

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
By the way, the goodness is we can air that and we won't get sued.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Tone deafness has its legal advantages.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
There's a guy from ASCAP.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Damn it!

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
So, five notes, four notes, six notes, shit.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
He doesn't know what he's doing.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Can't pin him down.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
It'd be like if Al Capone was so bad at bookkeeping that the IRS could never-

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Shit, he doesn't know how to add anymore.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
It just says he bought a bunch of cookies.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Both sets of books.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
His cooked books and his real books.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Cookies. He loves cookies.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
They're actual cookbooks.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
His cooked books are cookbooks.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
That's what I just said.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I know that's what you said. I'm refining it.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
It feels like a challenge.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Stop challenging me.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Every time we come to San Francisco, the city of brotherly love.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
As it is known, birthplace of Dolly Parton.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
Epicenter of the typewriter.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Wasn't invented here.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It's just where the most typewriters live.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Anyways, where the fuck was I?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Jolene.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
By the way, I'm riveted to find out where you're going with this.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I think it's very interesting.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I ran this over my head.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm interested to find out if there's an answer to this.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I'll cut to the chase.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Jolene is a very special song.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
I started talking to Aaron about it.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
It's a very interesting song.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
Men are all caught up in their testosterone politics.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
If a man feels threatened sexually by another man,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
he's not typically, in a songwriting sense,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
going to tend to express that by going,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Kevin, hey, take it easy on me.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
I know you got a bigger dick, but maybe explore other options

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
because I love my wife so much.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm just begging you, Kevin, come on.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Do me a solid this one time.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
It's not an instinctive choice for a man.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Aaron immediately said, well, women,

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
I don't want to mischaracterize her as making sweeping generalizations,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
but we were just generally talking about this.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Women are socialized to communicate.

20:13.000 --> 20:20.000
If you're a woman and you have that sort of competitive relationship

20:20.000 --> 20:27.000
with another woman, the woman who leaps into aggressiveness

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
doesn't do herself any favors.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
There's a sort of trapped, claustrophobic, helpless feeling about it.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
And the reason that song is a hit song and resonates with all of us,

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
of all genders, including the third secret one,

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
is because we all know what it's like to feel like

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
just fucking at the mercy of another human being.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
So my question to you is, as a fan of music,

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
is there a male equivalent to Jolene,

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
specifically a man, songwriter, singer, addressing another man?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Yes. Bird dog by Everly Brothers.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
That's a third person. He's a bird dog.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
He's warning other people he's going to fuck your dog.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Johnny is a joker. He calls him out by name.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Johnny is a joker. He's a bird.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
He's talking to the listener.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
Is there a song where a guy calls out another guy?

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
One guy saying to another guy, hey, Tim, you're an ace coxman.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
Let's agree on that.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Let's prove it out back.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
You got a big turgid piece of drill bit down there.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
I just appreciate you going somewhere else out of mercy.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm out of options. Signed Kevin.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The closest...

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I will open that up to the floor.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
I can get a bird dog where a guy says, Johnny is trying to bird dog my lady.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
But he says, hey bird dog in the chorus.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
He goes, hey bird dog, get away from my quail.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Hey bird dog, you're on the wrong quail.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
He's like, hey bird dog, leave my lovey-dove alone.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
But he's also still warning him off.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I want to open this up to the crowd.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
If anybody thinks that they know of a song, tell her no.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Tell her no by the zombies.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
You should tell you that she loves you.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Tell her no, no, no.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Anthony, tell her no, no, no.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Wait, so you say, tell her no.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Come up on stage.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Well, if you want, if you want.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Let's bring him up on stage.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Got a microphone here, would you?

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
Hans, that's a musical name. I love it.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
There's a line in Tell Her No by the zombies where he says,

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
specifically, if she should tell you that I love you,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
just remember she said that to me.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
There's another line I think where he says,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
don't take her love from my arms, stuff like that.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Oh, tell her no.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
It's one guy talking to another guy saying,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
if my girlfriend throws herself at you, do me a favor.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Ask girlfriend.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
And be a Teflon penis.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Pretty much, yeah.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Man to man, that's all I can ask.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
But he's not saying, don't steal her away from me,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
or let release her.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I'm saying, if she comes to you.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
He's saying, stop fucking my ex-girlfriend.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
He is. Or is he saying, in the event that she tries to fuck you,

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
tell her no.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Is he saying, stop fucking her,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
or tell her no in the event that she comes and tries to?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Right, right, right.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
I was asking the question.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
No, that's good.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
You were asking me.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
I think what it is is that, you know,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
let's say it's Tony and Johnny,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
and Johnny is fucking Tony's ex-girlfriend,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and he's not into it.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
He's bummed.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
So he's saying, hey, fucking stop it.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Or maybe he's just saying, hey, I love her,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
and you're just fucking around with her.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
And so, like, you know, if she says I love you,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
then take a hike, because I'm the one who really loves her.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
I don't know.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
That's good, though.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
That's close.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Thank you, Hans.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
That's good.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Hans, everybody.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Anybody else got that beat?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
All right.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Anybody else that has that beat for man on man thwarting?

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
Man on man, acquiescence and pleading

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
for non-sexual intervention.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I take a lot of long drives doing comedy shows

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
with great groups and Ryan Stiles.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
We were talking about the kind of weird...

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
I mean, this is not going to win any awards for naming it,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
but we call it kind of like rape rock,

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
where it's like, young girl, get out of my life.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
A guy yelling at an underage woman,

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
just stop putting the sauce on him.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Don't stand so close to me.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
You're just a baby.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
You're talking specifically about men saying to young women,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
like, get away from me?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Like the police son.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Don't stand so close to me yet.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But then there's the other more horrible thing,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
which is I don't understand, like,

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
she's 16, she's beautiful, and she's like, what?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
You're 48.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Yes, she's 16.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
She's beautiful, and in four years the laws will change

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
because of this song.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Oh, yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Hey, little sister, don't you?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
That one.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Like, he's talking about the girl he's dating.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
He's more into the little sister.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Like, I used to pull your pigtails,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
and Twister turned up and goes,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
now I'm looking at your titties.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Like, now it's fucking on.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
And you get the feeling from little sister

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
that it's because he's been rebuffed by the older sister,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and now he's just gone younger,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
which is a fucking Elvis.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Also, Elvis isn't a film, if I'm not mistaken,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
called Kissin' Cousins.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And there's a song about, like,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I forget how the lyrics go,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
but they're pretty fucking good,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
in the sense that they're horrifying.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
And he says, like, she does this and she does that.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
We hug and sneak.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
We don't hug and sneeze all night.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
But we're Kissin' Cousins,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
and that's what makes it all right.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Like, they're Kissin' Cousins.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
I think it means legally allowed to fuck cousins?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I don't know.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Oh, okay, the term, he's saying we're Kissin' Cousins,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
meaning we're not first cousins.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
We're not blood-related cousins, and that's what makes it okay.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Second cousins, yeah.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
See, I have a small family.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't even know if I have a cousin.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I probably do. I don't know them.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
I bet you'd make out with her if you did.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
You're not better than these southern people.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
We judge them, but they just have more cousins.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
I think that we in the blue state metropolitan areas,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
we go like, oh, they all fuck each other.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
They all fuck their cousins.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
We just don't have many cousins.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
If once you get up to six, eight, nine cousins,

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
one of them's going to really sweep you off your feet.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
That's what can happen down there where there's more room,

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
and there's swing sets and stuff, and there's just fields.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
They don't have...

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
This potato sack race?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Who knows what goes on in those potato sacks?

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Yeah, where we have a YMCA or a Walmart,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
they have just weathering heights of wheat.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
I don't know.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Okay.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Weathering heights.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
Mixed a couple geological and cultural things there.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
I kind of got sidetracked, and I want tonight to run cleanly,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
and I don't want to get off on any tangents.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
No tangents.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Because we're in San Francisco,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and I don't want to create the false impression...

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Can we talk real quick?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Can I go off on one?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
It's not really a tangent.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
It's just a brief interjection.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Walking up Columbus, here in North Beach,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
one of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco,

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
a town which I deeply love and adore.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I love coming here.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
We were supposed to...

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
The sketch fest people were going to bring us in tonight,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
fly us back tomorrow morning,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
and all of us agreed, separately,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
that we would stay an extra day

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
just to be here in this lovely city.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Because it is the best.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Because you can come to North Beach,

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
and I went to a bar,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
and there was Frenette Bronca on tap,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
like next to the beers.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
And it was...

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
It's serotonin just poured out of the back of my brain

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
into my butts.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
It was the best.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Because that's how it works, right?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Pour it out of your butt?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Yes.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
We'll get back to that.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I'm walking up the road,

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
and I'm going...

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
You guys were at Vesuvio having a drink,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
and I was...

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
I got to have a cab,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
and I wanted to get a pizza to a certain place,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
and I hopped out of the cab,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
and I crossed the street,

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
like, near, like, Stockton, Green, Columbus, the run there.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And there was a big black guy,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
youngish, you know, I would say not...

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
Maybe just 30, maybe less, big guy.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Football jersey, I think, for some reason,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
it was like Vikings or Green Bay,

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
but something Midwest-y.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
It wasn't like the Niners or anything local.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
And he had a football,

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
and he was standing, like,

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
waiting at the crosswalk,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
and he was, like, tapping the football...

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Jesus, he was, like, really out of his way.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah, well, yeah.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
But he was just standing there,

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
like, you know, it's like this...

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Like, it didn't bother me at all,

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
didn't really pay much attention.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Left went and had pizza come back.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
He's still there at the same crosswalk,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
and now I'm stuck at that crosswalk,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
waiting on a green light,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
and he's still there,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
and we're now waiting to cross the street,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
but I know this guy enough to know

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
he's not crossing that street,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
because he was there an hour ago,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
tapping that football,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
kind of shifting from left to right,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
and he looks over,

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
and I'm wearing a suit,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
and I got a tie on,

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
and I'm carrying a book

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
and a little zippy case from my iPad

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
that I DJed the show with,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
so he just looks over at me,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
and we're about...

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Like, our heads are about a foot and a half apart,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
waiting next to each other,

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
and he goes,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
fuck it, faggot.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Tapping the football,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
now more aggressively.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Fuck, look at this faggot.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Look at this faggot.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Faggot.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Faggot.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And then the light turned green,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
and I just kept trucking.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
And then he...

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
I told it to Erin backstage,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
she's like,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
wrong city.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
I did not see that coming.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
No.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Was he talking to you about it?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
No, I think he probably has Tourette's,

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
but it was for me,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
it was certainly for my...

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
He wasn't bonding with you,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
like, looking at, like...

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
He looked at me,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
and he didn't like what he was seeing,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
because I had a suit on.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
I mean, look,

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
he might have called everybody

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
that moved to faggot.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Well, I mean...

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm the only person I heard him say that to.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I love that he's so gay

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
that he has to carry a football around

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
in order to get away

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
with calling people faggot.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Because he's afraid that the absence of a football

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
will be the equivalent of the presence of a dildo.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
That's how gay that guy is.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I often hear rampant homophobia

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
as latent homosexuality,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
because I think, like,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
if you protest...

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
I'm a firm believer in it.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah, and if this guy's cruising,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
he's doing it the most high-concept way

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
of all time.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Well, I don't think...

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't think they're all cruising.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I think they're...

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I mean, but no,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I am an absolute firm believer

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
that if you are...

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
when you are that energetically opposed

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
to a victimous crime,

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
like, it is because you are jealous, period.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I don't understand...

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
And it's not...

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
That's not just me left-winging it,

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
and, like, I'm...

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I got all kinds of crazy political views.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I'm not a political person, but...

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Certainly, if he sends a threat

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
that you're not being threatened by,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
then that seems...

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
It's just...

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
It's too suspicious,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
and we've also found out too many times.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
It's just over and over and over again

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
that these people are, like,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
like, I'm gonna make a log in sput holes!

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
Everyone's but hole has to have an eye patch over it,

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
because homosexuals keep trying to make everyone gay!

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
It's like, okay, and then you find out

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
he's in an airport, you know,

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
and he's, like, got three dicks in his armpits, and...

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And it's just, like, over and over and over again.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Which is, for me, needlessly gay.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Well, because he's doing it wrong,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
because he's not healthy about it.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
He needs to go to, like, gay camp and, like,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
like, like, hang out with gay people

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
and ask, do you put them in your armpits

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
and have them say, no, sweetie, you don't.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Take it easy!

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Lick it, kiss it, suck it, don't...

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
You don't have to put it in your eyeball.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You don't have to go to a fucking rest stop for it.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But first of all, why are you married?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Get that in order?

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Like, you know, there's people waiting out there

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
to mentor you in gayness, if you...

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
You can find them.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Long story short, I'm fucking this guy.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And I mean...

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
I mean fucking him.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Alright, so I...

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Right in the old armpits.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
With all three of my dicks.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Because that's a big...

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
If you've got three dicks, fuck the armpits,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
because where else are you going to do it?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I never finished my...

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
So the first part of my experiment...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
The saying is one in the shit, two in the pit.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
The same...

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I don't even... I'm not even absorbing this

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
because I'm moving on.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Then...

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Just trying to educate our audience a little bit.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
If...

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
If you can...

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
If you can state it in a rhyme,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
you can justify a sex crime.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
A crime.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
On the playground.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
If there's grass on the field playing ball,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
if the river's red,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
take the dirt road instead.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
What do you...

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
No, is that one?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Is it real?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Yes, it's a real thing that I heard.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I thought you just ripped that,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
and I was going to fucking...

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Thomas Jefferson didn't say it.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
To my knowledge, but...

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
That is horrifying.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
But it says, yeah, these sayings,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
these slogans.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Yeah.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Which, by the way, are more clever than

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
today's modern beer slogans, which are just like...

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Down for what's up?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Hey, yo!

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Hashtag... Hey, Bud Light,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
if you love Bud Light, hashtag...

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Hi!

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
How are you?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
All the beer slogans are always like...

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Remember when they were really like Orwellian?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Like, why ask why?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I remember that one. That was fucked up.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Yeah, fucking...

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
A lot of you guys are 25. There was a beer...

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
There was a beer, I don't remember what brand it was.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Their slogan was, why ask why?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
That's fucked up

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
when your product is an opiate.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
To like, why ask why?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Why ask why?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I keep hearing why.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
There's a Madison Avenue boardroom,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
it's like, well, it seems like

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
our biggest opponent

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
to people buying beers,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
sometimes people keep asking why.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Yeah, well...

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Maybe we can turn the tables on them.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
It's the way that you use it!

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
The camera...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Camera pushes down a 21-year-old

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Johnny Madison.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Before that, the boss said,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I'm sick of being told why people should drink beer.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I'll tell you why.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And it goes...

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Mr Jenkins.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Bring me coffee.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
You keep saying you don't like the word why.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
If you even use why in a sentence...

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
What if I said it twice?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Why ask why?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Fuck you!

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Fuck you! I got your job now!

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I got your job!

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
You guys don't know that we're also gifted actors.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Yeah, so please...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I know Jody Foster was here last Wednesday.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Did she do this?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
No, she talked about

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
alien contact.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Again.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
It's like a broken record.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Leave it!

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I believe we're going to make contact...

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I'd like you to do a little more

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Jody Foster impression for me.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Alright, give me a suggestion.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Okay, I heard

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
rapping plumber.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Give me a beat.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Jody Foster the rapping plumber.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Break down!

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Jody Foster!

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Jody Foster!

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
MC Jody Foster in the house!

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I'm coming to your house

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
to plug your toilet!

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I'm doing it wrong already!

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I should be unplugging your toilet!

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I can't handle this,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Dr Lecter!

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Alright, that was dumb.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That was stupid.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Fuck you for enjoying it!

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
You're bad people.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Your joy makes you bad people.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
That was high risk, high yield.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
You proved it

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
by the risk yielding nothing.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I got off on a tangent,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
but I was going to say two experiments

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
that were contradicting each other.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
One is I'm owning it.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Wait, that's how long ago we jumped the tracks?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Because you started making fun of me for being fat

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
as I was owning my fat.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I was wearing that black sweatshirt.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You fucking pudgy asshole.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I didn't see now you were

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
trying to hide your fat body from your fans.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And I was like, okay, whatever.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm saying you're not hiding it.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I'm saying the sequence of being

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
given up.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Oh shit.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Owning it. Owning anything.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
If you got a zit on your forehead,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
it's fine to be insecure about it,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
but own it.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
You got a zit on your forehead.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Here's what people like.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
How do you own a zit in your head?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Here's a couple things people would be fine with.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Say it as Joey Foster.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I got a guy walking into the bar

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
with a big zit on his forehead and going like,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
hey, what's up?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Can I get you something?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
A zit on my forehead.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Because I already got one.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I'll take a Bud Light.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I'm pointing at a Bud Light.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Why?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Why ask why?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Dumb.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Thank you.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I got a zit on my forehead, but it's not your problem.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I didn't bring it up. I see all kinds in here.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
There was a

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
homophobic football player here

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
a moment ago.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Hey, what is this place?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
All right, I'm going to put something on the jukebox.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I'm a zit forehead drinking a Bud Light.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
So you like that guy.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Everyone likes that guy.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I hate that guy.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
He's making it my problem.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Here's a guy you don't like for sure.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I'll do a more accurate impression of this guy.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Still got a zit on his forehead.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Who am I?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
The bartender. Whoever you were.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
The pharmacist.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I don't know who you are.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Hey, can I get a Bud Light?

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
It's going to go away

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
in three weeks.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I'm sorry sir, this is a pharmacy. This is not a bar.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I'll take a bandaid.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I'm just going to cover it up until

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
you're not supposed to pop it.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
You don't have to talk to a pharmacist to get bandaid.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
They're over there in aisle two.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
All right, well.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Anyways, you get the idea.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Own it.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
It's okay to say

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I'm fat. I'd like to lose 40-80 pounds

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
before my wedding.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
How do I do?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
40-80?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
That's the spread.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Would you be happier with 80

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
or would you be happy with 40?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
We'd all be happier with 80.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
How much do you weigh right now?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
900, I don't know.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
You keep derailing me.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm just saying, yes, I'm fat, Jeff.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I didn't say that you were fat.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Why don't you go marry skinny people?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You know, I'm fat and I'm your friend.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I'm fat and you love me.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
What does that make you?

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
A fat man lover.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
It's worse.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
It's arguably worse.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That's why I'm...

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah, it's hard.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
That's me not owning it, see?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
That's me projecting all kinds of shame.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But if I come out like Santa Claus

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and I'm like, look who's got some presents

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
because he's so fat, you're like...

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
You don't even think of...

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
That's not owning it. Having presents because you're fat

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
is the opposite of owning it.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
That's apologizing for being fat.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I'm done with the owning it part.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
If you guys don't understand what owning it means,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
you got to Google it.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm done with that. We're not going to spend two hours on that.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
There was one other thing.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I'm apologizing now.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Now that's the opposite of owning it.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
No, you could be owning your own guilt

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
or your own shame.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I've always had this thing where somebody,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
when Erin says, when she suggests that I did something wrong,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I defend myself.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
It's some kind of chess game.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Right.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
We went to a pizza place today

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and they brought the plate of olive oil

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and I immediately took a salt shaker

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
and just put salt all over the olive oil

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
because I want to dip my bread in the olive oil.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Yes, that's why I'm fat.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I'm eating bread in olive oil.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
But I want to put the salt on the olive oil

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
but it was the table's olive oil

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
and Erin was like, maybe somebody else

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
doesn't want salt.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
My first thought is like

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
incoming

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
tactical invasion,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
perimeter defense.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
How do you get out of apologizing for this?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Someone's implying

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
that you're doing something wrong.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Prove that you're not

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
and then you just engage in all these things.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
It's like a chess game.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
So what did you say?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I was probably like, fuck you, I'm paying for dinner.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
But I don't know what I did.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
But then I was like, oh shit,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I realized when I got off the plane in San Francisco

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I want to

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
apologize whenever I

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
sense that moment.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Even if I feel like it's, who cares?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
What's the worst case scenario?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Apologize for everything.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I'm sure there's people out here that apologize too much

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and they have to work on that or something.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
They have to stick up for themselves.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I don't have that problem. I could apologize

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
a couple million times more often

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and I would break even

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
in terms of the average person.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Even practicing crunches

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
even though it's kind of an absurd,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
comedic, even quasi-passive

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
aggressive feel to it.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Now I'm just going to

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
say that I'm sorry more often.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Will you mean it when you say it

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
or is it a rude thing that you're saying?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I don't know.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Mean it, shmean it.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
It's not something that you're really doing

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
for someone else. It's like saying gizuntite.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Somebody goes like, oh you did this thing

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
and it's like...

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Being apologetic is actually

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
being contrite.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You're talking about remorse.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Sometimes those things overlap

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
but sometimes a graceful excuse me

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
pardon me.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
That's certainly the least you can do.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You don't have to grovel

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
and weep great tears about things.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
When you say I'm sorry

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
it should resonate

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
sincerely, right?

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
For instance, aren't you sorry for misunderstanding me just now?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Yes, I'm so sorry.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I'm sorry for interrupting the show.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Welcome Joe Hodgson!

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Hi everybody.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Hello Cobbs.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Joe Hodgson of Mystery Science Theater fame.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I was just going to bring you on.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Oh really? I thought...

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I got confused. I thought I was supposed to walk on

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
like Bob Hope used to do.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I told you to walk on but then they texted me

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
that you were here.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Let's do it again.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
You got some music?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I'll give you a proper intro.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
You're supposed to do a show biz intro ladies and gentlemen!

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
You know him from...

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
No, I want to give a...

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Okay.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I asked Adam Savage

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
to come on the show.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
He said yes and then he said no.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
The show was sold out anyway so there's no one here

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
that was coming for Adam Savage.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Of Mythbuster fame.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
A guy who gets his hands in the dirt

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
but

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
we really lucked out

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
in his absence because here in San Francisco

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
is really my

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
first original actual mentor

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
when I moved to LA

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
when Schrab and I moved to LA

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
the first Hollywood guy we ever

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
talked to, who ever talked to us about anything

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
was this guy and his brother

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
he had created the show

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
called Mystery Science Theater 3000

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
that I watched when I was in Milwaukee.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
One of the most...

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
this beacon

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
of inventiveness and do-it-yourselfness

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and autonomy

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
and Jim Hensonie kind of like

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
his audience and

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
here he was in LA

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and he was also from the Midwest

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
so we had to connect...

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
he was able to translate LA into Midwestern

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
terms for us and show us the ropes

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
a little bit and

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
he's a god to me and

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
a friend that I don't talk to enough

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
but he's here in San Francisco

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
and I happen to catch him on text so he's here.

44:56.000 --> 45:06.000
Thank you so much. Wow.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I've never been to Cobbs before.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It's like famous.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Isn't it? Well, yeah, there's pictures upstairs

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
that are kind of intimidating.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
There's Greg Geraldo to kind of somber

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
black and white photo

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
and a lot of like...

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
They laid the shit down at Cobbs.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah, Cobbs.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Back in the day, this is where they did

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
The Last Waltz.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Right? The band.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I don't know what is that.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
The concert movie, The Last Waltz.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Oh yeah? It was here?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Holy shit.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
It's a...

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
That was Dolly Parton's last show, I believe, wasn't it?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
It's a big room.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It's intimidating.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Yeah, I know.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
What were you doing out here in San Francisco?

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Oh, I'm doing a show tomorrow night

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
at the Brava Theater.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I'm doing riffing myself a new one.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Hey, don't plug your bullshit.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
What the fuck?

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
No, I don't know why.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
That's a dumb joke I do.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I'm just a scene maker. I apologize.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I just come and drop in on you guys.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I'm sorry I didn't bring you out faster.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
No, it's okay.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I didn't know your shows were two hours long.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Like, I talked to Aaron.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I thought they were like an hour.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Like, it's a podcast. I thought there were rules.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
My podcast are two hours.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And my podcast has rules?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
No, we're doing an hour of 45 tonight tops.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
A tight...

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
But I was rushing to get over here.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I had another show and I was like going,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
shit, I better get here or I'm not going to make it in time

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
and turns out...

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Fucking burning time over here.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah, a lot of these people probably had

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
an eight o'clock thing they were going to go to.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Or 8.30 or whatever. Fuck them.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
No, you're in for the whole thing.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Yeah.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Text your friend

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
and tell him to watch Dana Gould

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
at

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Courtney Pickles.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I think he's at Uncle Fucker's Chuckle Hut.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Uncle Fucker's Chuckle Hut.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I heard he was doing the midnight show

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
at the Taj Mahaha.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That's the only all...

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
What the...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Late night...

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
That's called owning it.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
That, my friend.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Dan just took a shirt off

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
and showed us the...

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Oh, dear heaven.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Get those dollars out, ladies.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Let's bring him out to the stage,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
put it together for the Yeti.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I thought you'd have

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
a lot more discolored skin.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I was expecting

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
a lot more.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Nope. Just a sea of creamy white

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
speckled with acne scars.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Did you ever think about

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
grooming it, cutting it back

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
with one of those groomers?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
You ever think about that?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Well, I have done it.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I mean,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
three days after I do it,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
it looks like this again.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Show me your back.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I don't want it at all.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Just show me.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Let me see.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Because I think

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
there'd be more welds.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I can't believe that he's entirely covered

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
in nipples. It's amazing.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It's almost entirely nipple.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I come from a long

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
line of tall, very hairless Austrian

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
men.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I've got like...

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I'm very symmetrical.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
If I get like a pimple on one side of my face,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I get one exactly opposite.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Like a cyborg with pimples.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I'm not taking it off, lady.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Does everybody hear that?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
When Jeff gets acne, it's also perfect.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Jesus fucking

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Monte Cristo.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
That's not what I'm saying.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Perfectly not having any.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I have one little hair that comes out on my right

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
shoulder.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
And I have one exactly on my left shoulder.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Like little magical wings.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Like vestigial pegasus wings.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
And that's it.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Also, I shit glitter.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
You come from a long line of Aryan men,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
but there aren't any women. What's up with that?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
It's just men.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I mean, what I mean by that is I've seen pictures

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
of my ancestry and all the men

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
are identical. And there's no women.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
That's what I'm saying. I'm putting it to you.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
It's just, it's just, it's just me and a bunch of dudes

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
with football from the corner of Columbus and Stockton.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
We've managed to breed homosexually.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I wish, it was so funny when

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
you guys were talking about the guy

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
who would be singing to another

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
man about his

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
coxswain's ship.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
But guys stay away from that, don't they, when they

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
write a song.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
We're socialized to

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
if that would be,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
that's just defeat, right?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
It's like, if I go like this

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
and you go like that,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
then I get your Twizzlers.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
But women aren't,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I mean, and I'm not,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
so it's important to,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
in these very sensitive times,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I'm talking about socialization.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I'm not talking about genetics.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
So girls

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
are socialized

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
at a young age. They tend to be

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
in a kind of superior way

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
because it's like they're,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I think they're socialized to like,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
they're not allowed to,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
you know,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
to do this like flexing,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
this weird like antler

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
locking thing.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
So they have to like,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
they have more complex social

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
structures and Jolene

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
is a golden egg that comes out of that.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Talking about the part before that

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
that I liked.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
The part that before you went off like that.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
The part,

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
yeah, the social thing, it was just like

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
when you were saying cock a lot.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
That was the part I liked.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
My problem with Jolene is I don't like it.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I think it's not a good song.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
It goes on and on and on and on.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I liked Dolly Parton a lot.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I saw her play at the Hollywood Bowl

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
and it was awesome because

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
like half the people

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I could see sitting around me.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
No, sorry, the Greek amphitheater in Los Angeles.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I looked around and I kind of got the feeling

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
that a good like 35,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
45% of the people around me

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
were in drag.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
She has a big like drag following.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
The real show at Dolly Parton shows

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
is in the bathroom.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Everyone, it's well known fact.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Do you have any anecdotes?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
No, that's all I got.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I'm sorry for interrupting.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
She's saying Jolene,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I thought about halfway through

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
and I feel like I should change the lyrics to

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Drag Queen and half of the

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
crowd stood up and they were like

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
a bunch of six foot five men in dresses.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
It was the best.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
And also her shows, anybody seen her live?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
By applause.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Four.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I heard one guy go,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
yep.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Are you in drag right now?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
No.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Yep.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
If she plays, please go see her

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
because she's hilarious.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
She's funny as hell.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I cried multiple times.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
She's an incredible storyteller.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
During her songs, in between songs.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
She's like,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
nobody puts on a show like her.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
She's really, really good.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
And she plays every fucking instrument in the building.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
She plays a saxophone at one point,

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
grand piano, like a banjo,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
mandolin, like she's all over the shop and she's great.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
But Jolene's too long.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
No.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
For me, it's repetitive.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
It's modal.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Maybe it does.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I haven't heard it in a while.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
When I listen to satellite radio

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
and I hear it,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I listen to a couple verses of it.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
There's 35 verses in it.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I don't know that it goes to a bridge.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
It just kind of stays in the same thing.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I don't think Jolene does have a bridge.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
The bridge would be what?

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I don't know what you would say.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
All the times you want to fuck

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
a man you always get to

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
but I'm just asking for you

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
to not fuck this one.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
That's already the verses.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I think we'd have to go to another place

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
of her backstory.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I was just thinking melodically.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It's a sweet bridge.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Thank you.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
It always tripped me up because it's Jolene.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I always thought of myself

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
dressed as a lady

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
going into town

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
experimenting, etc.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
You would use the word Jolene.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
When I'm on the phone

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I'd insist you call me Jolene.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Jolene.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
That's a good name for a

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
butch.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
For an alias.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
If I disappeared into the city tonight

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
after this show

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
in a pantsuit,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I'd be Jolene.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
All of the

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
fucks and all the motels would be

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Jolene.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I put my lips on it

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
like with lipstick.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Jolene, where are you situated now

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
when you're not in San Francisco?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I live in Pennsylvania now.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Pennsylvania?

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Where's your brother?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
He's in LA.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Fuck that guy.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
He's awesome.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Fuck it.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I still love him.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Come on.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
We're still close, aren't we?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
How many kids do you have now?

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I got two.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
You know what I'm talking about.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
He likes two kids.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Jolene.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Jolene's a big fan of two kids.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I can only sire children dressed as Jolene.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And what are you

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
focusing on creatively?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Well, I just did

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
we just did Six Years in a Cinematic Titanic

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
which was like the original cast

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
from Mystery Science Theater.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
We did a ton of shows

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and we just stopped that.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
So it's kind of like

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
and then I'm doing my one-man show.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
So that's kind of it. What's your one-man show?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I don't know anything about this. It's called

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Riffing Myself a New One.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
And it's just about the DNA

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
of Mystery Science Theater.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
So it's just this origin story.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Do you do it in present tense

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
and kind of go through the times and go like

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
so

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Fort Atkinson.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Wait, are you doing me, man?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
He does an impression of you.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Come on, man.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
You got a lot of nerve coming at me with that.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I want a stupid voice.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I'm not going to do your podcast anymore, man.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
If you keep on fucking doing

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
an impression of me.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Is it

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
bad to tell a line about

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
the problem with modern pornography

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
when you do an impression of him

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
about his problem with porn?

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Wasn't that you doing an impression of him

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
about his mythological

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Joseph Campbellian story arc?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
That was you.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I say this all the time, too.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Problem with porn, man.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Now it's all about

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
we've lost the refusal of the call, man.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
It's like

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
it used to be

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
you go into a library

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
and it's like

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
my book's overdue, but

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I can't do that, man.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
But I guess I have to.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
That's the key, man.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I'd love to get in on this,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
but I don't do me.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Own it, Joe.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
So you're one man's show.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Did I ever get to finish my plug?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I didn't.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I did the bit where tomorrow night

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
good seats still available. Come on.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Won't you?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Thank you.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I'm done. Are you going to leave or

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
you're not going to stay in place? No, I'll stay as long.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I have a feeling I'm going to get tired

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
and then you'll see me go.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
But I'll stay as long as I can

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
as long as I use some of this.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Yeah, yeah, man. That'll pep you up.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Nothing says good morning like a big

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
glass of Kettle One vodka.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
So what?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So you're...

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
I don't want to derail you, though.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I feel like I'm... No, no, no.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Our show hasn't a rail? Yeah.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I want to...

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I'm a bad interviewer and a bad friend

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
and a bad person and a bad podcaster

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
and a bad thing to pay $20 to see

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and a bad

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
carbon-based life form and

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
a bad...

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Go on.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
However,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
if I could ring anything out of you

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
while I had you here

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
it would be sort of like

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I like to hear you talk about

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
creative philosophy because

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
when I moved to LA

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I was lost in this sea of like

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
it's really easy to...

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
it's like a cult because you come

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
you come from the Midwest

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
into LA and

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
everyone's saying stuff that

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
if they're all saying it then it's true.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
I remember just sitting and having drinks

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
or dinner with you where you were

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I don't know, you would say stuff to me that kind of like

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
guided me.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Maybe it was just a cultural thing

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
like you sounded like a guy from the Midwest

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and you were out here and you had been through the ropes

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
like you would tell these stories

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
about how when you were

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
back before night court

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
you had the same agent as Harry Anderson

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
and there was a point where

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
you were like

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
you were like this

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
prop comic that was on SNL killing it

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
like had these inventions that you would

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
show and there were of course

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
people that were going like

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
like Joel Hodgson

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
he's the hottest thing

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
we gotta get you on a sitcom and stuff

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
and you diverted from that path

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
because you smelt a rat

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
like you forget that probably wouldn't be a great idea

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I remember talking to you about that stuff

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
and kind of like

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
having that as a guidepost and realizing

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
that it was okay in this sea of people

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
kissing your ass and telling

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
you everything that you thought you wanted

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
to hear that you still had to maintain

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
your own sanity I have no idea what to ask

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
you to ring some of that out of you but

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
um well

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
shit

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
what do you think about black people

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
that story in particular what's that

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
what are you saying

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I was just gonna say that story in particular was

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Brandon Tartikov who was the head of NBC

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
he wanted me to do a show called

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
High School USA which was this

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Michael J. Fox

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
like kind of like Animal House

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
they did a movie of that right

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
yeah this is a long time ago this is like

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I was 22 I was like 30 years ago

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
so it was like he said

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
um yeah we want you to do this show

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and I read the script

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
and I just didn't think

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
it was funny and I didn't think I could make it work

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and it just

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
it just seemed kind of stupid and

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I said no to it and

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
they just doubled the money

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
they just said oh yeah okay

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
it was I think they were giving me

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
ten grand a show

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
you know six guaranteed

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and they doubled it

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
so it had been over a hundred thousand dollars

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
thirty years ago and they just said okay

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
you don't want to do it here's twice the money

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
and I

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
it just made me it didn't make me feel better

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
it made me feel worse because I realized

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
that my opinion didn't really mean anything

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
in the face of all that money

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
if they you know what I mean they could

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
change your opinion

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
so when I quit I went back to Minneapolis

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and then like six or eight months later

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
started Mystery Science here so it was the right thing

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
to do for me

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
but yeah I think that's what you meant

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
that's why this

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
you made your mark

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
not from Los Angeles and not

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
with the help of these suits that were throwing piles

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
of money at you even though there was an option

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
for you it's always

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
the right thing to do to follow your

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
own compass and create if you

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
want to create then you have to actually

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
create there are a lot of people that really

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
that want to make a lot of money

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
and can kind of create

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and they're happy to

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
but they're like

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
it's always

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
you have to be willing to be homeless

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
you have to be willing to kill yourself

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
so that there's no choice if it's entertaining

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
you mean you can kill yourself

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
if you do it with the right amount of knowledge

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I find young people

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
asking that question all the time

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
like what should I do in this case

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
how do you know when you should do this

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and that and it's like

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
you have to be

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
you have to know that

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
if you tried to wash dishes

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
you'd just be worse at that you'd have to be

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
willing to sit under a bridge

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and just

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
die of exposure

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
if nobody gave you money

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
and still as your frozen grin

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
like

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
sealed shut and your eyes glazed over

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
the last thought you'd have

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
is like still though

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I did what I wanted

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and if you really don't

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
wouldn't feel that way as you died

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
then don't like well be a hack

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
try to figure out how to make money

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
and as the

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
character in Citizen Kane says

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
to paraphrase I'm like making money is no trick

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
if that's all you want to do

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
just go do it go make money

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
but I don't know

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
who was that guy that you guys

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
kind of like

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
he kind of had this style of

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
like I can't remember

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
you guys remember that roast you guys did

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and there was a guy

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
there who had this kind of training

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
where he'd take you to the airport

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
oh yeah Sam Christiansen

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
did you do that too?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
that seemed like fascinating

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
like what was that

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
what was his deal

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Sam Christiansen and he's this teacher

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
and it sounds like overly

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
guru to talk about him because

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
we talk about him pretty high flown tones

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
a lot of people

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
have been to him whether they're actors or not

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
you go in and you find out

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
it's changed a lot since I went

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
but he's got this kind of

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
pretty streamlined way

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
of you figuring out

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
the essential qualities that you've always had

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
and you always will have

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
there's things that complements

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
you've been paid your whole life

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and insults that you've received your whole life

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
and you will get them for the rest of your life

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
if people like you

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
if people like me they might call me poised or confident

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
if they don't like me they'll call me arrogant

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
or conceded or whatever but they're talking about a certain neighborhood

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
of an essential quality

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
and you go in there and it's very very interesting

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
to find out the stuff that you wish people didn't see

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
but they all do

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and the stuff that you wish people didn't see

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
but they all do

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
didn't get that right opposite wise

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
the stuff that we wish we had

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
that we don't

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
we used to go to the airport

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
a long time ago

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
when you could be at the gate without a boarding pass

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
that's how long ago that was

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and you would ask a stranger

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
to look at somebody else and check off adjectives

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
like for used Joel standing over there

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and it's fucking fascinating if you gave it to 5 people

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
or 500 people

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
they would all pick the exact same words to describe you

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and it's really chilling

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
the same grouping

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I put on a blue sweater

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I combed my hair I put on a bow tie

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
like go back multiple times

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
but people who never heard me say a word

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
know that I'm sarcastic

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
people from Germany

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
people from fucking Italy

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
they circle the word sarcastic

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
for me

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
it's been the result of

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
the cause of a lot of problems in my life

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
people assume I'm being sarcastic

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
people from me always

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
checked off shit sprinkles

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
glitter

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I fucked it

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
glitter shit is what I meant

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
he's a glitter shitter from way back

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
a glitter shitter

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
have you been to glitter shitter?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
that's what the after parties are after

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
yeah you know

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
here's what I'd like to do

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I'd like to bring out Erin McGathy

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
my betrothed

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
thank you

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
thank you

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
here's Scoops you want to

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
oh yeah I saw this here

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
oh

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
it's hard to tell what's going on but

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Scoops

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Scoops

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Scoops with a P or Scoops with a B

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Well, I mean, sometimes scoops, but I, scoops doesn't matter, it's private.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.500
Hello, Aaron, how are you?

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.000
I'm doing great, I'm owning it.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.500
We're owning it, and we're apologizing.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:05.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry that I ate two-quarter pounders without telling you.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Oh, it's okay.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I'm sorry.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I may have had some hummus with pita yesterday.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Wait, it sounds like your diet's a little stricter than Dan's.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It's still, it's still cheating.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I didn't realize how big this space was.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
My, my heart's a flutter.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I thought it was just this, this first area, and now I'm in the coliseum.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Also, there's a weird sort of, like, legion of doom people,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
that kind of...

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That lighting's unfortunate.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It looks like...

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Very, very eerily lit sort of rock.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It looks like you're all going to go like this.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
You stand convicted of intergalactic smuggling.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It looks like you're all about to go kill Superman.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Did you guys do something right to get to the seat?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
There's something terribly wrong.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It's really good.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And the thing that's cool is they're lit for our pleasure.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
There's no real practical reason they're lit up there.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That's for us.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Yeah, they're topless.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
They all look like somebody from like...

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Somebody up there yelled out something incredibly distinct

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
that I couldn't understand.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
What was that?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Who was the guy that did the sci-fi?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
No, Zarda.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Now we're getting actual Zarda quotes.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Zarda quotes.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
All right, awesome.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Dustin, can you run up and mic everybody up there

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
so they can just weigh in?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
All right, so now that we have this triumvirate,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
while we're in San Francisco,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
because we're just passing through,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I do want, before we move on,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I want to help one person from San Francisco.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You don't have to be from San Francisco.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
You could be from Mississippi.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You could be from...

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Three hours later, you could be from Pacoima.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And you could be from Kansas.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Is there anybody who really feels even more so

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
than they just want to be on stage?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And wanting to be on stage is fine.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
But somebody who really feels like they're in a...

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Like they got a problem.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
They got some pain.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
But remember, suffering's relative.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
That we could help you with.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Okay, I can only hear you in the back.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I can't see you.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Is somebody walking toward the stage

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
or is it a cocktail person?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I heard somebody say my girlfriend broke up with me.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Get up here, sir.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I think that's easy pain to access.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Would you be willing to come up here?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Person that said that?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
No.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Oh, he's coming.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Is he coming from the senatorial overlords up top?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
All right.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Here he comes.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It's funny to have to do a mad dash down for the...

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
My girlfriend broke up with me.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
That's when it's the price is right.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Hello.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
What's your name, sir?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Jeremy. It's Jeremy, everybody.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
What the fuck, I wouldn't shake my hand?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I held my hand out and he walked past me like a piece of shit.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Jeremy, you can come over here.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I have no idea how I walked past pieces of shit.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Do you want him to sit here?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
No, no, no. We'll sit Jeremy at the table there.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It's fine.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I do think Jeremy is safest next to me.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Okay, Jeremy, you have some of the finest minds

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
in the world up here.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You're feeling pain.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Tell us, tell us about it.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Give us the headlines.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
We were together for two and a half years

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and she dumped me.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
And, yeah, that's basically it.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
How did she do it?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
In person, over the phone, via text, email?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It was very sudden.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
What did she say?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Answer my question, Jeremy. How did she do it?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
It was in person.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And, you know, she gave a lot of reasons,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
but, you know, the deep reason was

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
we had communication problems.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
For the listener, Jeremy is closing his eyes

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and gesturing with his spit.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
That's what I do, too.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
He's turned away from us. I don't know why.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
What about your communication?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
What was the slide that she made up about communication?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Jeremy, grab the mic and just kind of eat it

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
so that you're free to...

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
You can communicate however you want.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I cover my eyes with my hand.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
We very much loved each other,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
but we did not communicate.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And she was someone who did not talk,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and I was someone who would not listen.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And so there was a communication that just did not happen,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
even though we were both good people

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
who loved each other very much.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Jeremy, you're a very handsome man.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Do you know that you turn into Ray Charles

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
when you're talking about your feelings?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Come on! Hey, help town!

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
She's good to me!

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Did you know that you turn into Hank Williams II?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
When someone says you're like Ray Charles?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
You have awakened all kinds of things in you.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Are you ready for some football?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Are you ready?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I'm actually not ready for football.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So Jeremy, how are you feeling about it now?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Where are you at?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
You know, it's been a couple weeks,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and you know, my friends have really been there for me,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
and I'm feeling okay, you know?

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
My friends have been really good to me, and so I feel okay.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Why are people calling out lying?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Okay, there's a part of me that does not feel okay,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
but the rest of me feels great.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
She's right there. Come on up.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Come on up. It's her. She's in the audience.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
No, no, no. We're going to bring them together right now.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
A woman just yelled out, he comes to my work all the time.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Get up here, get up here.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Annie Hall, everybody.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I'm ready for some football.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And if we don't have a mic, we're finding enough mics

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
until we can all get on stage.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Now, you can share with me. What's your name?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I'm Eva.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Eva.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Eva, you have a rebuttal?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I work at Boogaloo's, and this guy comes in all the time.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I've never seen him with a girlfriend once.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I worked there for two years.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Oh, boy.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
She ordered the same thing every time.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Does Boogaloo sell protein?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Guy doesn't have to be with a girl to have a girlfriend.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I'm just saying this guy, he's awesome,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
but I don't believe he was in a long-term,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
two-and-a-half relationship.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Jesus Christ!

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
What in the world?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
This isn't helping the healing process.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
You're calling...

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
There's a chamber of commerce of like...

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Jeremy, why do you think she would say

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
that she doesn't believe that you were in a two-year relationship?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Was this maybe a little unsighted?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
She would not believe what? I'm sorry.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Say that again?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Eva here doesn't believe you that you had a long-term girlfriend.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Hi, Jeremy.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So first off, let the record state,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
and you can back me up on this, I tip well.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I'm a good tipper. I'm not a deadbeat. I'm not an asshole.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
No, you are a great guy.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I'm a good tipper.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I was just wondering,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
because I know that I've been in a relationship

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
for well over two years.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Liar!

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I am with...

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I am with the man today.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
No, I was just...

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Wait, okay, now, Eva...

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Let's get these two together.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Stay for a moment.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Jeremy, she's accusing,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and so are more than one other people out in the audience.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
There was another female voice.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
There's at least one other...

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It almost feels like there's a consortium of local business owners

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
that the team of commerce hates me.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Definitely a counterproductive...

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Okay, here's the thing.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
She said quite succinctly

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
that she does not believe that you had a long-term relationship,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and you did not leap to your defense that quickly.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
You said you were a good tipper,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
which seems like an odd rebuttal to that accusation.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I am a good tipper.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Money talks, big hates!

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
There's real pain out there,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and a fake relationship is not one of them.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
This is the best.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
So, world's best Harmontown!

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
It ain't bad.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
It ain't wow.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Just to be...

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Joel, this show might go three hours.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
The thing is that I actually live like half a block from Boogaloo's,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
so once a week I have my work from home day,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
and I usually go there.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
As we all do.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So it's possible that half the time I have been there

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
was without my girlfriend.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So if she was an ex-girlfriend,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
she is not my girlfriend.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
She is a free woman now.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Can we put the focus back on you?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Also, why would I lie about this?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Let's take a second and think about this.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Why would I lie about this?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Jeremy, I...

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I wish I was lying about this.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
That's an incredibly...

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
I wish that she did not ever...

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
That's not helping.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
That's not helping.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
No, that's not helping.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
That's not true.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
That's not true.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
That's not helping.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
That's not true.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Eva, Eva, I...

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I'm glad she existed.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Eva may ask you.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I'm glad that she was with me,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and I'm glad that we had our...

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Eva, Jeremy, you're hanging yourself.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Eva, why...

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
When you were in the audience and you felt motivated

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
to yell at that it wasn't real,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
what part of you is angry about him claiming

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
that he had a relationship?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Like, what does that...

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
What does that extend from?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
What is that?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Is that a San Francisco thing?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Do you need a special certificate?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Or is there a...

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Yeah, give her the mic.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Well, I wasn't trying...

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I never assumed you never had a girlfriend

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
because you came in all...

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I go to restaurants probably every other day by myself.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And I have to...

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Yeah, I'm like, I have a boyfriend.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
He just works at night, you know, like...

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
But just you could tell by his voice...

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I'm sorry.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I could just tell.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And most people that do have relationships

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and that have been hurt,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
you can just hear it in their voice that,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
yeah, no, I really love...

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
But it's almost as if...

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
This is the thing that I'm curious about

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
because the big question is, as he points out,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
which I think is a valid rhetorical question,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
why would he lie?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
But I'm even more intrigued.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Why would you...

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Why were you...

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Without accusing any of you of anything,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
why were you compelled?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That's what Aaron's asking because you...

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It seems to be...

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Does he come in and like, ply this?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
No, no, no, because I just made one snide,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
rude comment to my boyfriend like,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I've never seen him with a girlfriend.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And he's like, you should say it.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And I was like...

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
If you had to guess, what do you think his...

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
If you had to guess why he would make up a...

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
So here's the thing, Maggie,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
the non-Googleable version of her name,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Maggie, you should email either Dan or Aaron

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
and tell them that you exist.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
You're probably not going to be happy

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
that I'm talking about you right now,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
but you listened to this

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and you should prove her wrong.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Oh, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Actually, I don't even think she...

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It's okay, Jeremy.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Eva, what...

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
If you...

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
My boyfriend, my boyfriend over there...

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
She's my girlfriend again!

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
We made love at summer camp!

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Order, order.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Okay, Eva, you came up here simply

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
because your boyfriend fucking goaded you to come up here?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yeah, her boyfriend, who we've never seen...

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
He's like...

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Wait, goddammit.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
They'll love it.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
You have been coming on this stage

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
for minutes and minutes

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
and I have never, ever seen this boyfriend.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
There is a boyfriend out there.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Maybe two.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Nobody cares about that part of it.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
We care about the fact that you actually have

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
no convictions about whether he had a girlfriend or not.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
No, no, no, she did.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
She had a leisurely one

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and her boyfriend was like, fucking goosome, man!

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Eva, what do you think, if you had to guess,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
what do you think his motivation would be

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
from making up a girlfriend?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Like, when you were...

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I have that anyway!

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Eva, just...

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Maybe come on down.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I'm sitting in the background

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
and I've heard a familiar voice

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
coming from the balcony.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
So, I...

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Yeah, I should have never called out anybody

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
that feels like they may have been in love.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
But you still feel that he did not have a girlfriend

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
for two and a half years.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I still don't.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
You stand by that conviction.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I stand by that, yeah.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Well, I would be so much easier.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
By show of applause right now.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
By show of applause...

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
First of all, let's do this a couple ways.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
First off, and I want this to be honest,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
no ironic bullshit here.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
People that already know Jeremy,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
or have met him before,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
and know him from around town,

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
please applaud right now.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Okay, three or four or five people.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Come on!

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
All right, now, everybody...

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
You met her!

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Everybody else, everybody else in here.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Who believes Jeremy that he's heartbroken

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
over his breakup of two and a half years?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Wow.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I feel like we've stumbled on

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
a very complicated...

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Who thinks that there might be

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
some malarkey going on with that?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Wow.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Jeremy!

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Hold on, okay, all right, thank you.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Thank you, thank you.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I wish they were right.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Jeremy, hang on.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I'm not editorializing on that.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I just wanted to see what the audience felt

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
based on human interaction so far.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
That was clear enough.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I mean, they're going to follow the drama,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
and I'm not saying they're wrong to do it,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
but it's like that's...

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But people smelled it before she did.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
There was already a feeling of that.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I don't know...

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Well, I don't know about that.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I know that if somebody comes up

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
and starts saying, like,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I love French fries.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I love French fries all the time.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
My favorite kind of French fries,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and then someone goes like,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
that's what you want us to think!

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Like, I'm going to go like,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
what the fuck?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And then if that person comes up

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
with a hat and a sweater,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
and it's like,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
this man pretends to like French fries.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And I'm not saying you're...

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
We're not leaving until we know

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
the fucking truth about this.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I'm just saying that...

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Lock the door is closed.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Can we just point out...

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I'm not saying you're a charlatan.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I'm just saying that

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
as an audience member,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
narratively, your mind then goes to...

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
We've all seen Aero Morris documentaries.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Like, you're fucking...

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Like, the first time bullshit is called,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
you're on the side of the...

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Like, you're fucking yo-yo.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Let us just...

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
If you were in love,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
and you just got your heart broken,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
you would have more details than

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
she didn't listen.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I couldn't listen.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Well, Tim, more details?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Can we just point out for a moment?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
The thing is, you don't actually want more details.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I could give you more details,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
but no one here wants to hear.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
San Francisco! San Francisco!

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Detail lightning round!

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Detail lightning round!

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Can we just point out for a moment

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
as somebody,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
and I'm sure I share the stage with other people

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
who feel the same way,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
as somebody who spent a lot of her time

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
heartbroken, it sounds like in San Francisco

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
it's a real privilege.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I mean, is this my...

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Do you have a special parking place?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
This is my vahala!

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I'm queen here!

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I'm like, oh, so many breakups,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
but yeah, I guess a detail lightning round.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
There's a special punch card for free coffee, if you...

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Alright, detail lightning round.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Okay, so somebody that's better at asking questions than me.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I think it would be great if he started out

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
by just saying four super cute things

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
that she used to do that he loved.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Okay.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Just really adorable things.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And you have to keep your eyes open while you explain.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Okay, so she was mildly narcoleptic,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
and so...

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
That's awesome.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
She would fall asleep if left unattended,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
and it was a little annoying

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
because she always had to take naps,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
so it was kind of cute

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
because we'd always take naps together.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
So that's one thing.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Let's see.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
We would refer to ourselves as mammals

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and just talk about how great it was to be mammals.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Okay, now we're drifting.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
We're drifting.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
No, two more.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Two more.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Okay, lightning round.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Two more.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Two more.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Two more.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Alright, okay.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Let's see.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
So when she would say the word cashew,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
it was really cute.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
She was like, cashew!

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I don't know.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
It's feeling real to me.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I like that.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
We made these salad like we had this...

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
You can't make shit up like that.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
We had this Asian chicken salad

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
that we would make their cashews in it.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
And...

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Last one.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I know lightning round, Jeremy.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Sometimes after we'd make out,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
we would just kind of look at each other and smile

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and know that we were making each other happy

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
and not have to say anything.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Man, it sounds like you just watched a Justin Long movie.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I'm sorry, my moment isn't cool enough for you.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Either she's real or he's a cuteness genius.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Okay, okay, fine.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I will tell you the best moment of our relationship,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
and it was when I had...

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
We got to go to this random event for my company,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
this random charitable event,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and it was this casino night thing

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
that neither of us knew was going to happen.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And we just...

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
It was a night of random frivolity,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
and it's just funny because someone taught us

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
how to play craps,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
and it wasn't even that spectacular.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
But after all the time we spent,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
all the vacations we went on,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
and all the beautiful sunsets

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and all that other shit.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
My best memory was this random ass night.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
This is so insane!

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Uh-oh.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Okay, wow.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I have a solution to get through this in the segment.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Okay, my relationship...

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Yeah, let's try.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Maybe we should have broken up.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Maybe you guys are right.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
There's a way to...

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
You know, Schrodinger's girlfriend can remain...

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I don't know, I think you guys are right.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I think we should have broken up.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I think this is good.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I'm glad we broke up.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
The box doesn't have to overcome open.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Schrodinger's girlfriend can be

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
one thing or another.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I think the thing that we can all agree on,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
although some people,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
it seems like 70% of the audience

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
doesn't think he deserves it,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I think we can all agree that Jeremy needs love.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I do!

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I'm not a bad guy!

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
This is a challenge of definitely values.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
So the tragic truth might be

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
that he has a cashew's speech impediment

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
having girlfriend that's a narcoleptic

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
and whose other two qualities are that

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
she just likes to kiss and then stare at him.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
It was cute!

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
In which case, bullet dodged.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Like, you're going to find a better girl than that.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Truthfully, you're already more interesting than that.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Let's thank Jeremy at Mackey.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Jeremy at Eva.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Don't turn me!

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
You love him!

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I love you, Jeremy!

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And thank you...

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
What was her name?

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Eva.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Eva.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Thank you, Eva.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I don't think...

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I don't think there were any heroes or villains in that story.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I think that was one of the most interesting...

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Fucking heroes.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Oh, thank you, buddy.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
And while the music is playing...

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Good bless you, Jeremy.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Let's bring our Dungeon Master, Spencer Christen.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Spencer Christen!

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Oh!

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Hey, can you guys hear me?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Am I audible?

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I can't hear myself.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
You can't hear yourself?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
When I was dating Mandy,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
she hated odd numbers.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
She dotted all her ellipses with four periods.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
She loved to feed birds...

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
She'd birds, crows, you know,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
french fries in the park.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And she had this really weird toe.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Man, when you're in love, obnoxious things are real cute.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
That was a very interesting moment.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And the beauty to me is,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I don't know that any of us...

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I mean, maybe there's a few people in the audience.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Jeremy will be one of them

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
that knows the exact truth about this.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
But there was a division there,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
and people felt it instantly.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And is it just that people

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
instantly got a vibe off of him?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Or there was truly something that was said

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
that sounded like fallacious, or...

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Both, yeah.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
It was all of the above.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Also, Jeremy, when he speaks,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
he has this kind of lightness

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
and this kind of laugh in his voice,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
and that makes it hard to believe.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Some people mask pain that way.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And also, people coming up on stage,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
maybe for the first time,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
or maybe not comfortable to come up here

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
under that kind of scrutiny,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
although he did seek it out himself,

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
to come up...

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
People do behave strangely on microphone

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
and under the light,

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
so I think you have to dispense

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
a little bit of leeway for that.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Definitely, one thing we've learned

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
in Harmon Chat is that

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
everyone's welcome up on stage,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
but you kind of...

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Because there's always a bunch of people

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
in the audience,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
and they know that you can kind of come up on stage,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
when you do come up on stage,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
you have two strikes against you,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
because everyone in the audience is going,

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
the fuck, I paid $20, I'm not coming up on stage.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Fuck you.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Even when we ask,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
it's like, that's a thing that you have against you.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And I'm not saying that's right or it's wrong,

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
but that's a thing you have against you.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I feel like...

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I've already said it,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
but he could have said,

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I like chocolate chip cookies,

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
and if James Earl Jones came up from the back,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
and was like, no, he doesn't.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
That's so interesting that

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
your brain just goes like,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
whoa, I think he doesn't.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It's not like we're in some small town.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
This is a big city we're in,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
and somebody came...

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Turns out it's a little smaller than...

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yeah, no.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
No, this is like our town right now.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
This is funny.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I run the bike shop

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
down on Third and Walton,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and this young man's...

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
He never seemed in love.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
He's been using his broken heart

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
to steal watches and coin purses

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
outside my malt shop

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
for nine unto two harvests.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And then a gal with a sweater

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
and a fedora came up on stage,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
and was just like kind of semi-to-fully convinced

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
that it was just bullshit.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
She was an intriguing character, too.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I wish the people that were listening could...

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I don't know how they could see those people.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Can we all go to...

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
What was you supposed to call it?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Boogaloo's?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Hoobie Doobies?

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Hoobie Doobies.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Boogaloo's?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Is it a restaurant?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Bar?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
What is it?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I imagine it's a place that sells balloons.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
That's the thing.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I want you to know if you're listening in New Jersey,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Milwaukee, Kansas, wherever you're listening,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
just know that Jeremy was not a bad-looking man

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
and also the girl that came up

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and inexplicably accused him of being a sociopath.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Also, like, very put together.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
It was just weird.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It was just weird to me.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I thought they were going to...

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I thought they were going to end up together.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Didn't it seem like they would end up like this?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
They both look like characters from like a CW show

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
or something.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
One of them didn't have an extra head

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
or leg braces or, like, you know,

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
it was obese or anything like that.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I'm so sorry.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I just offended all of our...

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I don't know.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Leg brace having obese listeners.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I'm not saying you're not worthy of being on a CW show.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I'm just saying that...

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I just wish that happened so early on in the show

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
so we could do this for the next 17 hours.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Yeah.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
One tree telepathic.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I didn't know.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It was like when Maury Povich realized

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
that you could just do paternity tests all the time.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yeah.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Now I just...

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Why isn't Harmontown just always like,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
okay, anybody got anything to say?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Is he lying?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It's just like somebody's like,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I think so!

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Fuck it!

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
It writes itself.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
The people...

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
So much more interesting than us,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
John, about Dolly Parton for two hours.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
But the thing is, that's amazing.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Like, we do a show in Hollywood

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
at the back room of a comic book store,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
and there's a team of people that come.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
We have our little Muppet show of regulars that come.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And it's a guy named Adam Goldberg

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
that certain people love and certain people don't love

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
and there's this and that.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
But like, you can come all the way up to Cobbs

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
and there's a fucking brand new Adam Goldberg.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
It's amazing.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
We don't have much time.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
We should probably go to the D&D

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
while we still have a little bit of daylight.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So, should I hand these out?

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Yeah, let's hand out the character sheets if we could.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
For those of you who are first timers to Harmontown,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Spencer is Dungeon Master extraordinaire.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Thank you.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Who has the noble and ignominious task

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
of trying to wrangle our drug and booze-addled brands

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
once a week trying to play the same campaign of D&D?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Last week was Super Bowl.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I was as drunk as I've been in Harmontown since last year

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
when I was here at the punchline.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Yeah, you were gone, man.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
No, no, I was fucking...

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I was Steamboat Willie, baby.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I was busy, MacTavish, and I really...

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I would read my notes from last week,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
but they're in Sanskrit.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Okay, so Joel, you're this character named Chris de Burgh.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Aside from being a rogue,

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
he also created the song Lady in Red.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Wow, these notes suck.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Fortunately, we have Spencer to recap for us

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
what happened last week.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Are you ready to go on that, Spencer?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Ready, ready.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yay, Spencer.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
When we last met,

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
our heroes had made with...

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
had made with Lenev.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Had met with Lenev.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
This is why you don't build stuff up, liar.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
No, you didn't!

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And then...

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
The skeleton man from Tormod Tour.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
On the way to the city, Lenev began explaining

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
the customs of the underworld

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
while Mulraine stabbed Quark for having too many hit points.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
After hearing a noise,

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Quark approached a battered hut,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
slaying its undead occupants

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
and violating their corpses.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Lenev led the gang into the broken city,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
passed the crumbling walls

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
and into the Forsaken Chapel.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
There they met the three bone sages of Tormod Tour,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
who revealed to our heroes

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
the location of the Pteragon of Virtue,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
high upon the Floating Isle of Paradise.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
With the Pteragon,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
they could finally heal Chris de Burgh of his possession.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
But before the gang could leave,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Lenev began...

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
began spitting and cussing,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
demanding that the party be brought to justice for their crimes.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
The bone sages didn't seem so enthusiastic about this,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
but decided to enact

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
the Rites of Televarna.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
But what were the Rites of Televarna?

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
And how could our party escape?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And what did it mean?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Is it some sort of name or something?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
A historical figure?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
No doubt, tonight.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
So you got all that, Joel?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Yeah.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Spencer, one quick thing.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
What's the thing?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
The Pteragon of Virtue is on the Floating Isle of Paradise,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
and they start invoking the Rites of what?

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Televarna.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Yeah, the bone sages, they're looking at you.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
They're looking at you, and they're saying,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
these Rites, these Rites of Televarna.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Televarna!

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Chains as black as night fire from the shadowy rafters,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
striking you in the chest,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and sending a cold, clammy pressure into your bodies.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
You feel claws gripping at your very soul,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
as dark energy envelopes you.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You see several silent figures hooded in black,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
filing into the church,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
standing around you in a circle.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Everyone in the church is also chained by these black chains.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I go into a barbarian rage,

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
and Russell try to get free of my chains.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Okay.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Flying into a barbarian rage,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
you attempt to extricate yourself from the shadowy chains.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I wonder what have fell off the table.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
You rip, you rip with all your might,

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
you rip out the chain,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
and with it, your soul.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Shit.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I put it back in.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Rookie mistake.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
With the black chains.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
As you rip the chain out of your body,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
you feel yourself die,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
but as you slump forward into the chain

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
that you ripped out of your body,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
your soul re-enters, and you feel yourself live.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Jesus Christ!

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Everybody, leave the chains until we figure out a better way.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
What's it, what happened?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Empower's there.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Did you fucking die?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
My soul was gone, I think.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I felt soulless.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
What was different?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000
130 people got a joke before I did.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Yeah.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I don't stab Mulraine.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Okay, so we're tethered with black

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Hellraiser chains that are tethered to our souls.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Yes.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Do I get experience points for restating that?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
No.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Hey, Christopher, how are you doing?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I'm doing great, and I'm wondering why we're in a church.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Because you've been possessed, Chris de Burgh,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
and we're trying to get the tarragon of virtue

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
which will release you from your possession.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
We're here to help you because you've been a real weirdo lately.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Should I do a different voice here?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Oh, I'm possessed.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I'm not just when I'm possessed.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I'm a kind of goofy fucker.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Oh, I'm possessed with fun.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Oh, I'm coming toward you and waddling around the room.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Oh, it's fun.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
This doesn't seem so bad.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
The voice is identical to my dad's tickle voice.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Oh, here it comes.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I yell to Lenev, Lenev, what the hell's going on?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Televarna.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
That's what's going on.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Hey, Lenev?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
When I get out of these chains,

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I'm going to fucking make your bones wish

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000
that their bones' bones were broken to fuck.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Wait, give me a second.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I'm threatening a skeleton.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I need to throw this to a room.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You're going to wish...

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I'm going to make your...

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Your marrow.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
They don't have muscles or meats.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I'm going to...

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I'm going to lick now.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Hey, Lenev, when I get out of this,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I'm going to lick you on your bones.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Oh.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I use my bluff,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
and I look to...

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Tup-tup, what's one of the...

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Torek...

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Tormite of Thor?

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
One of the skeletons.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
What's the skeleton? They're named the same name.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Tor or mod?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Tor.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Oh, that's right.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Second Tor.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I use bluff, and I look at Second Tor,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
and I say, ah, hey,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.000
it's me from that class.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
You're just trying to use, like,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Jonathan Silverman romantic comedy

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
pickup techniques on them?

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Ashley? Ashley from Roosevelt High?

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Hey, wow, you really...

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
You really stayed thin.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
This is so uncomfortable

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
because there's been a big mix-up.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
If you could just let this chain

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
grasp off my soul,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
we can have a party.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Roll it.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I did.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
The rites of Telemvarnah

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
cannot be shed so easily.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Telemvarnah!

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
What are the rites of Telemvarnah?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
It's this whole thing.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Um, hey, uh...

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Hey, Tor, Tor and mod.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And another Tor.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
They look over.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I'm not gonna pretend

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
that I know you guys,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
but I will double the offer

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
on the party

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
if you let these chains

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
off, if you know what I mean.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And I press my tongue

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
on the inside of my cheek

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
to simulate the head

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
of a dick.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And I explain to them that

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
if my hands were free,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I would take the left one

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
and encircle the hand

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
the width of a shaft

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
near the opening of my mouth

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
so that that can move it

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
in tandem with the tongue movement

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
so that the net result

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
was the appearance that I was

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
rubbing a dick

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
just washing my mouth with a dick

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
just rubbing a hard dick.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Johnny was a bird dog?

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
A bird dog.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
He really got it on with dudes.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
But I explain that to them verbally and I'm saying

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
like, if you let me go,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
like, I'm yours.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
He, uh...

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
They look at you and they're like, again,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
cannot be shed so easily.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Somebody explain to me the rites of

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Telemvarnah.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Telemvarnah shall watch over us all.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And may sinners be shackled

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
in darkness.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
The ceremony will begin soon.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Will the guilty party please step forward?

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Uh...

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I, I step forward.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Well, then.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
That's, that's literally never worked before.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Hey, guys.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I only deal with honesty.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And, uh, yeah, I'm guilty.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I'm guilty of wanting to have a party.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And I, I, I take my

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
stomach and I, I go back, like, I've been

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
hidden the stomach, but I do it in a way

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
that it's like a dick. I'm like, you can put

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
your dick in my belly.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Wait, what?

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Put your dick all the way in my belly.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I, like, gyrate

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
like there's a dick in my belly.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
And then I look to my friends and I

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
give them a question.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
You had to one up my mouth thing, I understand.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
There's only one thing bigger than a mouth

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and that's your whole stomach, yeah.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
And second tour, my belly button's

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
tight.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I mean, roll it.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Well, I'm Christy Berg and I wasn't here

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
tonight.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
You guys know that, like, boners aren't

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
really bones.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Oh.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Like, skeletons don't have dicks.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Well, I'm sure they have phantom dicks.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
By you saying that, we've achieved a connection

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
because you can tell that we're trying

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
to give you a boner.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
We never said that.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Oh, no, that was me, the dungeon master.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It's just been bothering me.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
What are you, backseat playing?

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
That's all like, yeah, kind of.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
So if you were playing,

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
you wouldn't try to give them a boner.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I mean, I...

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I mean, don't stop there. Tell us what you do.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I might try it once and then, you know,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
if it didn't work, I wouldn't try it again.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
That's not how you get boners, man.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Like, if people stopped

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
at the first attempt, the species

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
would be extinct.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Like, the first person that ever tried

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
to get a person to have a boner, like,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
used a leaf.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And it didn't work.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
They used two leaves and they got a boner,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
hence seven billion people.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Hey, Spencer, I'd be kind of offended

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
there's a man trying to train you in

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
on how to have a boner.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
That's what I'm saying. You don't use leaves.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
What are you talking about?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
That's my point, too. You're just making my point.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Statistically, someone in this room has a boner.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Liar!

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Jeremy's boner!

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
That's the only song

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
about a guy singing about another guy's dick.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Jeremy's boner.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Ha, ha, ha.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Oh, he has

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
a turgid goodness inside

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
the faggot of penis

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
to find it.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Tell him, Bruno,

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
burn sages.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
What is she accused of?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Penis flow.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
That part is rockin'

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
inside my prayers.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Oh, in the 90s

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
all you had to do

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
was eat the may.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
It'll sound

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
like you were saying,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
aw. Ha, ha, ha.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Singing about a boner.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I take my mighty great sword

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
and try to sever my chains.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Uh,

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
because this time I think it won't steal my soul.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Well, you steal my soul.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Just that sound of it.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
You sever the chain

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
and, uh,

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
yeah.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
You sever the chain and it just kind of

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
drops to the floor and evaporates.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
You see the end that's

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
on your side, shall we say?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
You're slowly disintegrating

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
towards your body.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
If you looked at it, it looks like it might take

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
about 10 minutes to finish dissolving.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
The guys just kind of look at you.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
They're like, I mean, I guess

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
you could do that.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
That's not a good idea.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I start running around in circles

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
nervously.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
All right, that happens.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Can I do something? Let me know when I can do something.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Anybody could do anything.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I want to reduce myself.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I want to reduce person.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
This is my go-to for getting out of...

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
That happens. You're smaller.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Yeah, so I get out of the chains.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
No.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
You're not like chained up.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
You have a chain going into your chest.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
It's like stabbing up in there.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Guys, I got a 10-minute fuse

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
that's going to steal my soul and it's like

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I'm a soul bomb right now.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I coughed to cover up

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
me saying that I was guilty

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
and I tried to cut off my chains with my sword.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I'm the guilty one.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
And then I tried to cut off my...

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
You don't quite have as much success

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
as Quark does.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
You clash into it.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I don't know what you do with chains.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
You slice into it, but it just plinks off.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
No, no, I'm possessed.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Can I read my chart

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
if I'm possessed?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Wait, read your chart?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
What says here I have the power

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
of sap?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Yeah, sap.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I think I'll use that.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
What do you want to use it on?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I'll squirt it on the skeleton.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
No, it's not like syrup.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
It's not like tree sap.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
You don't know that.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
It's a weapon.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
You just need to fall addicted to a lot of old tiny pranks.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Oh, excuse me.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I'm going to not use my weapon yet then.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
If it's not sap, I don't want to play.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
So...

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
All right, fuck you, gashes form.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Okay.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Gashes what?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
What do you say, gashes corn?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
All right, fuck you, gashes corn.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
No, gashes form.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I'm casting gashes form.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
You know, it turns me into like a fart.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
You do that.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
You become a gashes form.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
The one who cast it blasted.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Gashes.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
The chain is still going into your gashes form,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
and you see like a lighter glowing cloud

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
inside of your cloud.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
That's your soul, man!

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Chains, you got your soul, Jack!

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I'm running around because I have a ten-minute fuse

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
in my chest, and I start running looking for exits

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
or any sort of egress.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
For some reason, you can't seem to break

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
the barrier of standing hooded figures ringing you.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Oh, yeah.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I do a cleave flaming sword attack

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
through the hooded figures around me.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
All right.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
If your sword cuts them at all,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
it doesn't seem to have any effect.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
It slices through it as easily as if they were

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
a gashes form.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
It's embarrassing.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Guys who run along, we got to bring us into the station.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Mod speaks up, Mod speaks up.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Now tell him Varna's happening.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I already said that.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
You must elect a defendant.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Me.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I'm the defendant.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Do it.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
It's not like a defendant in the other

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
usage of the terms.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
It's more like a

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
defense attorney, really.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I defend myself.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
All right.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
If you shall be the defendant,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
then tell him Varna shall continue.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Varna shall continue.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Wait, why are you telling me what to say?

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I wasn't.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I am the defendant,

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
and I defend myself.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I am the guilty party.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Prepare your case, then.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
All right.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I don't know.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
What is my crime?

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
That's not how this works.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Okay.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Well, okay.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I'm still just running around stabbing gaseous people

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
around the room.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Still not doing anything.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I put cardboard paper

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
in Leviticus's head.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Leviticus?

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
And boy, what a mistake.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Levern deserved more.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I have a horse.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Jesus.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And I will do

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
anything to protect this crew.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
We are on a journey searching

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
something.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And I

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
went, sorry?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Own it.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I apologize.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I'm on my way to murder the shadow

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
in the crowd.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Wow.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I shall not apologize.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
My mother was a balloon.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I love popsicles.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Let's have a party.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'll go underground.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I wrote him a pull of chains out of her chest.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
As hard as I can, I pull her chains out.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I put my bag of nuts in her mouth.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I have an actual bag of nuts.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Can I cast mirror image?

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
And so there's another version of me

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
and the other side of the room.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
There's four more versions of you.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
But one of them steps forward and says,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
all right, that will do.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I think they've learned their lesson.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
And then we all wink and then we all jump in the air

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
and high five.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Set them free and let's proceed.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
You say those things.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
But, yeah.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I start swallowing my rope.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I use one of my other mirror image guys

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
to go like, don't believe him.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And then the guy he's talking about

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
goes like, fuck you.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And he's like, no, fuck you.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
And the other guy goes like, I hate skeletons.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And I go, fuck a dash, boogabosh.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
And the other one just goes away.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And I go like, you're welcome.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Now.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Now that I've taken care of your enemy,

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
the guy that hates skeletons.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
And I look at second tour

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
and I open my eyes real wide

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
and I say, cashew.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Cashew.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
And then I take a little nap.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
All right, what's the result of all that?

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Come on.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
The first tour, he looks on you

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
with kindness, but the other two

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
are very clearly not buying this.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Why?

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Why?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Like, Doug Benson is backstage.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I had a ten o'clock show.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
No, Doug Benson is backstage going, yeah, I get it.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
He's the only one.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
The...

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Big closing monologue by Sharpie

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
to end the show.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
No pressure. These shackles

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
fastened my wrists

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
and these chains

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
go into my soul.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
But there's something more

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
powerful than wrists.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
More valuable than souls.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And I refuse to tell

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
you what it is.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Because usually

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
when someone talks about something

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
more valuable,

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
it usually comes down to

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
something like the soul.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
But in this case...

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And it's...

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
one in the shit

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
two in the pits.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
No, don't end up that.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I tried to force an ending.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Well...

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
You prompted him for a monologue.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Does zero to four damage?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Avenger, attack!

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Scram!

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I have a hawk.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
What's the attacking?

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Patriotism.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
It hits.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Patriotism takes seven damage.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
How much more time do I have on the fuse in my chest?

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Like nine...

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
A lot. Most of the time.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Okay.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Come on, Harmon.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Can you speed it up?

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Can you make it like two minutes?

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Because I've lost my mind,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I pick up my sword and I stab myself in the throat.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Yeah, I'm gonna off myself too.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Cliffhanger!

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Thank you, everybody.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
All right.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Thank you so much, San Francisco.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Thank you, San Francisco.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
That was one doozy of a show.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I want to thank Jeremy for coming up.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Eva for making things the most complicated

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
and wonderful of all time.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Spencer Crittenden, Erin McGathy, everybody.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Our good friend, Joel Hodgson.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Come to my show.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Riffing myself a new one at the Brava Theater

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
tomorrow night, everybody.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Yeah, go to Joel's show.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
And thanks to those two kids that brought me

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
the little tiny bottle of Kettle One.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
That was nice of them.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I can't remember their names.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Oh, is that you guys? Thank you.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Thank you all. You guys are wonderful.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Let's go find a nice place to have a drink

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
and convene with one another, shall we?

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
All right.
