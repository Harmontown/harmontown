WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
Hello gang, how are y'all doing?

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Tasting, tasting, one, two, three from MacArthur Park where it's still melting in the dark

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
Parliament Town is now in session

00:40.000 --> 00:54.000
Spencer Crittenden, would you please join us on stage, the Game Master extraordinaire

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
So let's bring out the Mayor of Parliament Town, Dan Harvett

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
Hip to the hop, never stop, saw your mama on a raft on a lake

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Saw your mama for goodness sake, saw your mama going up and down

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Saw your mama dancing in a sprinkler shape like a clown

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
She got wet, I laid down a hundred dollar bet that she couldn't swim in the water coming out

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Fuck it so hard, in the mouth, okay gross, gross

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Okay stop, we go until we get gross, that's the new rule, I like that

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Did you win the bet?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yes

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh okay

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Also, who was the other person on the other end of that hundred dollar bet?

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
I have all the same questions you do

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I only have one item in my notepad

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Oh yeah

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
But we've got a great guest who's very provocative and wonderful to talk to

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
So you don't want me to have more in my notepad

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
But I already texted Jeff about this today, look

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Okay we have so many questions I have about this

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
But you know I texted you his whole monologue so don't

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
So you know to let me get to the all the way to the end and then we can all discuss

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I want you to lay it down as you found it

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
So I will admit and I don't do this all the time

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
It was just kind of a weird impulse I had, like life's going good

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
And I left my new home and I knew the work I had to do

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I knew how long I had to do it and I was kind of like

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I was like I'm gonna stop at this bar

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And it's 1130am and I'm gonna have one before work

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And I'm not usually that guy, I don't judge those guys

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Your name is Cliff Clavin

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And I wouldn't be embarrassed if I was that guy

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
But I was like I'm gonna give this a try and also I'm in a new neighborhood

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
So I wanted to see what is the new neighborhoods bar like at 1130am

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Well I'm not going back because it's fucking packed

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
It's like a Friday night for them because it's a different

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
The drawing room I'm really learning is something incredibly special

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
So I'll probably be making the trek to continue to drink there when I'm in that day drinking mood

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Because this was like a TGI Fridays

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But there was this guy, well I had my one drink

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
I just eavesdropped and I heard a monologue from a guy

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
That made me finish my drink very quickly

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Settle up in cash and fast walk to my car

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
So I could finish transcribing it without him knowing I was writing down everything

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And you sent me and Dino a group text

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
And we had a conversation about it which I'm glad for

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Because you would be cutting me off every five words if I just read this

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
You'd be like wait a minute

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
But this is what I texted my two friends

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Dan has two friends

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
I just ran out to the car and I didn't stand a chance of not getting this all verbatim

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Now I am going to do this in his authentic patois

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
He was a six foot five-ish African-American man

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
So I'm going to, you know, it wasn't like, look

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
If we've learned nothing else this week

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
We've learned to ask what's racist

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
But I just want to be authentic because it's more the working class nature of his ranch

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You're doing a authentic

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I'm not going to pretend he's from Jersey

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
But I'm not going to be like the crows in Dumbo

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I'm not doing a thing

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I don't think it's funny that he talks the way he does

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I just want you to understand

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
This is a working class monologue from a very specific archetype

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
What age are we talking?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I would put him at 55, 60

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
55, 6 foot 4 black gentleman

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
And he is at the bar next to you

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
He was holding court for sure

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
And I could tell you some politically incriminating shit that he said before this

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
But I don't want to put him in one category or another

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
I just found this monologue so fucking fascinating in a vacuum

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
I think just start with the narrative and then we can go back to that if we need to

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay, so I'm going to try to do this very tastefully

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
But I'm also going to try to do it authentically

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Which is how every tasteful story starts

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm going to try to be tasteful

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Okay

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Lou Diamond Phillips, okay

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Lou Diamond Phillips

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
He parked 3 feet from the curb

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
You know what I'm saying?

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
36 inches

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
So I'm writing the ticket

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
And he comes out, what are you doing? Why are you giving me a ticket?

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
I said, sir, the law is your car needs to be a minimum of 18 inches from the curb

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
He says, oh that's bullshit, that's bullshit

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
You know, so I said, okay, I'll make you a deal

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You can take the ticket

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Or I can call a tow truck

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And you know it's going to be much more expensive

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
And then his wife comes out and she was much more subtle

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
More kind

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
So I eventually said, okay, I'm not going to call the tow truck

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Because I like Lou Diamond Phillips

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
You know what I'm saying? I like his movies

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
But he came out like an asshole

06:39.000 --> 06:49.000
And all I'm saying is, so what makes his job more exalted than mine?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
He can do his job, but I can't do mine

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Why is that? And I ran from the bar

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
After waiting, I was going to wait

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I was like, I'm like thumb nailing notes

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
But he quieted, he simmered down

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Because the people he was holding court with, they were all like, I don't know

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I don't know, Todd, you're fun to listen to

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
But I don't know what you want us to say

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Is he the hero of that story?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Or for him, he certainly is

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
I think he's the absolute villain

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Just think about the conversation you and I had

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
I absolutely 100% side with Lou Diamond Phillips in this story

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I would first answer this man's question

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Not that I would have wanted any beef with him

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
But the answer to his rhetorical question is

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
The reason Lou Diamond Phillips can do his job and you can't do yours is

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Because his job is to make people happy and yours is to make people sad

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And that's no fault of yours, but not accepting that is weird

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Why does Lou Diamond Phillips get to be celebrated?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
He's a celebrity

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Was there no contrition on Lou Diamond Phillips' part about parking

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
A foot farther away from the curb than he's supposed to

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
This is the only narrative you're going to get

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Here's the quotes from Lou Diamond Phillips

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
He said it's bullshit

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
And he heard the reason, he's like, it's bullshit

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
That's what we got and we know his wife was very supple and smooth

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And she got him out of the tow truck

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
But it sounds like Lou Diamond Phillips

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Like any person that parks three feet from the curb

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Which I do want to be a law

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Because that is 36 inches and that is extreme

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
It sounds like he had to pay the same ticket

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
That a garbage man or a parking enforcement officer off duty would have to pay

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
It doesn't sound like he'd actually cut away with anything

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
It in fact kind of sounds, from my perspective, assuming this was 20 years ago

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Or this guy is the biggest Lou Diamond Phillips fan in the world

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
That the only difference between Lou Diamond Phillips and a parking enforcement officer

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Or a normal person getting a parking ticket is that because he's famous

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
This guy has been telling this story for 20 years

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Whereas otherwise it wouldn't have been a big deal

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I hope it was like yesterday or within the last week

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
It has to be recent

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Then that guy's got to be...

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
And here's my one other thought about answering his rhetorical question

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
The other reason he can do his job and you can't do yours

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Is because God gave you and Lou Diamond Phillips

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Both one chance at coping with Lou Diamond Phillips' fame

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And you're blowing it

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
And Lou Diamond Phillips has made a lot of movies that I know you haven't seen

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
You didn't see bats in the theater, I did

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I know Lou Diamond Phillips is good

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Have you guys seen bats?

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Everybody right now, in your mind, name four Lou Diamond Phillips films

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
And you only get one Young Guns

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I actually forgot Young Guns

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
And I was like for sure LaBamba, he must be thinking about LaBamba

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
But you had a very good point, like Young Guns

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Your theory on it was he went into law enforcement because of Young Guns

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, because Lou Diamond Phillips is his...

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
The reason why he started to go into law enforcement

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Is because Lou Diamond Phillips

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Who is the kind of representative of stoic morality

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
And then he meets Lou Diamond Phillips

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Who's parked too far away from the curve

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
He's like I wanted to be the Young Gun of parking enforcement or the LAPD

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
No, he wanted to be in the FBI

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
He wanted to be another thing

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
You don't go into parking enforcement because that was your end game

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
That was your thing

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
I just wonder how many people weren't assholes that come across him doing his job

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
His job is to really reign on people's parade

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And that's not his fault

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
What if Lou Diamond Bamba was just on a bad day?

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I call him Lou Diamond Bamba because there was an MTV interview

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
On MTV a long time ago, what's the worst soundtrack you ever heard?

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
And he goes, what's the worst moment in movie history?

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
And they asked a guy in New York who was from Brooklyn

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
He goes, it's when that Lou Diamond Bamba comes out and he goes, you know what?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
You're alright

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
But he called him Lou Diamond Bamba

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
That was one of the thoughts I had as I got into the car

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
I was like, wait a minute, you never changed your middle name to parking enforcement, I bet

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
That's a safe bet

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
Obviously at some point Lou Diamond Phillips or his parents decided he was destined for success

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
The story of the thing that you ever heard

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
There was a guy at a bar talking about being a parking enforcement official

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And Lou Diamond Bamba was being an asshole

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Was Lou Diamond Bamba on a bad day?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Well, yeah, I don't know

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
That's a question for him, yeah, for sure

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I mean, who knows?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
When do you park three feet from a curb?

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Is it because you think that's within your right to do so?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Or is it because he was with his wife?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Maybe she was...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
We don't know, they could have been outside a hospital

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm not trying to...

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
But then you said the guy was...

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Victim blame

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Then you said the victim being a guy who didn't enjoy writing a ticket

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
But the guy was at the bar, then he was watching TV and he called women bitches for...

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I already knew the guy was like...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It's a thing that's like...

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I interpreted everything he was saying as like a projection of...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
You know, this is the thing

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It's like people thinking...

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
This is why I tend to side with the celebrities

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I tend to side with the publicly shamed

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I tend to side with the visible

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
Because I think that people tend to project onto luminaries

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
This like privilege that may be partially true

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
I mean, I'm not being like a fucking pure apologist and going...

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Oh boy, the actors go to their job and they just work so hard

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
It's harder than coal mining

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm not implying that

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I will say it's a very hard fucking job

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
I should know, I have fucking worked actors very hard

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I've driven them to the brink

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And then I've said, with a Kubrickian flair

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Great, now put film in the camera

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Because I needed that

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
From Danny Pootie in that moment

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
And you loved it, and that's why you're here

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
I know somebody that ran into Keanu Reeves on a bad day

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Keanu Reeves was being like, surly

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
And he's like, fuck Keanu Reeves, he was a fucking asshole

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
You ask anybody else? Keanu Reeves, super cool

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
But you can't get one pass if you're a famous person

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Because if you have a bad moment with somebody, then that's your thing

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
I just kind of bristle at that culture of like, go...

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
It's that Dire Straits video refrigerator guy

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Like, look at that faggot, he's got his own airplane

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
He must be doing something right

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
And it's like, because in that monologue, the guy says

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
And I like...

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
What do you mean you like Lou Timewood Phillips?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Why don't you hate him now?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Is it because you think that...

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Obviously, you believe that he won the lottery

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
He didn't earn anything, otherwise you wouldn't be asking the question

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Why is his job so much more exalted?

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
You're implying that he's the recipient of pure, undeserved privilege

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
At the same time as you're saying like, and I like him

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
That's the thing, which is a very familiar thing to me

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It rings this bell in me where I'm like, ugh

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
You know, every interaction you have with somebody who's just a little bit off in there

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Like, oh, your girlfriend's tits or whatever

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And you go like, hey, why don't you go fuck yourself?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
And they're like, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
You write Rick and Morty, why don't you fucking learn?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
You're rich, aren't you swimming in a pool full of money?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Why don't you fucking learn to take a joke?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
And it's like, there's something off here with this relationship

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And it's coming from a projection on the part of someone who's asking themselves

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
What would I do if I were Keanu Reeves?

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
And if their answer is dark enough, Keanu Reeves is guilty of those crimes

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
And I think that's like a very fundamentally wrong

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Can you conjure up a memory of when you think that you might have misbehaved

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And that's going to color somebody's memory of...

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Oh, I'm sure it's all the time

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
As much as I love it when people interact with me

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
What can I ever do?

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I'm not a good person, I'm not a pleasant person to be around

15:37.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm also not an actor, so I never consider it my job to be like publicly fucking digestible

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
No, but you are

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
You're not as efficient for that, but thank you

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
No, I'm just saying, if somebody were to know who I was

15:54.000 --> 16:03.000
And if somebody were to know who I was and on top of that by whatever coincidence

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
Their fault or not their fault, I'm not getting a perfect fucking...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I didn't get a drink for an hour or whatever

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't know, like they might end up with a story about something I said that was kind of like dickish

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Spencer, when we did the Harmon Tour documentary thing

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
We watched you go through your first on camera

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I'm a person that people want to meet

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
And you were kind of mistrustful or...

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
Going through the scrutiny of strangers liking you for either some reason or no reason or whatever

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
That's right, Jeff

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
We'll be right back

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
I remember there's this story where we were doing the up fronts

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
Remember when we did the CISO thing at New York or whatever, it was that terrible terrible

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
We played with the love makers or whatever

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
We did a test of Harmon Quest or something, it was a fucking nightmare

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
Afterwards, there was someone who was backstage that was a fan or something

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
That was like, hey, great show, that was literally the worst experience, the worst show I've ever done

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
And I just remember giving that guy the cold shoulder and I just carried that with me

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm like, you can't treat people like that, you can't talk to fans

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I wasn't like, go fuck yourself or whatever

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
But I think that if someone had that interaction, they would be all like, oh, that was kind of a bummer

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And so anytime I interact with fans, I think of that

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
And it's like, well, I never want to do that again

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
And you know what? I found out pretty recently that that fan wasn't a fan at all

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It was Tom Sharpling

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
And so I feel really, really shitty about it now

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Wait, who's that?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I thought you'd feel better

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
No, because like that's like, I don't know, that's like if you were like, oh, and it turned out I like mouthed off to, you know, Keanu Reeves or something

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Oh, because you were right

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
And when you say not a fan, you don't mean dislikes

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
No, but I just thought it was some random fan

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
But then someone else that you would admire and whose opinion would matter a lot to you

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Right, or just like, it's like if one person just had one bad interaction with me

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
And they just, you know, they told that story, that's one thing

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
But if it's like, oh, there's this guy who could potentially, you know, talk about me in circles or something like that

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
I learned a long time ago like, you walk off stage and you have, you thought you had a shitty show

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Oh, I did

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
And then somebody comes up to you and goes, I would love that show

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
You really shouldn't say, no, that show sucked, you're wrong

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
You just say thank you

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
And because if they had a good time, like the, but what if they're lying?

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
If they walk up and say that, then they're a liar

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
But if they're saying that and they mean it, like you just walk away and say thank you

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
But I also think you, yeah, you never deflect a compliment

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Like, which means just like, you're wrong, what you just said is wrong

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
You have bad taste in experiences and people

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
But you don't, you don't have to do the opposite of that

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Which is like, for me, oh my god, thank you

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
You could, I've come to go, I was told to stop doing that

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
And I went from doing that to just going like, thank you so much, that's really nice of you to say

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
I thought I did horribly, so that's great, you're helping me by feeling that way

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
And then they'll go, no, I thought it was great, I was like, well, jeez, maybe it was great

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Thank you for saying that, you're helping me out

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Some of the worst shows I've ever done got the most praise

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And I don't know why people said that, but

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Oh, because they're idiots, they don't know

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Right, they get off their tractors and they're like yippie-de-doop-a-doo

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Oh, I'm gonna go see a famous person

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
Oh boy, but they're nailing it, I wouldn't know, I got a marble for a brain

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Just kidding, I'm kidding

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
That's what that guy thinks Lou Diamond Phillips thinks when he gets in his car

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
He thinks that's why Lou Diamond Phillips parked that far from the curb

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
He's like, who's gonna give me a ticket, some marble brain?

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
I was in Young Guns, that's not what Lou Diamond Phillips was thinking

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
And you said to me in the text, because you were inflamed about this, you said

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
I wasn't inflamed, I was having fun taking Lou Diamond's Phillips side

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
You were excited, and you said, ask that guy to name two other movies beside LaBamba

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
That Lou Diamond Phillips, he wouldn't be able to do it

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
He might've got two

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
But I actually forgot Young Guns, which is interesting

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
Because I was actually thinking of Lou Diamond Phillips as kind of like LaBamba

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
And then made the most of like, been in a dozen movies that are just hard to recall

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Like 1997's Bats, which is fucking amazing, and he's great in it

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
That's peeked Phillips

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
See Bats, it's a horror movie

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
If you were to dare that guy to name two more movies beside LaBamba

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
He could've gone Young Guns and Young Guns 2, and you would've been out a hundred bucks

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Alright, our next guest

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
What if it was Lou Diamond Phillips?

21:08.000 --> 21:15.000
If we were a proper podcast, this whole thing would've been a tee-up to bring out

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Lou Diamond Bamba and the whole crowd would've gone fucking berserk

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
If I deserved my podcast pulpit, I would also have the parking enforcement guy out

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
And I would do some real fucking work, like the guy that does heavyweight for gimlet media

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
There's people out there doing real work, I don't know why I continue to advertise space

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I think we have the juice to get Lou Diamond Phillips on the show

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Well, don't insult him

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
No, I...

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Or you won't get him on

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I'm insulting our audience

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Alright, so our guest tonight has been a guest before

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I believe he was a guest last time on the days

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
It better be Lou Diamond fucking Phillips

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
There really wasn't an audience, but I gotta say

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
If I had to name three man crush occupations

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
There was the guy I met who was an Irish firefighter

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Who I'm like, jeez, they fight that too?

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
It's a little racist, but I used to think I was Irish before I sent my spin into a fucking computer

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
I'm pretty sure that's the definition of racism

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Still, though, for all I knew I was Irish

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
You don't think other cultures fight fires?

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
I just... look, when I engage in the stereotype of the Irish being fighty

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
I mean, it's the same as them being poets and singers

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I'm like, oh, I got hearts in my eyes

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I want to be Irish so bad

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And then to be a firefighter, an Irish firefighter

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I'm just saying

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
In your mind, you think Irish... it's the little leprechaun guy

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Actually, you're like fist fighting a fire

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
No, I think it's a fucking badass dude that's like

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, well, you think you love me, but you don't

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Get up off the floor now

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
I'm going to sing a song with me fists

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
They're beautiful people, they're super natural

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Their cereal has magical...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
No, stop it

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
See, that shit's offensive, but anyways

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Can we please, our guest is waiting in the wings

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
This is the... I don't know what the third man crush occupation would be

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
But as far as two-word occupations, this is right there

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Who knows if it's number one or number two?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
After Irish firefighter

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Or before, I'm not sure

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Please welcome Conflict Journalist

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Fucking come on

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Put your dicks down

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
And lift your pants back up for Rob Evans

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Rob Evans?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
What up, Rob?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Well, Dan answered my question as to whether or not

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I was going to try a really offensive Irish accent

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
As soon as I got out on stage, so I don't have to now

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Thank you for that

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Have you been to Ireland and you're Conflict Journaling?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
No, not for Conflict

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Fires? No

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
See, I don't think so

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Are you ethnically descended from the Irish people?

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Not at all, but I can sing every word of come out you black and tans

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Do you really want to sing with him?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
He does, but don't take that as anything

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
What's the song?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Come out you black and tans

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
It's an old IRA song about beating up British paramilitaries

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
In the streets of Dublin

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Give us the fresh refrain of that

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Come out you black and tans

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Come out and fight me like a man

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Show your wife how you won medals out in Flanders

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
Tell her how the IRA made you run like hell away

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
From the green and lovely lakes of Kiloshan Drill

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Wow

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So the first couple rhymes you're thinking

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Oh shit, this is racist

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And then you're like, oh no, he likes the black and tans

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
No, what? No

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
No, is it?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
He wants to fight him

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
No, I thought he admired them and wanted them to fight with him

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
He wants to beat the shit out of them

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
He wants to beat up the black and tans

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
It's a drunken Irish militant being like

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Oh, you won medals in World War I, you fucking pawns

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Come out and fight me, I'll beat you up

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Oh

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah, that's what the song is about

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
But is the black and tans his veterans?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It's referencing a uniform, not a skin

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
It is a uniform, not a skin color

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
No, no, no, no, no, not a skin color

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Everyone was very white

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Right

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
So it's fine

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Right

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That's when you grow up in a country like Ireland

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
You have to, it's like

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
The pigmentation of your clothes has got me in a fucking xenophobic rage

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
They did kind of invent that, right?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
It's like, is that an orange band around your arm?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
All right, sorry if you're Irish, do not attack

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
These people can beat up fire

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I do not want to cross them

25:49.000 --> 25:56.000
But you go everywhere where I would never want to cross

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
You just got back from Syria by way of Mexico or?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
No, no, I was just there for a wedding

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
You went to, oh, Mexico was a wedding

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Yeah, yeah, that was just for fun

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Syria was for work

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Yeah, we went in by Iraq

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
And you gave me a little thumbnail of what you were doing out there

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Which I thought was really interesting

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
The precursor being that you're kind of a, you're freelance

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Right, because you don't, like you said, the big news organizations

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
They don't send you to the Middle East

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
Unless you're going to do a story that fits in a, you're doing ISIS stories

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Yeah, yeah, it's hard to get a big paper to pay for you to go out to Syria

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Because it's very expensive

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
They usually want you to travel with security

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Which kind of bollocks is everything up

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I imagine they have to insure the hell out of you

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Yeah, like it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars pretty easily

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
For like even just a single reporter in there for a couple of weeks

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
So you're freelancing and you're selling your stories to different media outlets?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I don't have to do that anymore

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
So I got, I do a couple of podcasts for iHeartRadio

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Behind the Bastards is like the big one

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And so like that's my regular job

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I got the one fan whistling somewhere

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And these are the stuff, stuff, stuff

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
How stuff gets made, stuff they don't like to know

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Yeah, they got acquired by a series of companies

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
And that's the way things work, I guess

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Are you a print or a photo or both?

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
I do print and I do podcasts, like online and stuff

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
So like, I just raised a bunch of money from my fans

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
I just asked people, like I said, I'll write this audio book

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
About how right wing terrorism works in the United States

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
And this sort of plot started in the 1980s

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
To create like a network of stochastic, randomly organized terrorists

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
To carry out attacks to stabilize the country

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
How this all like came together

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And I'll write that and I'll put it out for you

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
If you guys raise a bunch of money from me

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So that I can go to Syria and check it out

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
Crowd sourced journalism by gum

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
What brand of gum?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
It's both an amazing thing and also a sad testament

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
To the state of journalism

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Quit dodging the question

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
What are you gonna do?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
What brand of gum?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
It'd better fucking be Big League 2

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
You're damn right, Big League 2

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
So was this a crowd sourced affair?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Like what you were, the story you were doing out there

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
So tell us about this, this is like

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Okay, so this is like, there's a complicated story

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And it's hard to tell like how far back to go

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
When trying to explain this

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Like the short, if I'm like pitching this on an elevator is

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
There's like a quasi anarchist feminist revolution

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
In northern Syria

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
And they're sort of the folks who did most of the fighting

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
To beat ISIS

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
And so we were hanging out with these people

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And like talking with them about how their system works

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
And like watching this sort of thing develop

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
And that's like the short pitch

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
When you say anarchist, you mean like proper old school

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Like political anarchism

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Like not anarchic

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Where people think that word doesn't mean anything

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
This is where we get into the longer explanation of it

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And the longer explanation is that there is this

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Turkish Kurdish terrorist named Abdullah Ajalan

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Who is like an absolute terrorist

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Killed a shitload of innocent people back in the day

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And then in the late 90s, he gets arrested by the United States

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
In I think Kenya

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And there was another country involved too

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Anyway, he's been in an island prison in Turkey this whole time

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Like for the last 20 years or so

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
And in the last 20 years, he's sort of like moderated

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And he's just done a bunch of reading

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And he came upon an American anarchist philosopher

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Named Murray Bookchin

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And he started writing stuff where he's like

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Oh shit, I was wrong

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Number one, I was wrong to be a Marxist-Leninist

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Number two, the kind of terrorism I was advocating isn't okay

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
And if we're going to actually reform society

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
In a way that fixes things like I wanted to fix them

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Rather than just trying to overthrow the government

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
And institute our own

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
We need to actually overthrow the systems of oppression

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
That are at the basis of all authoritarianism

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Which is the domination of women by men

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
And so we need to fundamentally reorganize society

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
In order to fix the gender imbalance if we're going to fix anything

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
And due to a series of like weird flukes of history

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
The terrorist group that this guy is the figurehead of

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Wound up being the most powerful force in northern Syria

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
When ISIS was on the march

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
And they formed a couple of little subsidiary groups

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
That then took on a life of their own

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
And got US air support and backing

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
And they beat ISIS

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
And now they're in control of a region of about 4 million people

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
And so for the last couple of years

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
That there's been like

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Okay, well we have all of this political theory

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
This guy's been writing

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And now we're in charge

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
We should see if it works

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And it kind of seems like it does

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
But are they being like proper anarchists

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Like Paris Commune

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And like Mikhail Bakunin

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And Kropotkin and Emma Goldman and all that

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
I would call them anarchist inspired in certain areas

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Another way I've heard it

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I just a journalist today was telling me

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
He thinks it's his opinion of Rojava

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Which is what the region is called

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Is the world's most effective direct democracy

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Governed by an authoritarian system

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So you've got the military

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Which is central in a lot of aspects

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Because they need to defend this region

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Both from the Assad regime

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Which are assholes

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And from the Turkish government

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Which are also not very nice

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Particularly since it's a Kurdish-led liberation struggle

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
So they're in charge of a significant amount

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Of what goes on there

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
But not on the civil side

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Are they anarchists in the proper sense

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Where it's really like a true democratic

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Like anti-rule

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Where everybody decides their own fate

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
And stuff like that

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Somewhat, there's a lot of that in there

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So it's bottom-up political organization

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
And so they have communes on the lower level of thing

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Where different neighborhoods

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Every neighborhood will have sort of a direct democracy

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Where they vote for representatives of the neighborhood

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Which represent them at the city level

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Which represents the city at the Canton level

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Which is roughly analogous to a state

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
And it builds up from there

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
One of the rules they have is that

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
When they elect representatives

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
They'd never just elect one representative

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
So you don't just have a president

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
In charge of food production

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
You have two presidents

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
And they're always a man and a woman

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
And the idea is that

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
You should never have just a man

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Or just a woman in charge of anything

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It should be both simultaneously

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And they have to come to an accord personally

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
About what they're going to do

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Before anything could be done

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
And this is law throughout...

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Yeah, Rojava

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Wow

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
About four million people living under this right now

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Yeah

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Historically, what's going to happen is that

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Both other sides are going to come back in

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
And they will absolutely squash them

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Because they don't...

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
The threat of actual democracy breaks out

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
They get murdered

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
They get absolutely hammered

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
And it's...

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
You can see that in the offing all around it

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
So most of where we were

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Was within a mile or two of the Turkish border

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Like I had cell reception through Turkish cell networks

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
The whole time I was there

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
And you can see the military forces there

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
The YPG and the YPJ are building hundreds of miles of tunnels

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Underneath everything

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
There are Turkish forces to invade

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
And there's this gigantic border wall

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
That the Turks have built

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
That's like 20 feet tall

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
And topped with concertina wire

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And guard towers behind it

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
And every day we were there

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
The president of Turkey would send out another threat

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Saying, like, I'm going to wipe these people out

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
Like, if we don't get this exclusion zone we want

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
If the US doesn't pull back

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
I'm just going to invade

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
And, like, we'll see what happens

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
And he's been throwing threats out like that

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Out for a while

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
And the Assad regime is still in control

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Of most of Syria at this point

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
And, like, to the extent that there's one city

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Where they share joint control of

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
And we were, like, three feet away from the Assad regime

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And there's, like, statues of Bashar al-Assad

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And his troops glowering at you on one side

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
And then there's, like, the YPG on the other side

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
And it's very tense in some places

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
But then you'd travel, like, five miles back

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And you'd be, like, sitting at this, like, local council meeting

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Where it's just, like, a bunch of old women

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
In their 60s and 70s

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Talking about how they're handling, like

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
They don't have cops to deal with stuff like

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
Domestic disturbances and, like, that sort of thing

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Like civil law enforcement

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Is all done by an elected commune

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Of, like, people in the town

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Who just, like, go door-to-door

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
And there's, like, a fight or something

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
And you want to counsel it out

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
And that's your anarchy, functionally

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Because it's because people need not be governed

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Necessarily

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
They can figure shit out

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
They're kind of designed for it

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
There's usually better at it

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Yeah

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Um, I got a bookmark

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
That it's amazing to me

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
How some thoughts are

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Have so much power because this guy who was a

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
Warlord, autocratic, terrorist-minded guy

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Spent time in prison and then had that realization

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Is, like, reaching me

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Who's, like, a renowned woke Westerner

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Um, like, where I'm going, like,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Holy shit, yeah, that's a really good fundamental point

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
That misogyny is the atomic unit of autocracy

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Like, that's what he's saying

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Is, like, you can't go into an honest conversation

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
About whether or not mankind need be governed

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Um, when you're walking into that

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
When you're governing half of the species

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Yeah

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
When you were socialized to, like, get innervated

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
By any discussion that you think is not political

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
About whether or not Becky should be acting

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
The way she's acting

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
One of the really interesting things out there

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Because we talk to hundreds and hundreds of people

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
Um, and we spent time at a military training base

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
For the YPJ, which is the All Women's Militia

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
So all of society in Rojava

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
All women's militia

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
In Syria

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I've got some pictures, yeah

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
That's awesome

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah, so all of society, there's two chunks

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
There's general society, which is male and female

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
And should be as close to a 50-50 mix as possible

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
That's the goal

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
And then there's usually a women's auxiliary area

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Because they understand that, like, this is fucking Syria

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Like, shit's been really rough for women here

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
For a long time

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
And we need all women's groups

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
So that these, like, members

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Like, women who've been members of tribes

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Where, like, there hasn't been any representation

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Of women for a very long time

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Can kind of learn the ropes of speaking for themselves

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Without having to be, like, making decisions

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
In the same room as some, like, older man

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Who's just going to kind of walk all over them

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
So you have an all-female auxiliary army?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Yeah, you want to see pictures?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Yes

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Okay, let's see, I got it on the back here

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I mean, like, we have to have conversations

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Outside of writers' rooms

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
About how being conscious of, like,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Women being socialized to bear interruption

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
More than men are socialized to not interrupt

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
And, like, I can't even begin to...

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
That's in a rich first-world empire

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
I had a weird experience sitting on the floor

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Drinking coffee with these young women

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
Talking about how they have to avoid fake male feminists

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And how, like, yeah, there's guys in here

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That will say all the right things when you interview them

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
He's sitting right next to you up

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
He's sitting right next to you

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
We call it virtue signaling

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Like, they didn't use that word

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
But they were like, a lot of these guys

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
They talk the talk, but, like, you know

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
That they don't really believe

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And if things were to change society

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Societally, they would go back to the way things were

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
And my fixer, who's this wonderful woman,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
One of the most incredible people I've ever met

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
When you say fixer, you mean what?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Fixer is the person who leads you around

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
They usually interpret, they translate, they get you access

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Do you speak the local dialect?

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
I speak a little bit of Serani

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Enough to, like, get by

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Which is the Iraqi Kurdish dialect

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Which is the Syrian Kurdish dialect is garbage

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
And I barely know pleasantries

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
You have a handler that's taking you around

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Yeah, you usually do it in a war zone

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
And as much as, like, you need someone to, like, drive for you

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Which was, in our case, this dude Alon

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Who has nothing to do with anarchism or feminism

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
But the love this man had for cigarettes

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Was pure and beautiful

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
Like, I've never seen a man enjoy terrible cigarettes

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
As much as Alon

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
He would just smile at us with, like, this

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
He usually worked with women

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Because our fixer usually would only work with female journalists

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
These women are, like, Capri 100s

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
No, they just won't smoke

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Because they're, like, from New York or whatever

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
And, like, they don't like it

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Oh, okay

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
And he was working with, like, two men

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
And neither of us are regular smokers

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
But we were willing to humor him

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
So we wound up smoking, like, three packs a day

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Just to make Alon happy

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Because the joy on his face was so pure

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
But they were crap cigarettes?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Oh, they're garbage

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
The world sends its worst cigarettes to Syria

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
And we put it in English on the pack

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
There's no warnings on the packs

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Like, that's how bad the cigarettes are

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
They don't even bother to tell

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
It says it won't give you cancer

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
It will make you fly

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
So, I...

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Sorry, Dan

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
You're on the ground, Rob

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
And you're gathering stories

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
You're going through a handler that's interpreting for you

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Mm-hmm

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
And what is your relationship with, like, locals?

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Like, when they see you, do they see you as a friend?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
A threat?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Or just kind of a noncombatant?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Like, it's easy going?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Well, this is, you know, one of the things about the Middle East

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Is that, like, or at least the parts of it I've been to

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Because I don't have a comprehensive knowledge

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
But I spent a lot of time in Iraq

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
And I've now been to Syria

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
And I've spent a bit of time in Turkey

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
And in the UAE

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
People, one to one, no matter what you're doing

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Are incredibly friendly on, like, a general basis

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
And, like, some of them will, like, happily tell you

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Like, oh, yeah, the Marines killed my family

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Or, like, a U.S. bomb killed my dad or whatever

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
But, like, you want to go have tea?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Or, like, oh, if you need a place to stay for that

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
I'll put you up for the night

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
It's just like it's a cultural thing

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
They take you as a one-on-one, like, just regular guy

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
It's just sort of politeness and welcoming a guest

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Is, like, a deeper thing than religion in that part of the world

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And so I've almost never gotten a cold reception

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Are there women that do what you do that would get the same reception?

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Or is it easier to be a male journalist doing that?

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
It depends a little bit on the situation

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
There are certain times where it's easier to be a woman

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Just because people will be friendlier to you

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
It's much harder in other ways and in some ways more dangerous

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
But, like, if you're working with the military, for example

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
You can get a lot of pictures of stuff you shouldn't be able to get pictures with

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
If you're a woman and you'll just pose with the guys

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
For a shot on their cell phones

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And then, like, you can take pictures of the military base

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
You can take pictures of the tanks, like, they'll let you do whatever

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
It's just sort of like how much you're willing to kind of lean on that

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Because I think you're taking selfies

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
You can just disguise

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I went with my wife to Iraq three times

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
And when we got back from the second trip

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
She'd met all these Iraqi soldiers

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And, like, they'd all exchanged Facebook information

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
We'd gotten some, like, great access

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And, like, had a really good time

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
And then we, like, were in Istanbul in the hotel

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
And she pulls open Facebook

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
And she starts getting, or whatever, Facebook, like, video message

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
From, like, 30 to, like, half of the Iraqi 5th Federal Police Battalion

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
You're, like, being, like, hey, you want to talk?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
They don't speak any English, though

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Are you, like, do you ever get any watchlist bullshit from, like, customs and stuff like that?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
I never have any issue

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Okay

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Well, how do you file that emotionally?

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
Or slash sociopolitically as a nomadic journalist

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
Like, who probably doesn't have as many, like, prejudices

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
But, okay, that's your wife

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
And then the Facebook messages come in

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Do you file that as predatory?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Do you have a different way of looking at that?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I mean, they're not...

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Like, it's, um...

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
It's complicated

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Like, there's a lot of really gross, misogynistic anti-woman behavior

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
That you encounter in that part of the world

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Even if it's hidden from you

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Even if they don't show it to you as a guest

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
In that particular case

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
I got the feeling that these were just lonely soldiers up at the front line

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
That's what I thought you might say

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
That it's sort of like...

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
It's like if you were a U.S.O. performer

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
And they were on a submarine or something

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I mean, as you should always do in those situations

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I kind of went off of her feelings

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
And at every given step was like, how do you feel about this?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Like, what do you want to do?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Well, you don't have to high-rope that

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
When you post your pieces

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
If you're emailing them back to your source

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
Or to your, you know, wherever you're sending it to

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Do you get, like, any...

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
What do you call it?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Like, what's the word, Davis?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Censorship

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Are they going through your stuff and censorizing you?

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
No

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
But, you know, there's a couple of things I should point out

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
One is that I don't do, like, the daily...

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Like, I don't work for the New York Times

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
I don't work for, you know, the BBC

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I'm not, like, filing stories every day

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
And then having them, like, run up on the air

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
That's not the kind of work I do

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
As a general rule, I just come home with whatever

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I come home with, write whatever I want to write with

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
And some of it gets published

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Some of it they're not interested in

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
In this case, I'm just going to throw up

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Nobody's going through embodlerizing and censoring your stuff

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
No, I spent, like, a weird morning in Mosul

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
During the fighting there, just watching, like,

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
U.S. airstrikes hit apartment blocks and stuff

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
And, like, nobody censored, tried to stop me

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
From talking about that

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
And are these considered, I mean, like...

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
But we're talking about places where

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
It's not even explicitly declared

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Whether or not there's a war going on or not

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
It's just a mixing bowl of conflict

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
So are you wearing a vest that says press

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
And would that matter?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
I did the first...

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
When I went to Ukraine, which was my first trip out

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
I wore a vest, just because I didn't know what to expect

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
And I was, like...

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Meaning...

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Or do you mean Kevlar?

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah, like, a Kevlar vest

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
But I'm also talking about this sort of, like,

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Hey, I'm a journalist, kind of, like, insignia

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
In most of these areas, if you're, like,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
A clearly American person walking around

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Everyone kind of knows your press

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Like, especially in, like, these parts of Syria

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Like, the only Americans going through are either

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
U.N., foreign aid, and there's not that many

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Of those people who are, like, westerners

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Or you're just a journalist

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
What's the reaction?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
They're pretty used to it

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
When you meet locals and they know that you're from the U.S.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Or that you're not from Syria

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Like, what's their reaction to you?

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Are they friendly, automatically?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Or wary of you?

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Nine times out of ten people are friendly

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
The only places I got really negative reactions in Syria

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
Were when we were in Raqqa

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Which was the former capital of the Islamic State

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
There were a lot of older men who you could tell

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Had kind of bought into the status quo under ISIS

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
And you got a lot of staring daggers at them

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Very mean looks at them

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Like, we also went to Al-Hal

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Which is the refugee camp

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Where they're hosting most of the arrested ISIS brides

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
So, like, the women who had, like, left parts of the western world

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
And joined the Islamic State

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
And a lot of them, like, we had this one weird moment

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Where we were walking through the camp

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
And we were just surrounded by these women

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
And they're in full Nikabs

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Which is, like, the full black headdress

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And it's like, as soon as you try to lock eyes with them

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
They flip down this little visor thing

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
So you can't even see their eyes

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
And, like, we'd been out with

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
We'd been talking to, like, guards at the camp

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Who'd been showing us, like, knife wounds

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
And bite marks and stuff

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Because, like, a lot of these women, like, some of them will make shibs

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Or they'll get knives smuggled in

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
And they'll stab a guard

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
And then they'll run back into the crowd

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And you can't tell who did it

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
So, like, we were just surrounded by this crowd of women

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
You can't see their eyes or anything

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
And, like, that was, like, definitely some navigative vibes there

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
But I also had a long conversation in, like, a trailer

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
With these two ISIS women

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Who had willingly joined the Islamic State

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
From Jamaica and Barbados

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And they spoke perfect English

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And we're talking about, like, literally

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
One of the sentences I heard was

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
When we first came to the Islamic State, it was Airee

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And it was, like...

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Wow!

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And, like, at one point

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
My colleague and I, Jake Hanrahan

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Who's a British conflict journalist

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
It was Airee

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Yeah, it was Airee

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
And we're, like...

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
We're having this pleasant conversation

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
You're very polite to us, but, like, tell the truth

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
If the walls came down right now, Jake asks

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
You'd have our heads cut off

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
And they're, like, yeah!

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
She's, like, okay, well, at least we're on the same page, yeah

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Yeah, well, we in the states here

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I mean, we do...

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
The way I met Wyatt Sinek was

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Doing that Courtney Cox pilot that was

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Ripping off Daily Show, so a million years ago

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Like, when I was working for Dino as a writer

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
And we did this, like, remote piece

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Where Wyatt went to talk to Terry Metzger

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
The head of the Aryan...

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Former head of the Aryan nation

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
And, like...

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Oh, Metzger, yeah!

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
It was, like, all this gag, you know?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
It was, like, of course he...

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
You know, it's, like, the white nationalists

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Back then, it was, like...

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
It was always, like, a puzzler of, like, really?

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
They wanted us to send a black guy

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And a gay guy to talk to them about

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Who they hate more and really...

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
It's, like, like...

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Oh, yeah, it...

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
That's my segue into the fact that

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
What amazes me about you is

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You go and do all this other stuff

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
So I'm pretty sure

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Blackout drunks aside

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
That the last time you were on the show

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I spent a great deal of my energy going, like

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
How do you have the...

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
Hutzpah, the gumption, the stuff to, like...

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
To go to these corners of the earth

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Not to, like, maybe corners of the earth is a...

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
That's a Eurocentric slur

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Kind of right in the middle

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Yeah, they're, like, in the...

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah, like the fertile crescent of, yeah, everything

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
The kknave. of the earth

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
Yeah, that's actually really fair, yeah

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
It's undulating dance, summoning all of it

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Okay, there I got it

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
We're, like, right in the middle of its four pack

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
If it's got, like, pretty good abs

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
Yeah, what was the tipping point for you

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
To just decide to go out and go into

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Pretty, like, sketchy, dangerous parts of the world

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
To be a journalist

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I mean, you know, it was this really...

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
It kind of came from a really narcissistic place

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
Of just growing up raised on Hollywood action movies

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
And not being willing to join the military

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
But, like, wanting to know what it was like

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
To see conflict and to even, like, having this desire

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Like, I want to know what it's like to get shot at

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
And then going there and realizing, like, oh, that stuff

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Is, like, 1% of what you do

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
And mostly what you do is meet, like, the nicest people

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
You've ever met

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Because there's something about...

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Not that war is good for you, which is a bad...

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Would be a bad lesson to take from this

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
But that conflict and terrible circumstances

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Tend to reveal the best in people more often

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Than they reveal the worst

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
And that those stories don't get clicks

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
No, they sure don't

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
That fear and evil kind of propagate by

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
The fear that I feel when I think about

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
The Middle East as a hornet's nest

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
In a place I'd never go as part of the problem

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
That you're inoculating things somehow

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
You know, you're going deep in there

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
But the thing that blows my goddamn mind

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Is that on the right over here, I'm, like,

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
Reading your very thoughtful stuff

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
Because it's like, look, I wouldn't have dismissed you

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
As an adrenaline junkie

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
However, I would have been able to at least

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Find a place for you on my map of the cosmos

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
As, like, a guy who's, like,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Wants to be where the action is

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
And where the truth is and stuff

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
But you're...

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
You have this...

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You are really into...

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
Investigating this domestic situation

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
That we've got going on

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
And that involves absolutely no romantic

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
Hurt, lockery, fun, like,

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
You pack your bags and duck your head

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Because the rotors are buzzing and things

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
Like, it's all just mind-numbing, heart-aking

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Investigation into the gears of

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
The fucking 8-chan and the 4-chan thing

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It did get a bounty on my head

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
I'm sure it did

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, from 4-chan, 15 bitcoins

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I wouldn't be sub...

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
I probably faster than any work you've done

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
In the most dangerous places on Earth

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
How much... Are you a big history buff?

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
How much, like, knowledge

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Do you have to go into that?

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
When you land and hit the ground in Syria

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
Do you have to know about the whole history of it?

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
I mean, in a much shittier,

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Way less important version of what you're doing

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
I did comedy in Kosovo

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And trying to learn about the Balkans

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And what's gone on there

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
It's crazy

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
And there's no getting around how complicated all that is

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
And I read and I read and I read and I read and I read

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
And I still don't know what the fuck is going on there

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Yeah, you know, it's...

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
I'm a big believer, like, when I report on white nationalism

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
I've read almost everything, like, pretty much everything

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
And you're for it, right?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Yeah, big fan, yeah, big fan

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Once you do just the cursory amount of research

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
It sells itself

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Go ahead

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
No, so, like, I do a lot of...

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I've tried to get deep into the history on that

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
But when it comes to, like, I do as much reading as I can

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
But, like, really, you can't understand

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
The full depth of all of these conflicts

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, 600 years of fucking conflict, yeah

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
So, like, what you do is you ask people there

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
What they think you need to know

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
And, like, you do that to enough people

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
That you feel like you've gotten a good base of, like, things

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Like, what I actually need to understand

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
In order to understand this place

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
What they've told you when you do more research

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
And you try to present things with as much context as you can

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
But you also accept that, like, there's only certain stories

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
You can effectively report on about that part of the world

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
As someone from outside of it

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Because, like, you don't speak the language

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
You don't have an in-depth knowledge of the history

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
Which is why the kind of stuff that I have been trying to report on

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Like, what I focused on when I was in Syria

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Is the stuff that's going against the grain of history

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Which is very much, like, what everyone in Rojava will tell you

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Escape from is, like, the grain of history

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
That has caused so much problem

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Or so many problems for, like, the people in that region

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Over such a long span of time

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And has caused all these structural imbalances

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Is there a generational thing that's happening

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Where, like, there's a youthful kind of, like, a upsurge

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Of, like, let's escape the past?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, that's a big part of it

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And you meet a lot of older people there

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Who, you know, like, the women I would talk to

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Who would say, like, I don't think this guy really means it

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I don't think that guy really means it

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
And you would kind of have to parse it with the older guys

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
Which ones believed in sort of the feminist revolution

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Aspect of what was going on and which ones didn't

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
And so a lot of my conversations were trying to, like, figure out

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Like, how the old guys felt about it

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
And then at one point we wind up in this office

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
With a bunch of Asaish, which are, like, the local military police

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
And it's a mix, everyone in there is in their early 20s

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
And it's a mix of young women, some of whom are wearing

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Headdress, headscarfs, and some of whom are wearing

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Are just, like, bareheaded

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
And, like, men, and a lot of them have tattoos

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And they're all, like I said, in their early 20s

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
And I start asking them this

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Like, how do you feel about men and women working together

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
How do you feel about this new system

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
And they all start really awkwardly giggling

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
To the point where it was obvious that it was like

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
If I'd walked into a mixed group of, like, men and women

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Working together in, like, Orange County

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
And been like, how do you guys feel about women and men

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Working next to each other

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And they would all be like, what the fuck are you talking about, dude

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Really?

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
And that was the thing, like, the people that I got to know well

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
And talking about, they were like, we just have to keep

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
The old people who don't really believe

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
Shamed into falling in line long enough for them to die off

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
And the young people to grow up living this way

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Really? Wow.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
So how big is that?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
That can be a dangerous methodology

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Yeah, can we do a Logan's Run, so to say

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
It turns out some of them can whip that fire whip

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Right around Gandalf's ankle

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Right at the last minute and get a whole new football

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
This women-based militia and, like, kind of

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Yeah, you can see him if you pull a picture number seven

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I think was that

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Oh, we got pictures

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Oh, yeah, there's pictures

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
I love this podcast

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
But yeah, what were you asking?

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Oh, yeah, go like, oh, shit

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Yeah

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
So, like, how prominent are they

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And how many, like, what's, like, per capita

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
Like, how many of them are involved and what's going on?

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
There are a pretty substantial number of the forces

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Like, in the field

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's kind of hard to get numbers

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
But you can get a picture for it just by looking at military checkpoints

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
Because it's a mix of men and women working the checkpoints

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
And doing, like, the job of garrison duty

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
And from that, I'd guess somewhere around a quarter to a third

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
You can also get an idea by one of the things

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
So about 11,000, mostly Kurdish

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
But also Arabic fighters and also foreign fighters

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Died fighting ISIS

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
And they call them the Shaheeds, which means martyr

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
And their pictures are all over the place

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Pictures of different martyrs are all over the place

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
And quite a few of them are young women

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
There's a lot of women who are 16, 17 years old

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
Are there women in, like, high military status?

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Like, generals and...

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
So if you work in the Middle East in cover conflict

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
You will run into a situation very often

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Where in order to get into a certain area

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Or to embed with a military unit

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
You have to sit in a room with a bunch of elderly generals

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
And drink tea with them and maybe have lunch with them

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Like, all right, you guys can get in the Humvee

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
And go on and do your thing

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
They just want to, like, sit with you

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
And get sort of that face time with you

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
And I had that meeting for the first time in Raqqa

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
Where the person who was in charge was not a man

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
And it was a woman in her 60s

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Who was an older Kurdish fighter

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Probably former PKK

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Who was one of the co-presidents of security

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
For the city of Raqqa

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
And so she and this man were, like, running security

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
And she was, from the instant we stepped into the room

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Clearly in control

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
And nothing started until she was ready to go

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And nothing stopped until she was ready for it to stop

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
We've got her picture in here, too

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
But I want to go back to this at some point

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
This is your rap?

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
The rap you wanted to do?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Yeah, number three

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Yeah

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
So that's her

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
She's the Queen Elizabeth, the Titan?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Yeah, and she...

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
And who's smiling Jack over here?

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
That's her partner

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
And when we asked him, what do you think about

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
All of this, like, women's revolution and feminism stuff

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
He was the guy who was like, oh, I'm totally about it

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And she just, like, laughed and waved her hand at him

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
And it was, like, clearly this, like, dismissive gesture

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Like, yeah, fuck you, we've been in arguments together

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I know how you really fucking think, dude

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
I mean, that's really interesting

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
Like, of all places, you would think that that would not be the place

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
Where women were, like, controlled military

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
And, like, governmental control

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Yeah, there's a story I want to tell really quickly

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Just so I don't forget to do it

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
If you want to go back to picture seven

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
There's a woman in the middle of that picture

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
You see that young woman with the glasses?

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
She was 16 years old when Isis took over the city

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
That she lived in

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And one of the first rules they instituted for women

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Was that all women had to wear the niqab

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
Which is the full black, like, full body covering

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
And she went out one day with a white belt around it

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
And a member of the Hisba, which was Isis's religious police,

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Saw her

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
And she was sentenced to 1,500 lashes for wearing a white belt

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
And the way she described it to us is

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
That's enough lashes that three different men had to deliver it

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Because their arms gave out

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
And it took her four months to recover from the whipping

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Enough that she was able to move around

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
And eventually escape through the lines

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
And reach the Kurdish-controlled chunks of northern Syria

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Her there under the tree with a gun on her hand

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
Yeah, yeah, with the glasses

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I can't believe that wouldn't kill you

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
It can

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
It does a lot of the time

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
But their arms gave out

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
The number of women died, yeah

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
So she reaches the Kurdish lines

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
And the first thing she sees is a soldier

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
A young female soldier of the YPJ holding an AK-47

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
And the way she explained it to us is

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
As soon as I saw that woman holding a gun

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I was like, that's what I want to do

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Wow

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Yeah

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I mean, there's this bitter sweetness to it

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Because it's like

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
We in the West have been having this

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
For 200 years of like

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
And it's really hard to unbrade it

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Because it's like

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
Guns or penises and men are violent

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
And that's part of the problem

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
And then, but we also like these stories of

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Like, you know

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Injustice becoming justice

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
And like equality taking the form of

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Women holding these weapons of destruction

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
And it's like the mind just spirals

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
And while the mind is spiraling

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
One must then go

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Why is your mind spiraling?

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
Because there are too many poles going on here

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
Like get rid of them and achieve stabilization

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
And if you have to do that by

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
It's like whatever means you have to do that

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
I mean, if a person took 120 lashes

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Our hands are numb

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
We got different like

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
So they give you sort of their war name

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
So it always starts with Haval

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Which is a word in Kermaji Kurdish

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
That means friend or you might translate it to comrade

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
It's sort of like calling everybody around you

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Comrade would have been back in the early days

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
The Soviet Revolution

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
And her last name I have trouble pronouncing

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
But it's the Kurdish word for revenge

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
No shit

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Yeah, so like comrade revenge was the name that she

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
So this is post her being whipped 1500 times

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
And she's sitting there and looking like she's

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
She was getting training at this

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
She was actually helping to train the younger women

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
In the unit

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
So this was part of an all Arab unit of the YPJ

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
So these young women were all getting trained to fight

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
And it was like

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
I talked to a number of them

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
We spent like a sizable chunk of a day there

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
And we actually got

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I have a bunch of papers that I have to translate

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
That's like their coursework on feminism

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Because it's a two month boot camp

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
And the first month is on historical training

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And like feminist theory and like understanding

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Like the relation of men and women throughout the ages

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
And like the birth of authoritarianism

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Like that's part of the military training

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Along with how to shoot in AK-47

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Okay, well that's really interesting

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
I don't want to derail

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
But that sounds like a rabbit hole

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
That's what I came to talk about

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Like how does their history of feminism

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Hey Rob, scoot down over here

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
So that people can see all the photos here

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Like in case it's blocking anybody

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
I mean, so if you're

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I mean that just

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Like what history of feminism are

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
They're getting a completely different one

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Obviously there's not a

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
They don't do a slideshow

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
This is Susan and Anthony

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Like they have a completely different history

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Yeah, it's some

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
A lot of it does focus on like significant women

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
In both the history of the region

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
And the world who they like see

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
As sort of icons in this long struggle

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
A lot of it's the stuff that Ajalan

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Wrote about his theories on

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
When human beings transitioned

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
From hunter-gatherers to agricultural societies

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And when like the enslavement of women

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
On a systemic basis began

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And it's like coming to understand all of that

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
God damn

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Yeah, it's some surprising stuff

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
To encounter in the middle of the Syrian desert

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Are they heralded and being like

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Applauded in like their local areas

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
For being women in power

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Or being a women militia

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Some of their parents

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
They are disowned from

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And will not be going back home

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Because their family didn't want them coming

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
In joining and some of their parents

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Some of them expressed that like my family

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Was like yeah when I was a kid

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
This would have seemed impossible

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
But after ISIS they were just like fuck it

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Why not

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
So it was a mix

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Will they ever be heralded as heroes

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Or are they just going to kind of be footnotes

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Like in a weird crisis

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
There's a kind of real politic

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
That you encounter

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Particularly working with Kurdish forces

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
In any part of the world

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And I've been with them in Iraq

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And in Syria

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And they're both very different chunks

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
In both very different ideologies

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But they both understand how optics work

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Both like the Iraqi Kurdish movements

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And the Syrian Kurdish movements

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And so they understood from the beginning

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
That having female fighters up at the front line

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Looked really good in terms of getting the US

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
To support you with airstrikes

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Because like that just sells back home

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
A hell of a lot better than like

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
The way to a man's heart is a woman with a gun

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Well

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You can't argue with the effectiveness

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
One of the differences is that

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
For the Iraqi Kurds

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
That

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Having actual women in the front line

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Stopped being a thing

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
As soon as the immediate threat of ISIS

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Overrunning their capital

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Stopped being a thing

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And in Syria

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
They're still all over the place

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
They're still running

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Leading men into battle

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Like you would

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
It was so comprehensive

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That like

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Because a part of you as a journalist

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You're like is this just a put on for me

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Or are they like trying to like

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Play up a show or whatever

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Right

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
And a certain amount of time

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
After like looking back behind you

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And just seeing like

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
A young woman in a headscarf

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Like going over maps with a guy

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Like 40 feet behind you

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Like where you're not filming

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Where you're not looking at

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And they're clearly trying to figure out

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Where to position their guys and what not

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You just accept that it's happening

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And that it like isn't weird

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
For a lot of the people anymore

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Now look

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
If you've got a bunch of photos

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
We can go through all of them

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Or I can segue to domestic

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Which is only going to make my stomach hurt

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So I'm happy to go through photos of

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I mean you know

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Like if you've got a bunch of photos

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Let's look at them

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I would be happy to see more photos

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Of these women

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
We do

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
The thing is

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I'll just let me say this one thing

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And then we don't have to talk about

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Domestic again

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Because we do

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'll talk about domestic

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I know you want to

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That's the thing that impresses me about you

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Is that you're clearly passionate

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
About that shit

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And have such an eye for it

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
But Google Rob Evans

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And scroll past the kid stays in the picture

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
In the history of Paramount doing porn

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And see Rob Evans' pieces

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
About 8 Chan and 4 Chan

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And the stuff

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And it's like don't

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It's like look

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It's not

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
It takes 10 minutes

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And it fucking hurts

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Like drinking Nyquil

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But then

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Why is drinking Nyquil hurt?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
That puts you to sleep

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
That's pretty normal

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Wheat grass

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Wheat grass

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It's disgusting

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
But you feel a little better after you drink it

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Like you're a little more armed

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
For something

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And stuff

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
You talk about shit posting

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Which I really didn't know the definition of

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
All kinds of stuff

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But we have guests coming up

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Who are delving into that area

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And we can have you back anytime

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And if you've got a bunch of fucking photos

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
From your trip to Syria

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Let's go through them

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And listen to you tell stories

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Yeah

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Like there's one little spiel

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I'd like to go on

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
About the domestic side of things

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
That like I talk about this

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I've been doing like I was on the BBC

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And NPR

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And like doing a bunch of shit

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
After the last shooting

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Because they call me up every time

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Someone from 8chan murders people

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And there's something I never get to talk about

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Or I talk about it

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Sorry, interrupt

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
What is 8chan?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I don't know

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Is that two times worse than 4chan?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
If the internet's asshole

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
If the asshole of the internet

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Had an asshole

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
That's 8chan

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And it's actually called 8chan

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
It's called 8chan

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Because child porn was banned

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
On 4chan

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And Gamergate

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
We can't have this

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Well, yeah, I think it was popular

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It was because of Gamergate

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But I think that's why it was invented

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It's like we need a 4chan

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
To trade child porn

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Yeah, it was a

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Yes, that's the starting point

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's like

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And it only got worse

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Yeah

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
They took a real Nazi turn

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
After 2014

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And it's stupid

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And it's sad

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
But it's why like 80 people

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Have died this year

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
But there's a really important provocative cover

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I'm going to let you do your ranch in one second

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Because I can already hear

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
From my wonderful audience

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
That I respect the hell out of them

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
If I only think about the stuff on the drive

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Over here

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I thought the same thought

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Immediately when all this talk about

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
We get to pull the plug on 8chan

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And all this stuff

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And my first thought is like

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Wait a minute, that can't possibly be the solution

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I don't want anybody listening to this podcast

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
To think that like

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
That's why I say

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Go Google Rob Evans

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Read his shit

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
This guy as much as he's been in Syria

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And Iraq has been in 4chan and 8chan

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And just read the stuff

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Because it's not forcing you to do anything

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Just read his stuff

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And start to like

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Understand the climate

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And the definitions of what is

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
When do you start to call something

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
An actual like fucking cell

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And I just like

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The fact that I have to gingerly say that

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Is like a sign of the crazy ass times

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
But now do your thing

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Yeah, I mean I um

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So I started covering 8chan in 2014

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Because I was a comedian at that point in time

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And I worked for a website called crack.com

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
That did a comedy video about

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Personifying different websites on the internet

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
As like kids in high school

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And it personified 8chan as this creepy kid

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Like hitting on another young woman

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
In like a really creepy and abusive way

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And like that was the joke

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Is that that's the kid 8chan would have been

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
In high school

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And they found the video

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And they got angry

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And they didn't go after the director of the video

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Who was a man

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
They went after the actress

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And they started like sending dead animals to her house

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Letters written blood to her house

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Like this is like 2014

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
So I start like

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I just start checking in on these guys

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
A couple of times a year

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Just because I'm like what the fuck is happening here

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And in 2016

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
The president retweets a meme that they create

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You guys saw that picture of Hillary Clinton

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
With like the star of David behind her

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
That says most corrupt candidate ever

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
That was an 8chan meme

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
So I wrote a thing about them

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
For the comedy website that I wrote for

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
At that time

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And then I just keep looking in

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And then the Christchurch massacre happens

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And because I've been working on extremism

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And stuff during that time

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I read the guy's manifesto

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And I see that it was post on 8chan

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And I like write a thing about it

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Like while the bodies are still warm

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And suddenly like

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
All these journalists from legacy media

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Are being like

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Can you explain the internet to us

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And like that's why I'm in this position

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
But what I think is important for people to understand

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
That I tell to every journalist

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
From a big station that talks to me

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
That they never play

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
They never put it on the radio

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
They never put it on TV

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
This shit goes back

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Further than the internet as we know it

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
In the early 1980s

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
There was a terrorist group called

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The Order

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Which was inspired by a book called

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
The Turner Diaries

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Which is a fictional book

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
About a white race war

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That is sparked by like

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Terrorist cells carrying out like

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Random acts of violence

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It's a fantasy

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It's a fantasy for white supremacists

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yeah

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Who maybe don't call themselves fascists

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Blowing up enough shit

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And the terrorist group in the book is called

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The Order

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And the real terrorist group is called

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
The Order

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And they're protagonists or antagonists

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Oh they're the heroes

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
They're protagonists

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Like most terrorist written fiction

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It doesn't really have good structure

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
It's just like

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Once upon a time

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
We blew up enough shit

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
That we got to

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
We got to be America

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Which women we got to fuck

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And it was great

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And then we nuked the earalls

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yeah

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So this real terrorist group

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Calls The Order

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
The Order starts up

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And they mostly rob banks

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And armored cars

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
They only kill a couple of people

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But they make off with about

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Four million dollars in cash

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Some of it goes to buy rocket launchers

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And machine guns and shit

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Oh yeah this I know

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Okay

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
This part people know

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
What people don't know is that

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Most of the weapons that the money bought

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Got confiscated eventually

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
The army and shit tracked them down

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The FBI figured that shit out

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
But a lot of the money went to buy

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Apple II computers

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And early networking equipment

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Which connected KKK cells

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And new neo-nazi cells

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And like white supremacist readouts

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And places like the area nations up in Idaho

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
On an early internet network

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Called LibertyNet

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Now this is in the mid 1980s

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
By the mid 1990s

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
There were researchers realizing

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
There's an organized neo-nazi presence

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
On like use net and shit

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Like the early internet

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Like on these fucking like

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
What were they even called

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Not message boards

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Like even fucking before that

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
News groups

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
News groups

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Like all dot politics and shit

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Like there's Nazis all over these places

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And they start finding Nazi manifestos

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Written about how to radicalize people

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
On the internet

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And how if somebody confronts you

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
The first thing to say is

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I'm not a Nazi

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Use humor and jokes

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And try to claim that you're just joking

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
If people call you on like

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Your ironic fascism and stuff

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And like if we just put this stuff

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Out into the atmosphere often enough

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
This is how we can recruit people

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And so what we've seen

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
What we're seeing with 8chan

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And not just with 8chan

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
But with like this brother constellation

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Of like neo-nazis and fascists

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
On the internet

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Who were radicalizing

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Larger and larger groups of people

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And who sort of metastasized

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
In the 2017 Charlottesville March

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Where you got hundreds of these people

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
In real life

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Is the culmination of 30 years

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Of really diligent work

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And that's why I try to treat these people

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
And have tried to push the mainstream media

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And when I speak to law enforcement

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
When I lecture at colleges

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Try to talk to them about

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
You have to treat them as if they're like ISIS

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Or Al Qaeda

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And maybe they're not that organized

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And they're certainly not a central figurehead

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Of the group

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
But they function that way

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And they've been doing so for decades

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And it's time we acted like it

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
You have to at least ask yourself

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
In terms of group psychology

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
What if these people weren't white

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Now the brick wall that I run into

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Is like

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Well how can you possibly punish a medium

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Like how can

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
And that's what all of my friends also say too

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
The minute we hear this stuff

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
We just go like

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
How can pulling the plug on a fucking place

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Where people get together

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And say who wants to mass shoot

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
How can pulling the plug be the solution

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And just reading a couple of your pieces

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Like started to nudge me over

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Because unlike me

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Who's just simply a 46 year old dude

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Waking up and going

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Yeah but at the end of the day

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And that's why I say to you guys

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Because I don't presume anything about you guys

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
In these turbulent, turbulent times

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And I think that's

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
From reading two of your pieces

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That was one of the things I really respected

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Is your acknowledgement of the psychological effect

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Of just shit

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Just too much information

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And how there is like

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
That is like

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Like if we had

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
If you hadn't been to Syria

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That would be an hour long conversation

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
That you want to have

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Is like how in the hell

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
What is the responsibility of the discerning

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Humanitarian individual

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
When they're trying to figure out

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
What is the difference between shit posting

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Trolling propaganda

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And an outright like thing to bother attacking

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
What is anyone supposed to do

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Because it's obvious what the quote unquote

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Enemy wants to happen

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Which is fatigue

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Shock and awe

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yeah they want you offline

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
They want you to do what I have done

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Buy a gun and get in your swimming pool

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And I am proud

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Well I'm not proud

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
But I am not afraid to shamefully admit

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I've never seen you in the pool though with your gun

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
That's the next one man

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Challenge accepted

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
First off this is off topic

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
But if you haven't gone pool shooting

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Now Dan I come from Texas

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And rolling down a moving body of water with a rifle

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
That's some good times

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I'm not going to pretend it's not

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I can't tell if you're kidding

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I am not kidding

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I'm pretty sure mythbusters prove

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
That bulls don't work underwater

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Well no but he's talking about

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Tube shooting

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Which is something I've always done

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Like lazy river tube

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Tube shooting

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Plus sea shooting right

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Tube shooting

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Tube shooting

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
See that like I'm not a big gun enthusiast

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
But I would go tube shooting

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Who wouldn't

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Poss I would not go tube shooting with you

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
No I want to be completely alone

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Yeah well they say about you know

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
The old saying never be the smartest person in the room

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Never be the guy in the tube shooting trip

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
That has the least experience with guns

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And tubes

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Or tubes

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Yeah

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
To only go tube shooting with navy seals

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Rob I took journalism school at USC

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Like in the early 90s and I was

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I think about like what it must be like now

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
To go into a journalism school today

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Like because this is

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
When I went there it was pretty pre-internet

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And certainly pre-

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Napster

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Like yeah

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I was pre-napster for sure

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
There's less focus on Napster

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
That's heartbreaking

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
But like how do you approach journalism now

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And like when you're writing a piece

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And like you think of the market that's going to be delivered in

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Like in a world of just fake bullshit

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And like how do you approach print journalism today

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
That's a reason I'm a big fan of the site that I write for

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
It's called Bellingcat

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And these are the people they were founded by

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
A guy who was a something awful forums goon

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Named Elliot Higgins

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And something awful is also the forum that birthed HN

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Which is the forum that

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Right

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
The forum that birthed 4chan

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Now so Elliot's just like this nerd on the internet

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And like when the Syrian civil war starts up

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
He starts getting interested

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Just like looking at pictures of conflict

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Through like Google images

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And trying to piece stuff together

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And then he gets interested in like the fighting in Ukraine

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And there's been a number of stories that they've broken

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
But one of them is that after

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I think it was MH17

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The Malaysian air flight that was shot down over Ukraine

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
They just spent god knows how many hours

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Combing over pictures of the wreckage

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And pictures of Russian troop movements at the time

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
To identify which missile

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Based on the serial numbers on the missile

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Shot down the plane from like a Russian buck launcher

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And then traced down like

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
What launcher that missile was put onto

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And then traced its path from Russia into the Ukraine

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
To prove that it was the Russian back separatist in Ukraine

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Who shot down the plane

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And like that's the kind of journalism they do

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And I don't do that

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Because I'm not nearly that smart

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
But like that's I think a part of how you deal with

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
The problem of like

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Well nobody believes in truth

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
It's like okay well you can put out this article

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Where I'm not relying on trusting that you went here

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And talked to these people

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I can pull up all of these images

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I can trace the serial numbers on this missile

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I can like do all this myself

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Because you've spelled out how you're going to do it

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And that's hard to argue with

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Like when we look at the internet

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I'm using my eye statements here

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
When I look at the internet and I go

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
This is at least 80%

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Nonsense

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It's worse, poison

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Yeah

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
It might do me right to recognize

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
That that's probably because I'm 80% poison

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And that if I'm 20% decency

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Or health

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
That what that means is that there might be

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
20% of the internet that is decent

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That you shouldn't expect those averages to be higher

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And you should expect yourself to have to

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Dig a little harder

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
How would you teach, like you said

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You give talks and you

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Like how would you

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Like you're talking to a bunch of

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
18-year-old freshmen in college

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
That want to go into proper print journalism

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
No, I don't talk to those kids

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
When I lecture, I usually lecture to counter-terrorism students

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And to like new law enforcement

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Federal law enforcement officers

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
About dealing with particularly far-right terrorism

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
But in general with dealing with terrorist groups

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
That use the internet to recruit

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I don't like

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I think journalism is kind of broken

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
In the mainstream sense

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
The people that you're talking to

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Might be our actual journalists

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
The people that actually go in there and make

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Like on the ground reports

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And say this is what happened and this is why

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Well, but also, and here's one of the reasons

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Why I think mainstream

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And like most of the field is kind of screwed right now

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Is that it has abandoned

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
For sort of perceptions of the way things ought to be

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It has abandoned actually

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Mattering

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And that's important

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
In a world where somebody can just lie a thousand times

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
To overwhelm your one truth

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It doesn't matter that you're telling the truth

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
What matters is finding a way to get the truth

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
To reach people

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And sometimes that involves thinking

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Not like a journalist, but like a guy

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Who writes for television or whatever

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
How do you know when you write something

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And you've gone and reported on something

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And you disseminate that

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
How do you have any faith

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That will even land as truth

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Well, you have to be willing to write

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
A bunch of shit that nobody reads

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Which I have and will continue to do

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Until the day I die

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
You also have to have an amount of faith

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
In the fact that when people get scared

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
They'll pay attention to what makes sense

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
And the lies always make a kind of sense

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
But they're never a satisfying sense

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
When you really turn them around in your head

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And that's what you have to hope on

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And that's something I believe on faith

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I believe entirely because of the evidence

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Of my own eyes, because it's not always true

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Do you have editors and publishers that you trust

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
That they'll appreciate what you're doing

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
And that they'll make sure that what you've written

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Gets out?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Yeah, I've been really lucky to work

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
With good editors all my life

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And I don't know how journalists work

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
With ones who aren't

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
My editor at Bellingcat

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
When I started getting death threats

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And got that bounty put on me was like

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
He mentioned this

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Bounty? Please go over it

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
But pay attention

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
After the Christchurch shooting

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I was on a documentary for ABC Australia

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Talking about 8chan and stuff

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And they found it and they got angry at it

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And they put a 15-bit coin bounty on my head

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And it's probably a joke

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Because it's 8chan

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
But that's the point

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
They could always say it's a joke

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Until you get shot and they're like

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
That was my idea

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So I reported it to the police

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And the editor went to her contacts in the FBI

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And tried to get something

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Nothing ever gets done

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
But that's the way

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
There's also not much that you could do

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
One of the things I do know

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
But you were saying your editor at Bellingcat

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Yeah, she did everything she could

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
To get people to take it

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Even though there's nothing that will be done about it

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Because she considers her job to protect her creatives

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I shouldn't call you creatives

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I should call you something else

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
The thing that made me almost break down

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Was his editor

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Karen Atia at the Washington Post

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And her reaction to it

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
And you could tell she's one of those editors

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Who would take a bullet for anybody

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Writing for her

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
And you hope you work for somebody like that

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It's crazy that

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Now journalists

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Almost seem like they're part of

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
The intelligence service

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
You're basically

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Not spies

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
But you're certainly putting yourself out

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
In a real harm's way

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
By simply caring about

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Reporting truth

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Now you can get poisoned

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Murdered

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Decapitated in all sorts of horrible shit

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
You know, I think that's

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Always been the case in journalism

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
What makes this more on this edge

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Where we're actually dealing with live intelligence

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Rather than reporting cold intelligence

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Is the fact that nobody

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Including the intelligence agencies

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Understands the world right now

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Which is like a good

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Situation to work in if you're somebody

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Who gets the internet 3%

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
More than the guys working at the FBI

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Look, this guy's obviously referencing

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
The

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
The meme of this

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And a 40 year old guy is like

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
There's a meme?

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I had a time where I was trying to explain

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
The remove kebab meme

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Which I'm not going to explain here

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
If you don't need it, it's just a racist meme

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
By the Christchurch shooter

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
But having to go through this manifesto

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Line by line and explain

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
This in-joke that these nerds told on the internet

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
To each other

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
It's weird

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
When you're going against entropy

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
When you side, the thing

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
That drives fascism

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Which is a modern invention

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
You can't have an ancient fascist country

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Unless you change your definitions

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Because you have the tenets of fascism

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Include

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Like absolute nihilism

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And manipulation of the media

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Takeover of it

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
That includes this idea of

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You have to subvert the very idea of truth

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Which I see a thousand articles a day

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
As much as I try to avoid the news

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I just see Newsweek

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Time, CNN

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Washington Post

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I see a different permutation

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Of people coping with something that seems

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
As a ninth grade history student to me

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
To be the same headline over and over again

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Boy, these guys really

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Will stop at nothing to make everyone

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Not understand that there's an objective truth

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
See, I think

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Part of the problem is that

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Fascists

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Never tell the truth

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
But they are often the most authentic

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Players in the media

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Atmosphere and in the political space

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
This is something to bring it back to ISIS

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Who I do think are, I think it's an Islamo-fascist movement

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Just like we have crypto-fascists here

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
In the United States

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
This is your recruitment propaganda

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And you compare it to the recruitment propaganda

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Of the United States military

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You watch a U.S. Marine Corps recruitment video

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
You're gonna see cool guys with guns, cool uniforms

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
You're gonna see cool tanks rolling everywhere

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Nobody gets shot, nobody gets hurt

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Nobody's bleeding

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
You watch ISIS propaganda

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And they'll follow a single guy from his journey

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Leaving Canada and going to the Islamic State

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And picking up a rocket launcher and fighting

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
To him getting blown up and it zooming in

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Lovingly on his torn apart corpse on the ground

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
To be

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And people embrace it because it's authentic

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Because we live in this culture where everything is

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Like so plastic and formulated

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
And it was the same thing that was explained to me

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I talked to this guy who's a pretty sleazy dude

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Rick Wilson, he's a former Republican

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Political strategist and during the 2016 election

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I was talking to him about

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Political ads and we were evaluating

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Trump's first campaign ad with one of Hillary Clinton's

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Most recent ads and he said

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Everybody's making fun of Trump's campaign ad

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Because it's so like juvenile and looks like some kid

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Cooked it up on the internet

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
That's going to do a thousand times more for his campaign

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Than anything she could spend $20 million on

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Because that feels like something a kid cooked up

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
On his laptop because he cared

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And it's the same thing with ISIS's stuff

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It's the same thing fascists

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Always have going for them

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Is that they're lying about everything

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
But the emotional truth at the core of the movement

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Speaks to something in people

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And a politician who's just trying to get elected

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Never can

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And you don't want to be distant from that

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
But there's a

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I want to

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Inculcate myself

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But also

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Present the lighter side of that

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Which is like there was somebody that reached out

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
To me through private messaging and said

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
That they were a mental health professional

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
And that they work with at risk kids

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And by at risk I mean

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Particularly the kids that are at risk of self harm

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
That

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
This person was writing to me to let me know

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I put a quote from my show

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
On the door of their office

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
At this center

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Where these kids that are not privileged

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
They've

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Sunk down by virtue of wanting

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
To die to the lowest

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Like

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Drain gutter

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
And they're coming through him

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And he liked the show

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Rick and Morty

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Not community

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Which is very nihilistic

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Like fuck it

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I believe the quote was the thing that Morty says to his sister

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Which is like nothing matters

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Like nobody exists on purpose

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Come watch TV

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Which I did personally write

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And I did design it

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
To appeal to the potential

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Runaway in all of us

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
It is something that I wanted to hear

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
When I was 17 from

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Especially

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
An imagine kid brother

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
He said he put it on his door

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And that he was just reporting to me

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
That it was like making kids trust him

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And it brought me to tears

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I got to tell my therapist

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I make this shit

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I just follow my heart

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Sometimes my heart is dark

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And tortured and poisonous

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
And sometimes my heart is

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Pollyanna and all that stuff

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But what you're talking about is authenticity

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
The perceived authenticity of the message

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Versus

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Like when kids are attuned

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
To the horse shit

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
So when I was young

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Fight club was this big

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It was like it just spoke to me

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
It was like oh my god this movie gets it

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Oh my god the corporate America and all that stuff

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Like anything that's horse shit

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Anything that goes through channels

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
On its way to touch you

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
No matter how it's touching you

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
It would be simpler to just reach out

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And go yeah like maybe there is no god

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Maybe life means nothing

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
It's like I'm listening to this person first

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
God forbid they tell me to do something

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Terrible

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Because I just don't have time

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
For this fucking Pringles can over here

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Like that's like oh sorry Jeff

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I didn't mean to personalize that

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
That's an inside joke kind of thing

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
But like that idea of like yeah

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
No this contains no sucrose

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And this will eventually lead to your

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
It sort of reminds me in high school

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
The kind of battle that my teachers would tell me

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Of like at least the way they characterized it

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Like during the cold war

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
When you're going to third world countries

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
And you're pitching them democracy versus communism

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And you're basically saying

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
If you go with us

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Your grandkids are gonna maybe

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Have a lot of bread

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Like they can buy it at a supermarket

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
If you go with them

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Everyone's gonna eat a lot more tomorrow

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
That conversation probably that conflict

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
But it's like the paradigm

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
It cuts to that

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Which is like

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Authenticity

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Fidelity of messaging

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Hey, talking to you

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And I'm talking to you fucking straight

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Have you ever felt like killing yourself?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Yes

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
And then the other person is going like

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Hey, talking to you

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Didn't mean to scare you

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Everything's fine

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
No, of course, Uncle Henry

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Okay, good night

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I'm gonna go fuck your Aunt Irene

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And then

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Drop dead Freds over here

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I was like I'm gonna sneak out my window

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And they're authentic

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
It is

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I'm so glad you brought that up

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Because it also is like

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
It's this shit posting thing where it's like

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
People flooding a squirting ink

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
There where they go like

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Here's my manifesto

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
You take that

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Shit posting is like sort of the tactic

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
And it's not like fascist or inherently

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Right-wing or left-wing or negative or anything

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
It's just a thing that you can do to sort of flood

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
A discussion or a conversation online

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
With nonsense, usually a bunch of like meaningless

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Memes or like stuff like that

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
In order to kind of distract any sort of conversation

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Usually not just nonsense but stuff that's like

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Deliverately kind of emotionally provocative

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
In order to kind of derail productive conversation

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
It's kind of an inverted dog whistle

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
And it's the example that I brought up

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
In the case of terrorism was how like the 8chan

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Shooter had a bunch of

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
References to internet memes and stuff

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
In his manifesto that like had nothing

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
To do with anything and also would bring up

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
People like Candace Owens who he wasn't a fan of

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
But he knew that if he dropped her name in the manifesto

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
It would start like a right-wing, left-wing

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Fight and he could like sort of get people

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Talking about that as like while

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
They were also grouping the strategy

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Like Charles Manson told his people

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Right, right, you know white people

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Hate black people on the walls after you stabbed someone

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Yeah, it's not a totally new tactic

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
It's just this is the term the internet

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Yeah, you just like sort of you're the Grinch

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
You're Oscar, you're a fan of

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Entropy

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Entropy is going to get you to where you want to be faster

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Because order is not getting you anywhere

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Alright anyways

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Also you have a new

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Children's book coming out

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
It's called Good Night Moon

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Sorry you're broken into nine fractional pieces

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I was gonna go oh the places you won't go

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Because the Nazis have bombed the trains

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Oh the places you refuse to go

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Yeah

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Do you have kids by the way

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Good god no

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
So this is a job that yeah that would make sense

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Oh no I don't have kids because all the drugs

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Can I ask you a weird question

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
If you did have kids

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
How would you deal with that question

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Because people would like load

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I'm like

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
If you had kids

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Would you stop

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
No

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I don't know I'm not a parent

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
So like my advice on this is almost meaningless

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
My opinion as a former child

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Is that

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
A retired child

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yeah as a retired child

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Retired

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Aren't we all

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I love that

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I think you should let kids

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Be interested in and read about

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And study about anything

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
They want I don't think you should necessarily let them

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Watch anything they want

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
That was the rule my parents had for me

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
That like I'd have a lot of disagreements with my parents

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
But they were like we're gonna watch what you watch on tv

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
But any book is fine

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Because at least he's fucking reading

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And like I don't know if that works in the modern era

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Because that can mean like the kid winds up on fucking 8 chance

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So like I don't know

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Are we supposed to censor

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
No you know I think

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Censorship of that kind never works

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Which is not to say that like taking a site like 8chan

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Off the internet the way that it has

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Currently been taken off is bad because I don't

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Think that censorship I think that's being like

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Hey company do you want your name associated

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
With a site that's killed 80 people and they go like

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Yeah I really don't

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
But all that shit still you can post that

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Like in a post net neutrality world let them have

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Lower bandwidth

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Yeah I think what

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Anything that really works in the long run

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
When it comes to like fighting

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Authoritarianism and fascism through raising

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Better people is giving them

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
A solid grounding both on like a

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
One-to-one level in sort of the example

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
You said as a human being of how they should treat

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
People by how you treat people

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
And number two give them a thorough grounding

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
In history which they won't get

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
From school because like school history educations

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Are garbage so don't just tell them about

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
World War II and the Revolutionary War

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Talk to them about Bhopal India

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And the East India Trading Company

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Sounds like vegetables

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
History vegetables

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
No wonder I was dying

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I'm not even willing to do this

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
And I'm the coolest dad that could ever live

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Are you a dad now Dan?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
No I'm like you man

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I still got to fight to fight

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
No I'm just lazy and I don't want to talk

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
About Bhopal

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
That's kind of the problem

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
So I'm a hero for opting out of

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Reproduction

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
That's an option

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
That's my Syria

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Singleness

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Opting out is a

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Fine way to go

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
I don't know

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I know like

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
What I will say you were saying earlier

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Like what can be done

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
To like fight this and how do we actually fight it

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And like the answer is that

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Nobody

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
If you want to have a world where Nazis

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Don't regularly come back

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Into power and kill a shitload of people

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
And then they have to be fought

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And then they get like beaten down

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
For a little while and then 80 years later

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
They come back again if we don't want to have that world

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And we also want to live in a relatively free

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
And open society

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Nobody gets to be just

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
A comedy writer

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Which I was for a while

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Nobody gets to be just a whatever you do

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Nobody gets to be just a teacher or a hairdresser

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Or a construction worker

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
But it also has to be

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Involved in local politics

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Everybody has to be an anti-fascist

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Everybody has to put some responsibility

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
On themselves

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
To keep shit from getting fucked up

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Otherwise nobody gets fucked up again

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
We got to eat those history vegetables

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Well we got to eat those ideological vegetables

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Yeah

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
You know one of the

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Problems we have right now in our society

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
You look at some of the worst people

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Who are currently on sort of the site of the right

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Resistance right now

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And the people often who aren't

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Advocating it directly themselves

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
But who are saying things like that

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
600 million Muslims are radicalized terrorists

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And then a guy who reads them a bunch

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Goes and shoots up a mosque in Quebec City

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
That particular guy whose name

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I won't mention here

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Has a screenplay that he just couldn't

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Get sold in Hollywood

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
And Steve Bannon had some screenplays

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
That he just couldn't get sold

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And a lot of these guys who are currently

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Working outrage against immigrants and Muslims

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Have screenplays that they just couldn't sell

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Have TV pitches they couldn't sell

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
They're just failed screenwriters?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And failed stand-up comedians

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
A lot of them are failed stand-up comedians

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
You're a success

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
You're on a stage right now

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Thank you

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Proud boys founder Gavin McGinnis

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Couldn't quite hack it as a stand-up comedian

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And Dave Rubin's the same case

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
So they get into politics

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Because it's easier

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
To be good at this stuff

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Some of them succeed

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And the ones who are decent people and don't

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Go find something else to do with their time

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
But the ones who don't succeed and are shitty

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I can just be racist

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And then I can make a shitload of money

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Being racist and using the same tactics

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I learned to rile up a crowd

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
And get them to hate immigrants

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And they're focusing on politics

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Because it's the only place that they can

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Make a living because they're not quite

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Good enough to make us laugh

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yeah

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
It's the evil version of Christian rock

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I know four chords

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And I love Christ

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
A little

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I can either love learning chords

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So much that I learned six chords

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I could double down on my love of Christ

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
If I hear any

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Negative talk about Striper

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I'm leaving the stage right now

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Nobody's talking bad about Striper

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
It's the same thing

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I love Christ

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
The Christ

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I love Christ

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Two chords

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Smoke on the water

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You know if

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
If this Rick and Morty thing doesn't pan out

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
It should have been walking on water

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Wait, no notes

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
That's not...

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
What do you mean it should be walk on the water

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I'm saying that song was smoke on the water's

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Water's chords

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
So I was supposed to say walk on the water

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
If you got to the chorus, yeah

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Walk on the water

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Yes, I could have extended the bit

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
And see Dan, if you become a grifter

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
You never have to take notes again

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
I could busk

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Well, you're not going to keep your lifestyle

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
With that

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Also, I can't play those three chords

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I don't

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I don't even know what chord means

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Out of curiosity

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
What do you think a chord is

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I'm asking that

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Ironically, like...

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
It's a group of notes that

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Harmonize together

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I don't know, they work together

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Yeah

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And there's several different kinds of chords

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
What do you think the difference between a major

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
And a minor chord is

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Through the lens of a logic

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Pro user, the difference is that

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
The middle

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Line is either

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Closer to the bottom line

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Or closer to the top line

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
You're flattening the third

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
You're flattening one note

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
You're by half step

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Come at me, bitch

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
What do you think a sus chord is

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I think it's a sustained chord

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Generally

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Sustaining what

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Sustaining the chromatology

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I don't know, man

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Fuck you

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
What do you think the

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Overtone series is

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
It was the

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Follow-up to Downton Abbey

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
It was a

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Short-lived spin-off

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
The Overtones

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
They were always that family that was like

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Well, I think the servants took the wine

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Get out of here, Maud

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
And then they became the Overtones

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Are you more about the diatonic or the chromatic

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
You know, I

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I'll quote Donald Trump being quizzed

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
About the Bible and go, I think both

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Equally

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Remember that clip from him in the Camp J trailer

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
They were like, what, New Testament, Old Testament

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
He's like

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Both

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
So, so close to a hero

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I honestly

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
That's like Bob Roberts shit

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Like it's like

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Tanner-88, like fucking metahumor

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
You know

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Both, can I be president now

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Because if I can, you're the idiot

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
You proved that right

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Anyways

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
You playing the music, Rob?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
No, never

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Have you ever tried?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah, I played the tuba in high school

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
The tuba?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Are you talking tuba or sousaphone?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
No, tuba

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
That was, sousaphone were for people who played the tuba and wanted to

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Tubas were for people who couldn't play anything

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
But had to get a music credit

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Right

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Were you in a marching band?

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Sitting band

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Jeff, you got an email

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Because he has a 15 Bitcoin

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Price on his head

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
You stopped me

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Did you ever talk about that at all?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
You got an email

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Blackmailing you for 5 Bitcoin

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Oh, you did?

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Did you pay it?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
What did you do?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Jeff texted me, hey can you loan me 5 Bitcoin?

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I got an email today

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I happen to know

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Glenn Maxwell

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Who is really in deep shit right now

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
She's in the headlines now

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I haven't seen her in many years

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
But she

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Is a pal

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And she is probably

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
The procurus for Jeffrey Epstein's

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Sexual Trafficking

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Empire

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And I met her at a charity event

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And I believe Jeffrey Epstein was there too

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Is for Michael J. Fox's

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Parkinson's disease thing

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And we brought her on stage

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
And I sang a song to her

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And everything she said was a lie

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Because she couldn't talk about what she did

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Then we went out and hung out

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And we remained friends

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And as such, you're probably in her phone book

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Yes

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Greg Poops told me

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Get her number off of your phone

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And you did

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Every phone text that we have

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Is just her saying happy birthday

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And she said

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Jeff, I'm at the Soho house

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Do you want to come join me for lunch?

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And we'll get there and there's Hugh Laurie

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Sitting over there and we talk

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
About some of the questions

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Because she's

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
She's a very fascinating lady

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I didn't realize that she was

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Possibly

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
But you, because

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Applaud if you've received a spam

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Saying

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I'll read it

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I don't think this is like a Nigerian

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Like thing

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
We all get lots of spam

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And lots of emails saying that your social security number

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Has been compromised and whatever

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Confidentiality management

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Hello

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Comma

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And also it's signed by nobody

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
This whole thing sounds pretty fugazy

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
It has come to my attention

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
My

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Dave

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It has come to this author's attention

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
That you may be at risk

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
After a potential leak

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Regarding Jeffrey Epstein

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
The potential leak being

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Her phone

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Privacy and I believe

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I love this writing so bad

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I believe privacy and confidentiality

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Are very important in the world we live in

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
And I am willing to offer my services

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
To help

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
My services in helping

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Keep your confidentiality

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And privacy out of the public eye

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I have resources

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
And friends at all

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
The top social media sites

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
News outlets and government

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And governments

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
All the top governments

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
You are deep in the dark web now

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
We're talking top five governments here

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
By the way

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
This is Kevin Day

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I just wrote this

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I've worked

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
With

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I've

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Apostrophe

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Work with them in the past

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Helping others keep their privacy

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
In return I require

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
A one time payment of five bitcoin

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Sent

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
To

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
A link

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Once payment has been received

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
By my team

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
We'll get started

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Scrub on the internet to keep the privacy

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
We'll make sure

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
So

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
No one else got that

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Email

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Is that because they know

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
That Glenn Maxwell's phone number

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I truly believe

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
No one else is getting that email

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
And

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
But

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
I've humble bragged

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
That I was collateral damage of

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
FAP gate or whatever the fuck it was

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Because of various people

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Like

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It's not

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
It's truly I think what that

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Indicates you have actual knowledge

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
We could be like the young Turks

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Or some kind of web based news

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Agency like we have a scoop here

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Bellingcat

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Her phone's been hacked

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
To me that's what it suggests

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
What really freaks me out about that

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Email coming in today is that I almost posted

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
She sent me

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
You almost sent him five bitcoin

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Because you don't really understand what it's worth

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
But you were an early adopter and I keep telling you

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
You're a trillionaire

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I think it was my 30th birthday at

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
And she was my date

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
We threw a prom themed

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Based

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
And she came as my date

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I picked her up at the peninsula hotel

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And she said I've never been to a prom

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And so I went there and I got her corsage

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
And she said I've never done this

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I've only seen this in movies

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
And so I pick her up and we go to the thing

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
And

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
We took a photo together and then she sent me

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
A photo

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Frame in a sterling silver

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Like you know kind of 8x10 size frame

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
And I have that

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
And right before I saw that

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Clearly spammy

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Bullshit

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I almost posted that photo

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And said like this isn't going to age well

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Yeah

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
You should get rid of that photo

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Every time I

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
On my computer

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
I have the Guardian and I have Reuters

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
That comes up right off the bat

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And it's all day pictures

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Of

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Galen

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Standing next to Jeffrey Epstein

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Like I knew her

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
And I have a photo where I look like

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I'm the young Jeffrey Epstein

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
In that photo

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Rob Evans I see your knees twitching

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
You're a conflict journalist

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Do you have a take on this the Epstein

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Yeah the Epstein thing

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I think you should get rid of that picture man

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
That's not going to be good in about 3 months

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I want to take on his situation

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
But I have a fucking take on the Epstein thing

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I'm sure everyone does

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
60-40 I think 60%

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Of themselves

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Okay so here's my apparently

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Controversial take which is like

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
A suicide that

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Unwatched is murder

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Well

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
You could make a case that almost every

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Suicide in the US prison system

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
And there's a huge number of them is murder

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Wait but

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Do you know statistics about

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Prisoners who are of such

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Strategic

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Significance that

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.320
How often do they fail?

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.480
This is arguably the most important arrestee

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:12.120
in the history of criminal justice.

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.000
I don't know how to exaggerate it.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:14.960
Well, here's what I'll say.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.120
His suicide watch failing is murder.

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.600
He wasn't on Suicide Watch.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.440
He wasn't on Suicide Watch?

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.760
No, I'm taking it off.

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.640
Maybe that was part of the plot.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.360
Maybe they took him off.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.120
It's the last time, I'll say this,

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.320
the last time there was a prisoner

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.000
who was like this high profile was Lee Harvey Oswald,

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.840
and they didn't do a great job there.

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.600
Like, it wasn't a bang up protection gig.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.560
His was on camera.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.000
Yeah, well, here's a thing.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.280
Here's a funny little question to raise about Suicide Watch.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:52.280
Yeah, my neighbor's doorbell records my dog taking a shit.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.160
What's with these stories that come out

01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:00.800
from federal penitentiaries of the most notorious

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.840
potential witnesses?

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.520
I was like, well, we'll tell you what happened later.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.000
Like, wait, you can't put a little bubblegum size camera.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.920
The fact that he either committed suicide or was,

01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:18.720
it was the day that Ghislaine, all of her,

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:23.120
like this tranche of documents came out about him

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.280
and her involvement.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:27.080
And that's the day that he kills himself.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:28.480
That's either him going, oh, fuck it.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.480
I don't want to get involved in this.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.320
Steve Levy just sent me this link.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.640
It's in the New York Times where the staffer

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.160
on guard duty before it happened.

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.880
It was like, I was the guard on duty.

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.800
When my shift ended, a new guard came.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.760
I'd never seen him before.

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.720
I said, what's your name?

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.560
And he goes, Steve.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.560
And I said, Steve what?

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.200
And he looks around for a second, then said, JV.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.960
My name is Steve Jail.

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.680
I was tired in that same legit.

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.520
Steve Jail?

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.040
That's the person who would have been

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.400
on guard duty when he died.

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.520
Steve Jail.

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.240
Holy shit.

01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.360
This is some links from the New York Times.

01:47:58.360 --> 01:47:59.360
What the fuck?

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.360
Holy shit.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.200
Is that really from the New York Times?

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:07.000
It says that Steve, do you want to come out and confirm this?

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.600
At least hire somebody who went through UCB

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.320
to come up with a better name.

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:15.600
He didn't get that job by taking improv glasses.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.520
That's what it says.

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.400
That job description says, do you own piano wires?

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.360
I'm Steve Mafia.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:21.760
Yeah.

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.880
I'm Steve Murderer.

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.880
I'm Steve Prison.

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:25.120
And I'm Steve Assassin.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.200
I want to interject and say, I don't want to make light

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.560
of a fucking murder, because if that's what it is,

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.080
I also don't want to make light of a suicide

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.640
if that's what it is.

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.520
But it's so high profile, and there's

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.640
questions of rule of law here.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.840
I just don't understand.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.880
When you arrest a guy who has a safe

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.880
with a bunch of diamonds and a passport that's fake

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.760
and has an alternate identity in Saudi Arabia,

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:53.000
and everyone agrees, I imagine being this guy in a box

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.040
and going like, fuck, man, I never

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:59.640
thought in a million years that Trump would be president.

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.760
Because I think he thought he had all his bases covered

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.160
and was like, if it ever goes wrong with the Democrats,

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.160
I got every Republican in the world on my side.

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:13.440
And then he never foresaw the one thing that would fuck him

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.000
completely, which is the Republican Party being

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.120
hijacked by so much reality TV celebrity

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.680
that he's like, ha, I'm in this cell.

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.440
I've done it before.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.400
I'll do it again.

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:30.680
I have literally everybody on my, oh, shit, everybody?

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.520
There's not a single person in this world

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.040
that's going to stop me from being murdered now.

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.560
I don't know, man.

01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.840
Like, he was also pretty deep with Bill Clinton.

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.440
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.280
And I think if you boil it down to.

01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.080
So was Glenn.

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.080
Glenn was like a very type of Clinton.

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.440
I'm saying he was deep with Clinton and Trump,

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.240
and he didn't think Trump would become.

01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:56.080
He's like, hey, as long as I just keep this Rolodex up.

01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.600
I think you're making not the same mistake he made.

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.480
But in terms of where you're looking here as to his mistake,

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:04.280
I think you're making the same mistake he made,

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.480
which is that he looked at the top.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.080
That's very flattering.

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:09.600
What he did not pay attention to were the people at the bottom.

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.480
And what brought him down was not Trump becoming president.

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.680
What brought him down was a mix of two police detectives

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.720
who didn't care that it was the end of their career

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.600
to follow this case and a really, really dogged journalist

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:25.680
at a local paper in Florida who stayed on the case

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.040
like a fucking pit bull and wouldn't let it go.

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.400
So you've read about this.

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.440
Yeah, that's why fucking Epstein is dead right now.

01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.680
And the story, and this is one of the things

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.040
that I think is so fucked up about QAnon,

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.520
is when people imagine the pedophile conspiracy

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.520
that they think is at the center of world government,

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.800
they imagine five-year-old kids being

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.720
sacrificed by Satanists in the basement of a pizza place

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.840
and the actual conspiracy that will

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.440
have a huge amount of documentation.

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.200
What actually went on is that a bunch of rich, powerful people

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.040
around the world wanted to fuck high school girls.

01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.680
That's the whole conspiracy.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:00.800
They weren't six.

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.800
They weren't 10.

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.680
They were usually 15 to 17 years old.

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:06.680
That's what Jeffrey Epstein provided.

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.640
That's what all these billionaires and millionaires

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.400
and presidents and senators and members of the royal family

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.120
wanted as teenagers.

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.480
Wondering like right before.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.160
Weird flex, but OK.

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:23.200
Right before, the day before Jeffrey Epstein kills himself,

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.720
asking friends of mine that we all met Glenn

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.360
and we all hung out with her.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.560
And she's quite fascinating.

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:32.280
And she's a very interesting woman and multilingual

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:34.880
and just awesome.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:37.800
Wait, was she totally involved with this?

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:42.000
And I think all this paperwork came out,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.720
all these documents came out that would really

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:49.400
have affected Jeffrey Epstein and Trump, Bill Clinton,

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.720
the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Henry, all this shit.

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.440
And then he's dead.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.560
And the coup.

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:02.960
So Rob Evans, do you think Occam's razor says suicide?

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.280
This is one of those situations.

01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.920
I think Occam's razor applies to things

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:09.560
that you have some precedent for.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:12.160
I'm not aware of a situation in which a guy who

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.280
had a sitting president, a former president,

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.920
the Sultan of Brunei, a member of the royal family,

01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:21.040
several sitting senators, most of the fucking granite.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:24.840
And a guy named Gary Jail checking in to make sure

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.080
he doesn't kill himself.

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.360
So like, is it possible?

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.440
Steve Jail.

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:29.560
Steve Jail.

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.480
Get his name right.

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.520
Sorry, what are you saying?

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:33.960
Is it possible he was murdered?

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:34.840
Fuck it, of course.

01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.800
He pissed out like a lot of people

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.200
had a vested interest in him dying.

01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.360
So yeah, there's a real good chance he was murdered.

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.640
Is it also possible that a guy who had only ever lived

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.120
like as the richest, one of the richest people in the world

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:48.640
and who was used to having every whim catered to,

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.520
was broken by a few weeks of prison

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.480
and just decided to end it because he couldn't take it?

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:52.980
Sure.

01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:55.800
Well, but he, I mean, he did it before.

01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:57.320
He made it before.

01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:57.560
Yeah.

01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.680
Yeah, but that was a real fucking different story.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.160
Well, I mean, it was a different story, especially

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:03.880
now that it turned out this way.

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.160
He was looking at like basically a life sentence.

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:11.080
My thing of us about rule of law, because if you,

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.800
now we're all focused on this autopsy,

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.240
and I'm like, who cares if the autopsy says it?

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.760
Yeah, big FD.

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.000
Like, remember, you could go into this guy's cell,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.040
and I'm sorry, I must be frustrating you

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:26.600
because I'm like, oh, imagine the fucking,

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.600
I'm like the liberal QAnon.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:35.600
But I'm like, if you wanted to kill this detainee,

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:42.440
like it is as easy as literally like sliding open

01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:49.840
a thing on his cell and going like, my name is Steve Jail.

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:53.000
I am never going to come into that cell.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.880
Like, you know what to do.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.960
Right, that's the thing.

01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.720
It's like when a person is in that dire straits,

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:03.800
actively not keeping them from killing themselves

01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:06.960
is murder, regardless of conspiracy.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.440
What I think you might be dancing around is that.

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.760
Is that there was a failure to protect one of the most

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.320
powerful pawns in the history of chess.

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:17.280
That's not the story.

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.680
The story is that if you want someone dead

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:21.800
and you want them dead by their own hand,

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.440
the easiest way to guarantee that is make them

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.080
be a normal prisoner in a US maximum security prison.

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:32.480
Because that'll pretty much do the fucking job for you.

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:35.760
But he was in a New York prison.

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.840
It was a New York federal detention facility.

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.160
But he was like alone in a cell.

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.160
Right, alone.

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.400
He didn't have a cellmate.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.160
You're almost describing the threat

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.640
of being thrown into general pop.

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:46.140
I get that.

01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:48.960
What I'm also describing is being isolated.

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.440
If I apply what I would assume my Occam's razor is to that,

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:57.080
is that what you said is that he said, fuck it.

01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.240
I've been in jail since early July.

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.000
And I'm looking at being in jail for the rest of my life.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.040
And he just said, the first moment, I'm alone.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.440
And it's our job to keep these people alive.

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.920
I'm outraged about Jeffrey Dahmer dying in prison.

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:13.240
Like, there is something.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:18.880
We have this attitude about bad people in our society

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.720
where we're just like, lock them away.

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:22.520
And I hope they get raped to death.

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:23.480
And I hope they die.

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.840
I hope they kill themselves.

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.640
Yeah, Zach, you've got to be, I want to hear MC Steve Jail.

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.440
No, stop it.

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.560
Steve Jail.

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.920
Don't do it even as a joke.

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:32.420
Get them away.

01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.920
This is what I want to hear what you have to say about it.

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:35.640
Can I bring this around seamlessly to something

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.360
that ties it back to the original topic

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.480
and is also uplifting?

01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.680
Oh, yeah.

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:41.520
So I'm in fucking Syria.

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.800
And I'm talking to these guys.

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.400
I know uplifting when I hear it.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.080
So I'm talking to these guys who have been, all of these people,

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:50.760
men and women, who have just been dealing

01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.680
with this brutal war against ISIS.

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.360
And the last survivors of the caliphate,

01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.720
they have in a prison, well, it's part prison camp,

01:55:58.720 --> 01:55:59.560
part refugee camp.

01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:00.840
There's 71,000 people.

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:03.360
Not all of them are ISIS survivors, but a lot of them

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:03.920
are.

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.400
And they've got them locked in this camp.

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.480
And they're trying to figure out, what do we do with them?

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.320
And one of the first things that happens

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.200
is they start trying to send a lot of these people back

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.560
to Iraq, because a lot of them are Iraqi and origin,

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:15.960
or that was their port of entry.

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.320
And as soon as they send them back,

01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:18.720
they do it with a bunch of French fighters.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.960
And France says, we're not going to take these people.

01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.360
Fuck them.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.560
They're not French anymore.

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.080
And Iraq hangs them the same day.

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.440
That's just what they do in Iraq.

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.160
So far, not so uplifting.

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.000
Not uplifting yet.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.120
The Rojavan Constitution says, the death penalty is illegal.

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:37.240
You cannot kill a prisoner under any circumstances.

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:38.320
It's not OK.

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.120
So they stopped sending prisoners over to Iraq,

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.680
who are ISIS fighters.

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.160
And so I'm talking to these people.

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.440
I'm trying to understand, because me and my partner Jake,

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.640
we both had reported from the fighting against ISIS.

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:52.040
And in my case, at least, I've been shot at by these people.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:54.480
I've also spent hours and hours and hours talking to people

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.040
who've been tortured and beaten from them,

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:57.760
had family members killed.

01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.400
And I'm sitting and I start by talking to one

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.280
of the women who's planning out their criminal justice system

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.280
and trying to build this thing from the ground up

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:07.920
to be more equitable than the one in Syria, which is not

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.520
exactly a super hard story.

01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.200
But they're trying to do a better job.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:17.440
And she's like, no, revenge is a sign of weakness.

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.960
And revenge is also something that

01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:20.760
has been endemic in this part of the world,

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:22.120
in particular, for centuries.

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.840
And it's part of why we have so much violence,

01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.400
is one member of this family kills another,

01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.560
and they kill a member of their family.

01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.400
What we have to do is rehabilitation.

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.240
And so at first, I'm talking to this lady, who's

01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:33.240
in like, we're in a nice office room

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.760
while she's dealing with ISIS prisoners and stuff.

01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:38.000
And I'm like, well, you're used to talking with the press.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.360
There's a good chance you're putting on a show for me.

01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:41.920
So we get down to the ground level

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.160
to this actual prison camp, where

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.800
they're keeping all these ISIS detainees.

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.800
And we start talking to their guards,

01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.840
to these people who have.

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.360
Like, I talked to this one woman who

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.360
was telling me a story about how the day before she'd

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.840
been with this ISIS bride and her kids.

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.960
And the bride had knocked her down.

01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:58.520
And her kid had, one of her kids had bitten her on the arm.

01:57:58.520 --> 01:57:59.760
And she showed me the bite mark, where

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:02.000
this kid had ripped through the skin of her arm with his teeth.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.280
And the other kid had gone off to try to get a gas can

01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:07.560
to pour gasoline on her before her other comrades had gotten

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.520
them off.

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:10.600
And I'm like, what do you want to be done to these people?

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.360
And she's like, the only thing we can do

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.040
is try to rehabilitate them, is try to treat them well,

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.480
and take care of them, and eventually hope

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.080
that it gets through to some of them,

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.640
and particularly get through to their kids.

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:25.360
Because that's all you can do, is try to rehabilitate people

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:27.120
and be better than the people before.

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.680
Because if we just start killing them,

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:30.680
because we don't think they can be fixed,

01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.040
then we're exactly the same as the Dashi's, as ISIS.

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:36.560
And then I start talking to the other guards, these young men

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.880
with AK-47s, about what do you think should be done.

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.720
And they all have the same, like, we

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.160
have to try to fix these people.

01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.280
We have to try to help them.

01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:47.680
Because otherwise, this is fucked.

01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.280
Otherwise, this whole region is fucked.

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:51.800
If we can't get past all this violence, everything is fucked.

01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:54.040
And for a little bit of perspective,

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.360
when I'd been in Mosul at the end of the fighting,

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:59.560
I'd been talking to people who had fled the city

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:00.880
during the fighting against ISIS.

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.080
And I would ask people, what do you

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.600
plan to do when you get back?

01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.680
And almost everyone's answer was, well,

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.520
this neighbor of mine went with ISIS.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:08.560
And he informed on me.

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:10.200
And that's why I had to leave town,

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:12.760
or why my car got taken away, or why I wound up in prison.

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.400
So I'm going to tell on him to the Iraqi authorities and stuff.

01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.680
And it was like this cycle of violence being perpetuated.

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.600
And all the Kurds we talked to, and the Arabs we talked to

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.640
at this camp who were part of this thing going on in Rojava,

01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.320
were like, you can't fucking do that anymore.

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.680
It has to stop somewhere.

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:30.920
So we're going to try to stop it.

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:35.440
And that, to me, was the most uplifting thing

01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.840
that I saw there.

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:40.160
And we spent some time with this group of older women who

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:41.920
were part of the Neighborhood Council, who

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:46.160
were doing kind of what cops do in the United States,

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.920
like the civil side of law enforcement.

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.440
So they were the elected representatives

01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.520
of this neighborhood.

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:54.280
And they would go around, and one of the things they did

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:56.800
is when there was a murder, obviously you solve the murder.

01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.560
You try to solve the murder, and you try to get the murderer

01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:00.120
in jail.

02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:02.600
And it's usually pretty obvious who's done it.

02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.080
But you also have to deal with the fact

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.400
that there's two families that now hate each other.

02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.400
And so you have counseling sessions

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:09.640
between the two families, where you

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:12.000
try to figure out what the family of the murderer

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.560
can give the murdered in order to try to set things to right.

02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:19.600
And sometimes it's months of dealing with these conversations.

02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:22.000
And at the end of it, they throw a big feast

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.280
between both of the families and everyone else in the area,

02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:27.040
so that everybody sees this beef getting squashed,

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.240
so that there's public shame on the side of whoever it is.

02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.680
If another family starts up the vendetta again,

02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:35.200
then everyone knows they're the ones breaking the peace

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.200
this time.

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.880
And this was at the undergirding of everything

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:39.600
that they've done.

02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.920
And so I'm talking to these old ladies

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.560
about the fact these women who had lived 50, 60 years

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:48.480
under the Syrian regime, not able to hold a job,

02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.440
not able to have any role in governance,

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:53.000
and who are now acting as like their own local government

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.520
for their neighborhoods.

02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.120
And I asked them, could you ever go back to the way things

02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.160
were before?

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.440
And they were like, oh no, they'd have to fucking kill us.

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:05.960
And later that night, my fixer, Habat,

02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:09.120
takes us to the graveyard at the end of the day.

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:12.200
And you can see the graveyard on picture 5.

02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:15.040
And I want to show that because it's kind of noteworthy.

02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:17.720
So these are the way they do graves in that part of the world.

02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:20.600
Every single grave you can see is a garden.

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:22.480
So they plant flowers in all of the graves

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:25.280
so that every grave is a sprout of life.

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.320
And as we're walking through this graveyard, which

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:31.440
is all soldiers in this who died fighting the Islamic State,

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.800
we're walking and we're talking.

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:35.080
And my fixer, Habat, is explaining to us

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.280
how this justice system works and the important she believes

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.040
should be placed on rehabilitation

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.760
and how you can't just try to hurt people.

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.760
You can't just kill these people even though they kill

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:44.240
your families.

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.200
Like if you capture a nice guy.

02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.280
You have to try to keep him alive and rehabilitate him.

02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.000
And right after explaining this, we're

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.400
walking through this graveyard.

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.480
And she stops at a grave and kneels down and kisses it

02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.400
and says, this was my brother.

02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:02.640
He died fighting ISIS at the age of 17 in 2014.

02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.920
So like that to me was the thing that was like,

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.400
hit me like a fucking bullet.

02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:12.000
That somebody can have an experience like that, which

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.480
should be a generator of so much hate.

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.760
And can in the proper environment

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.880
and with the proper amount of hope and with, you know,

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.760
an acceptance of the realities of the situation,

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.280
take from that that things can still be better.

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.240
Yeah, and then literally grow a flower.

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.640
Thank you all.

02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:33.080
Wait, give it up for Rob, everybody.

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.560
Jeff, wait.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:35.200
Sorry?

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.720
Levy just texted me again.

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:38.200
Steve Jail is fake.

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:38.960
It's a hoax.

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:39.960
Steve Jail.

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.200
Ah, Steve Jail.

02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:44.000
Cliff Hanger, thank you all for giving up for Rob Evans,

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.160
everybody, Rob.

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.040
Rob Evans.

02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:49.040
We'll see you next week.

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.240
Thanks for coming.

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.400
Spencer Crittenden.

02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:53.000
Thanks, guys.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.800
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.640
Your mayor is Dan Harmon.

02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:58.240
One more time for Rob Evans.

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.480
That's a beautiful thing to find uplifting things

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.000
in a horrible, horrible world.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.960
You know what, tonight, drive slow and don't take chances.

02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.400
Zach, you got beat?

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.560
He's playing one.

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:15.800
There we are.

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:17.560
Give it up for Zac McKeever up there.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.480
Did you get any of that?

02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.640
It's a good show.
