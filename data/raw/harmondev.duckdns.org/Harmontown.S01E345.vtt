{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.000\nHello gang, how are y'all doing?\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:32.000\nTasting, tasting, one, two, three from MacArthur Park where it's still melting in the dark\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:40.000\nParliament Town is now in session\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:54.000\nSpencer Crittenden, would you please join us on stage, the Game Master extraordinaire\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:01.000\nSo let's bring out the Mayor of Parliament Town, Dan Harvett\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:10.000\nHip to the hop, never stop, saw your mama on a raft on a lake\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:14.000\nSaw your mama for goodness sake, saw your mama going up and down\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nSaw your mama dancing in a sprinkler shape like a clown\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:24.000\nShe got wet, I laid down a hundred dollar bet that she couldn't swim in the water coming out\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:27.000\nFuck it so hard, in the mouth, okay gross, gross\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:31.000\nOkay stop, we go until we get gross, that's the new rule, I like that\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nDid you win the bet?\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:34.000\nYes\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:35.000\nOh okay\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nAlso, who was the other person on the other end of that hundred dollar bet?\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:45.000\nI have all the same questions you do\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.000\nI only have one item in my notepad\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:48.000\nOh yeah\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nBut we've got a great guest who's very provocative and wonderful to talk to\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nSo you don't want me to have more in my notepad\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nBut I already texted Jeff about this today, look\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nOkay we have so many questions I have about this\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nBut you know I texted you his whole monologue so don't\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:11.000\nSo you know to let me get to the all the way to the end and then we can all discuss\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:14.000\nI want you to lay it down as you found it\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nSo I will admit and I don't do this all the time\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:21.000\nIt was just kind of a weird impulse I had, like life's going good\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:27.000\nAnd I left my new home and I knew the work I had to do\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nI knew how long I had to do it and I was kind of like\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nI was like I'm gonna stop at this bar\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nAnd it's 1130am and I'm gonna have one before work\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:41.000\nAnd I'm not usually that guy, I don't judge those guys\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:44.000\nYour name is Cliff Clavin\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nAnd I wouldn't be embarrassed if I was that guy\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nBut I was like I'm gonna give this a try and also I'm in a new neighborhood\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:54.000\nSo I wanted to see what is the new neighborhoods bar like at 1130am\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:58.000\nWell I'm not going back because it's fucking packed\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nIt's like a Friday night for them because it's a different\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.000\nThe drawing room I'm really learning is something incredibly special\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:11.000\nSo I'll probably be making the trek to continue to drink there when I'm in that day drinking mood\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nBecause this was like a TGI Fridays\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nBut there was this guy, well I had my one drink\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:22.000\nI just eavesdropped and I heard a monologue from a guy\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:26.000\nThat made me finish my drink very quickly\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nSettle up in cash and fast walk to my car\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:32.000\nSo I could finish transcribing it without him knowing I was writing down everything\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd you sent me and Dino a group text\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nAnd we had a conversation about it which I'm glad for\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:42.000\nBecause you would be cutting me off every five words if I just read this\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nYou'd be like wait a minute\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nBut this is what I texted my two friends\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nDan has two friends\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:57.000\nI just ran out to the car and I didn't stand a chance of not getting this all verbatim\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nNow I am going to do this in his authentic patois\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:08.000\nHe was a six foot five-ish African-American man\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:14.000\nSo I'm going to, you know, it wasn't like, look\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nIf we've learned nothing else this week\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nWe've learned to ask what's racist\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:25.000\nBut I just want to be authentic because it's more the working class nature of his ranch\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nYou're doing a authentic\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nI'm not going to pretend he's from Jersey\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:34.000\nBut I'm not going to be like the crows in Dumbo\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nI'm not doing a thing\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nI don't think it's funny that he talks the way he does\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nI just want you to understand\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:47.000\nThis is a working class monologue from a very specific archetype\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nWhat age are we talking?\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nI would put him at 55, 60\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\n55, 6 foot 4 black gentleman\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nAnd he is at the bar next to you\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nHe was holding court for sure\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:08.000\nAnd I could tell you some politically incriminating shit that he said before this\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nBut I don't want to put him in one category or another\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:17.000\nI just found this monologue so fucking fascinating in a vacuum\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:22.000\nI think just start with the narrative and then we can go back to that if we need to\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:27.000\nOkay, so I'm going to try to do this very tastefully\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nBut I'm also going to try to do it authentically\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nWhich is how every tasteful story starts\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nI'm going to try to be tasteful\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nOkay\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nLou Diamond Phillips, okay\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:43.000\nLou Diamond Phillips\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nHe parked 3 feet from the curb\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:56.000\n36 inches\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nSo I'm writing the ticket\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nAnd he comes out, what are you doing? Why are you giving me a ticket?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:07.000\nI said, sir, the law is your car needs to be a minimum of 18 inches from the curb\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:11.000\nHe says, oh that's bullshit, that's bullshit\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou know, so I said, okay, I'll make you a deal\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nYou can take the ticket\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nOr I can call a tow truck\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:21.000\nAnd you know it's going to be much more expensive\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\nAnd then his wife comes out and she was much more subtle\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.000\nMore kind\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nSo I eventually said, okay, I'm not going to call the tow truck\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nBecause I like Lou Diamond Phillips\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nYou know what I'm saying? I like his movies\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nBut he came out like an asshole\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:49.000\nAnd all I'm saying is, so what makes his job more exalted than mine?\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nHe can do his job, but I can't do mine\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nWhy is that? And I ran from the bar\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nAfter waiting, I was going to wait\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nI was like, I'm like thumb nailing notes\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nBut he quieted, he simmered down\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:07.000\nBecause the people he was holding court with, they were all like, I don't know\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:11.000\nI don't know, Todd, you're fun to listen to\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nBut I don't know what you want us to say\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nIs he the hero of that story?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nOr for him, he certainly is\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nI think he's the absolute villain\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nJust think about the conversation you and I had\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:29.000\nI absolutely 100% side with Lou Diamond Phillips in this story\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nI would first answer this man's question\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nNot that I would have wanted any beef with him\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nBut the answer to his rhetorical question is\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nThe reason Lou Diamond Phillips can do his job and you can't do yours is\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:45.000\nBecause his job is to make people happy and yours is to make people sad\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nAnd that's no fault of yours, but not accepting that is weird\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nWhy does Lou Diamond Phillips get to be celebrated?\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nHe's a celebrity\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:59.000\nWas there no contrition on Lou Diamond Phillips' part about parking\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nA foot farther away from the curb than he's supposed to\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nThis is the only narrative you're going to get\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nHere's the quotes from Lou Diamond Phillips\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nHe said it's bullshit\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnd he heard the reason, he's like, it's bullshit\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nThat's what we got and we know his wife was very supple and smooth\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nAnd she got him out of the tow truck\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nBut it sounds like Lou Diamond Phillips\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nLike any person that parks three feet from the curb\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nWhich I do want to be a law\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nBecause that is 36 inches and that is extreme\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nIt sounds like he had to pay the same ticket\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:37.000\nThat a garbage man or a parking enforcement officer off duty would have to pay\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nIt doesn't sound like he'd actually cut away with anything\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nIt in fact kind of sounds, from my perspective, assuming this was 20 years ago\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nOr this guy is the biggest Lou Diamond Phillips fan in the world\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nThat the only difference between Lou Diamond Phillips and a parking enforcement officer\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nOr a normal person getting a parking ticket is that because he's famous\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:00.000\nThis guy has been telling this story for 20 years\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nWhereas otherwise it wouldn't have been a big deal\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nI hope it was like yesterday or within the last week\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nIt has to be recent\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nThen that guy's got to be...\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nAnd here's my one other thought about answering his rhetorical question\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nThe other reason he can do his job and you can't do yours\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nIs because God gave you and Lou Diamond Phillips\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:26.000\nBoth one chance at coping with Lou Diamond Phillips' fame\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nAnd you're blowing it\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:33.000\nAnd Lou Diamond Phillips has made a lot of movies that I know you haven't seen\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nYou didn't see bats in the theater, I did\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nI know Lou Diamond Phillips is good\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nHave you guys seen bats?\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:46.000\nEverybody right now, in your mind, name four Lou Diamond Phillips films\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nAnd you only get one Young Guns\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nI actually forgot Young Guns\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nAnd I was like for sure LaBamba, he must be thinking about LaBamba\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut you had a very good point, like Young Guns\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\nYour theory on it was he went into law enforcement because of Young Guns\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nYeah, because Lou Diamond Phillips is his...\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nThe reason why he started to go into law enforcement\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nIs because Lou Diamond Phillips\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:19.000\nWho is the kind of representative of stoic morality\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nAnd then he meets Lou Diamond Phillips\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nWho's parked too far away from the curve\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nHe's like I wanted to be the Young Gun of parking enforcement or the LAPD\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nNo, he wanted to be in the FBI\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nHe wanted to be another thing\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:36.000\nYou don't go into parking enforcement because that was your end game\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nThat was your thing\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:43.000\nI just wonder how many people weren't assholes that come across him doing his job\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nHis job is to really reign on people's parade\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nAnd that's not his fault\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nWhat if Lou Diamond Bamba was just on a bad day?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nI call him Lou Diamond Bamba because there was an MTV interview\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:02.000\nOn MTV a long time ago, what's the worst soundtrack you ever heard?\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:07.000\nAnd he goes, what's the worst moment in movie history?\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:11.000\nAnd they asked a guy in New York who was from Brooklyn\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:16.000\nHe goes, it's when that Lou Diamond Bamba comes out and he goes, you know what?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nYou're alright\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nBut he called him Lou Diamond Bamba\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nThat was one of the thoughts I had as I got into the car\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:30.000\nI was like, wait a minute, you never changed your middle name to parking enforcement, I bet\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nThat's a safe bet\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:39.000\nObviously at some point Lou Diamond Phillips or his parents decided he was destined for success\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nThe story of the thing that you ever heard\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:46.000\nThere was a guy at a bar talking about being a parking enforcement official\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nAnd Lou Diamond Bamba was being an asshole\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nWas Lou Diamond Bamba on a bad day?\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nWell, yeah, I don't know\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nThat's a question for him, yeah, for sure\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:58.000\nI mean, who knows?\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nWhen do you park three feet from a curb?\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nIs it because you think that's within your right to do so?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nOr is it because he was with his wife?\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nMaybe she was...\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nWe don't know, they could have been outside a hospital\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nI'm not trying to...\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nBut then you said the guy was...\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:12.000\nVictim blame\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nThen you said the victim being a guy who didn't enjoy writing a ticket\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nBut the guy was at the bar, then he was watching TV and he called women bitches for...\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nYeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nI already knew the guy was like...\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nIt's a thing that's like...\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:30.000\nI interpreted everything he was saying as like a projection of...\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nYou know, this is the thing\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nIt's like people thinking...\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nThis is why I tend to side with the celebrities\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:40.000\nI tend to side with the publicly shamed\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nI tend to side with the visible\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:48.000\nBecause I think that people tend to project onto luminaries\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:53.000\nThis like privilege that may be partially true\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:57.000\nI mean, I'm not being like a fucking pure apologist and going...\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nOh boy, the actors go to their job and they just work so hard\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nIt's harder than coal mining\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nI'm not implying that\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nI will say it's a very hard fucking job\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:10.000\nI should know, I have fucking worked actors very hard\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nI've driven them to the brink\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nAnd then I've said, with a Kubrickian flair\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nGreat, now put film in the camera\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nBecause I needed that\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:27.000\nFrom Danny Pootie in that moment\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:32.000\nAnd you loved it, and that's why you're here\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:37.000\nI know somebody that ran into Keanu Reeves on a bad day\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nKeanu Reeves was being like, surly\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nAnd he's like, fuck Keanu Reeves, he was a fucking asshole\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.000\nYou ask anybody else? Keanu Reeves, super cool\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nBut you can't get one pass if you're a famous person\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nBecause if you have a bad moment with somebody, then that's your thing\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nI just kind of bristle at that culture of like, go...\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nIt's that Dire Straits video refrigerator guy\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nLike, look at that faggot, he's got his own airplane\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nHe must be doing something right\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nAnd it's like, because in that monologue, the guy says\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nAnd I like...\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nWhat do you mean you like Lou Timewood Phillips?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nWhy don't you hate him now?\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nIs it because you think that...\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nObviously, you believe that he won the lottery\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nHe didn't earn anything, otherwise you wouldn't be asking the question\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nWhy is his job so much more exalted?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:32.000\nYou're implying that he's the recipient of pure, undeserved privilege\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nAt the same time as you're saying like, and I like him\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nThat's the thing, which is a very familiar thing to me\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nIt rings this bell in me where I'm like, ugh\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nYou know, every interaction you have with somebody who's just a little bit off in there\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nLike, oh, your girlfriend's tits or whatever\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd you go like, hey, why don't you go fuck yourself?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nAnd they're like, I'm kidding, I'm kidding\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nYou write Rick and Morty, why don't you fucking learn?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\nYou're rich, aren't you swimming in a pool full of money?\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nWhy don't you fucking learn to take a joke?\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nAnd it's like, there's something off here with this relationship\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nAnd it's coming from a projection on the part of someone who's asking themselves\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nWhat would I do if I were Keanu Reeves?\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:12.000\nAnd if their answer is dark enough, Keanu Reeves is guilty of those crimes\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:16.000\nAnd I think that's like a very fundamentally wrong\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:21.000\nCan you conjure up a memory of when you think that you might have misbehaved\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nAnd that's going to color somebody's memory of...\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nOh, I'm sure it's all the time\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.000\nAs much as I love it when people interact with me\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nWhat can I ever do?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:37.000\nI'm not a good person, I'm not a pleasant person to be around\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:46.000\nI'm also not an actor, so I never consider it my job to be like publicly fucking digestible\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nNo, but you are\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nYou're not as efficient for that, but thank you\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:54.000\nNo, I'm just saying, if somebody were to know who I was\n\n15:54.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd if somebody were to know who I was and on top of that by whatever coincidence\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:10.000\nTheir fault or not their fault, I'm not getting a perfect fucking...\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nI didn't get a drink for an hour or whatever\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nI don't know, like they might end up with a story about something I said that was kind of like dickish\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:21.000\nSpencer, when we did the Harmon Tour documentary thing\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nWe watched you go through your first on camera\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nI'm a person that people want to meet\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd you were kind of mistrustful or...\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:38.000\nGoing through the scrutiny of strangers liking you for either some reason or no reason or whatever\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nYeah\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nThat's right, Jeff\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nWe'll be right back\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:51.000\nI remember there's this story where we were doing the up fronts\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:56.000\nRemember when we did the CISO thing at New York or whatever, it was that terrible terrible\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:00.000\nWe played with the love makers or whatever\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:05.000\nWe did a test of Harmon Quest or something, it was a fucking nightmare\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:10.000\nAfterwards, there was someone who was backstage that was a fan or something\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:17.000\nThat was like, hey, great show, that was literally the worst experience, the worst show I've ever done\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:22.000\nAnd I just remember giving that guy the cold shoulder and I just carried that with me\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nI'm like, you can't treat people like that, you can't talk to fans\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nI wasn't like, go fuck yourself or whatever\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:32.000\nBut I think that if someone had that interaction, they would be all like, oh, that was kind of a bummer\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.000\nAnd so anytime I interact with fans, I think of that\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nAnd it's like, well, I never want to do that again\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:42.000\nAnd you know what? I found out pretty recently that that fan wasn't a fan at all\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nIt was Tom Sharpling\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\nAnd so I feel really, really shitty about it now\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nWait, who's that?\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nI thought you'd feel better\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:57.000\nNo, because like that's like, I don't know, that's like if you were like, oh, and it turned out I like mouthed off to, you know, Keanu Reeves or something\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nOh, because you were right\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nAnd when you say not a fan, you don't mean dislikes\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nNo, but I just thought it was some random fan\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:08.000\nBut then someone else that you would admire and whose opinion would matter a lot to you\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:13.000\nRight, or just like, it's like if one person just had one bad interaction with me\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:16.000\nAnd they just, you know, they told that story, that's one thing\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:21.000\nBut if it's like, oh, there's this guy who could potentially, you know, talk about me in circles or something like that\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:28.000\nI learned a long time ago like, you walk off stage and you have, you thought you had a shitty show\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nOh, I did\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nAnd then somebody comes up to you and goes, I would love that show\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:38.000\nYou really shouldn't say, no, that show sucked, you're wrong\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:41.000\nYou just say thank you\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:46.000\nAnd because if they had a good time, like the, but what if they're lying?\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:50.000\nIf they walk up and say that, then they're a liar\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:55.000\nBut if they're saying that and they mean it, like you just walk away and say thank you\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:59.000\nBut I also think you, yeah, you never deflect a compliment\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:04.000\nLike, which means just like, you're wrong, what you just said is wrong\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nYou have bad taste in experiences and people\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:11.000\nBut you don't, you don't have to do the opposite of that\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:15.000\nWhich is like, for me, oh my god, thank you\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:20.000\nYou could, I've come to go, I was told to stop doing that\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:24.000\nAnd I went from doing that to just going like, thank you so much, that's really nice of you to say\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:28.000\nI thought I did horribly, so that's great, you're helping me by feeling that way\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nAnd then they'll go, no, I thought it was great, I was like, well, jeez, maybe it was great\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nThank you for saying that, you're helping me out\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nSome of the worst shows I've ever done got the most praise\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nAnd I don't know why people said that, but\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nOh, because they're idiots, they don't know\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nRight, they get off their tractors and they're like yippie-de-doop-a-doo\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.000\nOh, I'm gonna go see a famous person\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:52.000\nOh boy, but they're nailing it, I wouldn't know, I got a marble for a brain\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nJust kidding, I'm kidding\n\n19:55.000 --> 20:00.000\nThat's what that guy thinks Lou Diamond Phillips thinks when he gets in his car\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nHe thinks that's why Lou Diamond Phillips parked that far from the curb\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:07.000\nHe's like, who's gonna give me a ticket, some marble brain?\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:11.000\nI was in Young Guns, that's not what Lou Diamond Phillips was thinking\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nAnd you said to me in the text, because you were inflamed about this, you said\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:20.000\nI wasn't inflamed, I was having fun taking Lou Diamond's Phillips side\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:26.000\nYou were excited, and you said, ask that guy to name two other movies beside LaBamba\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:30.000\nThat Lou Diamond Phillips, he wouldn't be able to do it\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nHe might've got two\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nBut I actually forgot Young Guns, which is interesting\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:39.000\nBecause I was actually thinking of Lou Diamond Phillips as kind of like LaBamba\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:45.000\nAnd then made the most of like, been in a dozen movies that are just hard to recall\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:50.000\nLike 1997's Bats, which is fucking amazing, and he's great in it\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nThat's peeked Phillips\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nSee Bats, it's a horror movie\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nIf you were to dare that guy to name two more movies beside LaBamba\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:01.000\nHe could've gone Young Guns and Young Guns 2, and you would've been out a hundred bucks\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:04.000\nAlright, our next guest\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:08.000\nWhat if it was Lou Diamond Phillips?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:15.000\nIf we were a proper podcast, this whole thing would've been a tee-up to bring out\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:19.000\nLou Diamond Bamba and the whole crowd would've gone fucking berserk\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:23.000\nIf I deserved my podcast pulpit, I would also have the parking enforcement guy out\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:28.000\nAnd I would do some real fucking work, like the guy that does heavyweight for gimlet media\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:33.000\nThere's people out there doing real work, I don't know why I continue to advertise space\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.000\nI think we have the juice to get Lou Diamond Phillips on the show\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nWell, don't insult him\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nNo, I...\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nOr you won't get him on\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nI'm insulting our audience\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nAlright, so our guest tonight has been a guest before\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nI believe he was a guest last time on the days\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nIt better be Lou Diamond fucking Phillips\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:54.000\nThere really wasn't an audience, but I gotta say\n\n21:54.000 --> 22:00.000\nIf I had to name three man crush occupations\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:05.000\nThere was the guy I met who was an Irish firefighter\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:09.000\nWho I'm like, jeez, they fight that too?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:17.000\nIt's a little racist, but I used to think I was Irish before I sent my spin into a fucking computer\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:20.000\nI'm pretty sure that's the definition of racism\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nStill, though, for all I knew I was Irish\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:25.000\nYou don't think other cultures fight fires?\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:31.000\nI just... look, when I engage in the stereotype of the Irish being fighty\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nI mean, it's the same as them being poets and singers\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nI'm like, oh, I got hearts in my eyes\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nI want to be Irish so bad\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nAnd then to be a firefighter, an Irish firefighter\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nI'm just saying\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nIn your mind, you think Irish... it's the little leprechaun guy\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nActually, you're like fist fighting a fire\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nNo, I think it's a fucking badass dude that's like\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nOh, well, you think you love me, but you don't\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nGet up off the floor now\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nI'm going to sing a song with me fists\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nThey're beautiful people, they're super natural\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nTheir cereal has magical...\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nNo, stop it\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nSee, that shit's offensive, but anyways\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nCan we please, our guest is waiting in the wings\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:13.000\nThis is the... I don't know what the third man crush occupation would be\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:17.000\nBut as far as two-word occupations, this is right there\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nWho knows if it's number one or number two?\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nAfter Irish firefighter\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nOr before, I'm not sure\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:24.000\nPlease welcome Conflict Journalist\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nFucking come on\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nPut your dicks down\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nAnd lift your pants back up for Rob Evans\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nRob Evans?\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nWhat up, Rob?\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nWell, Dan answered my question as to whether or not\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nI was going to try a really offensive Irish accent\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nAs soon as I got out on stage, so I don't have to now\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nThank you for that\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nHave you been to Ireland and you're Conflict Journaling?\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nNo, not for Conflict\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nFires? No\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nSee, I don't think so\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nAre you ethnically descended from the Irish people?\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:16.000\nNot at all, but I can sing every word of come out you black and tans\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nDo you really want to sing with him?\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nHe does, but don't take that as anything\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nWhat's the song?\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nCome out you black and tans\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nIt's an old IRA song about beating up British paramilitaries\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nIn the streets of Dublin\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nGive us the fresh refrain of that\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nCome out you black and tans\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nCome out and fight me like a man\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:39.000\nShow your wife how you won medals out in Flanders\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:43.000\nTell her how the IRA made you run like hell away\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:47.000\nFrom the green and lovely lakes of Kiloshan Drill\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nWow\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nSo the first couple rhymes you're thinking\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nOh shit, this is racist\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:57.000\nAnd then you're like, oh no, he likes the black and tans\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nNo, what? No\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nNo, is it?\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nHe wants to fight him\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\nNo, I thought he admired them and wanted them to fight with him\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nHe wants to beat the shit out of them\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:05.000\nHe wants to beat up the black and tans\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nIt's a drunken Irish militant being like\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nOh, you won medals in World War I, you fucking pawns\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nCome out and fight me, I'll beat you up\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nOh\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\nYeah, that's what the song is about\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nBut is the black and tans his veterans?\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nIt's referencing a uniform, not a skin\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nIt is a uniform, not a skin color\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, not a skin color\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nEveryone was very white\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nRight\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nSo it's fine\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nRight\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nThat's when you grow up in a country like Ireland\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nYou have to, it's like\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:34.000\nThe pigmentation of your clothes has got me in a fucking xenophobic rage\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nThey did kind of invent that, right?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nIt's like, is that an orange band around your arm?\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nYeah\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:43.000\nAll right, sorry if you're Irish, do not attack\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nThese people can beat up fire\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nI do not want to cross them\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:56.000\nBut you go everywhere where I would never want to cross\n\n25:56.000 --> 26:00.000\nYou just got back from Syria by way of Mexico or?\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nNo, no, I was just there for a wedding\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nYou went to, oh, Mexico was a wedding\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nYeah, yeah, that was just for fun\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nSyria was for work\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nYeah, we went in by Iraq\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:13.000\nAnd you gave me a little thumbnail of what you were doing out there\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nWhich I thought was really interesting\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:20.000\nThe precursor being that you're kind of a, you're freelance\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nRight, because you don't, like you said, the big news organizations\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nThey don't send you to the Middle East\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:31.000\nUnless you're going to do a story that fits in a, you're doing ISIS stories\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:35.000\nYeah, yeah, it's hard to get a big paper to pay for you to go out to Syria\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:36.000\nBecause it's very expensive\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nThey usually want you to travel with security\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nWhich kind of bollocks is everything up\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nI imagine they have to insure the hell out of you\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nYeah, like it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars pretty easily\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:49.000\nFor like even just a single reporter in there for a couple of weeks\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:54.000\nSo you're freelancing and you're selling your stories to different media outlets?\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nI don't have to do that anymore\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:59.000\nSo I got, I do a couple of podcasts for iHeartRadio\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nBehind the Bastards is like the big one\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nAnd so like that's my regular job\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nI got the one fan whistling somewhere\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nAnd these are the stuff, stuff, stuff\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nHow stuff gets made, stuff they don't like to know\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nYeah, they got acquired by a series of companies\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.000\nAnd that's the way things work, I guess\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:18.000\nAre you a print or a photo or both?\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:22.000\nI do print and I do podcasts, like online and stuff\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:25.000\nSo like, I just raised a bunch of money from my fans\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:28.000\nI just asked people, like I said, I'll write this audio book\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.000\nAbout how right wing terrorism works in the United States\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nAnd this sort of plot started in the 1980s\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:38.000\nTo create like a network of stochastic, randomly organized terrorists\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nTo carry out attacks to stabilize the country\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nHow this all like came together\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nAnd I'll write that and I'll put it out for you\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nIf you guys raise a bunch of money from me\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nSo that I can go to Syria and check it out\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:51.000\nCrowd sourced journalism by gum\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:54.000\nWhat brand of gum?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:57.000\nIt's both an amazing thing and also a sad testament\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nTo the state of journalism\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nQuit dodging the question\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nWhat brand of gum?\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nIt'd better fucking be Big League 2\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nYou're damn right, Big League 2\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nSo was this a crowd sourced affair?\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nLike what you were, the story you were doing out there\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nSo tell us about this, this is like\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:17.000\nOkay, so this is like, there's a complicated story\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nAnd it's hard to tell like how far back to go\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:20.000\nWhen trying to explain this\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nLike the short, if I'm like pitching this on an elevator is\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:26.000\nThere's like a quasi anarchist feminist revolution\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nIn northern Syria\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:30.000\nAnd they're sort of the folks who did most of the fighting\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nTo beat ISIS\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.000\nAnd so we were hanging out with these people\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nAnd like talking with them about how their system works\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:39.000\nAnd like watching this sort of thing develop\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:42.000\nAnd that's like the short pitch\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:45.000\nWhen you say anarchist, you mean like proper old school\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:48.000\nLike political anarchism\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nLike not anarchic\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nWhere people think that word doesn't mean anything\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nThis is where we get into the longer explanation of it\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nAnd the longer explanation is that there is this\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:00.000\nTurkish Kurdish terrorist named Abdullah Ajalan\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nWho is like an absolute terrorist\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:05.000\nKilled a shitload of innocent people back in the day\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nAnd then in the late 90s, he gets arrested by the United States\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nIn I think Kenya\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nAnd there was another country involved too\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:15.000\nAnyway, he's been in an island prison in Turkey this whole time\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nLike for the last 20 years or so\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nAnd in the last 20 years, he's sort of like moderated\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nAnd he's just done a bunch of reading\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nAnd he came upon an American anarchist philosopher\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nNamed Murray Bookchin\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nAnd he started writing stuff where he's like\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nOh shit, I was wrong\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nNumber one, I was wrong to be a Marxist-Leninist\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nNumber two, the kind of terrorism I was advocating isn't okay\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:37.000\nAnd if we're going to actually reform society\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:40.000\nIn a way that fixes things like I wanted to fix them\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nRather than just trying to overthrow the government\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nAnd institute our own\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:46.000\nWe need to actually overthrow the systems of oppression\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nThat are at the basis of all authoritarianism\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:51.000\nWhich is the domination of women by men\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:54.000\nAnd so we need to fundamentally reorganize society\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:57.000\nIn order to fix the gender imbalance if we're going to fix anything\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:00.000\nAnd due to a series of like weird flukes of history\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:03.000\nThe terrorist group that this guy is the figurehead of\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:06.000\nWound up being the most powerful force in northern Syria\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nWhen ISIS was on the march\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nAnd they formed a couple of little subsidiary groups\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nThat then took on a life of their own\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nAnd got US air support and backing\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:14.000\nAnd they beat ISIS\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:17.000\nAnd now they're in control of a region of about 4 million people\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nAnd so for the last couple of years\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nThat there's been like\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nOkay, well we have all of this political theory\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nThis guy's been writing\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nAnd now we're in charge\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nWe should see if it works\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nAnd it kind of seems like it does\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nBut are they being like proper anarchists\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nLike Paris Commune\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nAnd like Mikhail Bakunin\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nAnd Kropotkin and Emma Goldman and all that\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:41.000\nI would call them anarchist inspired in certain areas\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nAnother way I've heard it\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nI just a journalist today was telling me\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nHe thinks it's his opinion of Rojava\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nWhich is what the region is called\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:53.000\nIs the world's most effective direct democracy\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nGoverned by an authoritarian system\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nSo you've got the military\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nWhich is central in a lot of aspects\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nBecause they need to defend this region\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nBoth from the Assad regime\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:03.000\nWhich are assholes\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nAnd from the Turkish government\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nWhich are also not very nice\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:10.000\nParticularly since it's a Kurdish-led liberation struggle\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:14.000\nSo they're in charge of a significant amount\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nOf what goes on there\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.000\nBut not on the civil side\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nAre they anarchists in the proper sense\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:22.000\nWhere it's really like a true democratic\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nLike anti-rule\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:26.000\nWhere everybody decides their own fate\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nAnd stuff like that\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nSomewhat, there's a lot of that in there\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nSo it's bottom-up political organization\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nAnd so they have communes on the lower level of thing\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:35.000\nWhere different neighborhoods\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:38.000\nEvery neighborhood will have sort of a direct democracy\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:41.000\nWhere they vote for representatives of the neighborhood\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nWhich represent them at the city level\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nWhich represents the city at the Canton level\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nWhich is roughly analogous to a state\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nAnd it builds up from there\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nOne of the rules they have is that\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nWhen they elect representatives\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nThey'd never just elect one representative\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nSo you don't just have a president\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nIn charge of food production\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nYou have two presidents\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nAnd they're always a man and a woman\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:02.000\nAnd the idea is that\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nYou should never have just a man\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nOr just a woman in charge of anything\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nIt should be both simultaneously\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nAnd they have to come to an accord personally\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nAbout what they're going to do\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nBefore anything could be done\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nAnd this is law throughout...\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nYeah, Rojava\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nWow\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nAbout four million people living under this right now\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nYeah\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nHistorically, what's going to happen is that\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:24.000\nBoth other sides are going to come back in\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nAnd they will absolutely squash them\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nBecause they don't...\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nYeah\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:31.000\nThe threat of actual democracy breaks out\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.000\nThey get murdered\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nThey get absolutely hammered\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nAnd it's...\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nYou can see that in the offing all around it\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nSo most of where we were\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nWas within a mile or two of the Turkish border\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nLike I had cell reception through Turkish cell networks\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nThe whole time I was there\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nAnd you can see the military forces there\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:51.000\nThe YPG and the YPJ are building hundreds of miles of tunnels\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:52.000\nUnderneath everything\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nThere are Turkish forces to invade\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nAnd there's this gigantic border wall\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nThat the Turks have built\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nThat's like 20 feet tall\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nAnd topped with concertina wire\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nAnd guard towers behind it\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.000\nAnd every day we were there\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nThe president of Turkey would send out another threat\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nSaying, like, I'm going to wipe these people out\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nLike, if we don't get this exclusion zone we want\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nIf the US doesn't pull back\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nI'm just going to invade\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nAnd, like, we'll see what happens\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nAnd he's been throwing threats out like that\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nOut for a while\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nAnd the Assad regime is still in control\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nOf most of Syria at this point\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nAnd, like, to the extent that there's one city\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nWhere they share joint control of\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nAnd we were, like, three feet away from the Assad regime\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nAnd there's, like, statues of Bashar al-Assad\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nAnd his troops glowering at you on one side\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:33.000\nAnd then there's, like, the YPG on the other side\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:37.000\nAnd it's very tense in some places\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nBut then you'd travel, like, five miles back\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nAnd you'd be, like, sitting at this, like, local council meeting\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nWhere it's just, like, a bunch of old women\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nIn their 60s and 70s\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nTalking about how they're handling, like\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nThey don't have cops to deal with stuff like\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:51.000\nDomestic disturbances and, like, that sort of thing\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nLike civil law enforcement\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nIs all done by an elected commune\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nOf, like, people in the town\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.000\nWho just, like, go door-to-door\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nAnd there's, like, a fight or something\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nAnd you want to counsel it out\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nAnd that's your anarchy, functionally\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nYeah\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nBecause it's because people need not be governed\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:05.000\nNecessarily\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nThey can figure shit out\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nThey're kind of designed for it\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:08.000\nThere's usually better at it\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nYeah\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:12.000\nUm, I got a bookmark\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nThat it's amazing to me\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:17.000\nHow some thoughts are\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:20.000\nHave so much power because this guy who was a\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:23.000\nWarlord, autocratic, terrorist-minded guy\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nSpent time in prison and then had that realization\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nIs, like, reaching me\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:29.000\nWho's, like, a renowned woke Westerner\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:32.000\nUm, like, where I'm going, like,\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nHoly shit, yeah, that's a really good fundamental point\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:38.000\nThat misogyny is the atomic unit of autocracy\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:39.000\nLike, that's what he's saying\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:42.000\nIs, like, you can't go into an honest conversation\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:46.000\nAbout whether or not mankind need be governed\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nUm, when you're walking into that\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nWhen you're governing half of the species\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nYeah\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:54.000\nWhen you were socialized to, like, get innervated\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:57.000\nBy any discussion that you think is not political\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nAbout whether or not Becky should be acting\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nThe way she's acting\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nOne of the really interesting things out there\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nBecause we talk to hundreds and hundreds of people\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:09.000\nUm, and we spent time at a military training base\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nFor the YPJ, which is the All Women's Militia\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nSo all of society in Rojava\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nAll women's militia\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.000\nIn Syria\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nI've got some pictures, yeah\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:18.000\nThat's awesome\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nYeah, so all of society, there's two chunks\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:23.000\nThere's general society, which is male and female\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nAnd should be as close to a 50-50 mix as possible\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nThat's the goal\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:29.000\nAnd then there's usually a women's auxiliary area\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nBecause they understand that, like, this is fucking Syria\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nLike, shit's been really rough for women here\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nFor a long time\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nAnd we need all women's groups\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nSo that these, like, members\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nLike, women who've been members of tribes\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nWhere, like, there hasn't been any representation\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nOf women for a very long time\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nCan kind of learn the ropes of speaking for themselves\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nWithout having to be, like, making decisions\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nIn the same room as some, like, older man\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nWho's just going to kind of walk all over them\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:55.000\nSo you have an all-female auxiliary army?\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:56.000\nYeah, you want to see pictures?\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nYes\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nOkay, let's see, I got it on the back here\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nI mean, like, we have to have conversations\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nOutside of writers' rooms\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nAbout how being conscious of, like,\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:08.000\nWomen being socialized to bear interruption\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nMore than men are socialized to not interrupt\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:13.000\nAnd, like, I can't even begin to...\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nThat's in a rich first-world empire\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:19.000\nI had a weird experience sitting on the floor\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nDrinking coffee with these young women\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nTalking about how they have to avoid fake male feminists\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nAnd how, like, yeah, there's guys in here\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nThat will say all the right things when you interview them\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nHe's sitting right next to you up\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.000\nHe's sitting right next to you\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:37.000\nWe call it virtue signaling\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:38.000\nLike, they didn't use that word\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nBut they were like, a lot of these guys\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nThey talk the talk, but, like, you know\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nThat they don't really believe\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nAnd if things were to change society\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nSocietally, they would go back to the way things were\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:50.000\nAnd my fixer, who's this wonderful woman,\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nOne of the most incredible people I've ever met\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nWhen you say fixer, you mean what?\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nFixer is the person who leads you around\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nThey usually interpret, they translate, they get you access\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nDo you speak the local dialect?\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:03.000\nI speak a little bit of Serani\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:04.000\nEnough to, like, get by\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nWhich is the Iraqi Kurdish dialect\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:09.000\nWhich is the Syrian Kurdish dialect is garbage\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nAnd I barely know pleasantries\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nYou have a handler that's taking you around\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nYeah, you usually do it in a war zone\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nAnd as much as, like, you need someone to, like, drive for you\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nWhich was, in our case, this dude Alon\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:23.000\nWho has nothing to do with anarchism or feminism\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:26.000\nBut the love this man had for cigarettes\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nWas pure and beautiful\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:32.000\nLike, I've never seen a man enjoy terrible cigarettes\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nAs much as Alon\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:36.000\nHe would just smile at us with, like, this\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:37.000\nHe usually worked with women\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.000\nBecause our fixer usually would only work with female journalists\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nThese women are, like, Capri 100s\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:43.000\nNo, they just won't smoke\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nBecause they're, like, from New York or whatever\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nAnd, like, they don't like it\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:47.000\nOh, okay\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:48.000\nAnd he was working with, like, two men\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nAnd neither of us are regular smokers\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:51.000\nBut we were willing to humor him\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nSo we wound up smoking, like, three packs a day\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:54.000\nJust to make Alon happy\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:57.000\nBecause the joy on his face was so pure\n\n37:57.000 --> 38:00.000\nBut they were crap cigarettes?\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nOh, they're garbage\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:04.000\nThe world sends its worst cigarettes to Syria\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nYeah\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:08.000\nAnd we put it in English on the pack\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:09.000\nYeah\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nThere's no warnings on the packs\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nLike, that's how bad the cigarettes are\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nThey don't even bother to tell\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nIt says it won't give you cancer\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nIt will make you fly\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:18.000\nYeah\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nSo, I...\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.000\nSorry, Dan\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nYou're on the ground, Rob\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:26.000\nAnd you're gathering stories\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:30.000\nYou're going through a handler that's interpreting for you\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:31.000\nMm-hmm\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:34.000\nAnd what is your relationship with, like, locals?\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:37.000\nLike, when they see you, do they see you as a friend?\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:38.000\nA threat?\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:39.000\nOr just kind of a noncombatant?\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nLike, it's easy going?\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nWell, this is, you know, one of the things about the Middle East\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nIs that, like, or at least the parts of it I've been to\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nBecause I don't have a comprehensive knowledge\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:48.000\nBut I spent a lot of time in Iraq\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:49.000\nAnd I've now been to Syria\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nAnd I've spent a bit of time in Turkey\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nAnd in the UAE\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nPeople, one to one, no matter what you're doing\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:58.000\nAre incredibly friendly on, like, a general basis\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nAnd, like, some of them will, like, happily tell you\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nLike, oh, yeah, the Marines killed my family\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nOr, like, a U.S. bomb killed my dad or whatever\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nBut, like, you want to go have tea?\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:07.000\nOr, like, oh, if you need a place to stay for that\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.000\nI'll put you up for the night\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:09.000\nIt's just like it's a cultural thing\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:12.000\nThey take you as a one-on-one, like, just regular guy\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:15.000\nIt's just sort of politeness and welcoming a guest\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nIs, like, a deeper thing than religion in that part of the world\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nAnd so I've almost never gotten a cold reception\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:23.000\nAre there women that do what you do that would get the same reception?\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:26.000\nOr is it easier to be a male journalist doing that?\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:29.000\nIt depends a little bit on the situation\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:32.000\nThere are certain times where it's easier to be a woman\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:35.000\nJust because people will be friendlier to you\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:39.000\nIt's much harder in other ways and in some ways more dangerous\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:42.000\nBut, like, if you're working with the military, for example\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nYou can get a lot of pictures of stuff you shouldn't be able to get pictures with\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nIf you're a woman and you'll just pose with the guys\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nFor a shot on their cell phones\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nAnd then, like, you can take pictures of the military base\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nYou can take pictures of the tanks, like, they'll let you do whatever\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:56.000\nIt's just sort of like how much you're willing to kind of lean on that\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nBecause I think you're taking selfies\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nYou can just disguise\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nI went with my wife to Iraq three times\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nAnd when we got back from the second trip\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nShe'd met all these Iraqi soldiers\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nAnd, like, they'd all exchanged Facebook information\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nWe'd gotten some, like, great access\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nAnd, like, had a really good time\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nAnd then we, like, were in Istanbul in the hotel\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nAnd she pulls open Facebook\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:19.000\nAnd she starts getting, or whatever, Facebook, like, video message\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:22.000\nFrom, like, 30 to, like, half of the Iraqi 5th Federal Police Battalion\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nYou're, like, being, like, hey, you want to talk?\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nThey don't speak any English, though\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:30.000\nAre you, like, do you ever get any watchlist bullshit from, like, customs and stuff like that?\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:31.000\nI never have any issue\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:32.000\nOkay\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nWell, how do you file that emotionally?\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:39.000\nOr slash sociopolitically as a nomadic journalist\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:44.000\nLike, who probably doesn't have as many, like, prejudices\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nBut, okay, that's your wife\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nAnd then the Facebook messages come in\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nDo you file that as predatory?\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nDo you have a different way of looking at that?\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nI mean, they're not...\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nLike, it's, um...\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nIt's complicated\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:01.000\nLike, there's a lot of really gross, misogynistic anti-woman behavior\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:04.000\nThat you encounter in that part of the world\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:05.000\nEven if it's hidden from you\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:08.000\nEven if they don't show it to you as a guest\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nIn that particular case\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:14.000\nI got the feeling that these were just lonely soldiers up at the front line\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:15.000\nThat's what I thought you might say\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nThat it's sort of like...\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:19.000\nIt's like if you were a U.S.O. performer\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nAnd they were on a submarine or something\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nI mean, as you should always do in those situations\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nI kind of went off of her feelings\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nAnd at every given step was like, how do you feel about this?\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:28.000\nLike, what do you want to do?\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nWell, you don't have to high-rope that\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:31.000\nYeah\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nWhen you post your pieces\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nIf you're emailing them back to your source\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:41.000\nOr to your, you know, wherever you're sending it to\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:44.000\nDo you get, like, any...\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nWhat do you call it?\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nLike, what's the word, Davis?\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.000\nCensorship\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nAre they going through your stuff and censorizing you?\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:52.000\nNo\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nBut, you know, there's a couple of things I should point out\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nOne is that I don't do, like, the daily...\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:57.000\nLike, I don't work for the New York Times\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nI don't work for, you know, the BBC\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nI'm not, like, filing stories every day\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nAnd then having them, like, run up on the air\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nThat's not the kind of work I do\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nAs a general rule, I just come home with whatever\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nI come home with, write whatever I want to write with\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nAnd some of it gets published\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nSome of it they're not interested in\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nIn this case, I'm just going to throw up\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nNobody's going through embodlerizing and censoring your stuff\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:21.000\nNo, I spent, like, a weird morning in Mosul\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nDuring the fighting there, just watching, like,\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:26.000\nU.S. airstrikes hit apartment blocks and stuff\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:29.000\nAnd, like, nobody censored, tried to stop me\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nFrom talking about that\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nAnd are these considered, I mean, like...\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nBut we're talking about places where\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:40.000\nIt's not even explicitly declared\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nWhether or not there's a war going on or not\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:46.000\nIt's just a mixing bowl of conflict\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:49.000\nSo are you wearing a vest that says press\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:50.000\nAnd would that matter?\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:51.000\nI did the first...\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nWhen I went to Ukraine, which was my first trip out\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:56.000\nI wore a vest, just because I didn't know what to expect\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:57.000\nAnd I was, like...\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:58.000\nMeaning...\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nOr do you mean Kevlar?\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nYeah, like, a Kevlar vest\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\nBut I'm also talking about this sort of, like,\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:06.000\nHey, I'm a journalist, kind of, like, insignia\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nIn most of these areas, if you're, like,\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:11.000\nA clearly American person walking around\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nEveryone kind of knows your press\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nLike, especially in, like, these parts of Syria\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nLike, the only Americans going through are either\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nU.N., foreign aid, and there's not that many\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:22.000\nOf those people who are, like, westerners\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:23.000\nOr you're just a journalist\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:24.000\nWhat's the reaction?\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.000\nThey're pretty used to it\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nWhen you meet locals and they know that you're from the U.S.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nOr that you're not from Syria\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:30.000\nLike, what's their reaction to you?\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:33.000\nAre they friendly, automatically?\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nOr wary of you?\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nNine times out of ten people are friendly\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nThe only places I got really negative reactions in Syria\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.000\nWere when we were in Raqqa\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nWhich was the former capital of the Islamic State\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nThere were a lot of older men who you could tell\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:49.000\nHad kind of bought into the status quo under ISIS\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nAnd you got a lot of staring daggers at them\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nVery mean looks at them\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:56.000\nLike, we also went to Al-Hal\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nWhich is the refugee camp\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nWhere they're hosting most of the arrested ISIS brides\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:03.000\nSo, like, the women who had, like, left parts of the western world\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:06.000\nAnd joined the Islamic State\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:09.000\nAnd a lot of them, like, we had this one weird moment\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:10.000\nWhere we were walking through the camp\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nAnd we were just surrounded by these women\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nAnd they're in full Nikabs\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nWhich is, like, the full black headdress\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nAnd it's like, as soon as you try to lock eyes with them\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:18.000\nThey flip down this little visor thing\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nSo you can't even see their eyes\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nAnd, like, we'd been out with\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nWe'd been talking to, like, guards at the camp\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:25.000\nWho'd been showing us, like, knife wounds\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:26.000\nAnd bite marks and stuff\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nBecause, like, a lot of these women, like, some of them will make shibs\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nOr they'll get knives smuggled in\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:31.000\nAnd they'll stab a guard\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:32.000\nAnd then they'll run back into the crowd\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nAnd you can't tell who did it\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nSo, like, we were just surrounded by this crowd of women\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nYou can't see their eyes or anything\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:41.000\nAnd, like, that was, like, definitely some navigative vibes there\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:44.000\nBut I also had a long conversation in, like, a trailer\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nWith these two ISIS women\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nWho had willingly joined the Islamic State\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nFrom Jamaica and Barbados\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nAnd they spoke perfect English\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nAnd we're talking about, like, literally\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nOne of the sentences I heard was\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nWhen we first came to the Islamic State, it was Airee\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nAnd it was, like...\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nWow!\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nAnd, like, at one point\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nMy colleague and I, Jake Hanrahan\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nWho's a British conflict journalist\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nIt was Airee\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:10.000\nYeah, it was Airee\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nAnd we're, like...\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nWe're having this pleasant conversation\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nYou're very polite to us, but, like, tell the truth\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nIf the walls came down right now, Jake asks\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nYou'd have our heads cut off\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nAnd they're, like, yeah!\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:24.000\nShe's, like, okay, well, at least we're on the same page, yeah\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nYeah, well, we in the states here\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nI mean, we do...\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:31.000\nThe way I met Wyatt Sinek was\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nDoing that Courtney Cox pilot that was\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nRipping off Daily Show, so a million years ago\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nLike, when I was working for Dino as a writer\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nAnd we did this, like, remote piece\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nWhere Wyatt went to talk to Terry Metzger\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nThe head of the Aryan...\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nFormer head of the Aryan nation\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:44.000\nAnd, like...\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nOh, Metzger, yeah!\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nIt was, like, all this gag, you know?\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nIt was, like, of course he...\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nYou know, it's, like, the white nationalists\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nBack then, it was, like...\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nIt was always, like, a puzzler of, like, really?\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nThey wanted us to send a black guy\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nAnd a gay guy to talk to them about\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nWho they hate more and really...\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:01.000\nIt's, like, like...\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nOh, yeah, it...\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nThat's my segue into the fact that\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:08.000\nWhat amazes me about you is\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nYou go and do all this other stuff\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nSo I'm pretty sure\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nBlackout drunks aside\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nThat the last time you were on the show\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nI spent a great deal of my energy going, like\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nHow do you have the...\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:24.000\nHutzpah, the gumption, the stuff to, like...\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:27.000\nTo go to these corners of the earth\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:30.000\nNot to, like, maybe corners of the earth is a...\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nThat's a Eurocentric slur\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nKind of right in the middle\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nYeah, they're, like, in the...\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:40.000\nYeah, like the fertile crescent of, yeah, everything\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nThe kknave. of the earth\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:45.000\nYeah, that's actually really fair, yeah\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:48.000\nIt's undulating dance, summoning all of it\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:49.000\nOkay, there I got it\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nWe're, like, right in the middle of its four pack\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nIf it's got, like, pretty good abs\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nYeah, what was the tipping point for you\n\n46:56.000 --> 47:00.000\nTo just decide to go out and go into\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:03.000\nPretty, like, sketchy, dangerous parts of the world\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nTo be a journalist\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nI mean, you know, it was this really...\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nIt kind of came from a really narcissistic place\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:12.000\nOf just growing up raised on Hollywood action movies\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:16.000\nAnd not being willing to join the military\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nBut, like, wanting to know what it was like\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:21.000\nTo see conflict and to even, like, having this desire\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:24.000\nLike, I want to know what it's like to get shot at\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:27.000\nAnd then going there and realizing, like, oh, that stuff\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nIs, like, 1% of what you do\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:32.000\nAnd mostly what you do is meet, like, the nicest people\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nYou've ever met\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nBecause there's something about...\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nNot that war is good for you, which is a bad...\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nWould be a bad lesson to take from this\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:42.000\nBut that conflict and terrible circumstances\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nTend to reveal the best in people more often\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:45.000\nThan they reveal the worst\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nAnd that those stories don't get clicks\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:49.000\nNo, they sure don't\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:53.000\nThat fear and evil kind of propagate by\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:56.000\nThe fear that I feel when I think about\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nThe Middle East as a hornet's nest\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:01.000\nIn a place I'd never go as part of the problem\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:04.000\nThat you're inoculating things somehow\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nYou know, you're going deep in there\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:11.000\nBut the thing that blows my goddamn mind\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nIs that on the right over here, I'm, like,\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:17.000\nReading your very thoughtful stuff\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:20.000\nBecause it's like, look, I wouldn't have dismissed you\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nAs an adrenaline junkie\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nHowever, I would have been able to at least\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nFind a place for you on my map of the cosmos\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nAs, like, a guy who's, like,\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nWants to be where the action is\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nAnd where the truth is and stuff\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nBut you're...\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nYou have this...\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nYou are really into...\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:41.000\nInvestigating this domestic situation\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nThat we've got going on\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:46.000\nAnd that involves absolutely no romantic\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:49.000\nHurt, lockery, fun, like,\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:52.000\nYou pack your bags and duck your head\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nBecause the rotors are buzzing and things\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:58.000\nLike, it's all just mind-numbing, heart-aking\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nInvestigation into the gears of\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:04.000\nThe fucking 8-chan and the 4-chan thing\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nIt did get a bounty on my head\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:07.000\nI'm sure it did\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, from 4-chan, 15 bitcoins\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nI wouldn't be sub...\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:14.000\nI probably faster than any work you've done\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:17.000\nIn the most dangerous places on Earth\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:20.000\nHow much... Are you a big history buff?\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:23.000\nHow much, like, knowledge\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nDo you have to go into that?\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:28.000\nWhen you land and hit the ground in Syria\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:31.000\nDo you have to know about the whole history of it?\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:34.000\nI mean, in a much shittier,\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:37.000\nWay less important version of what you're doing\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:40.000\nI did comedy in Kosovo\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nAnd trying to learn about the Balkans\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nAnd what's gone on there\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:45.000\nIt's crazy\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:49.000\nAnd there's no getting around how complicated all that is\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nAnd I read and I read and I read and I read and I read\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nAnd I still don't know what the fuck is going on there\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nYeah, you know, it's...\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:59.000\nI'm a big believer, like, when I report on white nationalism\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nI've read almost everything, like, pretty much everything\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nAnd you're for it, right?\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nYeah, big fan, yeah, big fan\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:09.000\nOnce you do just the cursory amount of research\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:14.000\nIt sells itself\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nGo ahead\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nNo, so, like, I do a lot of...\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nI've tried to get deep into the history on that\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nBut when it comes to, like, I do as much reading as I can\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nBut, like, really, you can't understand\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:27.000\nThe full depth of all of these conflicts\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:30.000\nYeah, 600 years of fucking conflict, yeah\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nSo, like, what you do is you ask people there\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nWhat they think you need to know\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nAnd, like, you do that to enough people\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:39.000\nThat you feel like you've gotten a good base of, like, things\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nLike, what I actually need to understand\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nIn order to understand this place\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nWhat they've told you when you do more research\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:48.000\nAnd you try to present things with as much context as you can\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:51.000\nBut you also accept that, like, there's only certain stories\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.000\nYou can effectively report on about that part of the world\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nAs someone from outside of it\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nBecause, like, you don't speak the language\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nYou don't have an in-depth knowledge of the history\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:04.000\nWhich is why the kind of stuff that I have been trying to report on\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nLike, what I focused on when I was in Syria\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nIs the stuff that's going against the grain of history\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:11.000\nWhich is very much, like, what everyone in Rojava will tell you\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nEscape from is, like, the grain of history\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nThat has caused so much problem\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:18.000\nOr so many problems for, like, the people in that region\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nOver such a long span of time\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nAnd has caused all these structural imbalances\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nIs there a generational thing that's happening\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.000\nWhere, like, there's a youthful kind of, like, a upsurge\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.000\nOf, like, let's escape the past?\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nYeah, that's a big part of it\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nAnd you meet a lot of older people there\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nWho, you know, like, the women I would talk to\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nWho would say, like, I don't think this guy really means it\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nI don't think that guy really means it\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:43.000\nAnd you would kind of have to parse it with the older guys\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:46.000\nWhich ones believed in sort of the feminist revolution\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nAspect of what was going on and which ones didn't\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:51.000\nAnd so a lot of my conversations were trying to, like, figure out\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nLike, how the old guys felt about it\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nAnd then at one point we wind up in this office\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:58.000\nWith a bunch of Asaish, which are, like, the local military police\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:01.000\nAnd it's a mix, everyone in there is in their early 20s\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:04.000\nAnd it's a mix of young women, some of whom are wearing\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nHeaddress, headscarfs, and some of whom are wearing\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nAre just, like, bareheaded\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nAnd, like, men, and a lot of them have tattoos\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nAnd they're all, like I said, in their early 20s\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:14.000\nAnd I start asking them this\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nLike, how do you feel about men and women working together\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nHow do you feel about this new system\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nAnd they all start really awkwardly giggling\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nTo the point where it was obvious that it was like\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:25.000\nIf I'd walked into a mixed group of, like, men and women\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:28.000\nWorking together in, like, Orange County\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nAnd been like, how do you guys feel about women and men\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.000\nWorking next to each other\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nAnd they would all be like, what the fuck are you talking about, dude\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:34.000\nReally?\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:37.000\nAnd that was the thing, like, the people that I got to know well\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:40.000\nAnd talking about, they were like, we just have to keep\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nThe old people who don't really believe\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:45.000\nShamed into falling in line long enough for them to die off\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nAnd the young people to grow up living this way\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nReally? Wow.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nSo how big is that?\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nThat can be a dangerous methodology\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nYeah, can we do a Logan's Run, so to say\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:58.000\nIt turns out some of them can whip that fire whip\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nRight around Gandalf's ankle\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:03.000\nRight at the last minute and get a whole new football\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:08.000\nThis women-based militia and, like, kind of\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:11.000\nYeah, you can see him if you pull a picture number seven\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:12.000\nI think was that\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:13.000\nOh, we got pictures\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:14.000\nOh, yeah, there's pictures\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:15.000\nI love this podcast\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:16.000\nBut yeah, what were you asking?\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:17.000\nOh, yeah, go like, oh, shit\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:18.000\nYeah\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nSo, like, how prominent are they\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nAnd how many, like, what's, like, per capita\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:25.000\nLike, how many of them are involved and what's going on?\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:28.000\nThere are a pretty substantial number of the forces\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:29.000\nLike, in the field\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nIt's kind of hard to get numbers\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:35.000\nBut you can get a picture for it just by looking at military checkpoints\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:38.000\nBecause it's a mix of men and women working the checkpoints\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nAnd doing, like, the job of garrison duty\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:43.000\nAnd from that, I'd guess somewhere around a quarter to a third\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:46.000\nYou can also get an idea by one of the things\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:49.000\nSo about 11,000, mostly Kurdish\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nBut also Arabic fighters and also foreign fighters\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nDied fighting ISIS\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:56.000\nAnd they call them the Shaheeds, which means martyr\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:59.000\nAnd their pictures are all over the place\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nPictures of different martyrs are all over the place\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nAnd quite a few of them are young women\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:07.000\nThere's a lot of women who are 16, 17 years old\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:10.000\nAre there women in, like, high military status?\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nLike, generals and...\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:16.000\nSo if you work in the Middle East in cover conflict\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nYou will run into a situation very often\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nWhere in order to get into a certain area\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nOr to embed with a military unit\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:25.000\nYou have to sit in a room with a bunch of elderly generals\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:28.000\nAnd drink tea with them and maybe have lunch with them\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nLike, all right, you guys can get in the Humvee\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\nAnd go on and do your thing\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:32.000\nThey just want to, like, sit with you\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nAnd get sort of that face time with you\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:38.000\nAnd I had that meeting for the first time in Raqqa\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:41.000\nWhere the person who was in charge was not a man\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:45.000\nAnd it was a woman in her 60s\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nWho was an older Kurdish fighter\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nProbably former PKK\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nWho was one of the co-presidents of security\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nFor the city of Raqqa\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:56.000\nAnd so she and this man were, like, running security\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:59.000\nAnd she was, from the instant we stepped into the room\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nClearly in control\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nAnd nothing started until she was ready to go\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nAnd nothing stopped until she was ready for it to stop\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nWe've got her picture in here, too\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nBut I want to go back to this at some point\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:12.000\nThis is your rap?\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:13.000\nThe rap you wanted to do?\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nYeah, number three\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:16.000\nYeah\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nSo that's her\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:22.000\nShe's the Queen Elizabeth, the Titan?\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nYeah, and she...\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:28.000\nAnd who's smiling Jack over here?\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nThat's her partner\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nAnd when we asked him, what do you think about\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nAll of this, like, women's revolution and feminism stuff\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:37.000\nHe was the guy who was like, oh, I'm totally about it\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nAnd she just, like, laughed and waved her hand at him\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:42.000\nAnd it was, like, clearly this, like, dismissive gesture\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nLike, yeah, fuck you, we've been in arguments together\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nI know how you really fucking think, dude\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:50.000\nI mean, that's really interesting\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:53.000\nLike, of all places, you would think that that would not be the place\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:57.000\nWhere women were, like, controlled military\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nAnd, like, governmental control\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nYeah, there's a story I want to tell really quickly\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:02.000\nJust so I don't forget to do it\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nIf you want to go back to picture seven\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:07.000\nThere's a woman in the middle of that picture\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nYou see that young woman with the glasses?\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:12.000\nShe was 16 years old when Isis took over the city\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:13.000\nThat she lived in\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nAnd one of the first rules they instituted for women\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nWas that all women had to wear the niqab\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:21.000\nWhich is the full black, like, full body covering\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:24.000\nAnd she went out one day with a white belt around it\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:27.000\nAnd a member of the Hisba, which was Isis's religious police,\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:28.000\nSaw her\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:32.000\nAnd she was sentenced to 1,500 lashes for wearing a white belt\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nAnd the way she described it to us is\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:37.000\nThat's enough lashes that three different men had to deliver it\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nBecause their arms gave out\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:42.000\nAnd it took her four months to recover from the whipping\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:45.000\nEnough that she was able to move around\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nAnd eventually escape through the lines\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:51.000\nAnd reach the Kurdish-controlled chunks of northern Syria\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nHer there under the tree with a gun on her hand\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:54.000\nYeah, yeah, with the glasses\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nI can't believe that wouldn't kill you\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:57.000\nIt can\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nIt does a lot of the time\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:00.000\nBut their arms gave out\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nThe number of women died, yeah\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nSo she reaches the Kurdish lines\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nAnd the first thing she sees is a soldier\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:10.000\nA young female soldier of the YPJ holding an AK-47\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:11.000\nAnd the way she explained it to us is\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nAs soon as I saw that woman holding a gun\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nI was like, that's what I want to do\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:16.000\nWow\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:17.000\nYeah\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nI mean, there's this bitter sweetness to it\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nBecause it's like\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:24.000\nWe in the West have been having this\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\nFor 200 years of like\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:29.000\nAnd it's really hard to unbrade it\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nBecause it's like\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:34.000\nGuns or penises and men are violent\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:37.000\nAnd that's part of the problem\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:40.000\nAnd then, but we also like these stories of\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:43.000\nLike, you know\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nInjustice becoming justice\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:49.000\nAnd like equality taking the form of\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nWomen holding these weapons of destruction\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:54.000\nAnd it's like the mind just spirals\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nAnd while the mind is spiraling\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nOne must then go\n\n57:58.000 --> 57:59.000\nWhy is your mind spiraling?\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:02.000\nBecause there are too many poles going on here\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:05.000\nLike get rid of them and achieve stabilization\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nAnd if you have to do that by\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:10.000\nIt's like whatever means you have to do that\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:13.000\nI mean, if a person took 120 lashes\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nOur hands are numb\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:16.000\nWe got different like\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nSo they give you sort of their war name\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:19.000\nSo it always starts with Haval\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nWhich is a word in Kermaji Kurdish\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:24.000\nThat means friend or you might translate it to comrade\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:25.000\nIt's sort of like calling everybody around you\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nComrade would have been back in the early days\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nThe Soviet Revolution\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:32.000\nAnd her last name I have trouble pronouncing\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nBut it's the Kurdish word for revenge\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:35.000\nNo shit\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:38.000\nYeah, so like comrade revenge was the name that she\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:41.000\nSo this is post her being whipped 1500 times\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:44.000\nAnd she's sitting there and looking like she's\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nShe was getting training at this\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nShe was actually helping to train the younger women\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:49.000\nIn the unit\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:53.000\nSo this was part of an all Arab unit of the YPJ\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:56.000\nSo these young women were all getting trained to fight\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:57.000\nAnd it was like\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:58.000\nI talked to a number of them\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nWe spent like a sizable chunk of a day there\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:01.000\nAnd we actually got\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nI have a bunch of papers that I have to translate\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nThat's like their coursework on feminism\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nBecause it's a two month boot camp\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:10.000\nAnd the first month is on historical training\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nAnd like feminist theory and like understanding\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nLike the relation of men and women throughout the ages\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nAnd like the birth of authoritarianism\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nLike that's part of the military training\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nAlong with how to shoot in AK-47\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nOkay, well that's really interesting\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:23.000\nI don't want to derail\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:24.000\nBut that sounds like a rabbit hole\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:25.000\nThat's what I came to talk about\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:26.000\nLike how does their history of feminism\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nHey Rob, scoot down over here\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nSo that people can see all the photos here\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nLike in case it's blocking anybody\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:35.000\nI mean, so if you're\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nI mean that just\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nLike what history of feminism are\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nThey're getting a completely different one\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:42.000\nObviously there's not a\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:43.000\nThey don't do a slideshow\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nThis is Susan and Anthony\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nLike they have a completely different history\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nYeah, it's some\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nA lot of it does focus on like significant women\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nIn both the history of the region\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nAnd the world who they like see\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nAs sort of icons in this long struggle\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nA lot of it's the stuff that Ajalan\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nWrote about his theories on\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nWhen human beings transitioned\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nFrom hunter-gatherers to agricultural societies\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nAnd when like the enslavement of women\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nOn a systemic basis began\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nAnd it's like coming to understand all of that\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nGod damn\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nYeah, it's some surprising stuff\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nTo encounter in the middle of the Syrian desert\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nAre they heralded and being like\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nApplauded in like their local areas\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nFor being women in power\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nOr being a women militia\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nSome of their parents\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nThey are disowned from\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nAnd will not be going back home\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nBecause their family didn't want them coming\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nIn joining and some of their parents\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nSome of them expressed that like my family\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nWas like yeah when I was a kid\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nThis would have seemed impossible\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nBut after ISIS they were just like fuck it\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nWhy not\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nSo it was a mix\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nWill they ever be heralded as heroes\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nOr are they just going to kind of be footnotes\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nLike in a weird crisis\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nThere's a kind of real politic\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nThat you encounter\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nParticularly working with Kurdish forces\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nIn any part of the world\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nAnd I've been with them in Iraq\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nAnd in Syria\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nAnd they're both very different chunks\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nIn both very different ideologies\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nBut they both understand how optics work\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nBoth like the Iraqi Kurdish movements\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nAnd the Syrian Kurdish movements\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nAnd so they understood from the beginning\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nThat having female fighters up at the front line\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nLooked really good in terms of getting the US\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nTo support you with airstrikes\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nBecause like that just sells back home\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nA hell of a lot better than like\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nThe way to a man's heart is a woman with a gun\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nWell\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nYou can't argue with the effectiveness\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nOne of the differences is that\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nFor the Iraqi Kurds\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nThat\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nHaving actual women in the front line\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nStopped being a thing\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nAs soon as the immediate threat of ISIS\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nOverrunning their capital\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nStopped being a thing\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nAnd in Syria\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nThey're still all over the place\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nThey're still running\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nLeading men into battle\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nLike you would\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nIt was so comprehensive\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nThat like\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nBecause a part of you as a journalist\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nYou're like is this just a put on for me\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nOr are they like trying to like\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nPlay up a show or whatever\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nRight\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nAnd a certain amount of time\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nAfter like looking back behind you\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nAnd just seeing like\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nA young woman in a headscarf\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nLike going over maps with a guy\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nLike 40 feet behind you\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nLike where you're not filming\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nWhere you're not looking at\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nAnd they're clearly trying to figure out\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nWhere to position their guys and what not\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nYou just accept that it's happening\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nAnd that it like isn't weird\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nFor a lot of the people anymore\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nNow look\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nIf you've got a bunch of photos\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nWe can go through all of them\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nOr I can segue to domestic\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nWhich is only going to make my stomach hurt\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nSo I'm happy to go through photos of\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nI mean you know\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nLike if you've got a bunch of photos\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nLet's look at them\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nI would be happy to see more photos\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nOf these women\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nWe do\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nThe thing is\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nI'll just let me say this one thing\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nAnd then we don't have to talk about\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nDomestic again\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nBecause we do\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nI'll talk about domestic\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nI know you want to\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nThat's the thing that impresses me about you\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nIs that you're clearly passionate\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nAbout that shit\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nAnd have such an eye for it\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nBut Google Rob Evans\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nAnd scroll past the kid stays in the picture\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nIn the history of Paramount doing porn\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nAnd see Rob Evans' pieces\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nAbout 8 Chan and 4 Chan\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nAnd the stuff\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nAnd it's like don't\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nIt's like look\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nIt's not\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nIt takes 10 minutes\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nAnd it fucking hurts\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nLike drinking Nyquil\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nBut then\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nWhy is drinking Nyquil hurt?\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nThat puts you to sleep\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nThat's pretty normal\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nWheat grass\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nWheat grass\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nIt's disgusting\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nBut you feel a little better after you drink it\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nLike you're a little more armed\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nFor something\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nAnd stuff\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nYou talk about shit posting\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nWhich I really didn't know the definition of\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nAll kinds of stuff\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nBut we have guests coming up\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nWho are delving into that area\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nAnd we can have you back anytime\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nAnd if you've got a bunch of fucking photos\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nFrom your trip to Syria\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nLet's go through them\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nAnd listen to you tell stories\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nYeah\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nLike there's one little spiel\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nI'd like to go on\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nAbout the domestic side of things\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nThat like I talk about this\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nI've been doing like I was on the BBC\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nAnd NPR\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nAnd like doing a bunch of shit\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nAfter the last shooting\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nBecause they call me up every time\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nSomeone from 8chan murders people\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nAnd there's something I never get to talk about\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nOr I talk about it\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nSorry, interrupt\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nWhat is 8chan?\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nI don't know\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nIs that two times worse than 4chan?\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nIf the internet's asshole\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nIf the asshole of the internet\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nHad an asshole\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nThat's 8chan\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nAnd it's actually called 8chan\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nIt's called 8chan\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nBecause child porn was banned\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nOn 4chan\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nAnd Gamergate\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nWe can't have this\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nWell, yeah, I think it was popular\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nIt was because of Gamergate\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nBut I think that's why it was invented\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nIt's like we need a 4chan\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nTo trade child porn\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nYeah, it was a\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nYes, that's the starting point\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nIt's like\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nAnd it only got worse\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nYeah\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nThey took a real Nazi turn\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nAfter 2014\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nAnd it's stupid\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nAnd it's sad\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nBut it's why like 80 people\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nHave died this year\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nBut there's a really important provocative cover\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nI'm going to let you do your ranch in one second\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nBecause I can already hear\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nFrom my wonderful audience\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nThat I respect the hell out of them\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nIf I only think about the stuff on the drive\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nOver here\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nI thought the same thought\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nImmediately when all this talk about\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nWe get to pull the plug on 8chan\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nAnd all this stuff\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nAnd my first thought is like\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nWait a minute, that can't possibly be the solution\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nI don't want anybody listening to this podcast\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nTo think that like\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nThat's why I say\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nGo Google Rob Evans\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nRead his shit\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nThis guy as much as he's been in Syria\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nAnd Iraq has been in 4chan and 8chan\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nAnd just read the stuff\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nBecause it's not forcing you to do anything\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nJust read his stuff\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nAnd start to like\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nUnderstand the climate\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nAnd the definitions of what is\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nWhen do you start to call something\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAn actual like fucking cell\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nAnd I just like\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nThe fact that I have to gingerly say that\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nIs like a sign of the crazy ass times\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nBut now do your thing\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nYeah, I mean I um\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nSo I started covering 8chan in 2014\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nBecause I was a comedian at that point in time\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nAnd I worked for a website called crack.com\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nThat did a comedy video about\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nPersonifying different websites on the internet\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nAs like kids in high school\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nAnd it personified 8chan as this creepy kid\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nLike hitting on another young woman\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nIn like a really creepy and abusive way\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nAnd like that was the joke\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nIs that that's the kid 8chan would have been\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nIn high school\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nAnd they found the video\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nAnd they got angry\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nAnd they didn't go after the director of the video\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nWho was a man\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nThey went after the actress\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nAnd they started like sending dead animals to her house\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nLetters written blood to her house\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nLike this is like 2014\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nSo I start like\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nI just start checking in on these guys\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nA couple of times a year\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nJust because I'm like what the fuck is happening here\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nAnd in 2016\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nThe president retweets a meme that they create\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nYou guys saw that picture of Hillary Clinton\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nWith like the star of David behind her\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nThat says most corrupt candidate ever\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nThat was an 8chan meme\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nSo I wrote a thing about them\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nFor the comedy website that I wrote for\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nAt that time\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nAnd then I just keep looking in\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nAnd then the Christchurch massacre happens\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nAnd because I've been working on extremism\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nAnd stuff during that time\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nI read the guy's manifesto\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nAnd I see that it was post on 8chan\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nAnd I like write a thing about it\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nLike while the bodies are still warm\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nAnd suddenly like\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nAll these journalists from legacy media\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nAre being like\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nCan you explain the internet to us\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nAnd like that's why I'm in this position\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nBut what I think is important for people to understand\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nThat I tell to every journalist\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nFrom a big station that talks to me\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nThat they never play\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nThey never put it on the radio\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nThey never put it on TV\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nThis shit goes back\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nFurther than the internet as we know it\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nIn the early 1980s\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nThere was a terrorist group called\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nThe Order\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nWhich was inspired by a book called\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nThe Turner Diaries\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nWhich is a fictional book\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nAbout a white race war\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nThat is sparked by like\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nTerrorist cells carrying out like\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nRandom acts of violence\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nIt's a fantasy\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nIt's a fantasy for white supremacists\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nYeah\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nWho maybe don't call themselves fascists\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nBlowing up enough shit\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nAnd the terrorist group in the book is called\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nThe Order\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nAnd the real terrorist group is called\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nThe Order\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nAnd they're protagonists or antagonists\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nOh they're the heroes\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nThey're protagonists\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nLike most terrorist written fiction\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nIt doesn't really have good structure\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nIt's just like\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nOnce upon a time\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nWe blew up enough shit\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nThat we got to\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nWe got to be America\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nWhich women we got to fuck\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nAnd it was great\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nAnd then we nuked the earalls\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nYeah\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nSo this real terrorist group\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nCalls The Order\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nThe Order starts up\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nAnd they mostly rob banks\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nAnd armored cars\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nThey only kill a couple of people\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nBut they make off with about\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nFour million dollars in cash\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nSome of it goes to buy rocket launchers\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nAnd machine guns and shit\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nOh yeah this I know\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nOkay\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nThis part people know\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nWhat people don't know is that\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nMost of the weapons that the money bought\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nGot confiscated eventually\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nThe army and shit tracked them down\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nThe FBI figured that shit out\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nBut a lot of the money went to buy\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nApple II computers\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nAnd early networking equipment\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nWhich connected KKK cells\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nAnd new neo-nazi cells\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nAnd like white supremacist readouts\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nAnd places like the area nations up in Idaho\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nOn an early internet network\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nCalled LibertyNet\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nNow this is in the mid 1980s\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nBy the mid 1990s\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nThere were researchers realizing\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nThere's an organized neo-nazi presence\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nOn like use net and shit\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nLike the early internet\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nLike on these fucking like\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nWhat were they even called\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nNot message boards\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nLike even fucking before that\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nNews groups\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nNews groups\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nLike all dot politics and shit\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nLike there's Nazis all over these places\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nAnd they start finding Nazi manifestos\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nWritten about how to radicalize people\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nOn the internet\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nAnd how if somebody confronts you\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nThe first thing to say is\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nI'm not a Nazi\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nUse humor and jokes\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nAnd try to claim that you're just joking\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nIf people call you on like\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nYour ironic fascism and stuff\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nAnd like if we just put this stuff\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nOut into the atmosphere often enough\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nThis is how we can recruit people\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nAnd so what we've seen\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nWhat we're seeing with 8chan\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nAnd not just with 8chan\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nBut with like this brother constellation\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000\nOf like neo-nazis and fascists\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nOn the internet\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nWho were radicalizing\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nLarger and larger groups of people\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nAnd who sort of metastasized\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nIn the 2017 Charlottesville March\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nWhere you got hundreds of these people\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nIn real life\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nIs the culmination of 30 years\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nOf really diligent work\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nAnd that's why I try to treat these people\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nAnd have tried to push the mainstream media\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000\nAnd when I speak to law enforcement\n\n01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nWhen I lecture at colleges\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nTry to talk to them about\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nYou have to treat them as if they're like ISIS\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nOr Al Qaeda\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nAnd maybe they're not that organized\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nAnd they're certainly not a central figurehead\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nOf the group\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nBut they function that way\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nAnd they've been doing so for decades\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nAnd it's time we acted like it\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nYou have to at least ask yourself\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nIn terms of group psychology\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nWhat if these people weren't white\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nNow the brick wall that I run into\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nIs like\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nWell how can you possibly punish a medium\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nLike how can\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nAnd that's what all of my friends also say too\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nThe minute we hear this stuff\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nWe just go like\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nHow can pulling the plug on a fucking place\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nWhere people get together\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nAnd say who wants to mass shoot\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nHow can pulling the plug be the solution\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nAnd just reading a couple of your pieces\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nLike started to nudge me over\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nBecause unlike me\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nWho's just simply a 46 year old dude\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nWaking up and going\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nYeah but at the end of the day\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nAnd that's why I say to you guys\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nBecause I don't presume anything about you guys\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nIn these turbulent, turbulent times\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nAnd I think that's\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nFrom reading two of your pieces\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nThat was one of the things I really respected\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nIs your acknowledgement of the psychological effect\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nOf just shit\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nJust too much information\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nAnd how there is like\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nThat is like\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nLike if we had\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nIf you hadn't been to Syria\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nThat would be an hour long conversation\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nThat you want to have\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nIs like how in the hell\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nWhat is the responsibility of the discerning\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nHumanitarian individual\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nWhen they're trying to figure out\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nWhat is the difference between shit posting\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nTrolling propaganda\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nAnd an outright like thing to bother attacking\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nWhat is anyone supposed to do\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nBecause it's obvious what the quote unquote\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nEnemy wants to happen\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nWhich is fatigue\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nShock and awe\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nYeah they want you offline\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nThey want you to do what I have done\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nBuy a gun and get in your swimming pool\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nAnd I am proud\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nWell I'm not proud\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nBut I am not afraid to shamefully admit\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nI've never seen you in the pool though with your gun\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nThat's the next one man\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nChallenge accepted\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nFirst off this is off topic\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nBut if you haven't gone pool shooting\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nNow Dan I come from Texas\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nAnd rolling down a moving body of water with a rifle\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nThat's some good times\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nI'm not going to pretend it's not\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nI can't tell if you're kidding\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nI am not kidding\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nI'm pretty sure mythbusters prove\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nThat bulls don't work underwater\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nWell no but he's talking about\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nTube shooting\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nWhich is something I've always done\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nLike lazy river tube\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nTube shooting\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nPlus sea shooting right\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nTube shooting\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nTube shooting\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nSee that like I'm not a big gun enthusiast\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nBut I would go tube shooting\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nWho wouldn't\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nPoss I would not go tube shooting with you\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nNo I want to be completely alone\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nYeah well they say about you know\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nThe old saying never be the smartest person in the room\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nNever be the guy in the tube shooting trip\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nThat has the least experience with guns\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nAnd tubes\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nOr tubes\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nYeah\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nTo only go tube shooting with navy seals\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nRob I took journalism school at USC\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nLike in the early 90s and I was\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nI think about like what it must be like now\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nTo go into a journalism school today\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nLike because this is\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nWhen I went there it was pretty pre-internet\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nAnd certainly pre-\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nNapster\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nLike yeah\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nI was pre-napster for sure\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nThere's less focus on Napster\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nThat's heartbreaking\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nBut like how do you approach journalism now\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nAnd like when you're writing a piece\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nAnd like you think of the market that's going to be delivered in\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nLike in a world of just fake bullshit\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nAnd like how do you approach print journalism today\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nThat's a reason I'm a big fan of the site that I write for\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nIt's called Bellingcat\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nAnd these are the people they were founded by\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nA guy who was a something awful forums goon\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nNamed Elliot Higgins\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nAnd something awful is also the forum that birthed HN\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000\nWhich is the forum that\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nRight\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nThe forum that birthed 4chan\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nNow so Elliot's just like this nerd on the internet\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nAnd like when the Syrian civil war starts up\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nHe starts getting interested\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nJust like looking at pictures of conflict\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nThrough like Google images\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nAnd trying to piece stuff together\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nAnd then he gets interested in like the fighting in Ukraine\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nAnd there's been a number of stories that they've broken\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nBut one of them is that after\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000\nI think it was MH17\n\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nThe Malaysian air flight that was shot down over Ukraine\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nThey just spent god knows how many hours\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nCombing over pictures of the wreckage\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nAnd pictures of Russian troop movements at the time\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nTo identify which missile\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000\nBased on the serial numbers on the missile\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nShot down the plane from like a Russian buck launcher\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nAnd then traced down like\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000\nWhat launcher that missile was put onto\n\n01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nAnd then traced its path from Russia into the Ukraine\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nTo prove that it was the Russian back separatist in Ukraine\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nWho shot down the plane\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nAnd like that's the kind of journalism they do\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nAnd I don't do that\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nBecause I'm not nearly that smart\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nBut like that's I think a part of how you deal with\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nThe problem of like\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nWell nobody believes in truth\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nIt's like okay well you can put out this article\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nWhere I'm not relying on trusting that you went here\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nAnd talked to these people\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nI can pull up all of these images\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nI can trace the serial numbers on this missile\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nI can like do all this myself\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nBecause you've spelled out how you're going to do it\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nAnd that's hard to argue with\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nLike when we look at the internet\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nI'm using my eye statements here\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nWhen I look at the internet and I go\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nThis is at least 80%\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nNonsense\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nIt's worse, poison\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nYeah\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nIt might do me right to recognize\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nThat that's probably because I'm 80% poison\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nAnd that if I'm 20% decency\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nOr health\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nThat what that means is that there might be\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000\n20% of the internet that is decent\n\n01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nThat you shouldn't expect those averages to be higher\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nAnd you should expect yourself to have to\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nDig a little harder\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nHow would you teach, like you said\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nYou give talks and you\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nYeah\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nLike how would you\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nLike you're talking to a bunch of\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\n18-year-old freshmen in college\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nThat want to go into proper print journalism\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nNo, I don't talk to those kids\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nWhen I lecture, I usually lecture to counter-terrorism students\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nAnd to like new law enforcement\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nFederal law enforcement officers\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nAbout dealing with particularly far-right terrorism\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nBut in general with dealing with terrorist groups\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nThat use the internet to recruit\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nI don't like\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nI think journalism is kind of broken\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nIn the mainstream sense\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nThe people that you're talking to\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nMight be our actual journalists\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nThe people that actually go in there and make\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nLike on the ground reports\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nAnd say this is what happened and this is why\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nWell, but also, and here's one of the reasons\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nWhy I think mainstream\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nAnd like most of the field is kind of screwed right now\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nIs that it has abandoned\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nFor sort of perceptions of the way things ought to be\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nIt has abandoned actually\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nMattering\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nAnd that's important\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nIn a world where somebody can just lie a thousand times\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nTo overwhelm your one truth\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nIt doesn't matter that you're telling the truth\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nWhat matters is finding a way to get the truth\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nTo reach people\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nAnd sometimes that involves thinking\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nNot like a journalist, but like a guy\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nWho writes for television or whatever\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nHow do you know when you write something\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nAnd you've gone and reported on something\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nAnd you disseminate that\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nHow do you have any faith\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nThat will even land as truth\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nWell, you have to be willing to write\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nA bunch of shit that nobody reads\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nWhich I have and will continue to do\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nUntil the day I die\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nYou also have to have an amount of faith\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nIn the fact that when people get scared\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nThey'll pay attention to what makes sense\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nAnd the lies always make a kind of sense\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000\nBut they're never a satisfying sense\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nWhen you really turn them around in your head\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000\nAnd that's what you have to hope on\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000\nAnd that's something I believe on faith\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nI believe entirely because of the evidence\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000\nOf my own eyes, because it's not always true\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nDo you have editors and publishers that you trust\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nThat they'll appreciate what you're doing\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nAnd that they'll make sure that what you've written\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nGets out?\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nYeah, I've been really lucky to work\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nWith good editors all my life\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nAnd I don't know how journalists work\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nWith ones who aren't\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nMy editor at Bellingcat\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nWhen I started getting death threats\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nAnd got that bounty put on me was like\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nHe mentioned this\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nBounty? Please go over it\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nBut pay attention\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nAfter the Christchurch shooting\n\n01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nI was on a documentary for ABC Australia\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nTalking about 8chan and stuff\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nAnd they found it and they got angry at it\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nAnd they put a 15-bit coin bounty on my head\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nAnd it's probably a joke\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nBecause it's 8chan\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nBut that's the point\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nThey could always say it's a joke\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nUntil you get shot and they're like\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nThat was my idea\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nSo I reported it to the police\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nAnd the editor went to her contacts in the FBI\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nAnd tried to get something\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nNothing ever gets done\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nBut that's the way\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nThere's also not much that you could do\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nOne of the things I do know\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nBut you were saying your editor at Bellingcat\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nYeah, she did everything she could\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000\nTo get people to take it\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nEven though there's nothing that will be done about it\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nBecause she considers her job to protect her creatives\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nI shouldn't call you creatives\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000\nI should call you something else\n\n01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000\nThe thing that made me almost break down\n\n01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000\nThe assassination of Jamal Khashoggi\n\n01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nWas his editor\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nKaren Atia at the Washington Post\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000\nAnd her reaction to it\n\n01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nAnd you could tell she's one of those editors\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nWho would take a bullet for anybody\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nWriting for her\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nAnd you hope you work for somebody like that\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nIt's crazy that\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000\nNow journalists\n\n01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nAlmost seem like they're part of\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nThe intelligence service\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000\nYou're basically\n\n01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000\nNot spies\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nBut you're certainly putting yourself out\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nIn a real harm's way\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000\nBy simply caring about\n\n01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nReporting truth\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nNow you can get poisoned\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nMurdered\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nDecapitated in all sorts of horrible shit\n\n01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nYou know, I think that's\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nAlways been the case in journalism\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nWhat makes this more on this edge\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nWhere we're actually dealing with live intelligence\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nRather than reporting cold intelligence\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nIs the fact that nobody\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nIncluding the intelligence agencies\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nUnderstands the world right now\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nWhich is like a good\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nSituation to work in if you're somebody\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nWho gets the internet 3%\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nMore than the guys working at the FBI\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nLook, this guy's obviously referencing\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nThe\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nThe meme of this\n\n01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000\nAnd a 40 year old guy is like\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000\nThere's a meme?\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000\nI had a time where I was trying to explain\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nThe remove kebab meme\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nWhich I'm not going to explain here\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nIf you don't need it, it's just a racist meme\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000\nBy the Christchurch shooter\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nBut having to go through this manifesto\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nLine by line and explain\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nThis in-joke that these nerds told on the internet\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nTo each other\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nIt's weird\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nWhen you're going against entropy\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nWhen you side, the thing\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nThat drives fascism\n\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nWhich is a modern invention\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nYou can't have an ancient fascist country\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nUnless you change your definitions\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nBecause you have the tenets of fascism\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nInclude\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nLike absolute nihilism\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nAnd manipulation of the media\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nTakeover of it\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nThat includes this idea of\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nYou have to subvert the very idea of truth\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nWhich I see a thousand articles a day\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nAs much as I try to avoid the news\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000\nI just see Newsweek\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nTime, CNN\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nWashington Post\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000\nI see a different permutation\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nOf people coping with something that seems\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nAs a ninth grade history student to me\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nTo be the same headline over and over again\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000\nBoy, these guys really\n\n01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nWill stop at nothing to make everyone\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nNot understand that there's an objective truth\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nSee, I think\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nPart of the problem is that\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nFascists\n\n01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nNever tell the truth\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nBut they are often the most authentic\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nPlayers in the media\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nAtmosphere and in the political space\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000\nThis is something to bring it back to ISIS\n\n01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nWho I do think are, I think it's an Islamo-fascist movement\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000\nJust like we have crypto-fascists here\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nIn the United States\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nThis is your recruitment propaganda\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nAnd you compare it to the recruitment propaganda\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000\nOf the United States military\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nYou watch a U.S. Marine Corps recruitment video\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000\nYou're gonna see cool guys with guns, cool uniforms\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nYou're gonna see cool tanks rolling everywhere\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nNobody gets shot, nobody gets hurt\n\n01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nNobody's bleeding\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000\nYou watch ISIS propaganda\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nAnd they'll follow a single guy from his journey\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nLeaving Canada and going to the Islamic State\n\n01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nAnd picking up a rocket launcher and fighting\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nTo him getting blown up and it zooming in\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nLovingly on his torn apart corpse on the ground\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nTo be\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nAnd people embrace it because it's authentic\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nBecause we live in this culture where everything is\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nLike so plastic and formulated\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nAnd it was the same thing that was explained to me\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nI talked to this guy who's a pretty sleazy dude\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nRick Wilson, he's a former Republican\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nPolitical strategist and during the 2016 election\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nI was talking to him about\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nPolitical ads and we were evaluating\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nTrump's first campaign ad with one of Hillary Clinton's\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nMost recent ads and he said\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nEverybody's making fun of Trump's campaign ad\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nBecause it's so like juvenile and looks like some kid\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nCooked it up on the internet\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nThat's going to do a thousand times more for his campaign\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nThan anything she could spend $20 million on\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nBecause that feels like something a kid cooked up\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nOn his laptop because he cared\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nAnd it's the same thing with ISIS's stuff\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nIt's the same thing fascists\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nAlways have going for them\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nIs that they're lying about everything\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nBut the emotional truth at the core of the movement\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nSpeaks to something in people\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nAnd a politician who's just trying to get elected\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nNever can\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nAnd you don't want to be distant from that\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nBut there's a\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nI want to\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nInculcate myself\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nBut also\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nPresent the lighter side of that\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nWhich is like there was somebody that reached out\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nTo me through private messaging and said\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nThat they were a mental health professional\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nAnd that they work with at risk kids\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nAnd by at risk I mean\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nParticularly the kids that are at risk of self harm\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nAnd\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nThat\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nThis person was writing to me to let me know\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nI put a quote from my show\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nOn the door of their office\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nAt this center\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nWhere these kids that are not privileged\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nThey've\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nSunk down by virtue of wanting\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nTo die to the lowest\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nLike\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nDrain gutter\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nAnd they're coming through him\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nAnd he liked the show\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nRick and Morty\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nNot community\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nWhich is very nihilistic\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nLike fuck it\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nI believe the quote was the thing that Morty says to his sister\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nWhich is like nothing matters\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nLike nobody exists on purpose\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nCome watch TV\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nWhich I did personally write\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nAnd I did design it\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nTo appeal to the potential\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nRunaway in all of us\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nIt is something that I wanted to hear\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nWhen I was 17 from\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nEspecially\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nAn imagine kid brother\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nAnd\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nHe said he put it on his door\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nAnd that he was just reporting to me\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nThat it was like making kids trust him\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nAnd it brought me to tears\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nI got to tell my therapist\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nI make this shit\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nI just follow my heart\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nSometimes my heart is dark\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nAnd tortured and poisonous\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nAnd sometimes my heart is\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nPollyanna and all that stuff\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nBut what you're talking about is authenticity\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nThe perceived authenticity of the message\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nVersus\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nLike when kids are attuned\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nTo the horse shit\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nSo when I was young\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nFight club was this big\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nIt was like it just spoke to me\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nIt was like oh my god this movie gets it\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nOh my god the corporate America and all that stuff\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nLike anything that's horse shit\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nAnything that goes through channels\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nOn its way to touch you\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nNo matter how it's touching you\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nIt would be simpler to just reach out\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nAnd go yeah like maybe there is no god\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nMaybe life means nothing\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nIt's like I'm listening to this person first\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nGod forbid they tell me to do something\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nTerrible\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nBecause I just don't have time\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nFor this fucking Pringles can over here\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nLike that's like oh sorry Jeff\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nI didn't mean to personalize that\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000\nThat's an inside joke kind of thing\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nBut like that idea of like yeah\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nNo this contains no sucrose\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nAnd this will eventually lead to your\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nIt sort of reminds me in high school\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nThe kind of battle that my teachers would tell me\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nOf like at least the way they characterized it\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nLike during the cold war\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nWhen you're going to third world countries\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nAnd you're pitching them democracy versus communism\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nAnd you're basically saying\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nIf you go with us\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nYour grandkids are gonna maybe\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nHave a lot of bread\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nLike they can buy it at a supermarket\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nIf you go with them\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nEveryone's gonna eat a lot more tomorrow\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nAnd\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nThat conversation probably that conflict\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nBut it's like the paradigm\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nIt cuts to that\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nWhich is like\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nAuthenticity\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nFidelity of messaging\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nHey, talking to you\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nAnd I'm talking to you fucking straight\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nHave you ever felt like killing yourself?\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nYes\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nAnd then the other person is going like\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nHey, talking to you\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nDidn't mean to scare you\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nEverything's fine\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nNo, of course, Uncle Henry\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nOkay, good night\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nI'm gonna go fuck your Aunt Irene\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nAnd then\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nDrop dead Freds over here\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nI was like I'm gonna sneak out my window\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nAnd they're authentic\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nIt is\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nI'm so glad you brought that up\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nBecause it also is like\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nIt's this shit posting thing where it's like\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nPeople flooding a squirting ink\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nThere where they go like\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nHere's my manifesto\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nYou take that\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nShit posting is like sort of the tactic\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nAnd it's not like fascist or inherently\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nRight-wing or left-wing or negative or anything\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000\nIt's just a thing that you can do to sort of flood\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nA discussion or a conversation online\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nWith nonsense, usually a bunch of like meaningless\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nMemes or like stuff like that\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nIn order to kind of distract any sort of conversation\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nUsually not just nonsense but stuff that's like\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nDeliverately kind of emotionally provocative\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nIn order to kind of derail productive conversation\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nIt's kind of an inverted dog whistle\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nAnd it's the example that I brought up\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nIn the case of terrorism was how like the 8chan\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nShooter had a bunch of\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nReferences to internet memes and stuff\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nIn his manifesto that like had nothing\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nTo do with anything and also would bring up\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nPeople like Candace Owens who he wasn't a fan of\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nBut he knew that if he dropped her name in the manifesto\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nIt would start like a right-wing, left-wing\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nFight and he could like sort of get people\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nTalking about that as like while\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nThey were also grouping the strategy\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nLike Charles Manson told his people\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nRight, right, you know white people\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nHate black people on the walls after you stabbed someone\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nYeah, it's not a totally new tactic\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nIt's just this is the term the internet\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nYeah, you just like sort of you're the Grinch\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nYou're Oscar, you're a fan of\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nEntropy\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nEntropy is going to get you to where you want to be faster\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nBecause order is not getting you anywhere\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nAlright anyways\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nAlso you have a new\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nChildren's book coming out\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nIt's called Good Night Moon\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nSorry you're broken into nine fractional pieces\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nI was gonna go oh the places you won't go\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nBecause the Nazis have bombed the trains\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nOh the places you refuse to go\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nYeah\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nDo you have kids by the way\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nGood god no\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nSo this is a job that yeah that would make sense\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nOh no I don't have kids because all the drugs\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nCan I ask you a weird question\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nIf you did have kids\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nHow would you deal with that question\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nBecause people would like load\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nI'm like\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nIf you had kids\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nWould you stop\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nNo\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000\nI don't know I'm not a parent\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nSo like my advice on this is almost meaningless\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nMy opinion as a former child\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nIs that\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nA retired child\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nYeah as a retired child\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nRetired\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nAren't we all\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nI love that\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nI think you should let kids\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nBe interested in and read about\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nAnd study about anything\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nThey want I don't think you should necessarily let them\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nWatch anything they want\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nThat was the rule my parents had for me\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nThat like I'd have a lot of disagreements with my parents\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nBut they were like we're gonna watch what you watch on tv\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nBut any book is fine\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nBecause at least he's fucking reading\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nAnd like I don't know if that works in the modern era\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nBecause that can mean like the kid winds up on fucking 8 chance\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000\nSo like I don't know\n\n01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nAre we supposed to censor\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nNo you know I think\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nCensorship of that kind never works\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nWhich is not to say that like taking a site like 8chan\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nOff the internet the way that it has\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nCurrently been taken off is bad because I don't\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nThink that censorship I think that's being like\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nHey company do you want your name associated\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nWith a site that's killed 80 people and they go like\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nYeah I really don't\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nBut all that shit still you can post that\n\n01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nLike in a post net neutrality world let them have\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nLower bandwidth\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nYeah I think what\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nAnything that really works in the long run\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nWhen it comes to like fighting\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nAuthoritarianism and fascism through raising\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nBetter people is giving them\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nA solid grounding both on like a\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nOne-to-one level in sort of the example\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nYou said as a human being of how they should treat\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nPeople by how you treat people\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nAnd number two give them a thorough grounding\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nIn history which they won't get\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nFrom school because like school history educations\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nAre garbage so don't just tell them about\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nWorld War II and the Revolutionary War\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nTalk to them about Bhopal India\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nAnd the East India Trading Company\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nSounds like vegetables\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nHistory vegetables\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nNo wonder I was dying\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nI'm not even willing to do this\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nAnd I'm the coolest dad that could ever live\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nAre you a dad now Dan?\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nNo I'm like you man\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nI still got to fight to fight\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nNo I'm just lazy and I don't want to talk\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nAbout Bhopal\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nThat's kind of the problem\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nSo I'm a hero for opting out of\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nReproduction\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nThat's an option\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nThat's my Syria\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nSingleness\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000\nOpting out is a\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nFine way to go\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nI don't know\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nI know like\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nWhat I will say you were saying earlier\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nLike what can be done\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nTo like fight this and how do we actually fight it\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nAnd like the answer is that\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nNobody\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nIf you want to have a world where Nazis\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nDon't regularly come back\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nInto power and kill a shitload of people\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nAnd then they have to be fought\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nAnd then they get like beaten down\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nFor a little while and then 80 years later\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nThey come back again if we don't want to have that world\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nAnd we also want to live in a relatively free\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nAnd open society\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nNobody gets to be just\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nA comedy writer\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nWhich I was for a while\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nNobody gets to be just a whatever you do\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nNobody gets to be just a teacher or a hairdresser\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nOr a construction worker\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nBut it also has to be\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nInvolved in local politics\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nEverybody has to be an anti-fascist\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nEverybody has to put some responsibility\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nOn themselves\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nTo keep shit from getting fucked up\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nOtherwise nobody gets fucked up again\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nWe got to eat those history vegetables\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nWell we got to eat those ideological vegetables\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nYeah\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nYou know one of the\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nProblems we have right now in our society\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nYou look at some of the worst people\n\n01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nWho are currently on sort of the site of the right\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nResistance right now\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nAnd the people often who aren't\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nAdvocating it directly themselves\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000\nBut who are saying things like that\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000\n600 million Muslims are radicalized terrorists\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nAnd then a guy who reads them a bunch\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nGoes and shoots up a mosque in Quebec City\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nThat particular guy whose name\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nI won't mention here\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nHas a screenplay that he just couldn't\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nGet sold in Hollywood\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000\nAnd Steve Bannon had some screenplays\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000\nThat he just couldn't get sold\n\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000\nAnd a lot of these guys who are currently\n\n01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nWorking outrage against immigrants and Muslims\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nHave screenplays that they just couldn't sell\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000\nHave TV pitches they couldn't sell\n\n01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nThey're just failed screenwriters?\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nAnd failed stand-up comedians\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000\nA lot of them are failed stand-up comedians\n\n01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000\nYou're a success\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nYou're on a stage right now\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nThank you\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000\nProud boys founder Gavin McGinnis\n\n01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000\nCouldn't quite hack it as a stand-up comedian\n\n01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nAnd Dave Rubin's the same case\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000\nSo they get into politics\n\n01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nBecause it's easier\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nTo be good at this stuff\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nSome of them succeed\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000\nAnd the ones who are decent people and don't\n\n01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000\nGo find something else to do with their time\n\n01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000\nBut the ones who don't succeed and are shitty\n\n01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nI can just be racist\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000\nAnd then I can make a shitload of money\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nBeing racist and using the same tactics\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000\nI learned to rile up a crowd\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000\nAnd get them to hate immigrants\n\n01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nAnd they're focusing on politics\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000\nBecause it's the only place that they can\n\n01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000\nMake a living because they're not quite\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nGood enough to make us laugh\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nYeah\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nIt's the evil version of Christian rock\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nI know four chords\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nAnd I love Christ\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nA little\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nI can either love learning chords\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nSo much that I learned six chords\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nI could double down on my love of Christ\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nIf I hear any\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nNegative talk about Striper\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nI'm leaving the stage right now\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nNobody's talking bad about Striper\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nIt's the same thing\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nI love Christ\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000\nThe Christ\n\n01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nI love Christ\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nTwo chords\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nSmoke on the water\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000\nYou know if\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nIf this Rick and Morty thing doesn't pan out\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nIt should have been walking on water\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nWait, no notes\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nThat's not...\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nWhat do you mean it should be walk on the water\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nI'm saying that song was smoke on the water's\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nWater's chords\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nSo I was supposed to say walk on the water\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nIf you got to the chorus, yeah\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000\nWalk on the water\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nYes, I could have extended the bit\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nAnd see Dan, if you become a grifter\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000\nYou never have to take notes again\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nI could busk\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000\nWell, you're not going to keep your lifestyle\n\n01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000\nWith that\n\n01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000\nAlso, I can't play those three chords\n\n01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nI don't\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nI don't even know what chord means\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nOut of curiosity\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000\nWhat do you think a chord is\n\n01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nI'm asking that\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nIronically, like...\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000\nIt's a group of notes that\n\n01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000\nHarmonize together\n\n01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000\nI don't know, they work together\n\n01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nYeah\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000\nAnd there's several different kinds of chords\n\n01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000\nWhat do you think the difference between a major\n\n01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nAnd a minor chord is\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nThrough the lens of a logic\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nPro user, the difference is that\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000\nThe middle\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nLine is either\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000\nCloser to the bottom line\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nOr closer to the top line\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000\nYou're flattening the third\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nYou're flattening one note\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nYou're by half step\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nCome at me, bitch\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000\nWhat do you think a sus chord is\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000\nI think it's a sustained chord\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nGenerally\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nSustaining what\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nSustaining the chromatology\n\n01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nI don't know, man\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nFuck you\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000\nWhat do you think the\n\n01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000\nOvertone series is\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000\nIt was the\n\n01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000\nFollow-up to Downton Abbey\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000\nIt was a\n\n01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nShort-lived spin-off\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000\nThe Overtones\n\n01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000\nThey were always that family that was like\n\n01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nWell, I think the servants took the wine\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000\nGet out of here, Maud\n\n01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000\nAnd then they became the Overtones\n\n01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nAre you more about the diatonic or the chromatic\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000\nYou know, I\n\n01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nI'll quote Donald Trump being quizzed\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000\nAbout the Bible and go, I think both\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nEqually\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000\nRemember that clip from him in the Camp J trailer\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000\nThey were like, what, New Testament, Old Testament\n\n01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nHe's like\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000\nBoth\n\n01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000\nSo, so close to a hero\n\n01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000\nI honestly\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nThat's like Bob Roberts shit\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nLike it's like\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000\nTanner-88, like fucking metahumor\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nYou know\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000\nBoth, can I be president now\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nBecause if I can, you're the idiot\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000\nYou proved that right\n\n01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000\nAnyways\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nYou playing the music, Rob?\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nNo, never\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000\nHave you ever tried?\n\n01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nYeah, I played the tuba in high school\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000\nThe tuba?\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nAre you talking tuba or sousaphone?\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000\nNo, tuba\n\n01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000\nThat was, sousaphone were for people who played the tuba and wanted to\n\n01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000\nTubas were for people who couldn't play anything\n\n01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000\nBut had to get a music credit\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000\nRight\n\n01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000\nWere you in a marching band?\n\n01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000\nSitting band\n\n01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000\nJeff, you got an email\n\n01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000\nBecause he has a 15 Bitcoin\n\n01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000\nPrice on his head\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nYou stopped me\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nDid you ever talk about that at all?\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000\nYou got an email\n\n01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000\nBlackmailing you for 5 Bitcoin\n\n01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000\nOh, you did?\n\n01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nDid you pay it?\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nJeff texted me, hey can you loan me 5 Bitcoin?\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nI got an email today\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000\nI happen to know\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000\nGlenn Maxwell\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000\nWho is really in deep shit right now\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000\nShe's in the headlines now\n\n01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nI haven't seen her in many years\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000\nBut she\n\n01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000\nIs a pal\n\n01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nAnd she is probably\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nThe procurus for Jeffrey Epstein's\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000\nSexual Trafficking\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nEmpire\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000\nAnd I met her at a charity event\n\n01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000\nAnd I believe Jeffrey Epstein was there too\n\n01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000\nIs for Michael J. Fox's\n\n01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000\nParkinson's disease thing\n\n01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000\nAnd we brought her on stage\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000\nAnd I sang a song to her\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000\nAnd everything she said was a lie\n\n01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000\nBecause she couldn't talk about what she did\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000\nThen we went out and hung out\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000\nAnd we remained friends\n\n01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000\nAnd as such, you're probably in her phone book\n\n01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000\nYes\n\n01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000\nGreg Poops told me\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000\nGet her number off of your phone\n\n01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000\nAnd you did\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000\nEvery phone text that we have\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nIs just her saying happy birthday\n\n01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nAnd she said\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000\nJeff, I'm at the Soho house\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000\nDo you want to come join me for lunch?\n\n01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nAnd we'll get there and there's Hugh Laurie\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nSitting over there and we talk\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000\nAbout some of the questions\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000\nBecause she's\n\n01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000\nShe's a very fascinating lady\n\n01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000\nI didn't realize that she was\n\n01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000\nPossibly\n\n01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000\nBut you, because\n\n01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nApplaud if you've received a spam\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000\nSaying\n\n01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000\nI'll read it\n\n01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nI don't think this is like a Nigerian\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nLike thing\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000\nWe all get lots of spam\n\n01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000\nAnd lots of emails saying that your social security number\n\n01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000\nHas been compromised and whatever\n\n01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000\nConfidentiality management\n\n01:41:24.000 -->

fugazy\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000\nIt has come to my attention\n\n01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nMy\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000\nDave\n\n01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nIt has come to this

knowledge\n\n01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000\nWe could be like the young Turks\n\n01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000\nOr some kind of web based news\n\n01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000\nAgency like we have a scoop here\n\n01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000\nBellingcat\n\n01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000\nHer phone's been hacked\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000\nTo me that's what it suggests\n\n01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nWhat really freaks me out about that\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000\nEmail coming in today is that I almost posted\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000\nShe sent me\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nYou almost sent him five bitcoin\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nBecause you don't really understand what it's worth\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nBut you were an early adopter and I keep telling you\n\n01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000\nYou're a trillionaire\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nI think it was my 30th birthday at\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000\nAnd she was my date\n\n01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000\nWe threw a prom themed\n\n01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nBased\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000\nAnd she came as my date\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000\nI picked her up at the peninsula hotel\n\n01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000\nAnd she said I've never been to a prom\n\n01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000\nAnd so I went there and I got her corsage\n\n01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000\nAnd she said I've never done this\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nI've only seen this in movies\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000\nAnd so I pick her up and we go to the thing\n\n01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000\nAnd\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000\nWe took a photo together and then she sent me\n\n01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nA photo\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000\nFrame in a sterling silver\n\n01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000\nLike you know kind of 8x10 size frame\n\n01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000\nAnd I have that\n\n01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000\nAnd right before I saw that\n\n01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nClearly spammy\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000\nBullshit\n\n01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000\nI almost posted that photo\n\n01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000\nAnd said like this isn't going to age well\n\n01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000\nYeah\n\n01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000\nYou should get rid of that photo\n\n01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000\nEvery time I\n\n01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000\nOn my computer\n\n01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nI have the Guardian and I have Reuters\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000\nThat comes up right off the bat\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000\nAnd it's all day pictures\n\n01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000\nOf\n\n01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000\nGalen\n\n01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nStanding next to Jeffrey Epstein\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000\nLike I knew her\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000\nAnd I have a photo where I look like\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000\nI'm the young Jeffrey Epstein\n\n01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nIn that photo\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000\nRob Evans I see your knees twitching\n\n01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nYou're a conflict journalist\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nDo you have a take on this the Epstein\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nYeah the Epstein thing\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nI think you should get rid of that picture man\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nThat's not going to be good in about 3 months\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000\nI want to take on his situation\n\n01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000\nBut I have a fucking take on the Epstein thing\n\n01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nI'm sure everyone does\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000\n60-40 I think 60%\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000\nOf themselves\n\n01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000\nOkay so here's my apparently\n\n01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000\nControversial take which is like\n\n01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000\nA suicide that\n\n01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nUnwatched is murder\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000\nWell\n\n01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nYou could make a case that almost every\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nSuicide in the US prison system\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000\nAnd there's a huge number of them is murder\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000\nWait but\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000\nDo you know statistics about\n\n01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000\nPrisoners who are of such\n\n01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000\nStrategic\n\n01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000\nSignificance that\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.320\nHow often do they fail?\n\n01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.480\nThis is arguably the most important arrestee\n\n01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:12.120\nin the history of criminal justice.\n\n01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.000\nI don't know how to exaggerate it.\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:14.960\nWell, here's what I'll say.\n\n01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.120\nHis suicide watch failing is murder.\n\n01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.600\nHe wasn't on Suicide Watch.\n\n01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.440\nHe wasn't on Suicide Watch?\n\n01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.760\nNo, I'm taking it off.\n\n01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.640\nMaybe that was part of the plot.\n\n01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.360\nMaybe they took him off.\n\n01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.120\nIt's the last time, I'll say this,\n\n01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.320\nthe last time there was a prisoner\n\n01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.000\nwho was like this high profile was Lee Harvey Oswald,\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.840\nand they didn't do a great job there.\n\n01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.600\nLike, it wasn't a bang up protection gig.\n\n01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.560\nHis was on camera.\n\n01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.000\nYeah, well, here's a thing.\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.280\nHere's a funny little question to raise about Suicide Watch.\n\n01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:52.280\nYeah, my neighbor's doorbell records my dog taking a shit.\n\n01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.160\nWhat's with these stories that come out\n\n01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:00.800\nfrom federal penitentiaries of the most notorious\n\n01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.840\npotential witnesses?\n\n01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.520\nI was like, well, we'll tell you what happened later.\n\n01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.000\nLike, wait, you can't put a little bubblegum size camera.\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.920\nThe fact that he either committed suicide or was,\n\n01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:18.720\nit was the day that Ghislaine, all of her,\n\n01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:23.120\nlike this tranche of documents came out about him\n\n01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.280\nand her involvement.\n\n01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:27.080\nAnd that's the day that he kills himself.\n\n01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:28.480\nThat's either him going, oh, fuck it.\n\n01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.480\nI don't want to get involved in this.\n\n01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.320\nSteve Levy just sent me this link.\n\n01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.640\nIt's in the New York Times where the staffer\n\n01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.160\non guard duty before it happened.\n\n01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.880\nIt was like, I was the guard on duty.\n\n01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.800\nWhen my shift ended, a new guard came.\n\n01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.760\nI'd never seen him before.\n\n01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.720\nI said, what's your name?\n\n01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.560\nAnd he goes, Steve.\n\n01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.560\nAnd I said, Steve what?\n\n01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.200\nAnd he looks around for a second, then said, JV.\n\n01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.960\nMy name is Steve Jail.\n\n01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.680\nI was tired in that same legit.\n\n01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.520\nSteve Jail?\n\n01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.040\nThat's the person who would have been\n\n01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.400\non guard duty when he died.\n\n01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.520\nSteve Jail.\n\n01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.240\nHoly shit.\n\n01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.360\nThis is some links from the New York Times.\n\n01:47:58.360 --> 01:47:59.360\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.360\nHoly shit.\n\n01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.200\nIs that really from the New York Times?\n\n01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:07.000\nIt says that Steve, do you want to come out and confirm this?\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.600\nAt least hire somebody who went through UCB\n\n01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.320\nto come up with a better name.\n\n01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:15.600\nHe didn't get that job by taking improv glasses.\n\n01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.520\nThat's what it says.\n\n01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.400\nThat job description says, do you own piano wires?\n\n01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.360\nI'm Steve Mafia.\n\n01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:21.760\nYeah.\n\n01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.880\nI'm Steve Murderer.\n\n01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.880\nI'm Steve Prison.\n\n01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:25.120\nAnd I'm Steve Assassin.\n\n01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.200\nI want to interject and say, I don't want to make light\n\n01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.560\nof a fucking murder, because if that's what it is,\n\n01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.080\nI also don't want to make light of a suicide\n\n01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.640\nif that's what it is.\n\n01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.520\nBut it's so high profile, and there's\n\n01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.640\nquestions of rule of law here.\n\n01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.840\nI just don't understand.\n\n01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.880\nWhen you arrest a guy who has a safe\n\n01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.880\nwith a bunch of diamonds and a passport that's fake\n\n01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.760\nand has an alternate identity in Saudi Arabia,\n\n01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:53.000\nand everyone agrees, I imagine being this guy in a box\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.040\nand going like, fuck, man, I never\n\n01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:59.640\nthought in a million years that Trump would be president.\n\n01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.760\nBecause I think he thought he had all his bases covered\n\n01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.160\nand was like, if it ever goes wrong with the Democrats,\n\n01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.160\nI got every Republican in the world on my side.\n\n01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:13.440\nAnd then he never foresaw the one thing that would fuck him\n\n01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.000\ncompletely, which is the Republican Party being\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.120\nhijacked by so much reality TV celebrity\n\n01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.680\nthat he's like, ha, I'm in this cell.\n\n01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.440\nI've done it before.\n\n01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.400\nI'll do it again.\n\n01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:30.680\nI have literally everybody on my, oh, shit, everybody?\n\n01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.520\nThere's not a single person in this world\n\n01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.040\nthat's going to stop me from being murdered now.\n\n01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.560\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.840\nLike, he was also pretty deep with Bill Clinton.\n\n01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.440\nYeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.280\nAnd I think if you boil it down to.\n\n01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.080\nSo was Glenn.\n\n01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.080\nGlenn was like a very type of Clinton.\n\n01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.440\nI'm saying he was deep with Clinton and Trump,\n\n01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.240\nand he didn't think Trump would become.\n\n01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:56.080\nHe's like, hey, as long as I just keep this Rolodex up.\n\n01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.600\nI think you're making not the same mistake he made.\n\n01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.480\nBut in terms of where you're looking here as to his mistake,\n\n01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:04.280\nI think you're making the same mistake he made,\n\n01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.480\nwhich is that he looked at the top.\n\n01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.080\nThat's very flattering.\n\n01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:09.600\nWhat he did not pay attention to were the people at the bottom.\n\n01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.480\nAnd what brought him down was not Trump becoming president.\n\n01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.680\nWhat brought him down was a mix of two police detectives\n\n01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.720\nwho didn't care that it was the end of their career\n\n01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.600\nto follow this case and a really, really dogged journalist\n\n01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:25.680\nat a local paper in Florida who stayed on the case\n\n01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.040\nlike a fucking pit bull and wouldn't let it go.\n\n01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.400\nSo you've read about this.\n\n01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.440\nYeah, that's why fucking Epstein is dead right now.\n\n01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.680\nAnd the story, and this is one of the things\n\n01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.040\nthat I think is so fucked up about QAnon,\n\n01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.520\nis when people imagine the pedophile conspiracy\n\n01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.520\nthat they think is at the center of world government,\n\n01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.800\nthey imagine five-year-old kids being\n\n01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.720\nsacrificed by Satanists in the basement of a pizza place\n\n01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.840\nand the actual conspiracy that will\n\n01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.440\nhave a huge amount of documentation.\n\n01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.200\nWhat actually went on is that a bunch of rich, powerful people\n\n01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.040\naround the world wanted to fuck high school girls.\n\n01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.680\nThat's the whole conspiracy.\n\n01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:00.800\nThey weren't six.\n\n01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.800\nThey weren't 10.\n\n01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.680\nThey were usually 15 to 17 years old.\n\n01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:06.680\nThat's what Jeffrey Epstein provided.\n\n01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.640\nThat's what all these billionaires and millionaires\n\n01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.400\nand presidents and senators and members of the royal family\n\n01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.120\nwanted as teenagers.\n\n01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.480\nWondering like right before.\n\n01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.160\nWeird flex, but OK.\n\n01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:23.200\nRight before, the day before Jeffrey Epstein kills himself,\n\n01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.720\nasking friends of mine that we all met Glenn\n\n01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.360\nand we all hung out with her.\n\n01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.560\nAnd she's quite fascinating.\n\n01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:32.280\nAnd she's a very interesting woman and multilingual\n\n01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:34.880\nand just awesome.\n\n01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:37.800\nWait, was she totally involved with this?\n\n01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:42.000\nAnd I think all this paperwork came out,\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.720\nall these documents came out that would really\n\n01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:49.400\nhave affected Jeffrey Epstein and Trump, Bill Clinton,\n\n01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.720\nthe Sultan of Brunei, Prince Henry, all this shit.\n\n01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.440\nAnd then he's dead.\n\n01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.560\nAnd the coup.\n\n01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:02.960\nSo Rob Evans, do you think Occam's razor says suicide?\n\n01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.280\nThis is one of those situations.\n\n01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.920\nI think Occam's razor applies to things\n\n01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:09.560\nthat you have some precedent for.\n\n01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:12.160\nI'm not aware of a situation in which a guy who\n\n01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.280\nhad a sitting president, a former president,\n\n01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.920\nthe Sultan of Brunei, a member of the royal family,\n\n01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:21.040\nseveral sitting senators, most of the fucking granite.\n\n01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:24.840\nAnd a guy named Gary Jail checking in to make sure\n\n01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.080\nhe doesn't kill himself.\n\n01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.360\nSo like, is it possible?\n\n01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.440\nSteve Jail.\n\n01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:29.560\nSteve Jail.\n\n01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.480\nGet his name right.\n\n01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.520\nSorry, what are you saying?\n\n01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:33.960\nIs it possible he was murdered?\n\n01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:34.840\nFuck it, of course.\n\n01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.800\nHe pissed out like a lot of people\n\n01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.200\nhad a vested interest in him dying.\n\n01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.360\nSo yeah, there's a real good chance he was murdered.\n\n01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.640\nIs it also possible that a guy who had only ever lived\n\n01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.120\nlike as the richest, one of the richest people in the world\n\n01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:48.640\nand who was used to having every whim catered to,\n\n01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.520\nwas broken by a few weeks of prison\n\n01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.480\nand just decided to end it because he couldn't take it?\n\n01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:52.980\nSure.\n\n01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:55.800\nWell, but he, I mean, he did it before.\n\n01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:57.320\nHe made it before.\n\n01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:57.560\nYeah.\n\n01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.680\nYeah, but that was a real fucking different story.\n\n01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.160\nWell, I mean, it was a different story, especially\n\n01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:03.880\nnow that it turned out this way.\n\n01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.160\nHe was looking at like basically a life sentence.\n\n01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:11.080\nMy thing of us about rule of law, because if you,\n\n01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.800\nnow we're all focused on this autopsy,\n\n01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.240\nand I'm like, who cares if the autopsy says it?\n\n01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.760\nYeah, big FD.\n\n01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.000\nLike, remember, you could go into this guy's cell,\n\n01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.040\nand I'm sorry, I must be frustrating you\n\n01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:26.600\nbecause I'm like, oh, imagine the fucking,\n\n01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.600\nI'm like the liberal QAnon.\n\n01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:35.600\nBut I'm like, if you wanted to kill this detainee,\n\n01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:42.440\nlike it is as easy as literally like sliding open\n\n01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:49.840\na thing on his cell and going like, my name is Steve Jail.\n\n01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:53.000\nI am never going to come into that cell.\n\n01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.880\nLike, you know what to do.\n\n01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.960\nRight, that's the thing.\n\n01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.720\nIt's like when a person is in that dire straits,\n\n01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:03.800\nactively not keeping them from killing themselves\n\n01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:06.960\nis murder, regardless of conspiracy.\n\n01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.440\nWhat I think you might be dancing around is that.\n\n01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.760\nIs that there was a failure to protect one of the most\n\n01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.320\npowerful pawns in the history of chess.\n\n01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:17.280\nThat's not the story.\n\n01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.680\nThe story is that if you want someone dead\n\n01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:21.800\nand you want them dead by their own hand,\n\n01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.440\nthe easiest way to guarantee that is make them\n\n01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.080\nbe a normal prisoner in a US maximum security prison.\n\n01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:32.480\nBecause that'll pretty much do the fucking job for you.\n\n01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:35.760\nBut he was in a New York prison.\n\n01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.840\nIt was a New York federal detention facility.\n\n01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.160\nBut he was like alone in a cell.\n\n01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.160\nRight, alone.\n\n01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.400\nHe didn't have a cellmate.\n\n01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.160\nYou're almost describing the threat\n\n01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.640\nof being thrown into general pop.\n\n01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:46.140\nI get that.\n\n01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:48.960\nWhat I'm also describing is being isolated.\n\n01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.440\nIf I apply what I would assume my Occam's razor is to that,\n\n01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:57.080\nis that what you said is that he said, fuck it.\n\n01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.240\nI've been in jail since early July.\n\n01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.000\nAnd I'm looking at being in jail for the rest of my life.\n\n01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.040\nAnd he just said, the first moment, I'm alone.\n\n01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.440\nAnd it's our job to keep these people alive.\n\n01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.920\nI'm outraged about Jeffrey Dahmer dying in prison.\n\n01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:13.240\nLike, there is something.\n\n01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:18.880\nWe have this attitude about bad people in our society\n\n01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.720\nwhere we're just like, lock them away.\n\n01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:22.520\nAnd I hope they get raped to death.\n\n01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:23.480\nAnd I hope they die.\n\n01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.840\nI hope they kill themselves.\n\n01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.640\nYeah, Zach, you've got to be, I want to hear MC Steve Jail.\n\n01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.440\nNo, stop it.\n\n01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.560\nSteve Jail.\n\n01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.920\nDon't do it even as a joke.\n\n01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:32.420\nGet them away.\n\n01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.920\nThis is what I want to hear what you have to say about it.\n\n01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:35.640\nCan I bring this around seamlessly to something\n\n01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:37.360\nthat ties it back to the original topic\n\n01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.480\nand is also uplifting?\n\n01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.680\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:41.520\nSo I'm in fucking Syria.\n\n01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.800\nAnd I'm talking to these guys.\n\n01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.400\nI know uplifting when I hear it.\n\n01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.080\nSo I'm talking to these guys who have been, all of these people,\n\n01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:50.760\nmen and women, who have just been dealing\n\n01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.680\nwith this brutal war against ISIS.\n\n01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.360\nAnd the last survivors of the caliphate,\n\n01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.720\nthey have in a prison, well, it's part prison camp,\n\n01:55:58.720 --> 01:55:59.560\npart refugee camp.\n\n01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:00.840\nThere's 71,000 people.\n\n01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:03.360\nNot all of them are ISIS survivors, but a lot of them\n\n01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:03.920\nare.\n\n01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.400\nAnd they've got them locked in this camp.\n\n01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.480\nAnd they're trying to figure out, what do we do with them?\n\n01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.320\nAnd one of the first things that happens\n\n01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.200\nis they start trying to send a lot of these people back\n\n01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.560\nto Iraq, because a lot of them are Iraqi and origin,\n\n01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:15.960\nor that was their port of entry.\n\n01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.320\nAnd as soon as they send them back,\n\n01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:18.720\nthey do it with a bunch of French fighters.\n\n01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.960\nAnd France says, we're not going to take these people.\n\n01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.360\nFuck them.\n\n01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.560\nThey're not French anymore.\n\n01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.080\nAnd Iraq hangs them the same day.\n\n01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.440\nThat's just what they do in Iraq.\n\n01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.160\nSo far, not so uplifting.\n\n01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.000\nNot uplifting yet.\n\n01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.120\nThe Rojavan Constitution says, the death penalty is illegal.\n\n01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:37.240\nYou cannot kill a prisoner under any circumstances.\n\n01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:38.320\nIt's not OK.\n\n01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.120\nSo they stopped sending prisoners over to Iraq,\n\n01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.680\nwho are ISIS fighters.\n\n01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.160\nAnd so I'm talking to these people.\n\n01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.440\nI'm trying to understand, because me and my partner Jake,\n\n01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.640\nwe both had reported from the fighting against ISIS.\n\n01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:52.040\nAnd in my case, at least, I've been shot at by these people.\n\n01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:54.480\nI've also spent hours and hours and hours talking to people\n\n01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.040\nwho've been tortured and beaten from them,\n\n01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:57.760\nhad family members killed.\n\n01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.400\nAnd I'm sitting and I start by talking to one\n\n01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.280\nof the women who's planning out their criminal justice system\n\n01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.280\nand trying to build this thing from the ground up\n\n01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:07.920\nto be more equitable than the one in Syria, which is not\n\n01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.520\nexactly a super hard story.\n\n01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.200\nBut they're trying to do a better job.\n\n01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:17.440\nAnd she's like, no, revenge is a sign of weakness.\n\n01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.960\nAnd revenge is also something that\n\n01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:20.760\nhas been endemic in this part of the world,\n\n01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:22.120\nin particular, for centuries.\n\n01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.840\nAnd it's part of why we have so much violence,\n\n01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.400\nis one member of this family kills another,\n\n01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.560\nand they kill a member of their family.\n\n01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.400\nWhat we have to do is rehabilitation.\n\n01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.240\nAnd so at first, I'm talking to this lady, who's\n\n01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:33.240\nin like, we're in a nice office room\n\n01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.760\nwhile she's dealing with ISIS prisoners and stuff.\n\n01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:38.000\nAnd I'm like, well, you're used to talking with the press.\n\n01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.360\nThere's a good chance you're putting on a show for me.\n\n01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:41.920\nSo we get down to the ground level\n\n01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.160\nto this actual prison camp, where\n\n01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.800\nthey're keeping all these ISIS detainees.\n\n01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.800\nAnd we start talking to their guards,\n\n01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.840\nto these people who have.\n\n01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.360\nLike, I talked to this one woman who\n\n01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.360\nwas telling me a story about how the day before she'd\n\n01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.840\nbeen with this ISIS bride and her kids.\n\n01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.960\nAnd the bride had knocked her down.\n\n01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:58.520\nAnd her kid had, one of her kids had bitten her on the arm.\n\n01:57:58.520 --> 01:57:59.760\nAnd she showed me the bite mark, where\n\n01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:02.000\nthis kid had ripped through the skin of her arm with his teeth.\n\n01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.280\nAnd the other kid had gone off to try to get a gas can\n\n01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:07.560\nto pour gasoline on her before her other comrades had gotten\n\n01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.520\nthem off.\n\n01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:10.600\nAnd I'm like, what do you want to be done to these people?\n\n01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.360\nAnd she's like, the only thing we can do\n\n01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.040\nis try to rehabilitate them, is try to treat them well,\n\n01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.480\nand take care of them, and eventually hope\n\n01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.080\nthat it gets through to some of them,\n\n01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.640\nand particularly get through to their kids.\n\n01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:25.360\nBecause that's all you can do, is try to rehabilitate people\n\n01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:27.120\nand be better than the people before.\n\n01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.680\nBecause if we just start killing them,\n\n01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:30.680\nbecause we don't think they can be fixed,\n\n01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.040\nthen we're exactly the same as the Dashi's, as ISIS.\n\n01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:36.560\nAnd then I start talking to the other guards, these young men\n\n01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.880\nwith AK-47s, about what do you think should be done.\n\n01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.720\nAnd they all have the same, like, we\n\n01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.160\nhave to try to fix these people.\n\n01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.280\nWe have to try to help them.\n\n01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:47.680\nBecause otherwise, this is fucked.\n\n01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.280\nOtherwise, this whole region is fucked.\n\n01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:51.800\nIf we can't get past all this violence, everything is fucked.\n\n01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:54.040\nAnd for a little bit of perspective,\n\n01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.360\nwhen I'd been in Mosul at the end of the fighting,\n\n01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:59.560\nI'd been talking to people who had fled the city\n\n01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:00.880\nduring the fighting against ISIS.\n\n01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.080\nAnd I would ask people, what do you\n\n01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.600\nplan to do when you get back?\n\n01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.680\nAnd almost everyone's answer was, well,\n\n01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.520\nthis neighbor of mine went with ISIS.\n\n01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:08.560\nAnd he informed on me.\n\n01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:10.200\nAnd that's why I had to leave town,\n\n01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:12.760\nor why my car got taken away, or why I wound up in prison.\n\n01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.400\nSo I'm going to tell on him to the Iraqi authorities and stuff.\n\n01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.680\nAnd it was like this cycle of violence being perpetuated.\n\n01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.600\nAnd all the Kurds we talked to, and the Arabs we talked to\n\n01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.640\nat this camp who were part of this thing going on in Rojava,\n\n01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.320\nwere like, you can't fucking do that anymore.\n\n01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.680\nIt has to stop somewhere.\n\n01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:30.920\nSo we're going to try to stop it.\n\n01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:35.440\nAnd that, to me, was the most uplifting thing\n\n01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.840\nthat I saw there.\n\n01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:40.160\nAnd we spent some time with this group of older women who\n\n01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:41.920\nwere part of the Neighborhood Council, who\n\n01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:46.160\nwere doing kind of what cops do in the United States,\n\n01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.920\nlike the civil side of law enforcement.\n\n01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.440\nSo they were the elected representatives\n\n01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.520\nof this neighborhood.\n\n01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:54.280\nAnd they would go around, and one of the things they did\n\n01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:56.800\nis when there was a murder, obviously you solve the murder.\n\n01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.560\nYou try to solve the murder, and you try to get the murderer\n\n01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:00.120\nin jail.\n\n02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:02.600\nAnd it's usually pretty obvious who's done it.\n\n02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.080\nBut you also have to deal with the fact\n\n02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.400\nthat there's two families that now hate each other.\n\n02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.400\nAnd so you have counseling sessions\n\n02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:09.640\nbetween the two families, where you\n\n02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:12.000\ntry to figure out what the family of the murderer\n\n02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.560\ncan give the murdered in order to try to set things to right.\n\n02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:19.600\nAnd sometimes it's months of dealing with these conversations.\n\n02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:22.000\nAnd at the end of it, they throw a big feast\n\n02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.280\nbetween both of the families and everyone else in the area,\n\n02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:27.040\nso that everybody sees this beef getting squashed,\n\n02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.240\nso that there's public shame on the side of whoever it is.\n\n02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.680\nIf another family starts up the vendetta again,\n\n02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:35.200\nthen everyone knows they're the ones breaking the peace\n\n02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.200\nthis time.\n\n02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.880\nAnd this was at the undergirding of everything\n\n02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:39.600\nthat they've done.\n\n02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.920\nAnd so I'm talking to these old ladies\n\n02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.560\nabout the fact these women who had lived 50, 60 years\n\n02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:48.480\nunder the Syrian regime, not able to hold a job,\n\n02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.440\nnot able to have any role in governance,\n\n02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:53.000\nand who are now acting as like their own local government\n\n02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.520\nfor their neighborhoods.\n\n02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.120\nAnd I asked them, could you ever go back to the way things\n\n02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.160\nwere before?\n\n02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.440\nAnd they were like, oh no, they'd have to fucking kill us.\n\n02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:05.960\nAnd later that night, my fixer, Habat,\n\n02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:09.120\ntakes us to the graveyard at the end of the day.\n\n02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:12.200\nAnd you can see the graveyard on picture 5.\n\n02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:15.040\nAnd I want to show that because it's kind of noteworthy.\n\n02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:17.720\nSo these are the way they do graves in that part of the world.\n\n02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:20.600\nEvery single grave you can see is a garden.\n\n02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:22.480\nSo they plant flowers in all of the graves\n\n02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:25.280\nso that every grave is a sprout of life.\n\n02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.320\nAnd as we're walking through this graveyard, which\n\n02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:31.440\nis all soldiers in this who died fighting the Islamic State,\n\n02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.800\nwe're walking and we're talking.\n\n02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:35.080\nAnd my fixer, Habat, is explaining to us\n\n02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.280\nhow this justice system works and the important she believes\n\n02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.040\nshould be placed on rehabilitation\n\n02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.760\nand how you can't just try to hurt people.\n\n02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.760\nYou can't just kill these people even though they kill\n\n02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:44.240\nyour families.\n\n02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.200\nLike if you capture a nice guy.\n\n02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.280\nYou have to try to keep him alive and rehabilitate him.\n\n02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.000\nAnd right after explaining this, we're\n\n02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.400\nwalking through this graveyard.\n\n02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.480\nAnd she stops at a grave and kneels down and kisses it\n\n02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.400\nand says, this was my brother.\n\n02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:02.640\nHe died fighting ISIS at the age of 17 in 2014.\n\n02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.920\nSo like that to me was the thing that was like,\n\n02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.400\nhit me like a fucking bullet.\n\n02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:12.000\nThat somebody can have an experience like that, which\n\n02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.480\nshould be a generator of so much hate.\n\n02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.760\nAnd can in the proper environment\n\n02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.880\nand with the proper amount of hope and with, you know,\n\n02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.760\nan acceptance of the realities of the situation,\n\n02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.280\ntake from that that things can still be better.\n\n02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.240\nYeah, and then literally grow a flower.\n\n02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.640\nThank you all.\n\n02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:33.080\nWait, give it up for Rob, everybody.\n\n02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.560\nJeff, wait.\n\n02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:35.200\nSorry?\n\n02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.720\nLevy just texted me again.\n\n02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:38.200\nSteve Jail is fake.\n\n02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:38.960\nIt's a hoax.\n\n02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:39.960\nSteve Jail.\n\n02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.200\nAh, Steve Jail.\n\n02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:44.000\nCliff Hanger, thank you all for giving up for Rob Evans,\n\n02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.160\neverybody, Rob.\n\n02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.040\nRob Evans.\n\n02:02:48.040 -->

guys.\n\n02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.800\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.640\nYour mayor is Dan Harmon.\n\n02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:58.240\nOne more time for Rob Evans.\n\n02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.480\nThat's a beautiful thing to find uplifting things\n\n02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.000\nin a horrible, horrible world.\n\n02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.960\nYou know what, tonight, drive slow and don't take chances.\n\n02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.400\nZach, you got beat?\n\n02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.560\nHe's playing one.\n\n02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:15.800\nThere we are.\n\n02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:17.560\nGive it up for Zac McKeever up there.\n\n02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.480\nDid you get any of that?\n\n02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.640\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[218580]}
