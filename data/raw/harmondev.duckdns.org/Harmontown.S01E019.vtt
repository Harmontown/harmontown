00:00.000 --> 00:15.400
Here you hear you, Harmontown is now in session. How was everyone out there tonight?

00:15.400 --> 00:24.480
Welcome once again, Harmonians, Harmonites, put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown,

00:24.480 --> 00:40.480
Mr. Dan Harmon. Yo, yo, yo, yo, okay, yo, sugar fried titties in your butt and your mouth,

00:40.480 --> 00:47.160
fuck your mama north, fuck your mama south, salt, pepper, pepper, salt, fuck your mama so hard,

00:47.160 --> 00:52.760
she turned into asphalt, I've turned her ass into a road, lying down the middle, she is a

00:52.760 --> 00:58.360
horny toad, took the big dick, split her down the middle, cat in the spoon in the moon in the

00:58.360 --> 01:04.880
fiddle, fuck your mama like she was a pancake, fuck your mama orgasms weren't faked, flipped her

01:04.880 --> 01:11.600
up in the air and then down, fucked your mama's smile into a frown, gotta dance, I gotta dance

01:11.600 --> 01:24.080
tonight, make your mama feel right, gotta dance tonight, break it down, fuck your mama, I fucked

01:24.080 --> 01:29.600
your mama, this is the whole show tonight you guys, I fucked your mama, I fucked your mama,

01:29.600 --> 01:34.840
80 minutes of freestyle rap about your mama, fucked your mama's smile up into a frown,

01:34.840 --> 01:41.120
fucked your mama's glasses back onto her head, looked like a librarian instead, fucked your mama's

01:41.120 --> 01:46.840
face, fucked her in her nose, fucked your mama, that's how it goes, I'm trying to tell you that

01:46.840 --> 01:52.720
I fucked your mom, don't you understand, I haven't been unclear, fucked your mama, your daddy just

01:52.720 --> 01:57.960
watched, I fucked your mama and your daddy just sat there, fucked your mama and your daddy didn't

01:57.960 --> 02:11.520
do nothing, fucked your mama, your daddy was the victim, maybe we'll start each show with

02:11.520 --> 02:17.440
a freestyle rap from now on, we can say this, nobody could accuse you of beating around the

02:17.440 --> 02:23.280
bush about whether or not you fucked someone's mom or not, I'm not soft on mama's, you were

02:23.280 --> 02:28.960
very candid about fucking someone's mama, if MCing, is that what it's called MCing, is that

02:28.960 --> 02:35.120
when you rap, if MCing was an elected position, my platform would not involve being soft on your

02:35.120 --> 02:40.000
mama, I would be tough on her, which is probably why I'd never get elected, I don't think that

02:40.000 --> 02:46.080
position should be up for focus, 51% of the population is women, they don't want to elect

02:46.080 --> 02:51.240
somebody as an MC that's gonna just fuck everyone's mama, because I didn't hear anything in that

02:51.240 --> 02:55.560
rap, Jeff, I'm scrutinizing myself, I didn't hear anything in that rap about consensual sex,

02:55.560 --> 03:01.520
but none of our gathams were fake, that's true, she did like it, I think you fucked

03:01.520 --> 03:07.120
her glasses into her head, which is a little disturbing, I thought they should have come

03:07.120 --> 03:12.440
to a librarian, she embedded them into her, no, no, no, no, got that's violent, breaking

03:12.440 --> 03:18.040
down, give me a beat, we'll clarify it, your mama liked it, your mom likes it, yeah, here

03:18.040 --> 03:29.720
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, when I fuck your mama, she likes it a lot, I fuck her so hard,

03:29.720 --> 03:35.440
her nose runs with snot, it's kinda gross, but she likes it, it's wild abandoned, it's

03:35.440 --> 03:40.960
like she likes it, you know, like life's surreal, your mama likes it so much, I fuck her for

03:40.960 --> 03:45.560
real, I might marry her, I might give her a ring, I fuck your mama so good the bitch

03:45.560 --> 03:51.240
starts to sing, she goes, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I like to give a fuck, but Dan

03:51.240 --> 04:00.080
Harmon, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, fuck me in the morning, but Dan Harmon, there's a little hook

04:00.080 --> 04:06.120
there, well, thank you, thank you folks, thank you, now we got the ladies on our side, that's

04:06.120 --> 04:10.680
good, so you gotta, you gotta, don't forget the sensitivity, also, too much, too much

04:10.680 --> 04:14.720
misogyny in rap, you gotta, and certainly now, women don't, you know, must get tired

04:14.720 --> 04:19.280
of that stereotype that men are only after young ladies, you know, you're after mamas,

04:19.280 --> 04:24.600
you know, and it's, mamas are still sexy, can I ask you, as an objective observer, because

04:24.600 --> 04:31.680
I go into a kind of fugue state when I rap, when I, I become a, I become just a, a science

04:31.680 --> 04:35.360
dropper, like I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't have consciousness, it's just moving

04:35.360 --> 04:41.480
through me like a channel, why, why, what, what do I do when I'm rapping that results

04:41.480 --> 04:45.680
in me being out of breath, why, why, it seems like I'm just rapping, why am I out of breath?

04:45.680 --> 04:50.600
You can do your little toddler dance, right, but that doesn't seem like exercise, like,

04:50.600 --> 04:55.240
I guess, also, you're, you're, you're doing more exhaling than inhaling probably, if

04:55.240 --> 04:56.240
you're doing it right.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.240
Right, okay, that's what it is.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.800
But you have that respiratory alkalosis thing, so that's good for you, I'd say, you breathe

05:00.800 --> 05:07.000
too much, sorry, I got my new phone and I don't know how to, it's pretty big, look at

05:07.000 --> 05:12.960
this fucking thing, he got, what is this called, the Samsung Gigantor, it's an iPad, some people

05:12.960 --> 05:20.280
call it a phablet, a phablet, part phone, part tablet, nope, nobody calls, no one calls

05:20.280 --> 05:30.000
it that, I defected from Apple, it fits, it fits almost in my pocket, yeah, it's, it's

05:30.000 --> 05:35.680
large, it's large, Aaron keeps suggesting that I got it because I'm so old that I like

05:35.680 --> 05:41.200
that it's like a big phone for old people, and that's kind of true, like, I'm able to

05:41.200 --> 05:49.000
thumb type faster on it, I think it's a crime that I'm not able to, you know, when I was,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.680
I've always, ever since I was like 15 years old, I've always loved having like little

05:53.680 --> 05:57.640
devices and things, even though at 15, what do you, what do you need them for, to schedule

05:57.640 --> 06:02.760
your chronic masturbation, or to like remind yourself to ask for another one next Christmas,

06:02.760 --> 06:06.040
like there was nothing I needed it for, but I just loved them, they're like, like, like

06:06.040 --> 06:09.960
made me feel like, like Penny and Inspector Gadget to have like a little, I should have

06:09.960 --> 06:15.160
just tried Pigtails and save my parents like 10K a year out on these little gadgets, but

06:15.160 --> 06:19.360
I always want, and that was before the internet was a thing, and certainly before the internet

06:19.360 --> 06:23.560
could be a repository for personal information, as I got older, even though I didn't have

06:23.560 --> 06:26.960
any use for these things, they never made me organize, they never, they never helped me

06:26.960 --> 06:31.280
in any way, way before they were phones, I always, I always had this fantasy, like as

06:31.280 --> 06:34.280
they became more sophisticated, I was like, yeah, what I want to do is I want to, I want

06:34.280 --> 06:40.160
to use these things, like seamlessly to record every, every little bit of my life, I want

06:40.160 --> 06:44.960
to like, I want to be like this, this human catalog of useless, like, like this was a

06:44.960 --> 06:48.400
guy and he was here and there was, this is what he had for breakfast at any given day,

06:48.400 --> 06:52.920
I just be able to like go through my life and just pounce on any, any moment, like I wanted

06:52.920 --> 06:58.280
to be the Bridget Jones of doing nothing at all, and I just ended up being the forest

06:58.280 --> 07:03.200
gump of buying little pieces of plastic shit, like I said, because I was just like, every,

07:03.200 --> 07:06.240
every single one that came out, I was there for palm pilots, I was there for things you

07:06.240 --> 07:11.560
guys don't remember, because you're, you're 25, but, but I, I, I, then the iPhone came

07:11.560 --> 07:16.320
out and it was like, okay, this is going to be great, because this is now an accessory,

07:16.320 --> 07:20.360
now everyone's, everyone's, it's a cool to whip it out, it's fine, you don't have to

07:20.360 --> 07:25.520
bring ordinary life to a halt, just to try to catalog your ordinary life, but then the

07:25.520 --> 07:29.680
old Henry twist on that is that all our ordinary lives became so intermingled with these things

07:29.680 --> 07:33.120
that ordinary life changed, you know, we know, I'm not, I'm not a hipster, Luddite snob

07:33.120 --> 07:40.080
about it, I, I upgraded when we became cyborgs, I, I, I, I lost nothing and gained a world

07:40.080 --> 07:45.640
when we, when we became Borg, I prefer it, I don't, I don't miss anything from the old

07:45.640 --> 07:50.760
world, the only thing that I remember from the old world was a couple of people going

07:50.760 --> 07:54.240
like, why is everyone on their phone all the time, like, like that, that's all I remember

07:54.240 --> 07:58.880
about real conversation, I like that breakfasts are documentaries about documenting breakfasts,

07:58.880 --> 08:04.520
like, I, I like, I like, I like, I like that we record everything and, but here's the thing

08:04.520 --> 08:09.520
about the iPhone, like I gave something up in between the, I had a thing called a Palm

08:09.520 --> 08:14.760
Trio and it was like, like, it looked like a lot like what blackberries look like, like,

08:14.760 --> 08:19.400
it had a little thumb keyboard, the little raised keyboard, there was the feedback, there

08:19.400 --> 08:22.960
was the bumps that you could feel and I could really, I could type on that fucker, I would

08:22.960 --> 08:28.160
write like essays at bars, I would like, write outlines, I would get work done, not a lot,

08:28.160 --> 08:31.560
but I would, I would, I would, I would write stuff, I would like, like, do blog entries

08:31.560 --> 08:35.880
and the iPhone is like, that fucking like, you don't, no matter how hard you try, you

08:35.880 --> 08:40.040
can't get good at typing on a, maybe, maybe some of like the girls with like the little

08:40.040 --> 08:43.640
itty-bitty tiny little thumbs, like if your thumbs are like little styluses.

08:43.640 --> 08:47.280
I get teased, people look over my children like, wow, you're, you're faster than my daughter

08:47.280 --> 08:54.400
at that, yeah, well, maybe you have little, little, little sharp thumbs, no, I just got,

08:54.400 --> 08:59.640
I just find that I spend exactly half the time on the iPhone, like correcting everything

08:59.640 --> 09:04.320
and if you turn off the auto correct, then it's just a fucking plate of spaghetti, you

09:04.320 --> 09:08.040
look up and you go, who, what was I even saying, what you do, when you have it on half the

09:08.040 --> 09:12.520
time, you're saying, you know, I didn't want to say nugget, I wanted to say the N word,

09:12.520 --> 09:19.040
you know, talking to my friend, Donald Clover has a really funny joke about that, but whatever,

09:19.040 --> 09:21.840
I can't tell it because it involves saying that.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.920
My phone is not smart enough to learn that I say fuck a lot more than duck, it really

09:26.920 --> 09:29.480
wants me to say duck you a lot, go and duck yourself.

09:29.480 --> 09:34.200
You can train them eventually, but the bottom line is like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying

09:34.200 --> 09:38.560
I'll meet you at the meeting at eight, that's the only thing that you can just type effortlessly

09:38.560 --> 09:42.880
on the iPhone, like stuff that's like, yes, Bill, I'd love to schedule that appointment.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.440
You can't, you can't just go, you know, man, give me some of that, Screab Squab, Flippy

09:47.440 --> 09:52.280
Flap, like you can't colloquialize, you can't, you can't, and that's, that's you buying

09:52.280 --> 09:53.280
hash, right?

09:53.280 --> 10:00.400
I want some Screab Squab, anyways, so I got this giant phone, it looks like a griddle,

10:00.400 --> 10:05.680
it looks like a, to me, it looks like what you get served a nice aperitif on, like a

10:05.680 --> 10:08.400
butler comes up with that and there's a drink on top of it.

10:08.400 --> 10:15.680
It's an iPhone Maxi, so you can't, you can't see it in podcast land, but it, it's, it's

10:15.680 --> 10:21.280
big enough that it looks like it should have a handle on it, like a, like a vanity mirror,

10:21.280 --> 10:25.120
like it looks like, like it's, it's, it's, it's, it's face is the size of us, of a,

10:25.120 --> 10:31.120
yeah, of an industrial spatula, or a big, or a big hairbrush, yeah, but it's got a, so

10:31.120 --> 10:34.880
it's got a big fat keyboard for my big fat thumbs, and I can thumb my little, my little

10:34.880 --> 10:35.880
heart away.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.920
I'm getting a little accuracy, I can tell that over time I'll actually get better, I

10:39.920 --> 10:44.000
don't have auto correct on, I'm just, I'm just thumbing and thumbing, so you can expect

10:44.000 --> 10:49.200
some wonderful things from old, uh, fuck your mama, uh, rapper coming down the blog

10:49.200 --> 10:50.200
pike.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.200
Yo.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.200
Yo.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.200
Yo.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
Yo.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.200
Yo.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.200
Yo.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.200
That's not the farm.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.200
Yo.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
Yo.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.200
Yo.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.200
Wait, hang on.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
Yo.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
What did I do?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.200
Zach, what, what was that one called?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.200
Yeah.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.200
Yo.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
Yo.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.200
Yo.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
Yo.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.200
Yo.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
Yo.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.200
Yo.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.200
Yo.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.200
Yo.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.200
I got a real big phone.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.200
It's the size of a spatula.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.200
Oh, your fucks.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.200
Oh, your fucks.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
Raps starting with spatula.

11:19.200 --> 11:24.200
I got to need more hands than a tarantula if I'm going to handle a phone the size of

11:24.200 --> 11:25.200
a spatula, whatever.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.200
It's not.

11:26.200 --> 11:31.200
I'm, I'm still out of breath from the second rap.

11:31.200 --> 11:37.200
Let's, let's, let's start with a couple of raps and then we'll roll into some social commentary

11:37.200 --> 11:41.200
and then, and then we'll close with a real, real, real big number.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.200
Okay.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.200
And you know what else I should do?

11:43.200 --> 11:46.200
I was thinking because I saw some of that Katy Perry documentary movie.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
That was a documentary, right?

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
That wasn't fiction.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.200
I have no idea what you're talking about.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.200
I need to do wardrobe changes at these shows.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.200
She changed her clothes a lot.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.200
Yeah.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.200
Like Dolly Parton.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.200
It looks, it's, it's, it's a fun thing for the, for the people.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.200
I don't want to keep looking at, you know, it's like I should have like a little, you

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
have a little, like a little oriental.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
A little rack.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
A little screen back here, like Martin Short.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.200
You can come back and you come out as Glick or whatever the hell.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
Yeah.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
I mean, it's a smaller stage.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.200
So I could just get dressed in front of people.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.200
I don't have to, there doesn't have to be magic about it.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
It doesn't have to feel like, how do you do that?

12:18.200 --> 12:20.200
You can go, oh, that's how he does that.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.200
Like.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.200
Wow.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
He buttons the shirt.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
Yeah.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
That's, that's what I do.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.200
And he buttons on another shirt.

12:26.200 --> 12:33.200
Finding out that you're, that I'm like you, it makes you feel more magical.

12:33.200 --> 12:37.200
One plaintive cry of protest.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.200
It was my first guest, ma'am.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
I don't know.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
I don't have an objective of you of myself.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.200
I thought that people loved me because they thought I was magical.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.200
It's just, it's just my first guest.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
Your dance is magical.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.200
Yeah.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.200
It's tiring though.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.200
So we're going to, we're going to go on tour.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.200
I know you guys don't care.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.200
I announced this before and it was like, you get lukewarm applause because you're talking

12:58.200 --> 13:00.200
to the people that you're leaving when you're going on tour.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.200
But, but we are going to go all around the country.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.200
It's, it's official now.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.200
Yeah.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.200
I can, I can really say it.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.200
We're going to, we're going to, we're going to take two weeks in January and we're just

13:09.200 --> 13:12.200
going to go like mad rabid dogs.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
There's no days off.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.200
We're in a different city.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.200
Every night.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.200
Every night.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.200
And so we're not going to enjoy being in those cities.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
No.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.200
We're going to see a hotel, a tour bus, and a microphone.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.200
And that's, and then a bed.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.200
And that's going to be it.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
It's going to be, it's going to be gripping.

13:26.200 --> 13:30.200
And we're going to visit each of the many, many cities within the sound of my voice.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.200
We may be coming through your town.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
We'll, we'll announce an official schedule at some point.

13:34.200 --> 13:40.200
And, and, and so, and we'll try to, my original plan was, oh, and then we'll tweet when we're

13:40.200 --> 13:43.200
on the road and people will go, oh, come to my little, little town.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.200
All I got is a bus stop.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.200
And there's only six people that know who you are, but, but, you know, stop at the bus

13:47.200 --> 13:50.200
stop and do a little rap about fucking their moms and stuff.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.200
And like, like, like, but I don't think we're going to have time for that.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.200
I think it's just going to be like, we got to get from Dallas to, to, to Schmalis,

13:56.200 --> 13:58.200
whatever another city would be.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
I don't know.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
Schmalis.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
I don't even know most of the states.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
They're going to memorize cities.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.200
But we're going to go like just a circle.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.200
We're going to draw a little story circle around America.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.200
So fuck you, Iowa.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.200
Because we're not going to, it's just, you're just going to be there in the, what's in the

14:14.200 --> 14:15.200
middle?

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
Is Iowa in the middle?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.200
Yeah, no.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.200
All right.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.200
I think Kansas, right?

14:19.200 --> 14:23.200
Is that the no lady, the same, the same lady say no the second time?

14:23.200 --> 14:25.200
The lady that tonight?

14:25.200 --> 14:27.200
I got her to say yes to something.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
Who is it?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.200
Raise your hand.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.200
Who's?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.200
Where's the no lady?

14:31.200 --> 14:32.200
Is that Justin's mom?

14:32.200 --> 14:33.200
Who is that?

14:33.200 --> 14:34.200
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.200
Wow.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.200
You're a silhouette.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.200
Dan, Dan, fuck her.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.200
Oh my God.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.200
I know my friend Justin's mom is here and you're a silhouette.

14:42.200 --> 14:48.200
I thought you were my friend's mom, so I almost fucked you.

14:48.200 --> 14:59.200
And if it hurt your feelings, I'll still sleep tonight because you're kind of yelling stuff

14:59.200 --> 15:01.200
out in the middle of the show.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.200
And also you've made your stance very clear on mamas.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.200
Yeah.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.200
I'm hard on them.

15:06.200 --> 15:14.200
I mean, I give them what they want in an unapologetic and unsolicited fashion.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.200
But always consensual, liberal way.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.200
No fake orgasms.

15:20.200 --> 15:25.200
Yeah, and always, always, their body, their choice afterward, whatever.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
It's very thoughtful of them.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.200
It's very, very thoughtful.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.200
That's when pro-choice becomes misogynistic.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
I just realized that.

15:33.200 --> 15:37.200
Yeah, there's a version of pro-chase that it's absolutely horrendously sexist.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.200
Yeah, yeah, your body, your choice.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.200
Says I.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
For breakfast.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.200
All right.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.200
Anyways, enough about politics.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.200
Let's talk about race.

15:51.200 --> 15:56.200
I think I'm the first show to close the book on race, right?

15:56.200 --> 15:59.200
You keep opening it, though.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.200
That book is frequently reopened.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.200
Well, it's a magical book.

16:02.200 --> 16:07.200
It flies in the beginning of Spielberg's Amazing Stories title sequence.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.200
Wow.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.200
Three people.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.200
Remember that show? Does anyone remember Amazing Stories?

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
Yeah.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.200
The same little lady?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.200
Yeah.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.200
I think it's amazing that even Spielberg isn't allowed to.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.200
He can't just roll into TV and go, because I said so.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.200
He's constantly taking another attempt at bat.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.200
Everybody wants to do TV.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.200
TV really doesn't.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.200
I found that TV does not care about your feature credentials.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.200
They just don't care.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.200
You constantly see people who are big movie stars and movie directors and stuff.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.200
They launch shows and TV just goes, yeah.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.200
Fuck.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.200
If no one watches it, fuck you.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.200
It's pretty amazing.

16:44.200 --> 16:49.200
It's kind of comforting to know that Spielberg has to try just as hard as you would to make

16:49.200 --> 16:51.200
a little show about dinosaurs or something.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.200
Let's make a prediction right now.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.200
You've got a CBS show that you're making.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.200
You've got a Fox show you're making.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.200
Let's time capsule this.

16:58.200 --> 17:02.200
Predictions on the success, the livelihood, the duration of these shows.

17:02.200 --> 17:07.200
I would say try to be right.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.200
Let's replay this in like two years, three years, whatever.

17:10.200 --> 17:16.200
Well, I think the Fox one will get a production order for the pilot, and then it won't get

17:16.200 --> 17:17.200
picked up.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.200
It'll be like a pilot people grow up, but that was good.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.200
And they'll be like, yeah, it wasn't that good.

17:23.200 --> 17:28.200
And then the CBS one, I think will, all right, serious prediction.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.200
I'm just going to make it.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.200
I'm not going to jinx myself.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
It's going to get picked up.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
Do you want to wrap it or do you want to just say it?

17:34.200 --> 17:36.200
I'll just say it.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.200
It's going to get, we'll shoot a pilot.

17:38.200 --> 17:44.200
It'll be my first multi-cam pilot, and six and out.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.200
Six episodes canceled.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.200
That's my prediction.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.200
But that's not chicken feet, man.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.200
No.

17:51.200 --> 17:59.200
That's a swimming pool.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.200
It's sad.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.200
It's a little sad.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.200
It's sad for the actors.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.200
Yeah.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.200
Yeah, all those little actors.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.200
Imagine them acting their little hearts out.

18:07.200 --> 18:11.200
I'm going to pilot, but I better make an extra good this morning.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.200
No, no, Toby.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.200
I'm the fucking kiss of death, baby.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.200
I've done so many failed TV shows.

18:16.200 --> 18:20.200
I am absolutely like just a scourge.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
I've never gotten out of season one.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
I've done so much.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.200
I'm going for Clooney's records of most failed pilots.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
Yeah.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.200
By the way, we're taking a break from D&D this week.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.200
And it's not because Spencer was so mopey last week.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.200
He was chomping at Spencer.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.200
Spencer took his own life this morning.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.200
That episode hasn't aired yet.

18:40.200 --> 18:44.200
We had quite an emotional episode that will be, I guess,

18:44.200 --> 18:45.200
will be airing this coming.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.200
It's very sad.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.200
For those of you who are here in the first...

18:48.200 --> 18:54.200
He fired a 22-sided bullet through his brain.

18:54.200 --> 19:00.200
He cast magic bullets through his head.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.200
Spencer, you feeling all right?

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
Let's get Spencer up and get a progress report.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.200
All right, let's check in with Spencer.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.200
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.200
Spencer for hire, the man with the plan.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.200
The flannel shirt even taller than Dan.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.200
He's got a big-ass beard like a Viking warrior.

19:21.200 --> 19:25.200
I fucked your mama because she's even horrier than me.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
I drank my pee.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.200
I ate my poop.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.200
And then I said, for me, I licked my lips.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.200
And I did it again.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.200
I fucked your mama five times.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.200
Then I fucked her 10.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.200
I fucked your mama.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.200
Welcome, Spencer.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.200
Thanks.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.200
I feel welcome.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.200
Spencer, you want to try your hand on some freestyle?

19:45.200 --> 19:47.200
No, no thanks.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.200
Maybe someday.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
Yo.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.200
I don't know.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.200
Sorry, guys.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.200
All right.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.200
God damn it.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.200
Don't break my heart.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.200
What are these days?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.200
What are these days?

20:02.200 --> 20:03.200
What are these days?

20:03.200 --> 20:04.200
One of some days, Sam.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.200
I'll train.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.200
All right.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.200
Maybe I'll just kind of leave that on in the background.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.200
You guys are so...

20:11.200 --> 20:14.200
Talk about whatever you guys are going to talk about.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.200
My name is Spencer.

20:16.200 --> 20:19.200
And I'm here to say, I'm going to rule your dice.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.200
Give your life away.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.200
That was me.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.200
That was me for him to say.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.200
Yeah.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.200
It would be fun to do like a Super Bowl shuffle

20:27.200 --> 20:29.200
and have like Adam Goldberg come out

20:29.200 --> 20:31.200
and each person raps what their name is

20:31.200 --> 20:34.200
and how they're valuable to Harmontown.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.200
Do like a little Harmontown rap.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.200
Spencer, are you feeling better?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.200
Spencer, update.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.200
I was feeling good until like just now.

20:43.200 --> 20:48.200
I was like, I can't rap.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.200
I didn't really fuck your mama.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.200
No, that's fine.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
Oh.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.200
Low on the priorities list.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.200
Well, I mean, I usually do D&D, but that's not happening.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.200
So what's up, you guys?

21:01.200 --> 21:03.200
Do you have other D&D games running?

21:03.200 --> 21:04.200
Not right now.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.200
I usually kind of crash and burn

21:06.200 --> 21:09.200
because my mom doesn't know what's going on.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.200
Not right now, I usually kind of crash and burn

21:13.200 --> 21:16.200
because my player group is totally gossiping on the Internet.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.200
My player group sucks a lot.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.200
So is it Trisha?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.200
Yeah.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.200
No, fuck it.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
She never stops shopping.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.200
She always wants to buy more 50 feet of rope.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.200
Like Trisha, there's a dungeon at the Ziggurat.

21:32.200 --> 21:36.200
She's like, I don't care.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.200
I need more burlap sex.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.200
I didn't know you could go shopping in D&D.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.200
Yeah, I mean, you guys never do it, but I mean, you totally can.

21:45.200 --> 21:51.200
I build cities, but you guys don't use them.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.200
Wait, you don't build cities?

21:52.200 --> 21:54.200
There's always a path in a thing.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.200
You were in a village once or twice.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.200
Yeah.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.200
We haven't been to town in like a city kind of sense, I wouldn't say.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.200
I don't know.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.200
Have we?

22:02.200 --> 22:03.200
Yeah, yeah.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.200
We can really go anywhere and do anything.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.200
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.200
To the eternal plane of fire.

22:09.200 --> 22:13.200
I'm having trouble deciding on something because I told you last week,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.200
and again, this one hasn't podcast yet,

22:15.200 --> 22:18.200
whatever, edit out me talking about that because it gets so confusing.

22:18.200 --> 22:24.200
But I told you last week that I've successfully sold, basically.

22:24.200 --> 22:29.200
I think I can say the word sold, the idea of doing the Dungeons & Dragons games

22:29.200 --> 22:31.200
and then recording the audio,

22:31.200 --> 22:35.200
and then we're going to have animators do stop motion guys acting out the action

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
and then it'll be like a thing, like Web of Sodes.

22:37.200 --> 22:44.200
But my dilemma is, do we stop doing D&D at Harmontown?

22:44.200 --> 22:46.200
We could do a different campaign.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.200
We could keep this campaign going here and do it again.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.200
We'll figure it out, whatever.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.200
It'll be cool, you guys.

22:52.200 --> 22:57.200
How many people here would be fine with us not doing D&D here at Harmontown?

22:57.200 --> 22:59.200
If it was like a separate thing.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.200
What if it was like a separate thing, though?

23:02.200 --> 23:06.200
You don't hear a lot of hisses these days.

23:06.200 --> 23:10.200
1930s.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.200
My self-esteem grew three sizes that day.

23:13.200 --> 23:16.200
Yeah, you are really, you're the thing.

23:16.200 --> 23:20.200
How many people are incredibly upset that we're not playing D&D tonight?

23:20.200 --> 23:22.200
All right, well, I'll see.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.200
It's all of your bluff, didn't I?

23:25.200 --> 23:29.200
It's all fine and well to oppose change,

23:29.200 --> 23:34.200
but when it comes time to pick up a picket sign.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.200
We're trying to find someone to play Lord Busselot's father.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.200
See, that was my big mistake.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.200
This is the exciting thing about the tour.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.200
I feel like we should talk more about it next week

23:46.200 --> 23:51.200
because I contacted a filmmaker that made a very cool documentary.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.200
Maybe we could even have him as a guest next Monday.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.200
Wait, what am I doing? I'm making everyone feel bad for not being here next week.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.200
Well, that sounds like a boring interview, though, doesn't it, filmmaker?

23:59.200 --> 24:02.200
Anyways, this guy did this really cool documentary

24:02.200 --> 24:04.200
and I called him and I said,

24:04.200 --> 24:07.200
look, you're the first person I thought of doing this Harmontown tour.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.200
What if you came with? What if we made this road movie?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.200
He's all excited about it.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.200
We're going to sit down as soon as he gets back from New York.

24:14.200 --> 24:19.200
It's going to be my point being that the fascinating thing is

24:19.200 --> 24:24.200
it's going to be a show about a show about a show about not knowing how to do a show.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.200
Because what I have found out for sure,

24:27.200 --> 24:31.200
we've been doing these things now for over a year

24:31.200 --> 24:34.200
and I know for certain, scientific certainty

24:34.200 --> 24:38.200
that every time I try to plan something, it sucks.

24:38.200 --> 24:44.200
It absolutely sucks and the only fun that we've ever had has been accidental.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.200
It's uncanny.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.200
I don't remember anything that we've ever decided before the show

24:49.200 --> 24:51.200
that yielded any gumdrops.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.200
We've decided vague things like let's play D&D, but that was all...

24:54.200 --> 24:57.200
Let's dress as Jareth, but then I was in the green room

24:57.200 --> 25:00.200
trying to memorize the song.

25:00.200 --> 25:05.200
And then I just come up here and I saw my baby, I don't...

25:05.200 --> 25:07.200
Jump like magic, jump.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.200
Yeah, I didn't...

25:09.200 --> 25:11.200
So anyways...

25:11.200 --> 25:17.200
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.200
Saw your mama yesterday, saw her today.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.200
Fucked her in the straw, fucked her in the hay.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.200
Fucked her in the barn, fucked her in the house,

25:25.200 --> 25:26.200
fucked her with a rat.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.200
Didn't fuck her with a mouse.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.200
That was a mislead, you saw it coming.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.200
Fucked your mama so hard, she started humming.

25:33.200 --> 25:38.200
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.200
We like to fuck you.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.200
Gotta have that part.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.200
So we're...

25:48.200 --> 25:49.200
Spencer.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.200
What's up?

25:50.200 --> 25:52.200
I want you to rap, I want you to rap so bad.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.200
I wish I was good.

25:56.200 --> 26:00.200
You've heard Harmon and he's amazing.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.200
One thing that people...

26:02.200 --> 26:04.200
I saw people tweeting, like,

26:04.200 --> 26:07.200
oh, you're gonna take Spencer along for the tour, right?

26:07.200 --> 26:09.200
But it kind of makes no logical sense,

26:09.200 --> 26:11.200
because each audience would be...

26:11.200 --> 26:13.200
Like, we can't serialize the...

26:13.200 --> 26:16.200
We could bring you along just to have you sit and do this.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.200
You could just hold a metal axe and...

26:18.200 --> 26:20.200
I'm trying to help Harmontown, you know,

26:20.200 --> 26:22.200
if it helps me to be there, it's good.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.200
If it helps me to not be there, it's good, I get it.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.200
If you're coming on tour...

26:25.200 --> 26:26.200
I'm not egotistical.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.200
If you're coming on tour with Spencer, and I would love that,

26:28.200 --> 26:30.200
I would fucking rap it.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.200
I could agree to that.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.200
We'll pay for all your meals and room and board

26:35.200 --> 26:40.200
if you do a little rap at every show.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.200
Yeah, yeah.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.200
All right.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.200
That's what it will be.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.200
There's a plan, we made a plan, so now it's gonna...

26:47.200 --> 26:48.200
I want to get...

26:48.200 --> 26:50.200
I mean, this is really presumptuous,

26:50.200 --> 26:52.200
and it's certainly not going to happen,

26:52.200 --> 26:54.200
but it would be so cool if, like,

26:54.200 --> 26:56.200
as you go from town to town,

26:56.200 --> 26:59.200
we go on this little jog and there's a couple kids following.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.200
By the end of the tour, there's a bunch of people

27:01.200 --> 27:04.200
on the steps jumping around and getting strong now.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.200
People want to just kind of follow us

27:06.200 --> 27:09.200
from a little club to club around the country.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.200
Harmon Heads.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.200
You're talking about Harmon Heads.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.200
They're different from Harmonians.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.200
It's like Trekkers and Trekkies, you know?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.200
Harmon Heads are...

27:18.200 --> 27:20.200
There's the angle of the documentary.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.200
Yeah, that's the angle.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.200
So, how's your brother?

27:25.200 --> 27:29.200
He just got his blood test results back,

27:29.200 --> 27:32.200
and he's uncancorous, so it's all done.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
He's good.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.200
Yeah.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.200
Awesome.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.200
It's crazy, because he had, like, four different types.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.200
Oh, he's gonna be so glad I'm telling everyone this.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.200
He had, like, four types of cancer at once,

27:42.200 --> 27:43.200
which is crazy.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
Oh, really?

27:44.200 --> 27:45.200
I thought just one.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.200
It was like he had three tumors,

27:46.200 --> 27:48.200
but they represented cell types from four different...

27:48.200 --> 27:49.200
It's crazy.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.200
Whenever people get cancer near you,

27:50.200 --> 27:52.200
you become, like, a cancer expert.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
It's like, awesome.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.200
But, yeah, yeah, so he got a lot of different kinds of cancer,

27:56.200 --> 27:58.200
which means he was basically like a walking cancer factory

27:58.200 --> 27:59.200
for a while.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.200
And, I mean, he's...

28:00.200 --> 28:01.200
It's done.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.200
He doesn't need chemo or anything.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.200
He's minus a ball, you know?

28:04.200 --> 28:06.200
He's living life and laughing easy.

28:06.200 --> 28:11.200
Minus a ball?

28:11.200 --> 28:15.200
You walked over that one like it was nothing.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.200
It's a light cost, considering.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.200
Yeah, that's true.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.200
It's pretty common.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.200
It's the most common type, right, for men.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.200
Or am I getting that statistic wrong?

28:23.200 --> 28:24.200
It's just...

28:24.200 --> 28:29.200
It's the most for women.

28:29.200 --> 28:33.200
Did the doctors, like, say anything about...

28:33.200 --> 28:34.200
Did they tell him, like...

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
First of all, is he going to mind us talking about...

28:36.200 --> 28:39.200
that he had testicular cancer and had a ball removed?

28:39.200 --> 28:40.200
I don't care.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.200
Okay.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.200
You're like me with my brother.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.200
Yeah, yeah.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.200
Let's exploit him.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.200
Except you like your brother.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.200
You want to hang out with him.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.200
Yeah, no, he's cool, but I think he'd be fine with this.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.200
I mean, he'd be like, they're talking about me.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.200
So did the doctors tell him when he got his...

28:53.200 --> 28:55.200
when they were telling him, like, this is what we're going to do?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.200
What's it called, the testectomy?

28:57.200 --> 28:59.200
What do they call that when you remove it?

28:59.200 --> 29:01.200
I don't know what they call it.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.200
I wasn't there, sorry.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.200
They can't call it neutering.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.200
That's not good.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.200
Well, that would be both of them, yeah.

29:10.200 --> 29:14.200
Did they tell him, like, is there an effect on your psychology?

29:14.200 --> 29:18.200
Do you become half a douche?

29:18.200 --> 29:22.200
Do you have more female friends because you're a better person?

29:22.200 --> 29:24.200
You lose your balance a lot.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.200
Really?

29:25.200 --> 29:28.200
No, no.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.200
You crave pickles.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.200
One of your vocal hordes tightens that gets higher voiced.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.200
I don't know.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.200
Yeah, no, I mean, you don't really need them.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.200
Like, you could cut them off, you'd be fine.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.200
Like, they're just...

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
They're external.

29:41.200 --> 29:47.200
They're like, it's not like going into a body and like pulling out the appendix and then reattaching stuff so it doesn't bleed to death.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.200
It's like, snip, and then, you know...

29:49.200 --> 29:51.200
But isn't that where all...

29:51.200 --> 29:53.200
That's where all the testosterone is made.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.200
I mean, if you take the whole thing off, then you would...

29:55.200 --> 29:59.200
Then you're a eunuch, don't you become like docile, like a cat?

29:59.200 --> 30:02.200
I know nothing of testosterone production.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.200
What's that?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.200
I know nothing of testosterone production.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.200
But I mean, you can...

30:06.200 --> 30:07.200
Yeah, why would you have to?

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
You don't need both of them.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.200
Like, I mean, you can make semen and sperm and stuff with just the one.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.200
You can.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.200
He's been sure...

30:15.200 --> 30:18.200
He's been sure he's always been shooting the left nut.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.200
So, like, he's fine anyway.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.200
Okay, all right.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.200
That's my fault.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.200
I shown the spotlight on that.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.200
I'm reaping the whirlwind right now.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
You wanted to talk about it.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.200
I mean, it's certainly something that needs to be repped about.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
Yo.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.200
Yo.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.200
Yo.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.200
Yo.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.200
Yo.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.200
Do you want me to...

30:44.200 --> 30:45.200
What?

30:45.200 --> 30:46.200
Yo.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
Yo.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.200
My brother, Chris, has one ball.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
Take a step back.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.200
You might just fall.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.200
It...

30:51.200 --> 30:52.200
That's all.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.200
I'm getting there.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.200
All right.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.200
All right.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.200
All right.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.200
I mean, it's like...

31:02.200 --> 31:03.200
That counts.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.200
I'm going to put it in.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.200
I'll be there, you know, in the future.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.200
All right.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.200
That was a lot of Spencer.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.200
Spencer, everyone.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.200
I'll also have a hand for Spencer for coming up.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
Sorry, we didn't play D&D.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.200
We'll give him a rest.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.200
Well, by the way, that's not why...

31:15.200 --> 31:20.200
I wanted to clarify that Spencer was lethargic last week, but that's not why there's no D&D

31:20.200 --> 31:21.200
this week.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.200
He's not on time out.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.200
It's actually because...

31:25.200 --> 31:29.700
Well, this is an example of how my plans always fall apart.

31:29.700 --> 31:34.800
You can see, if you listen to the episode a couple weeks ago, you can hear me crossing

31:34.800 --> 31:38.200
that threshold toward the end of the show where I'm just too sloppy drunk.

31:38.200 --> 31:43.200
And I kind of like... I decide because we're going to visit my father in the D&D adventure.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.200
I'm like, it pops in my head.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.200
I go, I'm just going to lay all my cards on the table now.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
I go, oh, Eric Eidel.

31:48.200 --> 31:53.200
Let's get Eric Eidel to come to Harmontown because Jeff's hanging out with him and he's

31:53.200 --> 31:56.200
Adam Goldberg's buddy.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
Adam has his card.

31:58.200 --> 32:03.200
Yeah, Adam got his card.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.200
Eric Eidel.

32:06.200 --> 32:11.200
Former Python, Gatabout, Foodie.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.200
What does he need a card for?

32:14.200 --> 32:18.200
Anyways, I was thinking, let's get him in here.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.200
Even though these guys are only 25, a nerd is a nerd.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.200
It's like having Led Zeppelin in here.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.200
He, over a bottle of wine, he's like, oh, I'd love to come down.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.200
We'll sing some songs.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.200
Yeah.

32:28.200 --> 32:31.200
He's always threatening to come in with his guitar.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.200
But I wanted to do that.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.200
Sing like fucking classic.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.200
They wrote new, if there's any Python fans out there, they wrote new lyrics, updated

32:37.200 --> 32:40.200
lyrics to the Galaxy Song, the universe song.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.200
With Brian Cox, the guy who does the wonders of the universe, that kind of cool rock and

32:44.200 --> 32:46.200
roll physicist guy.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.200
They've written the new Galaxy Song.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.200
It's awesome.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.200
Yeah.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.200
So anyways, that popped in my head.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
So there I am.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.200
You can hear me if you rewind to that episode.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.200
You can hear me mentally pining.

32:56.200 --> 33:00.200
As I stopped the D&D game, I'm in a drunken stupor.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.200
I'm saying to Jeff, like, yeah, let's do that.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.200
We should have a guest cameo.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.200
And he's like, yeah, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

33:06.200 --> 33:07.200
Yeah.

33:07.200 --> 33:11.200
So then the following week, you can hear a stalling because Eric couldn't do it.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.200
And then I think another way.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.200
And it's like this way.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.200
He probably won't do it.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.200
How about that?

33:15.200 --> 33:16.200
Yeah, exactly.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.200
He might, but he might.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
And also don't plan shit like Harmon.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.200
Don't do it.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.200
It's stupid.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.200
It's so dumb to try to.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.200
It's like you try to grab a butterfly.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.200
First, one of two things is going to happen.

33:27.200 --> 33:32.200
You do great and you just crush it to death or you blow it out of the way.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.200
You know, when it goes away, like it's a fucking butterfly.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.200
Just let it be, you know, just hang on.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.200
Thank you, ladies.

33:37.200 --> 33:43.200
I fucked your mama.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.200
So then this week, it was one more time.

33:46.200 --> 33:49.200
I was like, oh, I think because Eric, Eric goes like maybe, maybe not.

33:49.200 --> 33:54.200
And then, and then so we're like, we had a guy on standby that was going to come in.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.200
Our friend Joe Unger hangs out at the drying room.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.200
Because when you get to be my age, there's very few men who can play your father left

34:00.200 --> 34:01.200
in Los Angeles.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.200
We're working as performers.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.200
So what the other guy we could think of was Joe Unger.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.200
Yeah, he'll be good.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.200
At the drying room.

34:07.200 --> 34:12.200
And I think that might happen because I think he'd be a delight to have as a little character.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.200
You will adore Joe Unger.

34:14.200 --> 34:18.200
But at any rate, so he, then everything was like getting confused with schedule stuff.

34:18.200 --> 34:20.200
He had a rap party he wanted to go to and blah, blah, blah.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.200
So I called Spencer and I said, let's just forget it.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.200
But the light, the silver lining is.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.200
Is that Spencer got up and wrapped?

34:27.200 --> 34:33.200
Is that, is that Spencer and I up till now have been communicating through Twitter direct messages.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.200
And today two things happened.

34:35.200 --> 34:38.200
One, we fucked around with him all that, all that, all that much.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.200
And also I accidentally.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.200
You fucked his mom.

34:40.200 --> 34:43.200
I accidentally public tweeted a DM to my DM.

34:43.200 --> 34:48.200
And so enough was enough.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.200
And I just gave him my phone number.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.200
Spencer and I have upgraded our relationship.

34:52.200 --> 34:59.200
We are.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.200
You're in my phone now.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.200
We're the best of buds.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
I fucked your mama in the dirt and the mud.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.200
I fucked your salt.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.200
I fucked your pepper.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.200
I fucked your mama like a pig and a heifer.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.200
Fucked her on the farm.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.200
Fucked her in the city.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.200
Rolled her in the dough.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.200
Squeezed all her titties.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.200
I drank her milk.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.200
Fucked your mama soft to silk.

35:21.200 --> 35:27.200
Okay, that one went back into misogyny.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.200
Yeah, I don't like the rolling in the dough thing.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.200
Well, she called her a heifer.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.200
You kind of made her a farm animal.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.200
You squeeze all of her titties and make her seem like, you know.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.200
Okay, I know how to make it.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.200
I know how to make it right.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.200
I know how to make it right.

35:42.200 --> 35:46.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.200
I fucked your daddy.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.200
I sucked his dick.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.200
I cradled his balls till they made me sick.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.200
Oh, shit.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.200
Oh, so the song was over, sorry.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.200
God damn it.

35:59.200 --> 36:04.200
Ladies and gentlemen, there are seven people who fucked your daddy in the world.

36:04.200 --> 36:08.200
You are about to witness the eighth.

36:08.200 --> 36:13.200
Yo, yo, who wants their daddy fucked tonight?

36:13.200 --> 36:15.200
Yeah, I fucked your daddy.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.200
I nuzzled his nuts.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.200
I fucked his dick.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.200
I fucked his butt.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.200
I had him over to my house for dinner.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.200
I fucked your daddy.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.200
I'm a daddy fucking winner.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.200
I fucked your daddy on the roof of my house.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.200
I fucked your daddy.

36:28.200 --> 36:32.200
I wish I was his spouse, but it's not legal in most of the states.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.200
I fucked your daddy on his fine china plates.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.200
I fucked your daddy.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.200
I fucked him bad.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.200
I fucked your daddy while your mom was out.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.200
She had a great afternoon.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.200
Totally rusted.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.200
She came home and watched Homeland.

36:48.200 --> 36:53.200
I fucked your daddy.

36:53.200 --> 36:57.200
There you go, ladies.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.200
It's about time.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.200
Obama won, you know?

37:03.200 --> 37:06.200
And as rude as the treatment might have been for that daddy,

37:06.200 --> 37:14.200
you at least were sensitive enough to nuzzle his nuts.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.200
Spencer, we're sorry about your brother.

37:17.200 --> 37:22.200
But sometimes you need two nuts to get nuzzled.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.200
Nuzzle his meditation balls.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.200
It's nice, not alliteration.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
Consonance?

37:29.200 --> 37:30.200
Nuzzle his nuts?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.200
It's good.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.200
Nuzzle his alliteration?

37:32.200 --> 37:33.200
Yeah, I don't know.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.200
Tintinabulation.

37:34.200 --> 37:39.200
All right, Vincent Price is here.

37:39.200 --> 37:43.200
Yes, thank you for saying my favorite word.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.200
The tintinabulation.

37:45.200 --> 37:50.200
Wait, the woman that has booed you and...

37:50.200 --> 37:54.200
This is a very tempestuous relationship.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.200
Yeah, it seems like a free radical back there.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.200
Remember when we were in some car or something,

37:59.200 --> 38:02.200
we were talking about what if Vincent Price did more bridges

38:02.200 --> 38:04.200
and more songs?

38:04.200 --> 38:08.200
Instead of just thriller, we were doing Vincent Price

38:08.200 --> 38:12.200
doing his talking bridges for other songs.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.200
It was like...

38:14.200 --> 38:15.200
How's that going to work?

38:15.200 --> 38:17.200
You can go out of a Fuck Your Daddy rap

38:17.200 --> 38:19.200
and then have Vincent Price.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.200
We're starting from the top, though.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.200
All right, so this is Fuck Your Daddy rap

38:24.200 --> 38:26.200
with Vincent Price doing a breakdown.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.200
Doing a breakdown.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.200
We're planning now, so it's going to fall apart.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.200
No, it's going to be good.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.200
It's going to be a goodie.

38:33.200 --> 38:37.200
MC Daddy Fucker!

38:37.200 --> 38:40.200
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.200
See a lot of people in the house

38:42.200 --> 38:45.200
descended from paternal lineage.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.200
Well, I got news for you.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.200
Here's what I'm going to do.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.200
I fucked your daddy in the house of the sky.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.200
I fucked your daddy like Apple Pie.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.200
It's the American way.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
Obama's new land.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.200
I fucked your daddy in the palm of a hand

39:00.200 --> 39:03.200
at a giant, in a giant world.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.200
I fucked your daddy like he was a girl, lovingly.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.200
I caressed his ass.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.200
I fucked your daddy at the head of the class.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.200
Howard Hessman was watching the thing.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.200
I fucked your daddy till he started to sing.

39:16.200 --> 39:21.200
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

39:21.200 --> 39:26.200
Darkness descends on your father's asshole.

39:26.200 --> 39:31.200
A million penises go inside of it.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.200
A hurricane of semen.

39:34.200 --> 39:39.200
A swirling in his brown rectum.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.200
He will not love again.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.200
I fucked your daddy on the roof of the house of the sky.

39:44.200 --> 39:47.200
I fucked your daddy and he didn't know why.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.200
I fucked your daddy in both of his eyes.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.200
I fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.200
I fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.

39:55.200 --> 39:58.200
I fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.200
I fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.

40:00.200 --> 40:05.200
I fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.200
Is there a tissue back there?

40:09.200 --> 40:11.200
I'm crying.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.200
I was in the fetal position on the stage at one point.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.200
I feel like Vincent Price can do better than that.

40:18.200 --> 40:23.200
For future efforts, he is just sort of graphic and brown sperm.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.120
You're supposed to wax poetic.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.200
The whole point is that the guy from the street

40:27.200 --> 40:28.760
lays it on the line and then you come in

40:28.760 --> 40:31.920
and give it an air of erudite, like.

40:31.920 --> 40:32.760
Yeah.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.040
I think Vincent could have maybe dealt a little bit more

40:35.040 --> 40:37.360
with the fact that you fucked someone's daddy

40:37.360 --> 40:39.080
and the palm of a giant's hand.

40:39.080 --> 40:44.200
That's getting late.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.200
Yeah.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.000
That's how you know you've fucked someone

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
and has had sex with me.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Someone has had a giant.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.600
I don't know you've been fucked.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.600
Yeah.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.100
All right.

40:55.100 --> 40:56.920
That was fucking good.

40:56.920 --> 40:57.920
Yeah.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.600
We should press some vinyl, man.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.680
Enough is enough.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
Yeah.

41:02.680 --> 41:03.180
No.

41:03.180 --> 41:05.160
We're going to go find some vinyl.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.040
You could have a record.

41:06.040 --> 41:06.540
Yeah.

41:06.540 --> 41:07.280
You could have a record.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.320
We're going to do it.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.720
iTunes, direct.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.600
Just fucking fucked your mama on the A side,

41:13.600 --> 41:14.880
fucked your daddy on the B side.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.040
Like it's like a theme album.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.200
It's like each track has a sibling track.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.000
And then there's all these liner notes

41:22.000 --> 41:25.880
about street culture.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.600
I'll hire somebody to write that.

41:30.600 --> 41:34.960
Speaking of subcontracting, you aren't here in the green room

41:34.960 --> 41:35.760
today.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.400
It's a little bit of an awkward experience,

41:37.400 --> 41:39.560
speaking of relationships being upgraded.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.040
Spencer's is my choice, of course, as I decided.

41:42.040 --> 41:45.600
Then there's Adam Goldberg, who upgrades our relationship

41:45.600 --> 41:48.160
at his discretion.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.040
He took a new step today.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.720
He was outside the green room, and I came to the green room.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.560
I walked in, and I left the green room door open,

41:57.560 --> 41:59.800
because I didn't want to close it on his face.

41:59.800 --> 42:00.920
I was just going to the fridge.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.880
And he walked in, and he started pitching me

42:02.880 --> 42:06.160
a little segment that he wants to do.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.040
And he was in the green room.

42:08.040 --> 42:09.760
But he did after a while.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.680
He called McGathey's game quarter?

42:12.680 --> 42:17.080
He said, yeah, Adam Goldberg has a segment that he wants to do.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.320
I think that he has provided for Harmontown as much

42:19.320 --> 42:21.520
as he's taken away, perhaps.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.080
Oh, certainly.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.440
He's provided more, certainly.

42:23.440 --> 42:29.000
I think the benefit is I'll wait the cost of having him around.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.280
And he did eventually, after he said his piece,

42:33.280 --> 42:37.920
my silence as I poured my vodka, he waited just before I

42:37.920 --> 42:39.920
had to say it, and he kind of excused himself

42:39.920 --> 42:40.920
and left the green room.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.640
So that's good.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.040
We should reward that behavior.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.240
Oh.

42:46.240 --> 42:48.360
That didn't go the direction I thought it was going to go.

42:48.360 --> 42:52.920
No, no, he's not on the bottom of my car right now.

42:52.920 --> 42:58.440
He's still keeping himself within certain boundaries,

42:58.440 --> 43:01.360
I think, and providing us with a lot of pleasure

43:01.360 --> 43:02.360
and fascination.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.480
And also, we just don't know if you

43:04.480 --> 43:06.360
don't give him what he wants.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.240
And then there's an incident that involves,

43:08.240 --> 43:11.560
I don't know, a tower and a rifle.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.120
Who do we have to blame but ourselves?

43:14.120 --> 43:15.960
Who can say that we didn't see it coming?

43:15.960 --> 43:19.400
Who can say that we don't have 16 episodes of recording sessions?

43:19.400 --> 43:23.560
He's over there stroking his little proto beard.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.880
All right, let's bring Adam Goldberg up for the Adam Goldberg

43:25.880 --> 43:28.240
segment.

43:28.240 --> 43:31.480
That's all we'll call it.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.720
Yo, yo, yo.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.200
Adam Goldberg here with a dick situation.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.800
My parents have been fucked and due to strangulation.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.400
They weren't able to speak, but you know,

43:40.400 --> 43:44.040
they'd have said, Dan Harmon, you're better red than this.

43:44.040 --> 43:46.400
Sometimes the librarian needs to squeeze,

43:46.400 --> 43:49.360
and that's true in here with an internal rhyme freeze.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.360
Hey, this isn't the segment.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.800
I'm just being coy.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.400
Dan needs to get parents fucked on your boy.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.400
Yeah, that's the price.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.160
Oh, that's the price.

43:56.160 --> 43:56.660
Oh.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.840
Another situation from the nerdy boy.

44:01.840 --> 44:05.160
He had a lot of words, and he said, oh, and Dan

44:05.160 --> 44:07.040
went to parents, and that was said.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.800
And parents went with Dan, and all three went to bed.

44:09.800 --> 44:12.360
Oh, creepy.

44:12.360 --> 44:15.800
Developmental disorder.

44:15.800 --> 44:20.240
Descended on your stage in a real form.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.240
The inability to recognize social cues.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.920
Flocking like a hurricane of brown semen.

44:28.920 --> 44:29.440
I'm sorry.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.160
I'm sorry.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.360
Vincent, Vincent, stop it.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.280
All right.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.520
Sorry about Vincent Price.

44:35.520 --> 44:38.000
A hurricane can flock?

44:38.000 --> 44:41.680
Listen, Vincent Price has been dead a long time.

44:41.680 --> 44:47.400
It's not helping his mad science dropping.

44:47.400 --> 44:50.840
All right, solid, solid, solid, solid, solid.

44:50.840 --> 44:54.040
Back to the parent fucking well on this one.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.360
That went parent fucking well when we went back.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.840
Were you sitting there kind of writing a little bit

44:58.840 --> 44:59.320
in your head?

44:59.320 --> 45:00.840
You were writing a little rap in your head.

45:00.840 --> 45:01.440
No, I wasn't.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.400
I was trying to update this, which is,

45:03.400 --> 45:05.440
anyone here like Prairie Home Companion?

45:05.440 --> 45:05.920
No?

45:05.920 --> 45:08.560
Yes, I didn't give you enough time to respond there.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.240
Bad social cue on that one.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.840
Yeah, I think the answer was no.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.040
Good, because I'm going to tear it a new asshole.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.000
Oh, shit.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.840
Garrison Keeler, you hear it?

45:18.840 --> 45:19.800
Can you listen to this?

45:19.800 --> 45:23.560
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

45:23.560 --> 45:24.520
Lake Wobagon?

45:24.520 --> 45:27.040
Oh, sorry.

45:27.040 --> 45:27.640
Sorry.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.320
Sorry.

45:29.320 --> 45:31.280
Wow.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.720
I feel like you making fun of me, Jeff,

45:33.720 --> 45:34.840
is the best part of your week.

45:34.840 --> 45:35.880
I haven't said anything.

45:35.880 --> 45:36.920
I haven't said anything.

45:36.920 --> 45:37.400
I know.

45:37.400 --> 45:38.240
You're savoring it.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.920
You're waiting because you make fun of me.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.800
I'm like a Puma on a limb right now.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.120
We're ready to pounce.

45:45.120 --> 45:45.840
Perfect.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.440
Perfect.

45:47.440 --> 45:51.040
It's been a quiet week in Lake Harmontown, California,

45:51.040 --> 45:51.680
my hometown.

45:51.680 --> 45:52.760
Wait, so you're not pitching the bid.

45:52.760 --> 45:53.480
You're actually going to do the bid.

45:53.480 --> 45:54.240
No one can do the bid.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.800
Oh, yeah, no, he pitched in the green room.

45:55.800 --> 45:58.120
I pitched the bid, and they were very interested in me.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.720
I was so distracted by the social nervousness of like,

46:00.720 --> 46:02.160
Adam Goldberg's in the green room,

46:02.160 --> 46:03.800
and he's just pitching me something.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.840
I didn't really hear the pitch, so I just like,

46:05.840 --> 46:06.560
we'll bring you up.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.760
It's more of a warning.

46:07.760 --> 46:12.360
You know, I've been scouting out towers, you know?

46:12.360 --> 46:13.040
Oh, Jesus.

46:17.240 --> 46:20.360
Been smoking a lot of squeebs guava and just, you know?

46:20.360 --> 46:23.080
All right, what's the segment?

46:23.080 --> 46:26.480
It's a news from Lake Harmontown.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.520
Right.

46:27.520 --> 46:31.080
What's the elevator pitch?

46:31.080 --> 46:34.520
I don't think Erickson Keeler can sue me over a podcast.

46:34.520 --> 46:36.200
He's the elevator pitch.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.000
OK.

46:37.000 --> 46:37.600
All right.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.080
I have no idea what that means.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.680
I'll take 10 episodes.

46:41.680 --> 46:42.400
I can do six.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.040
All right, no, fuck it, for better or for worse.

46:44.040 --> 46:44.520
Here we go.

46:44.520 --> 46:45.800
Do you want some play in music?

46:45.800 --> 46:48.080
Like, do you have anything folksy?

46:48.080 --> 46:51.800
Just folksy?

46:51.800 --> 46:53.040
Yeah, I got something.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.840
You want like, down home-y kind of folksy?

46:54.840 --> 46:56.280
Sure, that would be spectacular.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.640
Let's see what we got here.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.960
I applaud your restraint, because the easy laugh

47:06.960 --> 47:09.760
would have been to just hit the hip hop, too.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.240
You are a craftsman.

47:12.240 --> 47:15.360
You're like a Chinese acrobat.

47:15.360 --> 47:16.760
Bad at math?

47:16.760 --> 47:17.760
What's that?

47:17.760 --> 47:18.760
What?

47:18.760 --> 47:21.640
That's why the Chinese acrobatics team

47:21.640 --> 47:22.880
is notoriously bad at math.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.320
That's why they had to acrobatics.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.440
This might not be apropos.

47:26.440 --> 47:28.480
It might not be fitting.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.760
I'm going to go Tiki on this one.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.880
So here you are.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.200
No, no, no, no, no.

47:33.200 --> 47:34.000
Thank you.

47:36.440 --> 47:39.000
It's been a quiet week in Lake Harmontown, California,

47:39.000 --> 47:40.240
my hometown.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.760
Autumn has come to Lake Harmontown,

47:41.760 --> 47:44.960
dropping the thermostat to a frosty 62 degrees.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.040
You sometimes have to wear a sweater if you go out at night,

47:47.040 --> 47:49.680
which is bothersome for the more athletic among us.

47:49.680 --> 47:51.880
Jeff Davis, Comptroller Jeff Davis,

47:51.880 --> 47:54.320
is even considering turning on the heated as apartment,

47:54.320 --> 47:58.280
but instead had them send over another batch of girls.

47:58.280 --> 48:02.600
Jeff Davis, a fabulous good sport, recently won the world

48:02.600 --> 48:04.920
record for saying, I don't normally say this to girls,

48:04.920 --> 48:07.720
but you know, he may not have to touch that thermostat

48:07.720 --> 48:08.320
until spring.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.080
This week is Thanksgiving, an important time for Lake Harmon.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.080
Is this fan fiction?

48:14.080 --> 48:18.080
Like, uh, it should have been like a slashing.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.360
Monday night is erotic fan fiction.

48:19.360 --> 48:22.440
Is this Harmon's famous slash?

48:22.440 --> 48:23.240
It's going that way.

48:23.240 --> 48:24.920
Yeah.

48:24.920 --> 48:29.640
But it's actually Dan slash Jeff's dad slash.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.400
Oh, right, of course, yeah, Dan's been fucking

48:32.400 --> 48:33.800
my dad and my mom for years.

48:33.800 --> 48:34.360
Oh, yeah.

48:34.360 --> 48:36.120
All right, sorry, continue.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.120
This week is Thanksgiving, an important week

48:38.120 --> 48:39.720
for Lake Harmonians, all of them who

48:39.720 --> 48:42.400
can't afford plane tickets home or putting their $10

48:42.400 --> 48:45.120
on the barrel, frantically Facebooking before the show,

48:45.120 --> 48:47.560
trying to find out which dinner party to attend.

48:47.560 --> 48:49.400
Fedora was talking to Cheruse earlier,

48:49.400 --> 48:51.200
wondering if it's worth driving to Santa Monica

48:51.200 --> 48:53.960
to avoid having to make her own cranberry sauce.

48:53.960 --> 48:58.480
He says it is if she can avoid the taking the 405.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.120
It's a time of change for Harmonians.

49:00.120 --> 49:03.600
They're wondering if they're going to colonize the moon this year.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.560
And if Jeff Blue will do the flight refunds,

49:06.560 --> 49:08.000
everyone's planning a Christmas.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.280
I don't have the same garrulous, joyful voice that he does.

49:11.280 --> 49:12.880
But I think this is going pretty well.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.000
You're doing wonderfully.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.960
Well, this much material at his pace would be like, you know.

49:18.960 --> 49:20.000
He goes 50 minutes.

49:20.000 --> 49:25.400
I'm going to get this under 150, minus self-comments.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.440
They're wondering if they're going to colonize the moon

49:27.440 --> 49:27.960
this year.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.840
And if Jeff Blue will do flight refunds,

49:29.840 --> 49:31.360
if that's the case.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.000
Everyone's planning a Christmas return to their colder states,

49:34.000 --> 49:37.160
unless it becomes really crazy in post for Wolverine.

49:37.160 --> 49:38.960
People are really putting their hopes up

49:38.960 --> 49:40.280
after X-Men First Class.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.000
They're saying it did a lot right that movie.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.360
It did a lot right.

49:44.360 --> 49:47.400
It's time for winter coffee here in Harmontown.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.720
All the new flavors of coffee are in the one with mint,

49:49.720 --> 49:53.200
winter mint, peppermint, coffee cans, and coffee meetings,

49:53.200 --> 49:56.200
which aren't officially business or dating or anything

49:56.200 --> 49:56.700
really.

49:56.700 --> 49:59.400
It can be quite fun until one person or another says

49:59.400 --> 50:01.240
the word so.

50:01.240 --> 50:05.320
Or, I know why we're both here, or offers to buy lunch.

50:05.320 --> 50:07.480
Then there's that one-on-one aspect to them.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.080
If there's three people, you can check

50:09.080 --> 50:11.360
to see if you've got any Facebook friend invites.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.400
But with two, that's a sign of rudeness.

50:13.400 --> 50:17.760
Coffee is a tricky thing in Harmontown, at least to drink.

50:17.760 --> 50:18.320
Page two.

50:18.320 --> 50:22.440
In the second page.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.920
One Armenian face was putting $20

50:24.920 --> 50:27.960
into a broke friend's gas tank in Glendale, as one does.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.480
And got a call to meet in Studio City.

50:30.480 --> 50:32.080
Got right back in his car and drove

50:32.080 --> 50:34.040
to meet someone for what wasn't a business meeting,

50:34.040 --> 50:36.480
but rather a guilt trip on taking too long to get

50:36.480 --> 50:39.120
from Glendale to Studio City.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.120
And it started to rain.

50:40.120 --> 50:43.120
Dan, what do you want to do later on after the show?

50:43.120 --> 50:45.520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, go ahead.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.840
And it started to rain when he was driving, the first time

50:47.840 --> 50:50.040
at Rainton Lodge in Angeles this autumn.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.640
When he got there, Jace was hurrying for taking so long,

50:52.640 --> 50:55.760
as it's assumed that Glendale and Studio City are adjacent.

50:55.760 --> 50:59.120
And rain doesn't slow down LA traffic uncontrollably.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.320
Or that he can be available in zero minutes time

51:01.320 --> 51:03.480
for not even a business meeting, just an offer

51:03.480 --> 51:05.400
to potentially maybe help a pitch for a pilot

51:05.400 --> 51:07.000
he was jerked around during.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.600
This meeting went predictably terribly,

51:08.600 --> 51:11.480
the way we're all hoping the new Wolverine doesn't.

51:11.480 --> 51:14.200
There's a whole lot in line for the franchise.

51:14.200 --> 51:16.320
And it rained a lot on Lake Harmontown in general.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.000
People stood in torrential line Sunday

51:18.000 --> 51:19.960
for buying Squeebsquab.

51:19.960 --> 51:22.520
Wet, but definitely worth it, but definitely wet.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.760
And Jace was tempted to think about the squeaky windshield

51:24.760 --> 51:27.040
wiper on his car, the goldsmobile.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.200
But he's waiting on some money.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.280
You know, if it gets down to 50 degrees,

51:30.280 --> 51:32.600
he may need to buy a winter jacket.

51:32.600 --> 51:35.240
That's the news from Lake Harmontown, California,

51:35.240 --> 51:37.320
my hometown, where the men are handsome,

51:37.320 --> 51:40.200
and the women are mostly Aaron.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.320
All right.

51:41.320 --> 51:42.160
Adam Goldberg.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.240
All right.

51:47.240 --> 51:49.240
Yeah.

51:49.240 --> 51:51.240
Oh.

51:51.240 --> 51:55.960
He's ripping up his segment.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.000
We got some humanity out of him.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.360
Back to the tower.

52:03.440 --> 52:07.160
This guy strategically up and gone.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.440
I wasn't going to say anything when you left at the beginning.

52:09.440 --> 52:10.960
Did you get a grilled cheese?

52:10.960 --> 52:12.600
Oh, yeah.

52:12.600 --> 52:14.200
I hate Adam Goldberg.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.000
You broke my heart.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.040
I was like, where's he going?

52:16.040 --> 52:17.280
He paid the meter in times.

52:17.280 --> 52:22.040
All right, Adam Goldberg, ladies and gentlemen.

52:22.040 --> 52:23.040
Woo!

52:27.040 --> 52:29.040
Love him or hate him?

52:32.040 --> 52:33.040
Or in my case?

52:33.040 --> 52:34.040
Do both.

52:36.040 --> 52:37.040
I don't hate you.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.040
I don't love you.

52:38.040 --> 52:41.040
A human coin landing on its edge every week.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.040
I just don't know.

52:43.040 --> 52:45.040
Is he the villain or am I the villain?

52:45.040 --> 52:46.040
What is it?

52:46.040 --> 52:53.040
It's like a mirror in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.040
In a seat cucumber.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.040
Yeah.

52:56.040 --> 53:01.040
Wait, did the no lady, did you, was that commentary from the no lady?

53:01.040 --> 53:02.040
That's all right.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.040
No lady.

53:03.040 --> 53:05.040
Do you want to come up here and, OK.

53:07.040 --> 53:08.040
No, she says.

53:08.040 --> 53:09.040
It makes sense.

53:09.040 --> 53:10.040
Yeah, yeah.

53:10.040 --> 53:11.040
Why would she?

53:11.040 --> 53:12.040
Why would she be called no lady?

53:12.040 --> 53:13.040
Yeah.

53:13.040 --> 53:16.040
Don't ask her yes or no questions.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.040
How would you feel about coming up on stage right now?

53:20.040 --> 53:21.040
Oh, no lady.

53:21.040 --> 53:24.040
You could do, you could do a no rap.

53:24.040 --> 53:25.040
You could rap at Vincent Price.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.040
Yeah.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.040
You could get a lot off your chest.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.040
Woo!

53:28.040 --> 53:30.040
It sounds like you, you got a lot, you got a lot in your mind back there.

53:30.040 --> 53:34.040
No, no, no lady is the voice I hear in my head when I do everything.

53:34.040 --> 53:35.040
Everything.

53:35.040 --> 53:42.040
No, no, no lady is, is the, the, the thing I have to overcome in order to treat good women nice.

53:42.040 --> 53:48.040
Like, like, they're always, I'm constantly punishing women for a voice in my head that's

53:48.040 --> 53:51.040
coming from my mother or something that's like disapproving.

53:51.040 --> 53:55.040
You know, it's like, like, that's where misogyny starts is you put women on a pedestal.

53:55.040 --> 54:01.040
You're like either you, you acknowledge their power over you and then, but the women don't

54:01.040 --> 54:04.040
realize that that's where it starts or they do and they don't care because why should

54:04.040 --> 54:05.040
you have to care?

54:05.040 --> 54:09.040
Like, like, but by the time the guy opens his mouth, he's on step three, which is getting

54:09.040 --> 54:10.040
even with you.

54:10.040 --> 54:12.040
And it makes, it makes no sense.

54:12.040 --> 54:15.040
You're just hearing this horrible thing and he's like high-fiving himself and his friends

54:15.040 --> 54:17.040
because it's like, yeah, we did it.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.040
Today we, we took back the night.

54:19.040 --> 54:22.040
It's like, no, you terrorized me.

54:22.040 --> 54:24.040
I, I, I am a vulnerable person.

54:24.040 --> 54:29.040
I'm capable of, of, of, of emotionally fulfilling you and you hate me for it.

54:29.040 --> 54:33.040
Um, score some points with the ladies tonight, I think.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.040
Um, no.

54:35.040 --> 54:40.040
Shut up, mom.

54:40.040 --> 54:44.040
Uh, um, what do we do?

54:44.040 --> 54:46.040
What do we got left to talk about?

54:46.040 --> 54:47.040
I mean, as if we had a list.

54:47.040 --> 54:51.040
We really, really came up empty tonight, but, uh, had, had some good times.

54:51.040 --> 54:54.040
I'm still reeling from the, uh, from the Vincent Price wrap.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.040
Yeah.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.040
It's cool.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.040
Yeah.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.040
Yeah.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.040
It was really cool.

54:59.040 --> 55:00.040
We've given these people a lot, a lot of show.

55:00.040 --> 55:01.040
A lot of show tonight.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.040
You guys really,

55:02.040 --> 55:03.040
What have we learned tonight?

55:03.040 --> 55:06.040
Uh, uh, God damn it.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.040
I know there's, I know there's, I know there's one more thing to do.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.040
All right.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.040
Well, let's do, let's see.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.040
We did this last week.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.040
Are you having a heart attack?

55:12.040 --> 55:13.040
I'm just burping.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.040
I'm just burping.

55:14.040 --> 55:16.040
I had hummus for lunch.

55:16.040 --> 55:18.040
It's not charismatic.

55:18.040 --> 55:19.040
That was terrifying.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.040
Are you going to take your business elsewhere?

55:21.040 --> 55:23.040
I had hummus for lunch.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.040
Uh, yeah.

55:24.040 --> 55:29.040
Who's, who's, who's, who's, who's, who's feeling, who's feeling vulnerable.

55:29.040 --> 55:31.040
Who's feeling, who's feeling in transition.

55:31.040 --> 55:34.040
Who's feeling, who's feeling like they need, they need support.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.040
Okay.

55:35.040 --> 55:38.040
We've got a, we've got a guy raising up the back of his hand.

55:38.040 --> 55:39.040
Right.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.040
Come on.

55:40.040 --> 55:41.040
Do you want to come up here?

55:41.040 --> 55:46.040
That's why I'm asking.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.040
We experiment last week, which hasn't aired yet.

55:48.040 --> 55:55.040
I read some of my journal from when I was like 15 and it created a very strange emotional

55:55.040 --> 55:57.040
vacuum in the room.

55:57.040 --> 56:00.040
Uh, it wasn't like the audience was having a bad time, but it was like, it was very

56:00.040 --> 56:04.040
like, it was very like raw, not raw, like, oh, what an awesome journal.

56:04.040 --> 56:07.040
It was like, it was like, it just created, it just made us all feel 15 again.

56:07.040 --> 56:11.040
And then Spencer could barely roll his dice and everything just went a little, a little

56:11.040 --> 56:12.040
haywire.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.040
It went a little adolescent.

56:13.040 --> 56:17.040
And then our friend in the audience, Jesus Diaz, Jesus, are you here tonight?

56:17.040 --> 56:18.040
Okay.

56:18.040 --> 56:20.040
Jesus, he's sitting a little further back tonight.

56:20.040 --> 56:22.040
Uh, he, we did this with him.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.040
He just, I said, who's, who's here?

56:24.040 --> 56:27.040
And we realized we kind of stumbled into this Baptist revival thing.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.040
That, that's what they do.

56:29.040 --> 56:31.040
I also found out it's not that easy.

56:31.040 --> 56:34.040
It's like, you know, we make fun of these people and we call them charlatans and stuff, but

56:34.040 --> 56:36.040
they're providing a service and it is kind of the same thing.

56:36.040 --> 56:38.040
Like you, you stand in front of an audience.

56:38.040 --> 56:40.040
Everyone is like, okay, we're here for some reason.

56:40.040 --> 56:42.040
We want to feel a certain way.

56:42.040 --> 56:45.040
And then someone says, who, there's someone in the room that's feeling something.

56:45.040 --> 56:47.040
And, and like you, you get excited.

56:47.040 --> 56:52.040
If you put, if you put enough pressure on that gas pedal, you just have a revival tent.

56:52.040 --> 56:56.040
I don't want people like, like thinking that they can walk again and stuff.

56:56.040 --> 57:00.040
Uh, uh, I went to, and I had a girlfriend that was very, uh, very Christian.

57:00.040 --> 57:04.040
And we went to Malibu to this church and there was a faith healer there.

57:04.040 --> 57:09.040
And if it was a put on, it was the best designed put on of all time.

57:09.040 --> 57:10.040
And if it was real, then amazing.

57:10.040 --> 57:13.040
But like people were getting up there and shit was getting done.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.040
It was really wild.

57:14.040 --> 57:19.040
And you can't, I mean, I'm, you know, there's a party that wants to believe that.

57:19.040 --> 57:21.040
There's a party that wants to be that can't believe it.

57:21.040 --> 57:25.040
And so you're sitting there like, but in that moment, everyone in that building was like,

57:25.040 --> 57:26.040
that guy can hear again.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.040
Right.

57:27.040 --> 57:28.040
Like there was a guy that couldn't hear.

57:28.040 --> 57:30.040
But like, you know, I mean, he probably could hear a little better.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.040
Maybe it was fake or whatever.

57:31.040 --> 57:35.040
But, but it's like, like, leave the hearing out of it as my, I'm saying like,

57:35.040 --> 57:38.040
because I think everybody in this room has been and so, hey, what do you want?

57:38.040 --> 57:39.040
What are you doing?

57:39.040 --> 57:40.040
I'm kidding.

57:40.040 --> 57:41.040
Uh, yeah.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.040
Meanwhile, a man has been on our stage for five minutes.

57:43.040 --> 57:46.040
I didn't control that very well.

57:46.040 --> 57:47.040
What was your name, sir?

57:47.040 --> 57:48.040
Yeah.

57:48.040 --> 57:49.040
What's your name?

57:49.040 --> 57:50.040
My name is Misha.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.040
Misha.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.040
Misha.

57:52.040 --> 57:53.040
Welcome.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.040
Welcome.

57:54.040 --> 58:00.040
Is this a masculinity to say that is a adorable kitten's name?

58:00.040 --> 58:03.040
It's better than a lot of what I've gotten throughout the years.

58:03.040 --> 58:05.040
What's the worst thing you've gotten?

58:05.040 --> 58:07.040
Misha Barton for way too long.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.040
Misha, what?

58:08.040 --> 58:11.040
Barton from the O.C.?

58:11.040 --> 58:12.040
Oh, okay.

58:12.040 --> 58:13.040
Yeah.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.040
I don't know how my bullies torment me.

58:16.040 --> 58:20.040
You're young enough to have people tease you about the O.C.?

58:20.040 --> 58:21.040
Yeah, I know.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.040
I'm telling you, man.

58:22.040 --> 58:25.040
Enjoy it while it lasts, young ins.

58:25.040 --> 58:29.040
Like a crisp orange leaf blowing through your daddy's dick.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.040
Yo.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.040
Yo.

58:31.040 --> 58:32.040
Yo.

58:32.040 --> 58:33.040
Yo.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.040
I fucked your mama.

58:34.040 --> 58:36.040
And I fucked your daddy.

58:36.040 --> 58:37.040
Sorry.

58:37.040 --> 58:38.040
Sorry, Misha.

58:38.040 --> 58:41.040
Misha, what's on your plate tonight, Misha?

58:41.040 --> 58:42.040
Yeah.

58:42.040 --> 58:43.040
What's brought you...

58:43.040 --> 58:45.040
One of them has to get laid.

58:45.040 --> 58:46.040
Yes.

58:46.040 --> 58:47.040
What brought you up here?

58:47.040 --> 58:48.040
Some spirit.

58:48.040 --> 58:52.040
I'm in a weird transition period of my life.

58:52.040 --> 58:54.040
I'm about to graduate from college next semester.

58:54.040 --> 58:59.040
But I'm also 19, so I'm trying to figure out what to do with everything.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.040
Are you some kind of prodigy?

59:01.040 --> 59:02.040
No.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.040
But is it 19, like, way too...

59:04.040 --> 59:05.040
It's really young.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.040
No.

59:06.040 --> 59:07.040
Did your parents push you?

59:07.040 --> 59:09.040
Did you graduate at 16 high school?

59:09.040 --> 59:11.040
I graduated at 16.

59:11.040 --> 59:12.040
It was weird.

59:12.040 --> 59:13.040
I don't know.

59:13.040 --> 59:17.040
I went to college when I was 16, which is...

59:17.040 --> 59:20.040
The OC was on the air.

59:20.040 --> 59:22.040
A perfect storm.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.040
All right.

59:23.040 --> 59:24.040
What's your field?

59:24.040 --> 59:25.040
What's your...

59:25.040 --> 59:27.040
Uh, writing for TV and film, actually.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.040
Oh, really?

59:28.040 --> 59:29.040
Yeah.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.040
Okay, so where do you go to school?

59:30.040 --> 59:31.040
Emerson College.

59:31.040 --> 59:32.040
Hmm.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.040
I'm out of my depth.

59:33.040 --> 59:35.040
I don't know anything about this circuit.

59:35.040 --> 59:38.040
Like, I became a writer, but I don't know anything about how you become a writer.

59:38.040 --> 59:40.040
I don't know anything about this path.

59:40.040 --> 59:41.040
I don't either.

59:41.040 --> 59:42.040
All right.

59:42.040 --> 59:43.040
All right.

59:43.040 --> 59:44.040
So 19 graduated.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.040
You don't know what you want to do.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.040
Is this just a...

59:47.040 --> 59:49.040
Well, let's get this cynical thought out of our heads.

59:49.040 --> 59:52.040
This isn't just a ploy to get me to read your screenplay.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.040
No, I don't actually have a screenplay.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.040
I realized in school I wasn't good at it.

59:56.040 --> 59:59.040
And I was like, oh, maybe this isn't the right thing for me.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040
So you're at the end of that road.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040
You're going out of the world and you kind of...

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.040
Now you're having second thoughts about the whole choice.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
Yeah.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040
What is your option?

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.040
What makes you think that you're not good at it?

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.040
Uh, I read my scripts.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.040
Well, I don't always a telltale sign.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.040
Yeah, because Dan, like, you know, there was periods in our friendship where Dan was,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.040
like, we were writing a movie and he would never hit print.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.040
He would never let anybody read it.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040
Like, you hate everything you write.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040
That's part of being a good writer, probably, isn't it?

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040
Yeah, it is.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.040
It's also part of being a bad writer.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.040
So don't go up on the roof and go, I can fly.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.040
Dan said so.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.040
It just doesn't eliminate any possibilities.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040
It's not the metric to use.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.040
I can't tell if I'm self-aware or just really self-critical.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.040
I mean, man learned that he could die and then the next thing he started doing is, you know,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:57.040
burying his friends with arrowheads because it's like, I'm fucking up on Earth.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.040
Like, your awareness is like self-hatred.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.040
So anyways, that part, you can't go by that.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.040
That's helpful.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Well, let's go to the positive side of it.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.040
Is there something else that calls to you that you kind of, no matter how guilty,

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.040
no matter what it pays, no matter whether there's a word for it,

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.040
is there some passion that you like really, like, God, I wish I was just doing this.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.040
Why didn't I just go in this direction?

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040
Stand up comedy.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040
Really?

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040
Okay, well, then you're close enough.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040
Like, that's fine.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040
Yeah.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040
All right, do some bits.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040
Let's hear them.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.040
You got airplane food.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040
What do you got?

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:38.040
Do you have a tight three?

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.040
Do you have material?

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.040
I do, but this is a weird form to do it on.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040
Well, it's up to you.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.040
Like, don't let them pressure you because they don't.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.040
You know what I found?

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.040
You know, I traveled in a lot of comedy.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.040
I found a really good way to loosen up is to start off with a little rap.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.040
Yeah, I'll open for you.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:03.040
There might even be an appearance by a Vets of Price.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.040
Yo, yo, yo, yo, actually, actually, start the song from the beginning.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.040
What we'll do is we'll do a little, we'll do a little Def Jam kind of.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.040
I'll be a host.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.040
I'll be Russell Simmons and I'll come out and I'll introduce a rap act and then I'll

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040
do a little rap.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040
No, lady.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
Just stop.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:35.040
It's like, at this point, you have to ask yourself, am I at the right show?

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.040
You start to become the asshole.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.040
I'm sorry, I'm not.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.040
Actually, Dan, no one said anything.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.040
It's an empty chair with a mop.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.040
It's just an old hat rack back there.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.040
No way, okay, no, you know what, I won't open with a rap because that would bury you.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040
I will.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040
Wow.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040
Wow.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.040
Take that no, lady.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040
I will give you the best opener in the world.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.040
I'll do like shitty, horrible stand-up.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.040
Okay, so, all right.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.040
So, ladies and gentlemen, he's open for colleges and clubs all around the country.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.040
Schman, Flanigan.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.040
Oh, wow.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.040
Boy, oh boy.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:22.040
I can't believe how much pussy's in the audience.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.040
I'd like to eat it with a fork.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:32.040
Oh, speaking of forks, here's my impression of Bill Clinton talking to a pussy with a fork.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:36.040
Oh, I did not have relations with a pussy fork.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040
Oh, seriously, what else is going on?

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:45.040
You know, black people are...

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040
Are they bad people?

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.040
They seem like bad people.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.040
I was walking in the grocery store.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040
I saw a black guy shopping.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.040
He's like, whoa, shit, shit, baby, I want some cereal.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.040
I can't figure these people out.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.040
It's like, you know, we should, we should, you know, do...

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:12.040
I don't know whether to be friends with them or round them up and then put them in some kind of special camp.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.040
I don't know, I don't know if you guys are familiar with the United Nations,

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.040
but they have a lot of countries they're represented,

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.040
and I always thought it would be weird if they were, if they were, instead of running the world,

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.040
that they were running a plumbing company.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.040
And I think it would go, you know, the first thing you'd see when you walk in, you'd see Russia,

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.040
you know, oh, me, I love to plunge toilets, oh, comrade.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.040
You look over there, there's China.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.040
Oh, I saw, oh, I need, oh, there's too much shit in my toilets.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:51.040
Oh, hey, partner, I'm the United States of America, see?

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.040
Now, who, who put all this shit in the United Nations toilet?

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.040
Hey, don't look at me.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.040
Thank you very much, I'm Span and Bargain.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.040
It's been great.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.040
What, what, what did I do?

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.040
Okay, keep it going, folks, comedy isn't easy.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.040
All right, let's keep it going, let's try to shake it off.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:23.040
We got another, another guy coming up, let's keep it going for Misha!

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.040
I can't, am I supposed to rap or am I supposed to tell jokes?

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.040
No, dude, do stand up better than that guy, dude.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:33.040
I can't wait to tell my friends that Dan Harmon opened up for me.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:39.040
That's number one.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.040
You already got a laugh.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:50.040
Okay, my name is Misha, Misha is a Russian name,

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.040
but I'm not Russian, as you guys can probably tell.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:58.040
I was given my name because I was conceived during the Cold War

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.040
and my parents were pessimists.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040
What?

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:20.040
According to statistics, I should understand statistics.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:28.040
For the podcast people, listen, he's Asian.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.040
I love the voice you do for that.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.040
Yes very much.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.040
You're not that Asian.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.040
According to white people, I look like I want to be told I look like Jackie Chan.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.040
And here's the thing, I don't mind being told I look like another Asian.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:57.040
What I do mind is being told I look like a 57 year old.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.040
My father got called down.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:06.040
This is a big triumph. Jeff is obviously jealous and he's sabotaging you.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040
That is a good milestone.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040
Keep keep keep keep going.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040
I'm not jealous, I'm excited.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040
Alright.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040
Oh more?

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040
Yeah.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.040
Close the father joke.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040
Close the father joke.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.040
Do I do the same one again?

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040
Wait, I'm confused now.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.040
Can you start with the father, you said my father?

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.040
Oh, my father was called Jackie Chan when he was a kid.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.040
My grandfather was called Jackie Chan when he was a kid.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.040
That is not a good family tradition.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040
You know what a good family tradition though?

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.040
Wow, I can't speak English.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.040
You know what a good family tradition though is?

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.040
Understanding statistics.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.040
And sort of brings it around full circle.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.040
Sorry, I fucked the bit.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040
I fucked it up, I'm sorry.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040
No, it's probably my fault.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.040
Is there any other closer?

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.040
Do you get anything else up your sleeve?

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040
Maybe a little wrap?

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040
Okay.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.040
What do you do when shit gets hectic?

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.040
Or you haven't done anything yet?

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.040
This is a fantasy eye one.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040
You don't have an old standby.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.040
I'm sorry, I felt the father joke got fucked.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040
I feel terrible.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.040
I put music cue in the middle of a bit.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040
I thought that was a thing and I fucked it.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040
He was killing.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040
I know he was killing.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040
He killed.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040
Let's put it that way.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.040
Misha, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.040
Get back there and wrap.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.040
Do you want to wrap Misha?

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040
You think you can try?

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.040
Or try a wrap?

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040
No, not even just with a wrap.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040
Just a few licks.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040
Just give it a whirl.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.040
It'll feel like closure.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.040
People of the world.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040
All different colors.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.040
We're all united in a Benetton world.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.040
Black, white, brown, purple.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040
Everyone's feeling the vibe.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040
I'm an anti-racist rapper.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.040
Feeling the vibe.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.040
It's a bohemian scene on the east side.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.040
Feeling the vibe.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.040
Throwing it to my man Misha.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.040
My name is Misha.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.040
I cannot rap.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.040
Not much I know, but that's a fact.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.040
When it comes to rapping, it's the skill I lack.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.040
And that's about that, I guess.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.040
Misha, everyone.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.040
Everyone's a rapper.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.040
That's what I learned tonight.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.040
I'm going to make a prediction since we made a prediction earlier.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.040
I think that Misha, first of all, he's a good stand-up comic.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.040
I think you're 19, right?

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040
Yeah.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.040
Holy shit.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040
Also, you're driven.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.040
You got your shit together.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040
It's a little infuriating.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040
Also, Dan.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040
You could take a nap for eight years.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.040
And get up and start doing stuff.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.040
And still make half of your friends mad.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.040
And he looks just like Jackie Chan.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.040
He does.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.040
It's like an uncanny.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040
Like a classic, classic Chan.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040
Yeah, like an early Chan.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.040
Like an ancient Chan.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.040
Like an ancient secret Chan.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Like the Sist of the Seven Orbs.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040
That's not a movie.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040
Oh, wow.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.040
That was good, Misha.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.040
That was fucking awesome.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.040
Also, I think you said that I was being jealous.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.040
What I was was like...

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.040
I was making a joke.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.040
I couldn't believe the balls of someone getting up there and doing stand-up in the middle of a show.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.040
That's the balls of a burglar.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.040
Also, the music is very sensitive to his surroundings.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.040
He wasn't just like barreling through his thing.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.040
He was like, well, the music's playing.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.040
He was doing like a 70-yard hurdle dash open.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.040
But there were like jacks on the track.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.040
And he was like kind of like acknowledging them and going,

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.040
Ow, ow, okay, still jumping though.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.040
It was our fault that the last bit that he didn't like fucking...

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.040
He could have finished with like a fucking backflip.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.040
He's not Jackie Chan, Dan.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.040
He's not actually Jackie Chan.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.040
I'm sorry.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.040
He looks just fucking like him.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.040
I was lateral racist.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.040
He's doing a stereotype of the best stand-ups are black.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.040
And the best act ends with a backflip.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040
Forgot he was Asian.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.040
That's a horrible thing to say.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.040
We learned several weeks ago not to ask black people time travel questions.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.040
Should never ever suggest that an Asian man does a backflip.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.040
Can you do a backflip, Misha?

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.040
No, you can, can you?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.040
You're just saying that.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.040
You're saying no because we're going to make you come up here and do it.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.040
How do people do that?

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.040
How do you not fall?

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.040
We'll figure that out in a different episode.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.040
All right, let's close in a timely fashion.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040
It's been a nice, tight show.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.040
I have a feeling people don't come to Harbin Town because they go,

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.040
Oh, the show's always two hours long.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040
Let's fucking blow their minds tonight.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040
Do a tight 90.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040
All right.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.040
And what do we, how do we close the show?

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.040
Well, it's almost certainly going to be a wrap.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040
But we have two.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040
It feels like it has to be.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.040
But how can it possibly, you know...

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.040
Maybe, I don't know, can you take the mic around and maybe like...

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040
Does someone want to do a freestyle challenge?

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.040
I worked the crowd wrap.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.040
Or does somebody out there feel that they have the chops to come up to do a freestyle?

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040
Oh, a battle.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.040
An eighth mile kind of throw down.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040
Anybody?

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.040
A one-eighth mile special wrap battle.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.040
Anybody?

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.040
Anybody want to try their hand at taking down the Grandmaster here?

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.040
No one, no one spits this kind of fire.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040
I wouldn't do it.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.040
I already have a mic in front of my face.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040
All right.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040
All right.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040
Well, wait, you should rap battle me.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.040
Huh?

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.040
Yeah.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040
Yeah.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.040
I fucked this guy.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.040
Or did I engineer that entire thing?

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.040
Oh shit.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:58.040
Break it down.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.040
Oh shit.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.040
Coming to the stage.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.040
The clash of the Titans.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.040
Dan Harmon versus Jeff Davis.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040
Yo, yo, I'll bury you.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040
I fucked your mama.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.040
I fucked her like a sheep or a llama.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.040
Went to the petting zoo, saw her ass, fed her some cashews.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.040
She took a, yo, yo, yo, I'm offended by some things that you said.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.040
I think I've already told you that my mother is dead.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.040
She died of cancer when I was just 13.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.040
She didn't lose a ball, but it still felt mean to die of having cancer in most parts

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.040
of her body.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:40.040
And now you've, you've really treated her like a hottie that you're fucking a corpse.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.040
Yeah.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.040
Yeah.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.040
Yeah.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.040
Yeah.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.040
Yeah.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.040
Yeah.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.040
Yeah.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.040
Yeah.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.040
From that, it's hard to recover.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.040
Yeah, you're trying to fuck my dead mother.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.040
I still fucked her even though she's dead.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.040
How about that?

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.040
I took her body to bed.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.040
I put her foot on the post, put her hand on the cradle.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.040
I fucked your mama like her name was Abel.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040
Ferrara.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.040
Yo, yo, it's an actor.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.040
Yo, yo, Dan, I'll tell you what.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.040
What I'm going to do.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.040
I'm going to fly to Wisconsin, kill your parents and fuck them too.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040
I'm going to, I'm going to kill them and fuck them with a body.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.040
It's still warm.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.040
I'm going to fuck them and I'm going to do the swarm.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.040
Swarm is a dance where you're coming to your mama.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040
And then you also call a llama.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.040
You put a llama on your daddy and you fuck it in the rear.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.040
You fuck the promise booty and you fuck your daddy's ear.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040
Yo, you're talking about fucking my parents.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040
Yeah.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.040
Yo, yo, that's really mean.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.040
Yeah.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040
You brought up a dead mom.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.040
Murder.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.040
She threw us for a loop, but I heard your uncle Tom.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.040
That's right.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.040
You're a betrayer of your race.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.040
I heard your mama was a can of mace.

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.040
She sprayed her pussy and she sprayed her breasts.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040
I heard your mama couldn't pass a test.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.040
I heard she took a number two on her own damn pencil.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.040
She didn't understand the meaning of the stencil.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040
She couldn't understand even a stencil.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040
Stencils are easy to read.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.040
It was a stencil.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:08.040
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to Harmontown.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:14.040
I think that rap battle goes to Jeff.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.040
Thank you very much.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.040
We got some people to thank.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040
Yes, we do.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040
They're right here.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.040
First of all, we want to thank Spencer, our Dungeon Master,

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.040
who's right there.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.040
And also our well wishes go out to your brother.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040
Congratulations on his recovery.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:32.040
We want to thank Misha, Adam Goldberg, as always.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.040
Also, Katie Levine, Zac McKeever, Emily Gordon,

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.040
Neil Cramer, Dustin Marshall, Mo Fathelbab, Jenny Fine,

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.040
and Shahruz.Shuckett.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.040
Thank you so much for coming down.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.040
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.040
There's the grilled cheese truckers out there.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040
I want to remind you.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040
Don't get your grilled cheese.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040
You guys are awesome tonight.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.040
Thank you.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.040
Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.040
Come next week.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.040
There's a point where we're going to break for the holidays.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040
So there's only a couple of Harmontowns left before.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.040
Eric Eible's not coming next week, any of you guys.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040
Don't miss it.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040
Thank you all.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040
Thank you.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.040
Thank you.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.040
Thank you.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040
Thank you.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.040
Thank you.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.040
It's always a battle that I have.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.040
Thank you.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.040
Thank you.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.040
That's my test.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040
Thank you.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.040
You like it.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.040
You like it.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.040
You
