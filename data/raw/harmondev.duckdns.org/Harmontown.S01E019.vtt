hard,\n\n00:47.160 --> 00:52.760\nshe turned into asphalt, I've turned her ass into a road, lying down the middle, she is a\n\n00:52.760 --> 00:58.360\nhorny toad, took the big dick, split her down the middle, cat in the spoon in the moon in the\n\n00:58.360 --> 01:04.880\nfiddle, fuck your mama like she was a pancake, fuck your mama orgasms weren't faked, flipped her\n\n01:04.880 -->

freestyle rap about your mama, fucked your mama's smile up into a frown,\n\n01:34.840 --> 01:41.120\nfucked your mama's glasses back onto her head, looked like a librarian instead, fucked your mama's\n\n01:41.120 --> 01:46.840\nface, fucked her in her nose, fucked your mama, that's how it goes, I'm trying to tell you that\n\n01:46.840 --> 01:52.720\nI fucked your mom, don't you understand, I haven't been unclear, fucked your mama, your daddy just\n\n01:52.720 --> 01:57.960\nwatched, I fucked your mama and your daddy just sat there, fucked your mama and your daddy didn't\n\n01:57.960 --> 02:11.520\ndo nothing, fucked your mama, your daddy was the victim, maybe we'll start each show with\n\n02:11.520 --> 02:17.440\na freestyle rap from now on, we can say this, nobody could accuse you of beating around the\n\n02:17.440 --> 02:23.280\nbush about whether or not you fucked someone's mom or not, I'm not soft on mama's, you were\n\n02:23.280 --> 02:28.960\nvery candid about fucking someone's mama, if MCing, is that what it's called MCing, is that\n\n02:28.960 --> 02:35.120\nwhen you rap, if MCing was an elected position, my platform would not involve being soft on your\n\n02:35.120 --> 02:40.000\nmama, I would be tough on her, which is probably why I'd never get elected, I don't think that\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:46.080\nposition should be up for focus, 51% of the population is women, they don't want to elect\n\n02:46.080 --> 02:51.240\nsomebody as an MC that's gonna just fuck everyone's mama, because I didn't hear anything in that\n\n02:51.240 --> 02:55.560\nrap, Jeff, I'm scrutinizing myself, I didn't hear anything in that rap about consensual sex,\n\n02:55.560 --> 03:01.520\nbut none of our gathams were fake, that's true, she did like it, I think you fucked\n\n03:01.520 --> 03:07.120\nher glasses into her head, which is a little disturbing, I thought they should have come\n\n03:07.120 --> 03:12.440\nto a librarian, she embedded them into her, no, no, no, no, got that's violent, breaking\n\n03:12.440 --> 03:18.040\ndown, give me a beat, we'll clarify it, your mama liked it, your mom likes it, yeah, here\n\n03:18.040 --> 03:29.720\nyo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, when I fuck your mama, she likes it a lot, I fuck her so hard,\n\n03:29.720 --> 03:35.440\nher nose runs with snot, it's kinda gross, but she likes it, it's wild abandoned, it's\n\n03:35.440 --> 03:40.960\nlike she likes it, you know, like life's surreal, your mama likes it so much, I fuck her for\n\n03:40.960 --> 03:45.560\nreal, I might marry her, I might give her a ring, I fuck your mama so good the bitch\n\n03:45.560 --> 03:51.240\nstarts to sing, she goes, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I like to give a fuck, but Dan\n\n03:51.240 --> 04:00.080\nHarmon, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, fuck me in the morning, but Dan Harmon, there's a little hook\n\n04:00.080 --> 04:06.120\nthere, well, thank you, thank you folks, thank you, now we got the ladies on our side, that's\n\n04:06.120 --> 04:10.680\ngood, so you gotta, you gotta, don't forget the sensitivity, also, too much, too much\n\n04:10.680 --> 04:14.720\nmisogyny in rap, you gotta, and certainly now, women don't, you know, must get tired\n\n04:14.720 --> 04:19.280\nof that stereotype that men are only after young ladies, you know, you're after mamas,\n\n04:19.280 --> 04:24.600\nyou know, and it's, mamas are still sexy, can I ask you, as an objective observer, because\n\n04:24.600 --> 04:31.680\nI go into a kind of fugue state when I rap, when I, I become a, I become just a, a science\n\n04:31.680 --> 04:35.360\ndropper, like I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't have consciousness, it's just moving\n\n04:35.360 --> 04:41.480\nthrough me like a channel, why, why, what, what do I do when I'm rapping that results\n\n04:41.480 --> 04:45.680\nin me being out of breath, why, why, it seems like I'm just rapping, why am I out of breath?\n\n04:45.680 --> 04:50.600\nYou can do your little toddler dance, right, but that doesn't seem like exercise, like,\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:55.240\nI guess, also, you're, you're, you're doing more exhaling than inhaling probably, if\n\n04:55.240 --> 04:56.240\nyou're doing it right.\n\n04:56.240 --> 04:57.240\nRight, okay, that's what it is.\n\n04:57.240 --> 05:00.800\nBut you have that respiratory alkalosis thing, so that's good for you, I'd say, you breathe\n\n05:00.800 --> 05:07.000\ntoo much, sorry, I got my new phone and I don't know how to, it's pretty big, look at\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.960\nthis fucking thing, he got, what is this called, the Samsung Gigantor, it's an iPad, some people\n\n05:12.960 --> 05:20.280\ncall it a phablet, a phablet, part phone, part tablet, nope, nobody calls, no one calls\n\n05:20.280 --> 05:30.000\nit that, I defected from Apple, it fits, it fits almost in my pocket, yeah, it's, it's\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:35.680\nlarge, it's large, Aaron keeps suggesting that I got it because I'm so old that I like\n\n05:35.680 --> 05:41.200\nthat it's like a big phone for old people, and that's kind of true, like, I'm able to\n\n05:41.200 --> 05:49.000\nthumb type faster on it, I think it's a crime that I'm not able to, you know, when I was,\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.680\nI've always, ever since I was like 15 years old, I've always loved having like little\n\n05:53.680 --> 05:57.640\ndevices and things, even though at 15, what do you, what do you need them for, to schedule\n\n05:57.640 --> 06:02.760\nyour chronic masturbation, or to like remind yourself to ask for another one next Christmas,\n\n06:02.760 --> 06:06.040\nlike there was nothing I needed it for, but I just loved them, they're like, like, like\n\n06:06.040 --> 06:09.960\nmade me feel like, like Penny and Inspector Gadget to have like a little, I should have\n\n06:09.960 --> 06:15.160\njust tried Pigtails and save my parents like 10K a year out on these little gadgets, but\n\n06:15.160 --> 06:19.360\nI always want, and that was before the internet was a thing, and certainly before the internet\n\n06:19.360 --> 06:23.560\ncould be a repository for personal information, as I got older, even though I didn't have\n\n06:23.560 --> 06:26.960\nany use for these things, they never made me organize, they never, they never helped me\n\n06:26.960 --> 06:31.280\nin any way, way before they were phones, I always, I always had this fantasy, like as\n\n06:31.280 --> 06:34.280\nthey became more sophisticated, I was like, yeah, what I want to do is I want to, I want\n\n06:34.280 --> 06:40.160\nto use these things, like seamlessly to record every, every little bit of my life, I want\n\n06:40.160 --> 06:44.960\nto like, I want to be like this, this human catalog of useless, like, like this was a\n\n06:44.960 --> 06:48.400\nguy and he was here and there was, this is what he had for breakfast at any given day,\n\n06:48.400 --> 06:52.920\nI just be able to like go through my life and just pounce on any, any moment, like I wanted\n\n06:52.920 --> 06:58.280\nto be the Bridget Jones of doing nothing at all, and I just ended up being the forest\n\n06:58.280 --> 07:03.200\ngump of buying little pieces of plastic shit, like I said, because I was just like, every,\n\n07:03.200 --> 07:06.240\nevery single one that came out, I was there for palm pilots, I was there for things you\n\n07:06.240 --> 07:11.560\nguys don't remember, because you're, you're 25, but, but I, I, I, then the iPhone came\n\n07:11.560 --> 07:16.320\nout and it was like, okay, this is going to be great, because this is now an accessory,\n\n07:16.320 --> 07:20.360\nnow everyone's, everyone's, it's a cool to whip it out, it's fine, you don't have to\n\n07:20.360 --> 07:25.520\nbring ordinary life to a halt, just to try to catalog your ordinary life, but then the\n\n07:25.520 --> 07:29.680\nold Henry twist on that is that all our ordinary lives became so intermingled with these things\n\n07:29.680 --> 07:33.120\nthat ordinary life changed, you know, we know, I'm not, I'm not a hipster, Luddite snob\n\n07:33.120 --> 07:40.080\nabout it, I, I upgraded when we became cyborgs, I, I, I, I lost nothing and gained a world\n\n07:40.080 --> 07:45.640\nwhen we, when we became Borg, I prefer it, I don't, I don't miss anything from the old\n\n07:45.640 --> 07:50.760\nworld, the only thing that I remember from the old world was a couple of people going\n\n07:50.760 --> 07:54.240\nlike, why is everyone on their phone all the time, like, like that, that's all I remember\n\n07:54.240 --> 07:58.880\nabout real conversation, I like that breakfasts are documentaries about documenting breakfasts,\n\n07:58.880 --> 08:04.520\nlike, I, I like, I like, I like, I like that we record everything and, but here's the thing\n\n08:04.520 --> 08:09.520\nabout the iPhone, like I gave something up in between the, I had a thing called a Palm\n\n08:09.520 --> 08:14.760\nTrio and it was like, like, it looked like a lot like what blackberries look like, like,\n\n08:14.760 --> 08:19.400\nit had a little thumb keyboard, the little raised keyboard, there was the feedback, there\n\n08:19.400 --> 08:22.960\nwas the bumps that you could feel and I could really, I could type on that fucker, I would\n\n08:22.960 --> 08:28.160\nwrite like essays at bars, I would like, write outlines, I would get work done, not a lot,\n\n08:28.160 --> 08:31.560\nbut I would, I would, I would, I would write stuff, I would like, like, do blog entries\n\n08:31.560 --> 08:35.880\nand the iPhone is like, that fucking like, you don't, no matter how hard you try, you\n\n08:35.880 --> 08:40.040\ncan't get good at typing on a, maybe, maybe some of like the girls with like the little\n\n08:40.040 --> 08:43.640\nitty-bitty tiny little thumbs, like if your thumbs are like little styluses.\n\n08:43.640 --> 08:47.280\nI get teased, people look over my children like, wow, you're, you're faster than my daughter\n\n08:47.280 --> 08:54.400\nat that, yeah, well, maybe you have little, little, little sharp thumbs, no, I just got,\n\n08:54.400 --> 08:59.640\nI just find that I spend exactly half the time on the iPhone, like correcting everything\n\n08:59.640 --> 09:04.320\nand if you turn off the auto correct, then it's just a fucking plate of spaghetti, you\n\n09:04.320 --> 09:08.040\nlook up and you go, who, what was I even saying, what you do, when you have it on half the\n\n09:08.040 --> 09:12.520\ntime, you're saying, you know, I didn't want to say nugget, I wanted to say the N word,\n\n09:12.520 --> 09:19.040\nyou know, talking to my friend, Donald Clover has a really funny joke about that, but whatever,\n\n09:19.040 --> 09:21.840\nI can't tell it because it involves saying that.\n\n09:21.840 --> 09:26.920\nMy phone is not smart enough to learn that I say fuck a lot more than duck, it really\n\n09:26.920 --> 09:29.480\nwants me to say duck you a lot, go and duck yourself.\n\n09:29.480 --> 09:34.200\nYou can train them eventually, but the bottom line is like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying\n\n09:34.200 --> 09:38.560\nI'll meet you at the meeting at eight, that's the only thing that you can just type effortlessly\n\n09:38.560 --> 09:42.880\non the iPhone, like stuff that's like, yes, Bill, I'd love to schedule that appointment.\n\n09:42.880 --> 09:47.440\nYou can't, you can't just go, you know, man, give me some of that, Screab Squab, Flippy\n\n09:47.440 --> 09:52.280\nFlap, like you can't colloquialize, you can't, you can't, and that's, that's you buying\n\n09:52.280 --> 09:53.280\nhash, right?\n\n09:53.280 --> 10:00.400\nI want some Screab Squab, anyways, so I got this giant phone, it looks like a griddle,\n\n10:00.400 --> 10:05.680\nit looks like a, to me, it looks like what you get served a nice aperitif on, like a\n\n10:05.680 --> 10:08.400\nbutler comes up with that and there's a drink on top of it.\n\n10:08.400 --> 10:15.680\nIt's an iPhone Maxi, so you can't, you can't see it in podcast land, but it, it's, it's\n\n10:15.680 --> 10:21.280\nbig enough that it looks like it should have a handle on it, like a, like a vanity mirror,\n\n10:21.280 --> 10:25.120\nlike it looks like, like it's, it's, it's, it's, it's face is the size of us, of a,\n\n10:25.120 --> 10:31.120\nyeah, of an industrial spatula, or a big, or a big hairbrush, yeah, but it's got a, so\n\n10:31.120 --> 10:34.880\nit's got a big fat keyboard for my big fat thumbs, and I can thumb my little, my little\n\n10:34.880 --> 10:35.880\nheart away.\n\n10:35.880 --> 10:39.920\nI'm getting a little accuracy, I can tell that over time I'll actually get better, I\n\n10:39.920 --> 10:44.000\ndon't have auto correct on, I'm just, I'm just thumbing and thumbing, so you can

12:33.200\nFinding out that you're, that I'm like you, it makes you feel more magical.\n\n12:33.200 --> 12:37.200\nOne plaintive cry of protest.\n\n12:37.200 --> 12:40.200\nIt was my first guest, ma'am.\n\n12:40.200 --> 12:41.200\nI don't know.\n\n12:41.200 --> 12:43.200\nI don't have an objective of you of myself.\n\n12:43.200 --> 12:46.200\nI thought that people loved me because they thought I was magical.\n\n12:46.200 --> 12:48.200\nIt's just, it's just my first guest.\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:49.200\nYour dance is magical.\n\n12:49.200 --> 12:50.200\nYeah.\n\n12:50.200 --> 12:52.200\nIt's tiring though.\n\n12:52.200 --> 12:54.200\nSo we're going to, we're going to go on tour.\n\n12:54.200 --> 12:55.200\nI know you guys don't care.\n\n12:55.200 --> 12:58.200\nI announced this before and it was like, you get lukewarm applause because you're talking\n\n12:58.200 --> 13:00.200\nto the people that you're leaving when you're going on tour.\n\n13:00.200 --> 13:03.200\nBut, but we are going to go all around the country.\n\n13:03.200 --> 13:04.200\nIt's, it's official now.\n\n13:04.200 --> 13:05.200\nYeah.\n\n13:05.200 --> 13:06.200\nI can, I can really say it.\n\n13:06.200 --> 13:09.200\nWe're going to, we're going to, we're going to take two weeks in January and we're just\n\n13:09.200 --> 13:12.200\ngoing to go like mad rabid dogs.\n\n13:12.200 --> 13:13.200\nThere's no days off.\n\n13:13.200 --> 13:14.200\nWe're in a different city.\n\n13:14.200 --> 13:15.200\nEvery night.\n\n13:15.200 --> 13:16.200\nEvery night.\n\n13:16.200 --> 13:18.200\nAnd so we're not going to enjoy being in those cities.\n\n13:18.200 --> 13:19.200\nNo.\n\n13:19.200 --> 13:22.200\nWe're going to see a hotel, a tour bus, and a microphone.\n\n13:22.200 --> 13:23.200\nAnd that's, and then a bed.\n\n13:23.200 --> 13:24.200\nAnd that's going to be it.\n\n13:24.200 --> 13:26.200\nIt's going to be, it's going to be gripping.\n\n13:26.200 --> 13:30.200\nAnd we're going to visit each of the many, many cities within the sound of my voice.\n\n13:30.200 --> 13:32.200\nWe may be coming through your town.\n\n13:32.200 --> 13:34.200\nWe'll, we'll announce an official schedule at some point.\n\n13:34.200 --> 13:40.200\nAnd, and, and so, and we'll try to, my original plan was, oh, and then we'll tweet when we're\n\n13:40.200 --> 13:43.200\non the road and people will go, oh, come to my little, little town.\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:44.200\nAll I got is a bus stop.\n\n13:44.200 --> 13:47.200\nAnd there's only six people that know who you are, but, but, you know, stop at the bus\n\n13:47.200 --> 13:50.200\nstop and do a little rap about fucking their moms and stuff.\n\n13:50.200 --> 13:52.200\nAnd like, like, like, but I don't think we're going to have time for that.\n\n13:52.200 --> 13:56.200\nI think it's just going to be like, we got to get from Dallas to, to, to Schmalis,\n\n13:56.200 --> 13:58.200\nwhatever another city would be.\n\n13:58.200 --> 13:59.200\nI don't know.\n\n13:59.200 --> 14:00.200\nSchmalis.\n\n14:00.200 --> 14:01.200\nI don't even know most of the states.\n\n14:01.200 --> 14:03.200\nThey're going to memorize cities.\n\n14:03.200 --> 14:06.200\nBut we're going to go like just a circle.\n\n14:06.200 --> 14:09.200\nWe're going to draw a little story circle around America.\n\n14:09.200 --> 14:11.200\nSo fuck you, Iowa.\n\n14:11.200 --> 14:14.200\nBecause we're not going to, it's just, you're just going to be there in the, what's in the\n\n14:14.200 --> 14:15.200\nmiddle?\n\n14:15.200 --> 14:16.200\nIs Iowa in the middle?\n\n14:16.200 --> 14:17.200\nYeah, no.\n\n14:17.200 --> 14:18.200\nAll right.\n\n14:18.200 --> 14:19.200\nI think Kansas, right?\n\n14:19.200 --> 14:23.200\nIs that the no lady, the same, the same lady say no the second time?\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:25.200\nThe lady that tonight?\n\n14:25.200 --> 14:27.200\nI got her to say yes to something.\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:28.200\nWho is it?\n\n14:28.200 --> 14:29.200\nRaise your hand.\n\n14:29.200 --> 14:30.200\nWho's?\n\n14:30.200 --> 14:31.200\nWhere's the no lady?\n\n14:31.200 --> 14:32.200\nIs that Justin's mom?\n\n14:32.200 --> 14:33.200\nWho is that?\n\n14:33.200 --> 14:34.200\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n14:34.200 --> 14:35.200\nWow.\n\n14:35.200 --> 14:36.200\nYou're a silhouette.\n\n14:36.200 --> 14:37.200\nDan, Dan, fuck her.\n\n14:37.200 --> 14:38.200\nOh my God.\n\n14:38.200 --> 14:42.200\nI know my friend Justin's mom is here and you're a silhouette.\n\n14:42.200 --> 14:48.200\nI thought you were my friend's mom, so I almost fucked you.\n\n14:48.200 --> 14:59.200\nAnd if it hurt your feelings, I'll still sleep tonight because you're kind of yelling stuff\n\n14:59.200 --> 15:01.200\nout in the middle of the show.\n\n15:01.200 --> 15:04.200\nAnd also you've made your stance very clear on mamas.\n\n15:04.200 --> 15:05.200\nYeah.\n\n15:05.200 --> 15:06.200\nI'm hard on them.\n\n15:06.200 --> 15:14.200\nI mean, I give them what they want in an unapologetic and unsolicited fashion.\n\n15:14.200 --> 15:18.200\nBut always consensual, liberal way.\n\n15:18.200 --> 15:20.200\nNo fake orgasms.\n\n15:20.200 --> 15:25.200\nYeah, and always, always, their body, their choice afterward, whatever.\n\n15:25.200 --> 15:28.200\nIt's very thoughtful of them.\n\n15:28.200 --> 15:30.200\nIt's very, very thoughtful.\n\n15:30.200 --> 15:32.200\nThat's when pro-choice becomes misogynistic.\n\n15:32.200 --> 15:33.200\nI just realized that.\n\n15:33.200 --> 15:37.200\nYeah, there's a version of pro-chase that it's absolutely horrendously sexist.\n\n15:37.200 --> 15:40.200\nYeah, yeah, your body, your choice.\n\n15:40.200 --> 15:43.200\nSays I.\n\n15:43.200 --> 15:44.200\nFor breakfast.\n\n15:44.200 --> 15:45.200\nAll right.\n\n15:45.200 --> 15:48.200\nAnyways, enough about politics.\n\n15:48.200 --> 15:51.200\nLet's talk about race.\n\n15:51.200 --> 15:56.200\nI think I'm the first show to close the book on race, right?\n\n15:56.200 --> 15:59.200\nYou keep opening it, though.\n\n15:59.200 --> 16:01.200\nThat book is frequently reopened.\n\n16:01.200 --> 16:02.200\nWell, it's a magical book.\n\n16:02.200 --> 16:07.200\nIt flies in the beginning of Spielberg's Amazing Stories title sequence.\n\n16:07.200 --> 16:08.200\nWow.\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:10.200\nThree people.\n\n16:10.200 --> 16:13.200\nRemember that show? Does anyone remember Amazing Stories?\n\n16:13.200 --> 16:14.200\nYeah.\n\n16:14.200 --> 16:15.200\nThe same little lady?\n\n16:15.200 --> 16:16.200\nYeah.\n\n16:16.200 --> 16:19.200\nI think it's amazing that even Spielberg isn't allowed to.\n\n16:19.200 --> 16:22.200\nHe can't just roll into TV and go, because I said so.\n\n16:22.200 --> 16:26.200\nHe's constantly taking another attempt at bat.\n\n16:26.200 --> 16:27.200\nEverybody wants to do TV.\n\n16:27.200 --> 16:28.200\nTV really doesn't.\n\n16:28.200 --> 16:32.200\nI found that TV does not care about your feature credentials.\n\n16:32.200 --> 16:33.200\nThey just don't care.\n\n16:33.200 --> 16:37.200\nYou constantly see people who are big movie stars and movie directors and stuff.\n\n16:37.200 --> 16:40.200\nThey launch shows and TV just goes, yeah.\n\n16:40.200 --> 16:41.200\nFuck.\n\n16:41.200 --> 16:43.200\nIf no one watches it, fuck you.\n\n16:43.200 --> 16:44.200\nIt's pretty amazing.\n\n16:44.200 --> 16:49.200\nIt's kind of comforting to know that Spielberg has to try just as hard as you would to make\n\n16:49.200 --> 16:51.200\na little show about dinosaurs or something.\n\n16:51.200 --> 16:52.200\nLet's make a prediction right now.\n\n16:52.200 --> 16:54.200\nYou've got a CBS show that you're making.\n\n16:54.200 --> 16:56.200\nYou've got a Fox show you're making.\n\n16:56.200 --> 16:58.200\nLet's time capsule this.\n\n16:58.200 --> 17:02.200\nPredictions on the success, the livelihood, the duration of these shows.\n\n17:02.200 --> 17:07.200\nI would say try to be right.\n\n17:07.200 --> 17:10.200\nLet's replay this in like two years, three years, whatever.\n\n17:10.200 --> 17:16.200\nWell, I think the Fox one will get a production order for the pilot, and then it won't get\n\n17:16.200 --> 17:17.200\npicked up.\n\n17:17.200 --> 17:19.200\nIt'll be like a pilot people grow up, but that was good.\n\n17:19.200 --> 17:23.200\nAnd they'll be like, yeah, it wasn't that good.\n\n17:23.200 --> 17:28.200\nAnd then the CBS one, I think will, all right, serious prediction.\n\n17:28.200 --> 17:29.200\nI'm just going to make it.\n\n17:29.200 --> 17:30.200\nI'm not going to jinx myself.\n\n17:30.200 --> 17:32.200\nIt's going to get picked up.\n\n17:32.200 --> 17:34.200\nDo you want to wrap it or do you want to just say it?\n\n17:34.200 --> 17:36.200\nI'll just say it.\n\n17:36.200 --> 17:38.200\nIt's going to get, we'll shoot a pilot.\n\n17:38.200 --> 17:44.200\nIt'll be my first multi-cam pilot, and six and out.\n\n17:44.200 --> 17:47.200\nSix episodes canceled.\n\n17:47.200 --> 17:48.200\nThat's my prediction.\n\n17:48.200 --> 17:50.200\nBut that's not chicken feet, man.\n\n17:50.200 --> 17:51.200\nNo.\n\n17:51.200 --> 17:59.200\nThat's a swimming pool.\n\n17:59.200 --> 18:00.200\nIt's sad.\n\n18:00.200 --> 18:01.200\nIt's a little sad.\n\n18:01.200 --> 18:02.200\nIt's sad for the actors.\n\n18:02.200 --> 18:03.200\nYeah.\n\n18:03.200 --> 18:04.200\nYeah, all those little actors.\n\n18:04.200 --> 18:07.200\nImagine them acting their little hearts out.\n\n18:07.200 --> 18:11.200\nI'm going to pilot, but I better make an extra good this morning.\n\n18:11.200 --> 18:12.200\nNo, no, Toby.\n\n18:12.200 --> 18:14.200\nI'm the fucking kiss of death, baby.\n\n18:14.200 --> 18:16.200\nI've done so many failed TV shows.\n\n18:16.200 --> 18:20.200\nI am absolutely like just a scourge.\n\n18:20.200 --> 18:22.200\nI've never gotten out of season one.\n\n18:22.200 --> 18:23.200\nI've done so much.\n\n18:23.200 --> 18:25.200\nI'm going for Clooney's records of most failed pilots.\n\n18:25.200 --> 18:26.200\nYeah.\n\n18:26.200 --> 18:29.200\nBy the way, we're taking a break from D&D this week.\n\n18:29.200 --> 18:33.200\nAnd it's not because Spencer was so mopey last week.\n\n18:33.200 --> 18:35.200\nHe was chomping at Spencer.\n\n18:35.200 --> 18:38.200\nSpencer took his own life this morning.\n\n18:38.200 --> 18:40.200\nThat episode hasn't aired yet.\n\n18:40.200 --> 18:44.200\nWe had quite an emotional episode that will be, I guess,\n\n18:44.200 --> 18:45.200\nwill be airing this coming.\n\n18:45.200 --> 18:46.200\nIt's very sad.\n\n18:46.200 --> 18:48.200\nFor those of you who are here in the first...\n\n18:48.200 --> 18:54.200\nHe fired a 22-sided bullet through his brain.\n\n18:54.200 --> 19:00.200\nHe cast magic bullets through his head.\n\n19:00.200 --> 19:02.200\nSpencer, you feeling all right?\n\n19:02.200 --> 19:04.200\nLet's get Spencer up and get a progress report.\n\n19:04.200 --> 19:07.200\nAll right, let's check in with Spencer.\n\n19:11.200 --> 19:13.200\nYo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n19:13.200 --> 19:16.200\nSpencer for hire, the man with the plan.\n\n19:16.200 --> 19:18.200\nThe flannel shirt even taller than Dan.\n\n19:18.200 --> 19:21.200\nHe's got a big-ass beard like a Viking warrior.\n\n19:21.200 --> 19:25.200\nI fucked your mama because she's even horrier than me.\n\n19:25.200 --> 19:26.200\nI drank my pee.\n\n19:26.200 --> 19:27.200\nI ate my poop.\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:30.200\nAnd then I said, for me, I licked my lips.\n\n19:30.200 --> 19:31.200\nAnd I did it again.\n\n19:31.200 --> 19:33.200\nI fucked your mama five times.\n\n19:33.200 --> 19:34.200\nThen I fucked her 10.\n\n19:34.200 --> 19:37.200\nI fucked your mama.\n\n19:37.200 --> 19:39.200\nWelcome, Spencer.\n\n19:39.200 --> 19:40.200\nThanks.\n\n19:40.200 --> 19:42.200\nI feel welcome.\n\n19:42.200 --> 19:45.200\nSpencer, you want to try your hand on some freestyle?\n\n19:45.200 --> 19:47.200\nNo, no thanks.\n\n19:47.200 --> 19:49.200\nMaybe someday.\n\n19:49.200 --> 19:51.200\nYo.\n\n19:51.200 --> 19:53.200\nI don't know.\n\n19:53.200 --> 19:55.200\nSorry, guys.\n\n19:55.200 --> 19:57.200\nAll right.\n\n19:57.200 --> 19:59.200\nGod damn it.\n\n19:59.200 --> 20:00.200\nDon't break my heart.\n\n20:00.200 --> 20:01.200\nWhat are these days?\n\n20:01.200 --> 20:02.200\nWhat are these days?\n\n20:02.200 --> 20:03.200\nWhat are these days?\n\n20:03.200 --> 20:04.200\nOne of some days, Sam.\n\n20:04.200 --> 20:05.200\nI'll train.\n\n20:05.200 --> 20:06.200\nAll right.\n\n20:06.200 --> 20:09.200\nMaybe I'll just kind of leave that on in the background.\n\n20:09.200 --> 20:11.200\nYou guys are so...\n\n20:11.200 --> 20:14.200\nTalk about whatever you guys are going to talk about.\n\n20:14.200 --> 20:16.200\nMy name is Spencer.\n\n20:16.200 --> 20:19.200\nAnd I'm here to say, I'm going to rule your dice.\n\n20:19.200 --> 20:21.200\nGive your life away.\n\n20:21.200 --> 20:22.200\nThat was me.\n\n20:22.200 --> 20:24.200\nThat was me for him to say.\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:25.200\nYeah.\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:27.200\nIt would be fun to do like a Super Bowl shuffle\n\n20:27.200 --> 20:29.200\nand have like Adam Goldberg come out\n\n20:29.200 --> 20:31.200\nand each person raps what their name is\n\n20:31.200 --> 20:34.200\nand how they're valuable to Harmontown.\n\n20:34.200 --> 20:37.200\nDo like a little Harmontown rap.\n\n20:37.200 --> 20:39.200\nSpencer, are you feeling better?\n\n20:39.200 --> 20:40.200\nSpencer, update.\n\n20:40.200 --> 20:43.200\nI was feeling good until like just now.\n\n20:43.200 --> 20:48.200\nI was like, I can't rap.\n\n20:48.200 --> 20:51.200\nI didn't really fuck your mama.\n\n20:51.200 --> 20:52.200\nNo, that's fine.\n\n20:52.200 --> 20:53.200\nOh.\n\n20:53.200 --> 20:57.200\nLow on the priorities list.\n\n20:57.200 --> 21:00.200\nWell, I mean, I usually do D&D, but that's not happening.\n\n21:00.200 --> 21:01.200\nSo what's up, you guys?\n\n21:01.200 --> 21:03.200\nDo you have other D&D games running?\n\n21:03.200 --> 21:04.200\nNot right now.\n\n21:04.200 --> 21:06.200\nI usually kind of crash and burn\n\n21:06.200 --> 21:09.200\nbecause my mom doesn't know what's going on.\n\n21:09.200 --> 21:13.200\nNot right now, I usually kind of crash and burn\n\n21:13.200 --> 21:16.200\nbecause my player group is totally gossiping on the Internet.\n\n21:16.200 --> 21:19.200\nMy player group sucks a lot.\n\n21:19.200 --> 21:21.200\nSo is it Trisha?\n\n21:21.200 --> 21:22.200\nYeah.\n\n21:22.200 --> 21:23.200\nNo, fuck it.\n\n21:23.200 --> 21:25.200\nShe never stops shopping.\n\n21:25.200 --> 21:29.200\nShe always wants to buy more 50 feet of rope.\n\n21:29.200 --> 21:32.200\nLike Trisha, there's a dungeon at the Ziggurat.\n\n21:32.200 --> 21:36.200\nShe's like, I don't care.\n\n21:36.200 --> 21:39.200\nI need more burlap sex.\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:42.200\nI didn't know you could go shopping in D&D.\n\n21:42.200 --> 21:45.200\nYeah, I mean, you guys never do it, but I mean, you totally can.\n\n21:45.200 --> 21:51.200\nI build cities, but you guys don't use them.\n\n21:51.200 --> 21:52.200\nWait, you don't build cities?\n\n21:52.200 --> 21:54.200\nThere's always a path in a thing.\n\n21:54.200 --> 21:56.200\nYou were in a village once or twice.\n\n21:56.200 --> 21:57.200\nYeah.\n\n21:57.200 --> 22:00.200\nWe haven't been to town in like a city kind of sense, I wouldn't say.\n\n22:00.200 --> 22:01.200\nI don't know.\n\n22:01.200 --> 22:02.200\nHave we?\n\n22:02.200 --> 22:03.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n22:03.200 --> 22:05.200\nWe can really go anywhere and do anything.\n\n22:05.200 --> 22:07.200\nYeah, yeah, definitely.\n\n22:07.200 --> 22:09.200\nTo the eternal plane of fire.\n\n22:09.200 --> 22:13.200\nI'm having trouble deciding on something because I told you last week,\n\n22:13.200 --> 22:15.200\nand again, this one hasn't podcast yet,\n\n22:15.200 --> 22:18.200\nwhatever, edit out me talking about that because it gets so confusing.\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:24.200\nBut I told you last week that I've successfully sold, basically.\n\n22:24.200 --> 22:29.200\nI think I can say the word sold, the idea of doing the Dungeons & Dragons games\n\n22:29.200 --> 22:31.200\nand then recording the audio,\n\n22:31.200 --> 22:35.200\nand then we're going to have animators do stop motion guys acting out the action\n\n22:35.200 --> 22:37.200\nand then it'll be like a thing, like Web of Sodes.\n\n22:37.200 --> 22:44.200\nBut my dilemma is, do we stop doing D&D at Harmontown?\n\n22:44.200 --> 22:46.200\nWe could do a different campaign.\n\n22:46.200 --> 22:48.200\nWe could keep this campaign going here and do it again.\n\n22:48.200 --> 22:50.200\nWe'll figure it out, whatever.\n\n22:50.200 --> 22:52.200\nIt'll be cool, you guys.\n\n22:52.200 --> 22:57.200\nHow many people here would be fine with us not doing D&D here at Harmontown?\n\n22:57.200 --> 22:59.200\nIf it was like a separate thing.\n\n22:59.200 --> 23:02.200\nWhat if it was like a separate thing, though?\n\n23:02.200 --> 23:06.200\nYou don't hear a lot of hisses these days.\n\n23:06.200 --> 23:10.200\n1930s.\n\n23:10.200 --> 23:13.200\nMy self-esteem grew three sizes that day.\n\n23:13.200 --> 23:16.200\nYeah, you are really, you're the thing.\n\n23:16.200 --> 23:20.200\nHow many people are incredibly upset that we're not playing D&D tonight?\n\n23:20.200 --> 23:22.200\nAll right, well, I'll see.\n\n23:22.200 --> 23:25.200\nIt's all of your bluff, didn't I?\n\n23:25.200 --> 23:29.200\nIt's all fine and well to oppose change,\n\n23:29.200 --> 23:34.200\nbut when it comes time to pick up a picket sign.\n\n23:34.200 --> 23:39.200\nWe're trying to find someone to play Lord Busselot's father.\n\n23:39.200 --> 23:41.200\nSee, that was my big mistake.\n\n23:41.200 --> 23:43.200\nThis is the exciting thing about the tour.\n\n23:43.200 --> 23:46.200\nI feel like we should talk more about it next week\n\n23:46.200 --> 23:51.200\nbecause I contacted a filmmaker that made a very cool documentary.\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:53.200\nMaybe we could even have him as a guest next Monday.\n\n23:53.200 --> 23:56.200\nWait, what am I doing? I'm making everyone feel bad for not being here next week.\n\n23:56.200 --> 23:59.200\nWell, that sounds like a boring interview, though, doesn't it, filmmaker?\n\n23:59.200 --> 24:02.200\nAnyways, this guy did this really cool documentary\n\n24:02.200 --> 24:04.200\nand I called him and I said,\n\n24:04.200 --> 24:07.200\nlook, you're the first person I thought of doing this Harmontown tour.\n\n24:07.200 --> 24:09.200\nWhat if you came with? What if we made this road movie?\n\n24:09.200 --> 24:11.200\nHe's all excited about it.\n\n24:11.200 --> 24:14.200\nWe're going to sit down as soon as he gets back from New York.\n\n24:14.200 --> 24:19.200\nIt's going to be my point being that the fascinating thing is\n\n24:19.200 --> 24:24.200\nit's going to be a show about a show about a show about not knowing how to do a show.\n\n24:24.200 --> 24:27.200\nBecause what I have found out for sure,\n\n24:27.200 --> 24:31.200\nwe've been doing these things now for over a year\n\n24:31.200 --> 24:34.200\nand I know for certain, scientific certainty\n\n24:34.200 --> 24:38.200\nthat every time I try to plan something, it sucks.\n\n24:38.200 --> 24:44.200\nIt absolutely sucks and the only fun that we've ever had has been accidental.\n\n24:44.200 --> 24:46.200\nIt's uncanny.\n\n24:46.200 --> 24:49.200\nI don't remember anything that we've ever decided before the show\n\n24:49.200 --> 24:51.200\nthat yielded any gumdrops.\n\n24:51.200 --> 24:54.200\nWe've decided vague things like let's play D&D, but that was all...\n\n24:54.200 --> 24:57.200\nLet's dress as Jareth, but then I was in the green room\n\n24:57.200 --> 25:00.200\ntrying to memorize the song.\n\n25:00.200 --> 25:05.200\nAnd then I just come up here and I saw my baby, I don't...\n\n25:05.200 --> 25:07.200\nJump like magic, jump.\n\n25:07.200 --> 25:09.200\nYeah, I didn't...\n\n25:09.200 --> 25:11.200\nSo anyways...\n\n25:11.200 --> 25:17.200\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n25:17.200 --> 25:20.200\nSaw your mama yesterday, saw her today.\n\n25:20.200 --> 25:22.200\nFucked her in the straw, fucked her in the hay.\n\n25:22.200 --> 25:25.200\nFucked her in the barn, fucked her in the house,\n\n25:25.200 --> 25:26.200\nfucked her with a rat.\n\n25:26.200 --> 25:28.200\nDidn't fuck her with a mouse.\n\n25:28.200 --> 25:30.200\nThat was a mislead, you saw it coming.\n\n25:30.200 --> 25:33.200\nFucked your mama so hard, she started humming.\n\n25:33.200 --> 25:38.200\nHum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.\n\n25:38.200 --> 25:41.200\nWe like to fuck you.\n\n25:41.200 --> 25:43.200\nGotta have that part.\n\n25:47.200 --> 25:48.200\nSo we're...\n\n25:48.200 --> 25:49.200\nSpencer.\n\n25:49.200 --> 25:50.200\nWhat's up?\n\n25:50.200 --> 25:52.200\nI want you to rap, I want you to rap so bad.\n\n25:54.200 --> 25:56.200\nI wish I was good.\n\n25:56.200 --> 26:00.200\nYou've heard Harmon and he's amazing.\n\n26:00.200 --> 26:02.200\nOne thing that people...\n\n26:02.200 --> 26:04.200\nI saw people tweeting, like,\n\n26:04.200 --> 26:07.200\noh, you're gonna take Spencer along for the tour, right?\n\n26:07.200 --> 26:09.200\nBut it kind of makes no logical sense,\n\n26:09.200 --> 26:11.200\nbecause each audience would be...\n\n26:11.200 --> 26:13.200\nLike, we can't serialize the...\n\n26:13.200 --> 26:16.200\nWe could bring you along just to have you sit and do this.\n\n26:16.200 --> 26:18.200\nYou could just hold a metal axe and...\n\n26:18.200 --> 26:20.200\nI'm trying to help Harmontown, you know,\n\n26:20.200 --> 26:22.200\nif it helps me to be there, it's good.\n\n26:22.200 --> 26:24.200\nIf it helps me to not be there, it's good, I get it.\n\n26:24.200 --> 26:25.200\nIf you're coming on tour...\n\n26:25.200 --> 26:26.200\nI'm not egotistical.\n\n26:26.200 --> 26:28.200\nIf you're coming on tour with Spencer, and I would love that,\n\n26:28.200 --> 26:30.200\nI would fucking rap it.\n\n26:30.200 --> 26:32.200\nI could agree to that.\n\n26:32.200 --> 26:35.200\nWe'll pay for all your meals and room and board\n\n26:35.200 --> 26:40.200\nif you do a little rap at every show.\n\n26:40.200 --> 26:41.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n26:41.200 --> 26:43.200\nAll right.\n\n26:43.200 --> 26:45.200\nThat's what it will be.\n\n26:45.200 --> 26:47.200\nThere's a plan, we made a plan, so now it's gonna...\n\n26:47.200 --> 26:48.200\nI want to get...\n\n26:48.200 --> 26:50.200\nI mean, this is really presumptuous,\n\n26:50.200 --> 26:52.200\nand it's certainly not going to happen,\n\n26:52.200 --> 26:54.200\nbut it would be so cool if, like,\n\n26:54.200 --> 26:56.200\nas you go from town to town,\n\n26:56.200 --> 26:59.200\nwe go on this little jog and there's a couple kids following.\n\n26:59.200 --> 27:01.200\nBy the end of the tour, there's a bunch of people\n\n27:01.200 --> 27:04.200\non the steps jumping around and getting strong now.\n\n27:04.200 --> 27:06.200\nPeople want to just kind of follow us\n\n27:06.200 --> 27:09.200\nfrom a little club to club around the country.\n\n27:09.200 --> 27:10.200\nHarmon Heads.\n\n27:10.200 --> 27:13.200\nYou're talking about Harmon Heads.\n\n27:13.200 --> 27:15.200\nThey're different from Harmonians.\n\n27:15.200 --> 27:17.200\nIt's like Trekkers and Trekkies, you know?\n\n27:17.200 --> 27:18.200\nHarmon Heads are...\n\n27:18.200 --> 27:20.200\nThere's the angle of the documentary.\n\n27:20.200 --> 27:22.200\nYeah, that's the angle.\n\n27:22.200 --> 27:25.200\nSo, how's your brother?\n\n27:25.200 --> 27:29.200\nHe just got his blood test results back,\n\n27:29.200 --> 27:32.200\nand he's uncancorous, so it's all done.\n\n27:32.200 --> 27:33.200\nHe's good.\n\n27:33.200 --> 27:34.200\nYeah.\n\n27:34.200 --> 27:35.200\nAwesome.\n\n27:35.200 --> 27:38.200\nIt's crazy, because he had, like, four different types.\n\n27:38.200 --> 27:40.200\nOh, he's gonna be so glad I'm telling everyone this.\n\n27:40.200 --> 27:42.200\nHe had, like, four types of cancer at once,\n\n27:42.200 --> 27:43.200\nwhich is crazy.\n\n27:43.200 --> 27:44.200\nOh, really?\n\n27:44.200 --> 27:45.200\nI thought just one.\n\n27:45.200 --> 27:46.200\nIt was like he had three tumors,\n\n27:46.200 --> 27:48.200\nbut they represented cell types from four different...\n\n27:48.200 --> 27:49.200\nIt's crazy.\n\n27:49.200 --> 27:50.200\nWhenever people get cancer near you,\n\n27:50.200 --> 27:52.200\nyou become, like, a cancer expert.\n\n27:52.200 --> 27:53.200\nIt's like, awesome.\n\n27:53.200 --> 27:56.200\nBut, yeah, yeah, so he got a lot of different kinds of cancer,\n\n27:56.200 --> 27:58.200\nwhich means he was basically like a walking cancer factory\n\n27:58.200 --> 27:59.200\nfor a while.\n\n27:59.200 --> 28:00.200\nAnd, I mean, he's...\n\n28:00.200 --> 28:01.200\nIt's done.\n\n28:01.200 --> 28:03.200\nHe doesn't need chemo or anything.\n\n28:03.200 --> 28:04.200\nHe's minus a ball, you know?\n\n28:04.200 --> 28:06.200\nHe's living life and laughing easy.\n\n28:06.200 --> 28:11.200\nMinus a ball?\n\n28:11.200 --> 28:15.200\nYou walked over that one like it was nothing.\n\n28:15.200 --> 28:17.200\nIt's a light cost, considering.\n\n28:17.200 --> 28:18.200\nYeah, that's true.\n\n28:18.200 --> 28:19.200\nIt's pretty common.\n\n28:19.200 --> 28:21.200\nIt's the most common type, right, for men.\n\n28:21.200 --> 28:23.200\nOr am I getting that statistic wrong?\n\n28:23.200 --> 28:24.200\nIt's just...\n\n28:24.200 --> 28:29.200\nIt's the most for women.\n\n28:29.200 --> 28:33.200\nDid the doctors, like, say anything about...\n\n28:33.200 --> 28:34.200\nDid they tell him, like...\n\n28:34.200 --> 28:36.200\nFirst of all, is he going to mind us talking about...\n\n28:36.200 --> 28:39.200\nthat he had testicular cancer and had a ball removed?\n\n28:39.200 --> 28:40.200\nI don't care.\n\n28:40.200 --> 28:41.200\nOkay.\n\n28:41.200 --> 28:43.200\nYou're like me with my brother.\n\n28:43.200 --> 28:44.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n28:44.200 --> 28:45.200\nLet's exploit him.\n\n28:45.200 --> 28:46.200\nExcept you like your brother.\n\n28:46.200 --> 28:47.200\nYou want to hang out with him.\n\n28:47.200 --> 28:49.200\nYeah, no, he's cool, but I think he'd be fine with this.\n\n28:49.200 --> 28:51.200\nI mean, he'd be like, they're talking about me.\n\n28:51.200 --> 28:53.200\nSo did the doctors tell him when he got his...\n\n28:53.200 --> 28:55.200\nwhen they were telling him, like, this is what we're going to do?\n\n28:55.200 --> 28:57.200\nWhat's it called, the testectomy?\n\n28:57.200 --> 28:59.200\nWhat do they call that when you remove it?\n\n28:59.200 --> 29:01.200\nI don't know what they call it.\n\n29:01.200 --> 29:03.200\nI wasn't there, sorry.\n\n29:03.200 --> 29:06.200\nThey can't call it neutering.\n\n29:06.200 --> 29:07.200\nThat's not good.\n\n29:07.200 --> 29:10.200\nWell, that would be both of them, yeah.\n\n29:10.200 --> 29:14.200\nDid they tell him, like, is there an effect on your psychology?\n\n29:14.200 --> 29:18.200\nDo you become half a douche?\n\n29:18.200 --> 29:22.200\nDo you have more female friends because you're a better person?\n\n29:22.200 --> 29:24.200\nYou lose your balance a lot.\n\n29:24.200 --> 29:25.200\nReally?\n\n29:25.200 --> 29:28.200\nNo, no.\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:30.200\nYou crave pickles.\n\n29:30.200 --> 29:33.200\nOne of your vocal hordes tightens that gets higher voiced.\n\n29:33.200 --> 29:34.200\nI don't know.\n\n29:34.200 --> 29:36.200\nYeah, no, I mean, you don't really need them.\n\n29:36.200 --> 29:38.200\nLike, you could cut them off, you'd be fine.\n\n29:38.200 --> 29:40.200\nLike, they're just...\n\n29:40.200 --> 29:41.200\nThey're external.\n\n29:41.200 --> 29:47.200\nThey're like, it's not like going into a body and like pulling out the appendix and then reattaching stuff so it doesn't bleed to death.\n\n29:47.200 --> 29:49.200\nIt's like, snip, and then, you know...\n\n29:49.200 --> 29:51.200\nBut isn't that where all...\n\n29:51.200 --> 29:53.200\nThat's where all the testosterone is made.\n\n29:53.200 --> 29:55.200\nI mean, if you take the whole thing off, then you would...\n\n29:55.200 --> 29:59.200\nThen you're a eunuch, don't you become like docile, like a cat?\n\n29:59.200 --> 30:02.200\nI know nothing of testosterone production.\n\n30:02.200 --> 30:03.200\nWhat's that?\n\n30:03.200 --> 30:05.200\nI know nothing of testosterone production.\n\n30:05.200 --> 30:06.200\nBut I mean, you can...\n\n30:06.200 --> 30:07.200\nYeah, why would you have to?\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:08.200\nYou don't need both of them.\n\n30:08.200 --> 30:12.200\nLike, I mean, you can make semen and sperm and stuff with just the one.\n\n30:12.200 --> 30:13.200\nYou can.\n\n30:13.200 --> 30:15.200\nHe's been sure...\n\n30:15.200 --> 30:18.200\nHe's been sure he's always been shooting the left nut.\n\n30:18.200 --> 30:20.200\nSo, like, he's fine anyway.\n\n30:20.200 --> 30:21.200\nOkay, all right.\n\n30:23.200 --> 30:25.200\nThat's my fault.\n\n30:26.200 --> 30:28.200\nI shown the spotlight on that.\n\n30:28.200 --> 30:31.200\nI'm reaping the whirlwind right now.\n\n30:31.200 --> 30:32.200\nYou wanted to talk about it.\n\n30:32.200 --> 30:36.200\nI mean, it's certainly something that needs to be repped about.\n\n30:36.200 --> 30:37.200\nYo.\n\n30:38.200 --> 30:39.200\nYo.\n\n30:39.200 --> 30:40.200\nYo.\n\n30:41.200 --> 30:42.200\nYo.\n\n30:42.200 --> 30:43.200\nYo.\n\n30:43.200 --> 30:44.200\nDo you want me to...\n\n30:44.200 --> 30:45.200\nWhat?\n\n30:45.200 --> 30:46.200\nYo.\n\n30:46.200 --> 30:47.200\nYo.\n\n30:47.200 --> 30:48.200\nMy brother, Chris, has one ball.\n\n30:48.200 --> 30:49.200\nTake a step back.\n\n30:49.200 --> 30:50.200\nYou might just fall.\n\n30:50.200 --> 30:51.200\nIt...\n\n30:51.200 --> 30:52.200\nThat's all.\n\n30:52.200 --> 30:53.200\nI'm getting there.\n\n30:53.200 --> 30:54.200\nAll right.\n\n30:54.200 --> 30:55.200\nAll right.\n\n30:55.200 --> 30:56.200\nAll right.\n\n31:00.200 --> 31:02.200\nI mean, it's like...\n\n31:02.200 --> 31:03.200\nThat counts.\n\n31:03.200 --> 31:04.200\nI'm going to put it in.\n\n31:04.200 --> 31:05.200\nI'll be there, you know, in the future.\n\n31:05.200 --> 31:06.200\nAll right.\n\n31:06.200 --> 31:07.200\nThat was a lot of Spencer.\n\n31:07.200 --> 31:08.200\nSpencer, everyone.\n\n31:08.200 --> 31:10.200\nI'll also have a hand for Spencer for coming up.\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:11.200\nSorry, we didn't play D&D.\n\n31:11.200 --> 31:13.200\nWe'll give him a rest.\n\n31:13.200 --> 31:15.200\nWell, by the way, that's not why...\n\n31:15.200 --> 31:20.200\nI wanted to clarify that Spencer was lethargic last week, but that's not why there's no D&D\n\n31:20.200 --> 31:21.200\nthis week.\n\n31:21.200 --> 31:24.200\nHe's not on time out.\n\n31:24.200 --> 31:25.200\nIt's actually because...\n\n31:25.200 --> 31:29.700\nWell, this is an example of how my plans always fall apart.\n\n31:29.700 --> 31:34.800\nYou can see, if you listen to the episode a couple weeks ago, you can hear me crossing\n\n31:34.800 --> 31:38.200\nthat threshold toward the end of the show where I'm just too sloppy drunk.\n\n31:38.200 --> 31:43.200\nAnd I kind of like... I decide because we're going to visit my father in the D&D adventure.\n\n31:43.200 --> 31:45.200\nI'm like, it pops in my head.\n\n31:45.200 --> 31:47.200\nI go, I'm just going to lay all my cards on the table now.\n\n31:47.200 --> 31:48.200\nI go, oh, Eric Eidel.\n\n31:48.200 --> 31:53.200\nLet's get Eric Eidel to come to Harmontown because Jeff's hanging out with him and he's\n\n31:53.200 --> 31:56.200\nAdam Goldberg's buddy.\n\n31:56.200 --> 31:58.200\nAdam has his card.\n\n31:58.200 --> 32:03.200\nYeah, Adam got his card.\n\n32:03.200 --> 32:06.200\nEric Eidel.\n\n32:06.200 --> 32:11.200\nFormer Python, Gatabout, Foodie.\n\n32:11.200 --> 32:14.200\nWhat does he need a card for?\n\n32:14.200 --> 32:18.200\nAnyways, I was thinking, let's get him in here.\n\n32:18.200 --> 32:21.200\nEven though these guys are only 25, a nerd is a nerd.\n\n32:21.200 --> 32:23.200\nIt's like having Led Zeppelin in here.\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:26.200\nHe, over a bottle of wine, he's like, oh, I'd love to come down.\n\n32:26.200 --> 32:27.200\nWe'll sing some songs.\n\n32:27.200 --> 32:28.200\nYeah.\n\n32:28.200 --> 32:31.200\nHe's always threatening to come in with his guitar.\n\n32:31.200 --> 32:32.200\nBut I wanted to do that.\n\n32:32.200 --> 32:33.200\nSing like fucking classic.\n\n32:33.200 --> 32:37.200\nThey wrote new, if there's any Python fans out there, they wrote new lyrics, updated\n\n32:37.200 --> 32:40.200\nlyrics to the Galaxy Song, the universe song.\n\n32:40.200 --> 32:44.200\nWith Brian Cox, the guy who does the wonders of the universe, that kind of cool rock and\n\n32:44.200 --> 32:46.200\nroll physicist guy.\n\n32:46.200 --> 32:48.200\nThey've written the new Galaxy Song.\n\n32:48.200 --> 32:49.200\nIt's awesome.\n\n32:49.200 --> 32:50.200\nYeah.\n\n32:50.200 --> 32:51.200\nSo anyways, that popped in my head.\n\n32:51.200 --> 32:52.200\nSo there I am.\n\n32:52.200 --> 32:54.200\nYou can hear me if you rewind to that episode.\n\n32:54.200 --> 32:56.200\nYou can hear me mentally pining.\n\n32:56.200 --> 33:00.200\nAs I stopped the D&D game, I'm in a drunken stupor.\n\n33:00.200 --> 33:03.200\nI'm saying to Jeff, like, yeah, let's do that.\n\n33:03.200 --> 33:04.200\nWe should have a guest cameo.\n\n33:04.200 --> 33:06.200\nAnd he's like, yeah, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\n\n33:06.200 --> 33:07.200\nYeah.\n\n33:07.200 --> 33:11.200\nSo then the following week, you can hear a stalling because Eric couldn't do it.\n\n33:11.200 --> 33:12.200\nAnd then I think another way.\n\n33:12.200 --> 33:13.200\nAnd it's like this way.\n\n33:13.200 --> 33:14.200\nHe probably won't do it.\n\n33:14.200 --> 33:15.200\nHow about that?\n\n33:15.200 --> 33:16.200\nYeah, exactly.\n\n33:16.200 --> 33:17.200\nHe might, but he might.\n\n33:17.200 --> 33:19.200\nAnd also don't plan shit like Harmon.\n\n33:19.200 --> 33:20.200\nDon't do it.\n\n33:20.200 --> 33:21.200\nIt's stupid.\n\n33:21.200 --> 33:22.200\nIt's so dumb to try to.\n\n33:22.200 --> 33:24.200\nIt's like you try to grab a butterfly.\n\n33:24.200 --> 33:27.200\nFirst, one of two things is going to happen.\n\n33:27.200 --> 33:32.200\nYou do great and you just crush it to death or you blow it out of the way.\n\n33:32.200 --> 33:34.200\nYou know, when it goes away, like it's a fucking butterfly.\n\n33:34.200 --> 33:36.200\nJust let it be, you know, just hang on.\n\n33:36.200 --> 33:37.200\nThank you, ladies.\n\n33:37.200 --> 33:43.200\nI fucked your mama.\n\n33:43.200 --> 33:46.200\nSo then this week, it was one more time.\n\n33:46.200 --> 33:49.200\nI was like, oh, I think because Eric, Eric goes like maybe, maybe not.\n\n33:49.200 --> 33:54.200\nAnd then, and then so we're like, we had a guy on standby that was going to come in.\n\n33:54.200 --> 33:56.200\nOur friend Joe Unger hangs out at the drying room.\n\n33:56.200 --> 34:00.200\nBecause when you get to be my age, there's very few men who can play your father left\n\n34:00.200 --> 34:01.200\nin Los Angeles.\n\n34:01.200 --> 34:03.200\nWe're working as performers.\n\n34:03.200 --> 34:05.200\nSo what the other guy we could think of was Joe Unger.\n\n34:05.200 --> 34:06.200\nYeah, he'll be good.\n\n34:06.200 --> 34:07.200\nAt the drying room.\n\n34:07.200 --> 34:12.200\nAnd I think that might happen because I think he'd be a delight to have as a little character.\n\n34:12.200 --> 34:14.200\nYou will adore Joe Unger.\n\n34:14.200 --> 34:18.200\nBut at any rate, so he, then everything was like getting confused with schedule stuff.\n\n34:18.200 --> 34:20.200\nHe had a rap party he wanted to go to and blah, blah, blah.\n\n34:20.200 --> 34:23.200\nSo I called Spencer and I said, let's just forget it.\n\n34:23.200 --> 34:25.200\nBut the light, the silver lining is.\n\n34:25.200 --> 34:27.200\nIs that Spencer got up and wrapped?\n\n34:27.200 --> 34:33.200\nIs that, is that Spencer and I up till now have been communicating through Twitter direct messages.\n\n34:33.200 --> 34:35.200\nAnd today two things happened.\n\n34:35.200 --> 34:38.200\nOne, we fucked around with him all that, all that, all that much.\n\n34:38.200 --> 34:39.200\nAnd also I accidentally.\n\n34:39.200 --> 34:40.200\nYou fucked his mom.\n\n34:40.200 --> 34:43.200\nI accidentally public tweeted a DM to my DM.\n\n34:43.200 --> 34:48.200\nAnd so enough was enough.\n\n34:48.200 --> 34:50.200\nAnd I just gave him my phone number.\n\n34:50.200 --> 34:52.200\nSpencer and I have upgraded our relationship.\n\n34:52.200 --> 34:59.200\nWe are.\n\n34:59.200 --> 35:01.200\nYou're in my phone now.\n\n35:01.200 --> 35:03.200\nWe're the best of buds.\n\n35:03.200 --> 35:05.200\nI fucked your mama in the dirt and the mud.\n\n35:05.200 --> 35:06.200\nI fucked your salt.\n\n35:06.200 --> 35:08.200\nI fucked your pepper.\n\n35:08.200 --> 35:10.200\nI fucked your mama like a pig and a heifer.\n\n35:10.200 --> 35:11.200\nFucked her on the farm.\n\n35:11.200 --> 35:13.200\nFucked her in the city.\n\n35:13.200 --> 35:14.200\nRolled her in the dough.\n\n35:14.200 --> 35:16.200\nSqueezed all her titties.\n\n35:16.200 --> 35:18.200\nI drank her milk.\n\n35:18.200 --> 35:21.200\nFucked your mama soft to silk.\n\n35:21.200 --> 35:27.200\nOkay, that one went back into misogyny.\n\n35:27.200 --> 35:29.200\nYeah, I don't like the rolling in the dough thing.\n\n35:29.200 --> 35:31.200\nWell, she called her a heifer.\n\n35:31.200 --> 35:34.200\nYou kind of made her a farm animal.\n\n35:34.200 --> 35:37.200\nYou squeeze all of her titties and make her seem like, you know.\n\n35:37.200 --> 35:39.200\nOkay, I know how to make it.\n\n35:39.200 --> 35:40.200\nI know how to make it right.\n\n35:40.200 --> 35:42.200\nI know how to make it right.\n\n35:42.200 --> 35:46.200\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n35:46.200 --> 35:47.200\nI fucked your daddy.\n\n35:47.200 --> 35:49.200\nI sucked his dick.\n\n35:49.200 --> 35:51.200\nI cradled his balls till they made me sick.\n\n35:51.200 --> 35:52.200\nOh, shit.\n\n35:52.200 --> 35:54.200\nOh, so the song was over, sorry.\n\n35:54.200 --> 35:55.200\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n35:55.200 --> 35:59.200\nGod damn it.\n\n35:59.200 --> 36:04.200\nLadies and gentlemen, there are seven people who fucked your daddy in the world.\n\n36:04.200 --> 36:08.200\nYou are about to witness the eighth.\n\n36:08.200 --> 36:13.200\nYo, yo, who wants their daddy fucked tonight?\n\n36:13.200 --> 36:15.200\nYeah, I fucked your daddy.\n\n36:15.200 --> 36:16.200\nI nuzzled his nuts.\n\n36:16.200 --> 36:18.200\nI fucked his dick.\n\n36:18.200 --> 36:19.200\nI fucked his butt.\n\n36:19.200 --> 36:22.200\nI had him over to my house for dinner.\n\n36:22.200 --> 36:23.200\nI fucked your daddy.\n\n36:23.200 --> 36:24.200\nI'm a daddy fucking winner.\n\n36:24.200 --> 36:27.200\nI fucked your daddy on the roof of my house.\n\n36:27.200 --> 36:28.200\nI fucked your daddy.\n\n36:28.200 --> 36:32.200\nI wish I was his spouse, but it's not legal in most of the states.\n\n36:32.200 --> 36:34.200\nI fucked your daddy on his fine china plates.\n\n36:34.200 --> 36:36.200\nI fucked your daddy.\n\n36:36.200 --> 36:37.200\nI fucked him bad.\n\n36:37.200 --> 36:40.200\nI fucked your daddy while your mom was out.\n\n36:40.200 --> 36:42.200\nShe had a great afternoon.\n\n36:42.200 --> 36:45.200\nTotally rusted.\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:48.200\nShe came home and watched Homeland.\n\n36:48.200 --> 36:53.200\nI fucked your daddy.\n\n36:53.200 --> 36:57.200\nThere you go, ladies.\n\n36:57.200 --> 37:00.200\nIt's about time.\n\n37:00.200 --> 37:03.200\nObama won, you know?\n\n37:03.200 --> 37:06.200\nAnd as rude as the treatment might have been for that daddy,\n\n37:06.200 --> 37:14.200\nyou at least were sensitive enough to nuzzle his nuts.\n\n37:14.200 --> 37:17.200\nSpencer, we're sorry about your brother.\n\n37:17.200 --> 37:22.200\nBut sometimes you need two nuts to get nuzzled.\n\n37:22.200 --> 37:25.200\nNuzzle his meditation balls.\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:28.200\nIt's nice, not alliteration.\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:29.200\nConsonance?\n\n37:29.200 --> 37:30.200\nNuzzle his nuts?\n\n37:30.200 --> 37:31.200\nIt's good.\n\n37:31.200 --> 37:32.200\nNuzzle his alliteration?\n\n37:32.200 --> 37:33.200\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n37:33.200 --> 37:34.200\nTintinabulation.\n\n37:34.200 --> 37:39.200\nAll right, Vincent Price is here.\n\n37:39.200 --> 37:43.200\nYes, thank you for saying my favorite word.\n\n37:43.200 --> 37:45.200\nThe tintinabulation.\n\n37:45.200 --> 37:50.200\nWait, the woman that has booed you and...\n\n37:50.200 --> 37:54.200\nThis is a very tempestuous relationship.\n\n37:54.200 --> 37:57.200\nYeah, it seems like a free radical back there.\n\n37:57.200 --> 37:59.200\nRemember when we were in some car or something,\n\n37:59.200 --> 38:02.200\nwe were talking about what if Vincent Price did more bridges\n\n38:02.200 --> 38:04.200\nand more songs?\n\n38:04.200 --> 38:08.200\nInstead of just thriller, we were doing Vincent Price\n\n38:08.200 --> 38:12.200\ndoing his talking bridges for other songs.\n\n38:12.200 --> 38:14.200\nIt was like...\n\n38:14.200 --> 38:15.200\nHow's that going to work?\n\n38:15.200 --> 38:17.200\nYou can go out of a Fuck Your Daddy rap\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:19.200\nand then have Vincent Price.\n\n38:19.200 --> 38:22.200\nWe're starting from the top, though.\n\n38:22.200 --> 38:24.200\nAll right, so this is Fuck Your Daddy rap\n\n38:24.200 --> 38:26.200\nwith Vincent Price doing a breakdown.\n\n38:26.200 --> 38:28.200\nDoing a breakdown.\n\n38:28.200 --> 38:31.200\nWe're planning now, so it's going to fall apart.\n\n38:31.200 --> 38:32.200\nNo, it's going to be good.\n\n38:32.200 --> 38:33.200\nIt's going to be a goodie.\n\n38:33.200 --> 38:37.200\nMC Daddy Fucker!\n\n38:37.200 --> 38:40.200\nYo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n38:40.200 --> 38:42.200\nSee a lot of people in the house\n\n38:42.200 --> 38:45.200\ndescended from paternal lineage.\n\n38:45.200 --> 38:48.200\nWell, I got news for you.\n\n38:48.200 --> 38:50.200\nHere's what I'm going to do.\n\n38:50.200 --> 38:52.200\nI fucked your daddy in the house of the sky.\n\n38:52.200 --> 38:54.200\nI fucked your daddy like Apple Pie.\n\n38:54.200 --> 38:56.200\nIt's the American way.\n\n38:56.200 --> 38:58.200\nObama's new land.\n\n38:58.200 --> 39:00.200\nI fucked your daddy in the palm of a hand\n\n39:00.200 --> 39:03.200\nat a giant, in a giant world.\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:06.200\nI fucked your daddy like he was a girl, lovingly.\n\n39:06.200 --> 39:08.200\nI caressed his ass.\n\n39:08.200 --> 39:10.200\nI fucked your daddy at the head of the class.\n\n39:10.200 --> 39:13.200\nHoward Hessman was watching the thing.\n\n39:13.200 --> 39:16.200\nI fucked your daddy till he started to sing.\n\n39:16.200 --> 39:21.200\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.\n\n39:21.200 --> 39:26.200\nDarkness descends on your father's asshole.\n\n39:26.200 --> 39:31.200\nA million penises go inside of it.\n\n39:31.200 --> 39:34.200\nA hurricane of semen.\n\n39:34.200 --> 39:39.200\nA swirling in his brown rectum.\n\n39:39.200 --> 39:42.200\nHe will not love again.\n\n39:42.200 --> 39:44.200\nI fucked your daddy on the roof of the house of the sky.\n\n39:44.200 --> 39:47.200\nI fucked your daddy and he didn't know why.\n\n39:47.200 --> 39:49.200\nI fucked your daddy in both of his eyes.\n\n39:49.200 --> 39:52.200\nI fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.\n\n39:52.200 --> 39:55.200\nI fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.\n\n39:55.200 --> 39:58.200\nI fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.\n\n39:58.200 --> 40:00.200\nI fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.\n\n40:00.200 --> 40:05.200\nI fucked your daddy till he said goodbye.\n\n40:06.200 --> 40:09.200\nIs there a tissue back there?\n\n40:09.200 --> 40:11.200\nI'm crying.\n\n40:11.200 --> 40:15.200\nI was in the fetal position on the stage at one point.\n\n40:15.200 --> 40:18.200\nI feel like Vincent Price can do better than that.\n\n40:18.200 --> 40:23.200\nFor future efforts, he is just sort of graphic and brown sperm.\n\n40:23.200 --> 40:25.120\nYou're supposed to wax poetic.\n\n40:25.120 --> 40:27.200\nThe whole point is that the guy from the street\n\n40:27.200 --> 40:28.760\nlays it on the line and then you come in\n\n40:28.760 --> 40:31.920\nand give it an air of erudite, like.\n\n40:31.920 --> 40:32.760\nYeah.\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:35.040\nI think Vincent could have maybe dealt a little bit more\n\n40:35.040 --> 40:37.360\nwith the fact that you fucked someone's daddy\n\n40:37.360 --> 40:39.080\nand the palm of a giant's hand.\n\n40:39.080 --> 40:44.200\nThat's getting late.\n\n40:44.200 --> 40:45.200\nYeah.\n\n40:45.200 --> 40:47.000\nThat's how you know you've fucked someone\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nand has had sex with me.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.000\nSomeone has had a giant.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:52.600\nI don't know you've been fucked.\n\n40:52.600 --> 40:54.600\nYeah.\n\n40:54.600 --> 40:55.100\nAll right.\n\n40:55.100 --> 40:56.920\nThat was fucking good.\n\n40:56.920 --> 40:57.920\nYeah.\n\n40:57.920 --> 41:00.600\nWe should press some vinyl, man.\n\n41:00.600 --> 41:01.680\nEnough is enough.\n\n41:01.680 --> 41:02.680\nYeah.\n\n41:02.680 --> 41:03.180\nNo.\n\n41:03.180 --> 41:05.160\nWe're going to go find some vinyl.\n\n41:05.160 --> 41:06.040\nYou could have a record.\n\n41:06.040 --> 41:06.540\nYeah.\n\n41:06.540 --> 41:07.280\nYou could have a record.\n\n41:07.280 --> 41:08.320\nWe're going to do it.\n\n41:08.320 --> 41:10.720\niTunes, direct.\n\n41:10.720 --> 41:13.600\nJust fucking fucked your mama on the A side,\n\n41:13.600 --> 41:14.880\nfucked your daddy on the B side.\n\n41:14.880 --> 41:17.040\nLike it's like a theme album.\n\n41:17.040 --> 41:20.200\nIt's like each track has a sibling track.\n\n41:20.200 --> 41:22.000\nAnd then there's all these liner notes\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:25.880\nabout street culture.\n\n41:25.880 --> 41:27.600\nI'll hire somebody to write that.\n\n41:30.600 --> 41:34.960\nSpeaking of subcontracting, you aren't here in the green room\n\n41:34.960 --> 41:35.760\ntoday.\n\n41:35.760 --> 41:37.400\nIt's a little bit of an awkward experience,\n\n41:37.400 --> 41:39.560\nspeaking of relationships being upgraded.\n\n41:39.560 --> 41:42.040\nSpencer's is my choice, of course, as I decided.\n\n41:42.040 --> 41:45.600\nThen there's Adam Goldberg, who upgrades our relationship\n\n41:45.600 --> 41:48.160\nat his discretion.\n\n41:48.160 --> 41:51.040\nHe took a new step today.\n\n41:51.040 --> 41:53.720\nHe was outside the green room, and I came to the green room.\n\n41:53.720 --> 41:57.560\nI walked in, and I left the green room door open,\n\n41:57.560 --> 41:59.800\nbecause I didn't want to close it on his face.\n\n41:59.800 --> 42:00.920\nI was just going to the fridge.\n\n42:00.920 --> 42:02.880\nAnd he walked in, and he started pitching me\n\n42:02.880 --> 42:06.160\na little segment that he wants to do.\n\n42:06.160 --> 42:08.040\nAnd he was in the green room.\n\n42:08.040 --> 42:09.760\nBut he did after a while.\n\n42:09.760 --> 42:12.680\nHe called McGathey's game quarter?\n\n42:12.680 --> 42:17.080\nHe said, yeah, Adam Goldberg has a segment that he wants to do.\n\n42:17.080 --> 42:19.320\nI think that he has provided for Harmontown as much\n\n42:19.320 --> 42:21.520\nas he's taken away, perhaps.\n\n42:21.520 --> 42:22.080\nOh, certainly.\n\n42:22.080 --> 42:23.440\nHe's provided more, certainly.\n\n42:23.440 --> 42:29.000\nI think the benefit is I'll wait the cost of having him around.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:33.280\nAnd he did eventually, after he said his piece,\n\n42:33.280 --> 42:37.920\nmy silence as I poured my vodka, he waited just before I\n\n42:37.920 --> 42:39.920\nhad to say it, and he kind of excused himself\n\n42:39.920 --> 42:40.920\nand left the green room.\n\n42:40.920 --> 42:42.640\nSo that's good.\n\n42:42.640 --> 42:44.040\nWe should reward that behavior.\n\n42:44.040 --> 42:46.240\nOh.\n\n42:46.240 --> 42:48.360\nThat didn't go the direction I thought it was going to go.\n\n42:48.360 --> 42:52.920\nNo, no, he's not on the bottom of my car right now.\n\n42:52.920 --> 42:58.440\nHe's still keeping himself within certain boundaries,\n\n42:58.440 --> 43:01.360\nI think, and providing us with a lot of pleasure\n\n43:01.360 --> 43:02.360\nand fascination.\n\n43:02.360 --> 43:04.480\nAnd also, we just don't know if you\n\n43:04.480 --> 43:06.360\ndon't give him what he wants.\n\n43:06.360 --> 43:08.240\nAnd then there's an incident that involves,\n\n43:08.240 --> 43:11.560\nI don't know, a tower and a rifle.\n\n43:11.560 --> 43:14.120\nWho do we have to blame but ourselves?\n\n43:14.120 --> 43:15.960\nWho can say that we didn't see it coming?\n\n43:15.960 --> 43:19.400\nWho can say that we don't have 16 episodes of recording sessions?\n\n43:19.400 --> 43:23.560\nHe's over there stroking his little proto beard.\n\n43:23.560 --> 43:25.880\nAll right, let's bring Adam Goldberg up for the Adam Goldberg\n\n43:25.880 --> 43:28.240\nsegment.\n\n43:28.240 --> 43:31.480\nThat's all we'll call it.\n\n43:31.480 --> 43:33.720\nYo, yo, yo.\n\n43:33.720 --> 43:36.200\nAdam Goldberg here with a dick situation.\n\n43:36.200 --> 43:38.800\nMy parents have been fucked and due to strangulation.\n\n43:38.800 --> 43:40.400\nThey weren't able to speak, but you know,\n\n43:40.400 --> 43:44.040\nthey'd have said, Dan Harmon, you're better red than this.\n\n43:44.040 --> 43:46.400\nSometimes the librarian needs to squeeze,\n\n43:46.400 --> 43:49.360\nand that's true in here with an internal rhyme freeze.\n\n43:49.360 --> 43:50.360\nHey, this isn't the segment.\n\n43:50.360 --> 43:51.800\nI'm just being coy.\n\n43:51.800 --> 43:54.400\nDan needs to get parents fucked on your boy.\n\n43:54.400 --> 43:55.400\nYeah, that's the price.\n\n43:55.400 --> 43:56.160\nOh, that's the price.\n\n43:56.160 --> 43:56.660\nOh.\n\n43:59.680 --> 44:01.840\nAnother situation from the nerdy boy.\n\n44:01.840 --> 44:05.160\nHe had a lot of words, and he said, oh, and Dan\n\n44:05.160 --> 44:07.040\nwent to parents, and that was said.\n\n44:07.040 --> 44:09.800\nAnd parents went with Dan, and all three went to bed.\n\n44:09.800 --> 44:12.360\nOh, creepy.\n\n44:12.360 --> 44:15.800\nDevelopmental disorder.\n\n44:15.800 --> 44:20.240\nDescended on your stage in a real form.\n\n44:20.240 --> 44:23.240\nThe inability to recognize social cues.\n\n44:26.080 --> 44:28.920\nFlocking like a hurricane of brown semen.\n\n44:28.920 --> 44:29.440\nI'm

Price.\n\n44:35.520 --> 44:38.000\nA hurricane can flock?\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:41.680\nListen, Vincent Price has been dead a long time.\n\n44:41.680 --> 44:47.400\nIt's not helping his mad science dropping.\n\n44:47.400 --> 44:50.840\nAll right, solid, solid, solid, solid, solid.\n\n44:50.840 --> 44:54.040\nBack to the parent fucking well on this one.\n\n44:54.040 --> 44:56.360\nThat went parent fucking well when we went back.\n\n44:56.360 --> 44:58.840\nWere you sitting there kind of writing a little bit\n\n44:58.840 --> 44:59.320\nin your head?\n\n44:59.320 --> 45:00.840\nYou were

California,\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:51.680\nmy hometown.\n\n45:51.680 --> 45:52.760\nWait, so you're not pitching the bid.\n\n45:52.760 --> 45:53.480\nYou're actually going to do the bid.\n\n45:53.480 -->

me.\n\n45:58.120 --> 46:00.720\nI was so distracted by the social nervousness of like,\n\n46:00.720 --> 46:02.160\nAdam Goldberg's in the green room,\n\n46:02.160 --> 46:03.800\nand he's just pitching

team\n\n47:21.640 --> 47:22.880\nis notoriously bad at math.\n\n47:22.880 --> 47:25.320\nThat's why they had to acrobatics.\n\n47:25.320 --> 47:26.440\nThis might not be apropos.\n\n47:26.440 --> 47:28.480\nIt might not be fitting.\n\n47:28.480 --> 47:29.760\nI'm going to go Tiki on this one.\n\n47:29.760 --> 47:31.880\nSo here you are.\n\n47:31.880 --> 47:33.200\nNo, no, no, no,

47:41.760\nAutumn has come to Lake Harmontown,\n\n47:41.760 --> 47:44.960\ndropping the thermostat to a frosty 62 degrees.\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:47.040\nYou sometimes have to wear a sweater if you go out at night,\n\n47:47.040 --> 47:49.680\nwhich is bothersome for the more athletic among us.\n\n47:49.680 --> 47:51.880\nJeff Davis, Comptroller Jeff Davis,\n\n47:51.880 --> 47:54.320\nis even considering turning on the heated as apartment,\n\n47:54.320 --> 47:58.280\nbut instead had them send over another batch of girls.\n\n47:58.280 --> 48:02.600\nJeff Davis, a fabulous good sport, recently won the world\n\n48:02.600 --> 48:04.920\nrecord for saying, I don't normally say this to girls,\n\n48:04.920 --> 48:07.720\nbut you know, he may not have to touch that thermostat\n\n48:07.720 --> 48:08.320\nuntil spring.\n\n48:10.960 --> 48:13.080\nThis week is Thanksgiving, an important time for Lake Harmon.\n\n48:13.080 --> 48:14.080\nIs this fan fiction?\n\n48:14.080 --> 48:18.080\nLike, uh, it should have been like a slashing.\n\n48:18.080 --> 48:19.360\nMonday night is erotic fan fiction.\n\n48:19.360 --> 48:22.440\nIs this Harmon's famous slash?\n\n48:22.440 --> 48:23.240\nIt's going that way.\n\n48:23.240 --> 48:24.920\nYeah.\n\n48:24.920 --> 48:29.640\nBut it's actually Dan slash Jeff's dad slash.\n\n48:29.640 --> 48:32.400\nOh, right, of course, yeah, Dan's been fucking\n\n48:32.400 --> 48:33.800\nmy dad and my mom for years.\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:34.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n48:34.360 --> 48:36.120\nAll right, sorry, continue.\n\n48:36.120 --> 48:38.120\nThis week is Thanksgiving, an important week\n\n48:38.120 --> 48:39.720\nfor Lake Harmonians, all of them who\n\n48:39.720 --> 48:42.400\ncan't afford plane tickets home or putting their $10\n\n48:42.400 --> 48:45.120\non the barrel, frantically Facebooking before the show,\n\n48:45.120 --> 48:47.560\ntrying to find out which dinner party to attend.\n\n48:47.560 --> 48:49.400\nFedora was talking to Cheruse earlier,\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:51.200\nwondering if it's worth driving to Santa Monica\n\n48:51.200 --> 48:53.960\nto avoid having to make her own cranberry sauce.\n\n48:53.960 --> 48:58.480\nHe says it is if she can avoid the taking the 405.\n\n48:58.480 --> 49:00.120\nIt's a time of change for Harmonians.\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:03.600\nThey're wondering if they're going to colonize the moon this year.\n\n49:03.600 --> 49:06.560\nAnd if Jeff Blue will do the flight refunds,\n\n49:06.560 --> 49:08.000\neveryone's planning a Christmas.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:11.280\nI don't have the same garrulous, joyful voice that he does.\n\n49:11.280 --> 49:12.880\nBut I think this is going pretty well.\n\n49:12.880 --> 49:15.000\nYou're doing wonderfully.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:18.960\nWell, this much material at his pace would be like, you know.\n\n49:18.960 --> 49:20.000\nHe goes 50 minutes.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:25.400\nI'm going to get this under 150, minus self-comments.\n\n49:25.400 --> 49:27.440\nThey're wondering if they're going to colonize the moon\n\n49:27.440 --> 49:27.960\nthis year.\n\n49:27.960 --> 49:29.840\nAnd if Jeff Blue will do flight refunds,\n\n49:29.840 --> 49:31.360\nif that's the case.\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:34.000\nEveryone's planning a Christmas return to their colder states,\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:37.160\nunless it becomes really crazy in post for Wolverine.\n\n49:37.160 --> 49:38.960\nPeople are really putting their hopes up\n\n49:38.960 --> 49:40.280\nafter X-Men First Class.\n\n49:40.280 --> 49:42.000\nThey're saying it did a lot right that movie.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.360\nIt did a lot right.\n\n49:44.360 --> 49:47.400\nIt's time for winter coffee here in Harmontown.\n\n49:47.400 --> 49:49.720\nAll the new flavors of coffee are in the one with mint,\n\n49:49.720 --> 49:53.200\nwinter mint, peppermint, coffee cans, and coffee meetings,\n\n49:53.200 --> 49:56.200\nwhich aren't officially business or dating or anything\n\n49:56.200 --> 49:56.700\nreally.\n\n49:56.700 --> 49:59.400\nIt can be quite fun until one person or another says\n\n49:59.400 --> 50:01.240\nthe word so.\n\n50:01.240 --> 50:05.320\nOr, I know why we're both here, or offers to buy lunch.\n\n50:05.320 --> 50:07.480\nThen there's that one-on-one aspect to them.\n\n50:07.480 --> 50:09.080\nIf there's three people, you can check\n\n50:09.080 --> 50:11.360\nto see if you've got any Facebook friend invites.\n\n50:11.360 --> 50:13.400\nBut with two, that's a sign of rudeness.\n\n50:13.400 --> 50:17.760\nCoffee is a tricky thing in Harmontown, at least to drink.\n\n50:17.760 --> 50:18.320\nPage two.\n\n50:18.320 --> 50:22.440\nIn the second page.\n\n50:22.440 --> 50:24.920\nOne Armenian face was putting $20\n\n50:24.920 --> 50:27.960\ninto a broke friend's gas tank in Glendale, as one does.\n\n50:27.960 --> 50:30.480\nAnd got a call to meet in Studio City.\n\n50:30.480 --> 50:32.080\nGot right back in his car and drove\n\n50:32.080 --> 50:34.040\nto meet someone for what wasn't a business meeting,\n\n50:34.040 --> 50:36.480\nbut rather a guilt trip on taking too long to get\n\n50:36.480 --> 50:39.120\nfrom Glendale to Studio City.\n\n50:39.120 --> 50:40.120\nAnd it started to rain.\n\n50:40.120 --> 50:43.120\nDan, what do you want to do later on after the show?\n\n50:43.120 --> 50:45.520\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n50:45.520 --> 50:47.840\nAnd it started to rain when he was driving, the first time\n\n50:47.840 --> 50:50.040\nat Rainton Lodge in Angeles this autumn.\n\n50:50.040 --> 50:52.640\nWhen he got there, Jace was hurrying for taking so long,\n\n50:52.640 --> 50:55.760\nas it's assumed that Glendale and Studio City are adjacent.\n\n50:55.760 --> 50:59.120\nAnd rain doesn't slow down LA traffic uncontrollably.\n\n50:59.120 --> 51:01.320\nOr that he can be available in zero minutes time\n\n51:01.320 --> 51:03.480\nfor not even a business meeting, just an offer\n\n51:03.480 --> 51:05.400\nto potentially maybe help a pitch for a pilot\n\n51:05.400 --> 51:07.000\nhe was jerked around during.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:08.600\nThis meeting went predictably terribly,\n\n51:08.600 --> 51:11.480\nthe way we're all hoping the new Wolverine doesn't.\n\n51:11.480 --> 51:14.200\nThere's a whole lot in line for the franchise.\n\n51:14.200 --> 51:16.320\nAnd it rained a lot on Lake Harmontown in general.\n\n51:16.320 --> 51:18.000\nPeople stood in torrential line Sunday\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:19.960\nfor buying Squeebsquab.\n\n51:19.960 --> 51:22.520\nWet, but definitely worth it, but definitely wet.\n\n51:22.520 --> 51:24.760\nAnd Jace was tempted to think about the squeaky windshield\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:27.040\nwiper on his car, the goldsmobile.\n\n51:27.040 --> 51:28.200\nBut he's waiting on some money.\n\n51:28.200 --> 51:30.280\nYou know, if it gets down to 50 degrees,\n\n51:30.280 --> 51:32.600\nhe may need to buy a winter jacket.\n\n51:32.600 --> 51:35.240\nThat's the news from Lake Harmontown, California,\n\n51:35.240 --> 51:37.320\nmy hometown, where the men are handsome,\n\n51:37.320 --> 51:40.200\nand the women are mostly Aaron.\n\n51:40.200 --> 51:41.320\nAll right.\n\n51:41.320 --> 51:42.160\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n51:45.760 --> 51:47.240\nAll right.\n\n51:47.240 --> 51:49.240\nYeah.\n\n51:49.240 --> 51:51.240\nOh.\n\n51:51.240 --> 51:55.960\nHe's ripping up his segment.\n\n51:55.960 --> 51:58.000\nWe got some humanity out of him.\n\n51:58.000 --> 51:59.360\nBack to the tower.\n\n52:03.440 --> 52:07.160\nThis guy strategically up and gone.\n\n52:07.160 --> 52:09.440\nI wasn't going to say anything when you left at the beginning.\n\n52:09.440 --> 52:10.960\nDid you get a grilled cheese?\n\n52:10.960 --> 52:12.600\nOh, yeah.\n\n52:12.600 --> 52:14.200\nI hate Adam Goldberg.\n\n52:14.200 --> 52:15.000\nYou broke my heart.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.040\nI was like, where's he going?\n\n52:16.040 --> 52:17.280\nHe paid the meter in times.\n\n52:17.280 --> 52:22.040\nAll right, Adam Goldberg, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n52:22.040 --> 52:23.040\nWoo!\n\n52:27.040 --> 52:29.040\nLove him or hate him?\n\n52:32.040 --> 52:33.040\nOr in my case?\n\n52:33.040 --> 52:34.040\nDo both.\n\n52:36.040 --> 52:37.040\nI don't hate you.\n\n52:37.040 --> 52:38.040\nI don't love you.\n\n52:38.040 --> 52:41.040\nA human coin landing on its edge every week.\n\n52:41.040 --> 52:43.040\nI just don't know.\n\n52:43.040 --> 52:45.040\nIs he the villain or am I the villain?\n\n52:45.040 --> 52:46.040\nWhat is it?\n\n52:46.040 --> 52:53.040\nIt's like a mirror in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a.\n\n52:53.040 --> 52:55.040\nIn a seat cucumber.\n\n52:55.040 --> 52:56.040\nYeah.\n\n52:56.040 --> 53:01.040\nWait, did the no lady, did you, was that commentary from the no lady?\n\n53:01.040 --> 53:02.040\nThat's all right.\n\n53:02.040 --> 53:03.040\nNo lady.\n\n53:03.040 --> 53:05.040\nDo you want to come up here and, OK.\n\n53:07.040 --> 53:08.040\nNo, she says.\n\n53:08.040 --> 53:09.040\nIt makes sense.\n\n53:09.040 --> 53:10.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n53:10.040 --> 53:11.040\nWhy would she?\n\n53:11.040 --> 53:12.040\nWhy would she be called no lady?\n\n53:12.040 --> 53:13.040\nYeah.\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:16.040\nDon't ask her yes or no questions.\n\n53:18.040 --> 53:20.040\nHow would you feel about coming up on stage right now?\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:21.040\nOh, no lady.\n\n53:21.040 --> 53:24.040\nYou could do, you could do a no rap.\n\n53:24.040 --> 53:25.040\nYou could rap at Vincent Price.\n\n53:25.040 --> 53:26.040\nYeah.\n\n53:26.040 --> 53:27.040\nYou could get a lot off your chest.\n\n53:27.040 --> 53:28.040\nWoo!\n\n53:28.040 --> 53:30.040\nIt sounds like you, you got a lot, you got a lot in your mind back there.\n\n53:30.040 --> 53:34.040\nNo, no, no lady is the voice I hear in my head when I do everything.\n\n53:34.040 --> 53:35.040\nEverything.\n\n53:35.040 --> 53:42.040\nNo, no, no lady is, is the, the, the thing I have to overcome in order to treat good women nice.\n\n53:42.040 --> 53:48.040\nLike, like, they're always, I'm constantly punishing women for a voice in my head that's\n\n53:48.040 --> 53:51.040\ncoming from my mother or something that's like disapproving.\n\n53:51.040 --> 53:55.040\nYou know, it's like, like, that's where misogyny starts is you put women on a pedestal.\n\n53:55.040 --> 54:01.040\nYou're like either you, you acknowledge their power over you and then, but the women don't\n\n54:01.040 --> 54:04.040\nrealize that that's where it starts or they do and they don't care because why should\n\n54:04.040 --> 54:05.040\nyou have to care?\n\n54:05.040 --> 54:09.040\nLike, like, but by the time the guy opens his mouth, he's on step three, which is getting\n\n54:09.040 --> 54:10.040\neven with you.\n\n54:10.040 --> 54:12.040\nAnd it makes, it makes no sense.\n\n54:12.040 --> 54:15.040\nYou're just hearing this horrible thing and he's like high-fiving himself and his friends\n\n54:15.040 --> 54:17.040\nbecause it's like, yeah, we did it.\n\n54:17.040 --> 54:19.040\nToday we, we took back the night.\n\n54:19.040 --> 54:22.040\nIt's like, no, you terrorized me.\n\n54:22.040 --> 54:24.040\nI, I, I am a vulnerable person.\n\n54:24.040 --> 54:29.040\nI'm capable of, of, of, of emotionally fulfilling you and you hate me for it.\n\n54:29.040 --> 54:33.040\nUm, score some points with the ladies tonight, I think.\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:35.040\nUm, no.\n\n54:35.040 --> 54:40.040\nShut up, mom.\n\n54:40.040 --> 54:44.040\nUh, um, what do we do?\n\n54:44.040 --> 54:46.040\nWhat do we got left to talk about?\n\n54:46.040 --> 54:47.040\nI mean, as if we had a list.\n\n54:47.040 --> 54:51.040\nWe really, really came up empty tonight, but, uh, had, had some good times.\n\n54:51.040 --> 54:54.040\nI'm still reeling from the, uh, from the Vincent Price wrap.\n\n54:54.040 --> 54:55.040\nYeah.\n\n54:55.040 --> 54:56.040\nIt's cool.\n\n54:56.040 --> 54:57.040\nYeah.\n\n54:57.040 --> 54:58.040\nYeah.\n\n54:58.040 --> 54:59.040\nIt was really cool.\n\n54:59.040 --> 55:00.040\nWe've given these people a lot, a lot of show.\n\n55:00.040 --> 55:01.040\nA lot of show tonight.\n\n55:01.040 --> 55:02.040\nYou guys really,\n\n55:02.040 --> 55:03.040\nWhat have we learned tonight?\n\n55:03.040 --> 55:06.040\nUh, uh, God damn it.\n\n55:06.040 --> 55:08.040\nI know there's, I know there's, I know there's one more thing to do.\n\n55:08.040 --> 55:09.040\nAll right.\n\n55:09.040 --> 55:10.040\nWell, let's do, let's see.\n\n55:10.040 --> 55:11.040\nWe did this last week.\n\n55:11.040 --> 55:12.040\nAre you having a heart attack?\n\n55:12.040 --> 55:13.040\nI'm just burping.\n\n55:13.040 --> 55:14.040\nI'm just burping.\n\n55:14.040 --> 55:16.040\nI had hummus for lunch.\n\n55:16.040 --> 55:18.040\nIt's not charismatic.\n\n55:18.040 --> 55:19.040\nThat was terrifying.\n\n55:19.040 --> 55:21.040\nAre you going to take your business elsewhere?\n\n55:21.040 --> 55:23.040\nI had hummus for lunch.\n\n55:23.040 --> 55:24.040\nUh, yeah.\n\n55:24.040 --> 55:29.040\nWho's, who's, who's, who's, who's, who's feeling, who's feeling vulnerable.\n\n55:29.040 --> 55:31.040\nWho's feeling, who's feeling in transition.\n\n55:31.040 --> 55:34.040\nWho's feeling, who's feeling like they need, they need support.\n\n55:34.040 --> 55:35.040\nOkay.\n\n55:35.040 --> 55:38.040\nWe've got a, we've got a guy raising up the back of his hand.\n\n55:38.040 --> 55:39.040\nRight.\n\n55:39.040 --> 55:40.040\nCome on.\n\n55:40.040 --> 55:41.040\nDo you want to come up here?\n\n55:41.040 --> 55:46.040\nThat's why I'm asking.\n\n55:46.040 --> 55:48.040\nWe experiment last week, which hasn't aired yet.\n\n55:48.040 --> 55:55.040\nI read some of my journal from when I was like 15 and it created a very strange emotional\n\n55:55.040 --> 55:57.040\nvacuum in the room.\n\n55:57.040 --> 56:00.040\nUh, it wasn't like the audience was having a bad time, but it was like, it was very\n\n56:00.040 --> 56:04.040\nlike, it was very like raw, not raw, like, oh, what an awesome journal.\n\n56:04.040 --> 56:07.040\nIt was like, it was like, it just created, it just made us all feel 15 again.\n\n56:07.040 --> 56:11.040\nAnd then Spencer could barely roll his dice and everything just went a little, a little\n\n56:11.040 --> 56:12.040\nhaywire.\n\n56:12.040 --> 56:13.040\nIt went a little adolescent.\n\n56:13.040 --> 56:17.040\nAnd then our friend in the audience, Jesus Diaz, Jesus, are you here tonight?\n\n56:17.040 --> 56:18.040\nOkay.\n\n56:18.040 --> 56:20.040\nJesus, he's sitting a little further back tonight.\n\n56:20.040 --> 56:22.040\nUh, he, we did this with him.\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:24.040\nHe just, I said, who's, who's here?\n\n56:24.040 --> 56:27.040\nAnd we realized we kind of stumbled into this Baptist revival thing.\n\n56:27.040 --> 56:29.040\nThat, that's what they do.\n\n56:29.040 --> 56:31.040\nI also found out it's not that easy.\n\n56:31.040 --> 56:34.040\nIt's like, you know, we make fun of these people and we call them charlatans and stuff, but\n\n56:34.040 --> 56:36.040\nthey're providing a service and it is kind of the same thing.\n\n56:36.040 --> 56:38.040\nLike you, you stand in front of an audience.\n\n56:38.040 --> 56:40.040\nEveryone is like, okay, we're here for some reason.\n\n56:40.040 --> 56:42.040\nWe want to feel a certain way.\n\n56:42.040 --> 56:45.040\nAnd then someone says, who, there's someone in the room that's feeling something.\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:47.040\nAnd, and like you, you get excited.\n\n56:47.040 --> 56:52.040\nIf you put, if you put enough pressure on that gas pedal, you just have a revival tent.\n\n56:52.040 --> 56:56.040\nI don't want people like, like thinking that they can walk again and stuff.\n\n56:56.040 --> 57:00.040\nUh, uh, I went to, and I had a girlfriend that was very, uh, very Christian.\n\n57:00.040 --> 57:04.040\nAnd we went to Malibu to this church and there was a faith healer there.\n\n57:04.040 --> 57:09.040\nAnd if it was a put on, it was the best designed put on of all time.\n\n57:09.040 --> 57:10.040\nAnd if it was real, then amazing.\n\n57:10.040 --> 57:13.040\nBut like people were getting up there and shit was getting done.\n\n57:13.040 --> 57:14.040\nIt was really wild.\n\n57:14.040 --> 57:19.040\nAnd you can't, I mean, I'm, you know, there's a party that wants to believe that.\n\n57:19.040 --> 57:21.040\nThere's a party that wants to be that can't believe it.\n\n57:21.040 --> 57:25.040\nAnd so you're sitting there like, but in that moment, everyone in that building was like,\n\n57:25.040 --> 57:26.040\nthat guy can hear again.\n\n57:26.040 --> 57:27.040\nRight.\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:28.040\nLike there was a guy that couldn't hear.\n\n57:28.040 --> 57:30.040\nBut like, you know, I mean, he probably could hear a little better.\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:31.040\nMaybe it was fake or whatever.\n\n57:31.040 --> 57:35.040\nBut, but it's like, like, leave the hearing out of it as my, I'm saying like,\n\n57:35.040 --> 57:38.040\nbecause I think everybody in this room has been and so, hey, what do you want?\n\n57:38.040 --> 57:39.040\nWhat are you doing?\n\n57:39.040 --> 57:40.040\nI'm kidding.\n\n57:40.040 --> 57:41.040\nUh, yeah.\n\n57:41.040 --> 57:43.040\nMeanwhile, a man has been on our stage for five minutes.\n\n57:43.040 --> 57:46.040\nI didn't control that very well.\n\n57:46.040 --> 57:47.040\nWhat was your name, sir?\n\n57:47.040 --> 57:48.040\nYeah.\n\n57:48.040 --> 57:49.040\nWhat's your name?\n\n57:49.040 --> 57:50.040\nMy name is Misha.\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:51.040\nMisha.\n\n57:51.040 --> 57:52.040\nMisha.\n\n57:52.040 --> 57:53.040\nWelcome.\n\n57:53.040 --> 57:54.040\nWelcome.\n\n57:54.040 --> 58:00.040\nIs this a masculinity to say that is a adorable kitten's name?\n\n58:00.040 --> 58:03.040\nIt's better than a lot of what I've gotten throughout the years.\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:05.040\nWhat's the worst thing you've gotten?\n\n58:05.040 --> 58:07.040\nMisha Barton for way too long.\n\n58:07.040 --> 58:08.040\nMisha, what?\n\n58:08.040 --> 58:11.040\nBarton from the O.C.?\n\n58:11.040 --> 58:12.040\nOh, okay.\n\n58:12.040 --> 58:13.040\nYeah.\n\n58:13.040 --> 58:16.040\nI don't know how my bullies torment me.\n\n58:16.040 --> 58:20.040\nYou're young enough to have people tease you about the O.C.?\n\n58:20.040 --> 58:21.040\nYeah, I know.\n\n58:21.040 --> 58:22.040\nI'm telling you, man.\n\n58:22.040 --> 58:25.040\nEnjoy it while it lasts, young ins.\n\n58:25.040 --> 58:29.040\nLike a crisp orange leaf blowing through your daddy's dick.\n\n58:29.040 --> 58:30.040\nYo.\n\n58:30.040 --> 58:31.040\nYo.\n\n58:31.040 --> 58:32.040\nYo.\n\n58:32.040 --> 58:33.040\nYo.\n\n58:33.040 --> 58:34.040\nI fucked your mama.\n\n58:34.040 --> 58:36.040\nAnd I fucked your daddy.\n\n58:36.040 --> 58:37.040\nSorry.\n\n58:37.040 --> 58:38.040\nSorry, Misha.\n\n58:38.040 --> 58:41.040\nMisha, what's on your plate tonight, Misha?\n\n58:41.040 --> 58:42.040\nYeah.\n\n58:42.040 --> 58:43.040\nWhat's brought you...\n\n58:43.040 --> 58:45.040\nOne of them has to get laid.\n\n58:45.040 --> 58:46.040\nYes.\n\n58:46.040 --> 58:47.040\nWhat brought you up here?\n\n58:47.040 --> 58:48.040\nSome spirit.\n\n58:48.040 --> 58:52.040\nI'm in a weird transition period of my life.\n\n58:52.040 --> 58:54.040\nI'm about to graduate from college next semester.\n\n58:54.040 --> 58:59.040\nBut I'm also 19, so I'm trying to figure out what to do with everything.\n\n58:59.040 --> 59:01.040\nAre you some kind of prodigy?\n\n59:01.040 --> 59:02.040\nNo.\n\n59:02.040 --> 59:04.040\nBut is it 19, like, way too...\n\n59:04.040 --> 59:05.040\nIt's really young.\n\n59:05.040 --> 59:06.040\nNo.\n\n59:06.040 --> 59:07.040\nDid your parents push you?\n\n59:07.040 --> 59:09.040\nDid you graduate at 16 high school?\n\n59:09.040 --> 59:11.040\nI graduated at 16.\n\n59:11.040 --> 59:12.040\nIt was weird.\n\n59:12.040 --> 59:13.040\nI don't know.\n\n59:13.040 --> 59:17.040\nI went to college when I was 16, which is...\n\n59:17.040 --> 59:20.040\nThe OC was on the air.\n\n59:20.040 --> 59:22.040\nA perfect storm.\n\n59:22.040 --> 59:23.040\nAll right.\n\n59:23.040 --> 59:24.040\nWhat's your field?\n\n59:24.040 --> 59:25.040\nWhat's your...\n\n59:25.040 --> 59:27.040\nUh, writing for TV and film, actually.\n\n59:27.040 --> 59:28.040\nOh, really?\n\n59:28.040 --> 59:29.040\nYeah.\n\n59:29.040 --> 59:30.040\nOkay, so where do you go to school?\n\n59:30.040 --> 59:31.040\nEmerson College.\n\n59:31.040 --> 59:32.040\nHmm.\n\n59:32.040 --> 59:33.040\nI'm out of my depth.\n\n59:33.040 --> 59:35.040\nI don't know anything about this circuit.\n\n59:35.040 --> 59:38.040\nLike, I became a writer, but I don't know anything about how you become a writer.\n\n59:38.040 --> 59:40.040\nI don't know anything about this path.\n\n59:40.040 --> 59:41.040\nI don't either.\n\n59:41.040 --> 59:42.040\nAll right.\n\n59:42.040 --> 59:43.040\nAll right.\n\n59:43.040 --> 59:44.040\nSo 19 graduated.\n\n59:44.040 --> 59:45.040\nYou don't know what you want to do.\n\n59:45.040 --> 59:47.040\nIs this just a...\n\n59:47.040 --> 59:49.040\nWell, let's get this cynical thought out of our heads.\n\n59:49.040 --> 59:52.040\nThis isn't just a ploy to get me to read your screenplay.\n\n59:52.040 --> 59:54.040\nNo, I don't actually have a screenplay.\n\n59:54.040 --> 59:56.040\nI realized in school I wasn't good at it.\n\n59:56.040 --> 59:59.040\nAnd I was like, oh, maybe this isn't the right thing for me.\n\n59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040\nSo you're at the end of that road.\n\n01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040\nYou're going out of the world and you kind of...\n\n01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.040\nNow you're having second thoughts about the whole choice.\n\n01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040\nYeah.\n\n01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040\nWhat is your option?\n\n01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.040\nWhat makes you think that you're not good at it?\n\n01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.040\nUh, I read my scripts.\n\n01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.040\nWell, I don't always a telltale sign.\n\n01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.040\nYeah, because Dan, like, you know, there was periods in our friendship where Dan was,\n\n01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.040\nlike, we were writing a movie and he would never hit print.\n\n01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.040\nHe would never let anybody read it.\n\n01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040\nLike, you hate everything you write.\n\n01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040\nThat's part of being a good writer, probably, isn't it?\n\n01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040\nYeah, it is.\n\n01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.040\nIt's also part of being a bad writer.\n\n01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.040\nSo don't go up on the roof and go, I can fly.\n\n01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.040\nDan said so.\n\n01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.040\nIt just doesn't eliminate any possibilities.\n\n01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040\nIt's not the metric to use.\n\n01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.040\nI can't tell if I'm self-aware or just really self-critical.\n\n01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.040\nI mean, man learned that he could die and then the next thing he started doing is, you know,\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:57.040\nburying his friends with arrowheads because it's like, I'm fucking up on Earth.\n\n01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.040\nLike, your awareness is like self-hatred.\n\n01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.040\nSo anyways, that part, you can't go by that.\n\n01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.040\nThat's helpful.\n\n01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.040\nWell, let's go to the positive side of it.\n\n01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.040\nIs there something else that calls to you that you kind of, no matter how guilty,\n\n01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.040\nno matter what it pays, no matter whether there's a word for it,\n\n01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.040\nis there some passion that you like really, like, God, I wish I was just doing this.\n\n01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.040\nWhy didn't I just go in this direction?\n\n01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040\nStand up comedy.\n\n01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040\nReally?\n\n01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040\nOkay, well, then you're close enough.\n\n01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040\nLike, that's fine.\n\n01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040\nYeah.\n\n01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040\nAll right, do some bits.\n\n01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040\nLet's hear them.\n\n01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.040\nYou got airplane food.\n\n01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040\nWhat do you got?\n\n01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:38.040\nDo you have a tight three?\n\n01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.040\nDo you have material?\n\n01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.040\nI do, but this is a weird form to do it on.\n\n01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040\nWell, it's up to you.\n\n01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.040\nLike, don't let them pressure you because they don't.\n\n01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.040\nYou know what I found?\n\n01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.040\nYou know, I traveled in a lot of comedy.\n\n01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.040\nI found a really good way to loosen up is to start off with a little rap.\n\n01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.040\nYeah, I'll open for you.\n\n01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:03.040\nThere might even be an appearance by a Vets of Price.\n\n01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.040\nYo, yo, yo, yo, actually, actually, start the song from the beginning.\n\n01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.040\nWhat we'll do is we'll do a little, we'll do a little Def Jam kind of.\n\n01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.040\nI'll be a host.\n\n01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.040\nI'll be Russell Simmons and I'll come out and I'll introduce a rap act and then I'll\n\n01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040\ndo a little rap.\n\n01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040\nNo, lady.\n\n01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040\nJust stop.\n\n01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:35.040\nIt's like, at this point, you have to ask yourself, am I at the right show?\n\n01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.040\nYou start to become the asshole.\n\n01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.040\nI'm sorry, I'm not.\n\n01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.040\nActually, Dan, no one said anything.\n\n01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.040\nIt's an empty chair with a mop.\n\n01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.040\nIt's just an old hat rack back there.\n\n01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.040\nNo way, okay, no, you know what, I won't open with a rap because that would bury you.\n\n01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040\nI will.\n\n01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040\nWow.\n\n01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040\nWow.\n\n01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.040\nTake that no, lady.\n\n01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040\nI will give you the best opener in the world.\n\n01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.040\nI'll do like shitty, horrible stand-up.\n\n01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.040\nOkay, so, all right.\n\n01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.040\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, he's open for colleges and clubs all around the country.\n\n01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.040\nSchman, Flanigan.\n\n01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.040\nOh, wow.\n\n01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.040\nBoy, oh boy.\n\n01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:22.040\nI can't believe how much pussy's in the audience.\n\n01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.040\nI'd like to eat it with a fork.\n\n01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:32.040\nOh, speaking of forks, here's my impression of Bill Clinton talking to a pussy with a fork.\n\n01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:36.040\nOh, I did not have relations with a pussy fork.\n\n01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040\nOh, seriously, what else is going on?\n\n01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:45.040\nYou know, black people are...\n\n01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040\nAre they bad people?\n\n01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.040\nThey seem like bad people.\n\n01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.040\nI was walking in the grocery store.\n\n01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040\nI saw a black guy shopping.\n\n01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.040\nHe's like, whoa, shit, shit, baby, I want some cereal.\n\n01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.040\nI can't figure these people out.\n\n01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.040\nIt's like, you know, we should, we should, you know, do...\n\n01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:12.040\nI don't know whether to be friends with them or round them up and then put them in some kind of special camp.\n\n01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.040\nI don't know, I don't know if you guys are familiar with the United Nations,\n\n01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.040\nbut they have a lot of countries they're represented,\n\n01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.040\nand I always thought it would be weird if they were, if they were, instead of running the world,\n\n01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.040\nthat they were running a plumbing company.\n\n01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.040\nAnd I think it would go, you know, the first thing you'd see when you walk in, you'd see Russia,\n\n01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.040\nyou know, oh, me, I love to plunge toilets, oh, comrade.\n\n01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.040\nYou look over there, there's China.\n\n01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.040\nOh, I saw, oh, I need, oh, there's too much shit in my toilets.\n\n01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:51.040\nOh, hey, partner, I'm the United States of America, see?\n\n01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.040\nNow, who, who put all this shit in the United Nations toilet?\n\n01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.040\nHey, don't look at me.\n\n01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.040\nThank you very much, I'm Span and Bargain.\n\n01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.040\nIt's been great.\n\n01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.040\nWhat, what, what did I do?\n\n01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.040\nOkay, keep it going, folks, comedy isn't easy.\n\n01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.040\nAll right, let's keep it going, let's try to shake it off.\n\n01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:23.040\nWe got another, another guy coming up, let's keep it going for Misha!\n\n01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.040\nI can't, am I supposed to rap or am I supposed to tell jokes?\n\n01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.040\nNo, dude, do stand up better than that guy, dude.\n\n01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:33.040\nI can't wait to tell my friends that Dan Harmon opened up for me.\n\n01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:39.040\nThat's number one.\n\n01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.040\nYou already got a laugh.\n\n01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:50.040\nOkay, my name is Misha, Misha is a Russian name,\n\n01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.040\nbut I'm not Russian, as you guys can probably tell.\n\n01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:58.040\nI was given my name because I was conceived during the Cold War\n\n01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.040\nand my parents were pessimists.\n\n01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040\nWhat?\n\n01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:20.040\nAccording to statistics, I should understand statistics.\n\n01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:28.040\nFor the podcast people, listen, he's Asian.\n\n01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.040\nI love the voice you do for that.\n\n01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.040\nYes very much.\n\n01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.040\nYou're not that Asian.\n\n01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.040\nAccording to white people, I look like I want to be told I look like Jackie Chan.\n\n01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.040\nAnd here's the thing, I don't mind being told I look like another Asian.\n\n01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:57.040\nWhat I do mind is being told I look like a 57 year old.\n\n01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.040\nMy father got called down.\n\n01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:06.040\nThis is a big triumph. Jeff is obviously jealous and he's sabotaging you.\n\n01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040\nThat is a good milestone.\n\n01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040\nKeep keep keep keep going.\n\n01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040\nI'm not jealous, I'm excited.\n\n01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040\nAlright.\n\n01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040\nOh more?\n\n01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040\nYeah.\n\n01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.040\nClose the father joke.\n\n01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040\nClose the father joke.\n\n01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.040\nDo I do the same one again?\n\n01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040\nWait, I'm confused now.\n\n01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.040\nCan you start with the father, you said my father?\n\n01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.040\nOh, my father was called Jackie Chan when he was a kid.\n\n01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.040\nMy grandfather was called Jackie Chan when he was a kid.\n\n01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.040\nThat is not a good family tradition.\n\n01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040\nYou know what a good family tradition though?\n\n01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.040\nWow, I can't speak English.\n\n01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.040\nYou know what a good family tradition though is?\n\n01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.040\nUnderstanding statistics.\n\n01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.040\nAnd sort of brings it around full circle.\n\n01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.040\nSorry, I fucked the bit.\n\n01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040\nI fucked it up, I'm sorry.\n\n01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040\nNo, it's probably my fault.\n\n01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.040\nIs there any other closer?\n\n01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.040\nDo you get anything else up your sleeve?\n\n01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040\nMaybe a little wrap?\n\n01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040\nOkay.\n\n01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.040\nWhat do you do when shit gets hectic?\n\n01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.040\nOr you haven't done anything yet?\n\n01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.040\nThis is a fantasy eye one.\n\n01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040\nYou don't have an old standby.\n\n01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.040\nI'm sorry, I felt the father joke got fucked.\n\n01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040\nI feel terrible.\n\n01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.040\nI put music cue in the middle of a bit.\n\n01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040\nI thought that was a thing and I fucked it.\n\n01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040\nHe was killing.\n\n01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040\nI know he was killing.\n\n01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040\nHe killed.\n\n01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040\nLet's put it that way.\n\n01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.040\nMisha, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.040\nGet back there and wrap.\n\n01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.040\nDo you want to wrap Misha?\n\n01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040\nYou think you can try?\n\n01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.040\nOr try a wrap?\n\n01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040\nNo, not even just with a wrap.\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040\nJust a few licks.\n\n01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040\nJust give it a whirl.\n\n01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.040\nIt'll feel like closure.\n\n01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.040\nPeople of the world.\n\n01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040\nAll different colors.\n\n01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.040\nWe're all united in a Benetton world.\n\n01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.040\nBlack, white, brown, purple.\n\n01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040\nEveryone's feeling the vibe.\n\n01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040\nI'm an anti-racist rapper.\n\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.040\nFeeling the vibe.\n\n01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.040\nIt's a bohemian scene on the east side.\n\n01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.040\nFeeling the vibe.\n\n01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.040\nThrowing it to my man Misha.\n\n01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.040\nMy name is Misha.\n\n01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.040\nI cannot rap.\n\n01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.040\nNot much I know, but that's a fact.\n\n01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.040\nWhen it comes to rapping, it's the skill I lack.\n\n01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.040\nAnd that's about that, I guess.\n\n01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.040\nMisha, everyone.\n\n01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.040\nEveryone's a rapper.\n\n01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.040\nThat's what I learned tonight.\n\n01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.040\nI'm going to make a prediction since we made a prediction earlier.\n\n01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.040\nI think that Misha, first of all, he's a good stand-up comic.\n\n01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.040\nI think you're 19, right?\n\n01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040\nYeah.\n\n01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.040\nHoly shit.\n\n01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040\nAlso, you're driven.\n\n01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.040\nYou got your shit together.\n\n01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040\nIt's a little infuriating.\n\n01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040\nAlso, Dan.\n\n01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040\nYou could take a nap for eight years.\n\n01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.040\nAnd get up and start doing stuff.\n\n01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.040\nAnd still make half of your friends mad.\n\n01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.040\nAnd he looks just like Jackie Chan.\n\n01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.040\nHe does.\n\n01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.040\nIt's like an uncanny.\n\n01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040\nLike a classic, classic Chan.\n\n01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040\nYeah, like an early Chan.\n\n01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.040\nLike an ancient Chan.\n\n01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.040\nLike an ancient secret Chan.\n\n01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.040\nLike the Sist of the Seven Orbs.\n\n01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040\nThat's not a movie.\n\n01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040\nOh, wow.\n\n01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.040\nThat was good, Misha.\n\n01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.040\nThat was fucking awesome.\n\n01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.040\nAlso, I think you said that I was being jealous.\n\n01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.040\nWhat I was was like...\n\n01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.040\nI was making a joke.\n\n01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.040\nI couldn't believe the balls of someone getting up there and doing stand-up in the middle of a show.\n\n01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.040\nThat's the balls of a burglar.\n\n01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.040\nAlso, the music is very sensitive to his surroundings.\n\n01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.040\nHe wasn't just like barreling through his thing.\n\n01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.040\nHe was like, well, the music's playing.\n\n01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.040\nHe was doing like a 70-yard hurdle dash open.\n\n01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.040\nBut there were like jacks on the track.\n\n01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.040\nAnd he was like kind of like acknowledging them and going,\n\n01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.040\nOw, ow, okay, still jumping though.\n\n01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.040\nIt was our fault that the last bit that he didn't like fucking...\n\n01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.040\nHe could have finished with like a fucking backflip.\n\n01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.040\nHe's not Jackie Chan, Dan.\n\n01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.040\nHe's not actually Jackie Chan.\n\n01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.040\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.040\nHe looks just fucking like him.\n\n01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.040\nI was lateral racist.\n\n01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.040\nHe's doing a stereotype of the best stand-ups are black.\n\n01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.040\nAnd the best act ends with a backflip.\n\n01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040\nForgot he was Asian.\n\n01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.040\nThat's a horrible thing to say.\n\n01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.040\nWe learned several weeks ago not to ask black people time travel questions.\n\n01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.040\nShould never ever suggest that an Asian man does a backflip.\n\n01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.040\nCan you do a backflip, Misha?\n\n01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.040\nNo, you can, can you?\n\n01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.040\nYou're just saying that.\n\n01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.040\nYou're saying no because we're going to make you come up here and do it.\n\n01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.040\nHow do people do that?\n\n01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.040\nHow do you not fall?\n\n01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.040\nWe'll figure that out in a different episode.\n\n01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.040\nAll right, let's close in a timely fashion.\n\n01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040\nIt's been a nice, tight show.\n\n01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.040\nI have a feeling people don't come to Harbin Town because they go,\n\n01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.040\nOh, the show's always two hours long.\n\n01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040\nLet's fucking blow their minds tonight.\n\n01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040\nDo a tight 90.\n\n01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040\nAll right.\n\n01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.040\nAnd what do we, how do we close the show?\n\n01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.040\nWell, it's almost certainly going to be a wrap.\n\n01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040\nBut we have two.\n\n01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040\nIt feels like it has to be.\n\n01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.040\nBut how can it possibly, you know...\n\n01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.040\nMaybe, I don't know, can you take the mic around and maybe like...\n\n01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040\nDoes someone want to do a freestyle challenge?\n\n01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.040\nI worked the crowd wrap.\n\n01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.040\nOr does somebody out there feel that they have the chops to come up to do a freestyle?\n\n01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040\nOh, a battle.\n\n01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.040\nAn eighth mile kind of throw down.\n\n01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040\nAnybody?\n\n01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.040\nA one-eighth mile special wrap battle.\n\n01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.040\nAnybody?\n\n01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.040\nAnybody want to try their hand at taking down the Grandmaster here?\n\n01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.040\nNo one, no one spits this kind of fire.\n\n01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040\nI wouldn't do it.\n\n01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.040\nI already have a mic in front of my face.\n\n01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040\nAll right.\n\n01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040\nAll right.\n\n01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040\nWell, wait, you should rap battle me.\n\n01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.040\nHuh?\n\n01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.040\nI fucked this guy.\n\n01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.040\nOr did I engineer that entire thing?\n\n01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.040\nOh shit.\n\n01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:58.040\nBreak it down.\n\n01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.040\nOh shit.\n\n01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.040\nComing to the stage.\n\n01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.040\nThe clash of the Titans.\n\n01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.040\nDan Harmon versus Jeff Davis.\n\n01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040\nYo, yo, I'll bury you.\n\n01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040\nI fucked your mama.\n\n01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.040\nI fucked her like a sheep or a llama.\n\n01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.040\nWent to the petting zoo, saw her ass, fed her some cashews.\n\n01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.040\nShe took a, yo, yo, yo, I'm offended by some things that you said.\n\n01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.040\nI think I've already told you that my mother is dead.\n\n01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.040\nShe died of cancer when I was just 13.\n\n01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.040\nShe didn't lose a ball, but it still felt mean to die of having cancer in most parts\n\n01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.040\nof her body.\n\n01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:40.040\nAnd now you've, you've really treated her like a hottie that you're fucking a corpse.\n\n01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.040\nFrom that, it's hard to recover.\n\n01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.040\nYeah, you're trying to fuck my dead mother.\n\n01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.040\nI still fucked her even though she's dead.\n\n01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.040\nHow about that?\n\n01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.040\nI took her body to bed.\n\n01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.040\nI put her foot on the post, put her hand on the cradle.\n\n01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.040\nI fucked your mama like her name was Abel.\n\n01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040\nFerrara.\n\n01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.040\nYo, yo, it's an actor.\n\n01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.040\nYo, yo, Dan, I'll tell you what.\n\n01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.040\nWhat I'm going to do.\n\n01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.040\nI'm going to fly to Wisconsin, kill your parents and fuck them too.\n\n01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040\nI'm going to, I'm going to kill them and fuck them with a body.\n\n01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.040\nIt's still warm.\n\n01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.040\nI'm going to fuck them and I'm going to do the swarm.\n\n01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.040\nSwarm is a dance where you're coming to your mama.\n\n01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040\nAnd then you also call a llama.\n\n01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.040\nYou put a llama on your daddy and you fuck it in the rear.\n\n01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.040\nYou fuck the promise booty and you fuck your daddy's ear.\n\n01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040\nYo, you're talking about fucking my parents.\n\n01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040\nYeah.\n\n01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.040\nYo, yo, that's really mean.\n\n01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.040\nYeah.\n\n01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040\nYou brought up a dead mom.\n\n01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.040\nMurder.\n\n01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.040\nShe threw us for a loop, but I heard your uncle Tom.\n\n01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.040\nThat's right.\n\n01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.040\nYou're a betrayer of your race.\n\n01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.040\nI heard your mama was a can of mace.\n\n01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.040\nShe sprayed her pussy and she sprayed her breasts.\n\n01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040\nI heard your mama couldn't pass a test.\n\n01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.040\nI heard she took a number two on her own damn pencil.\n\n01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.040\nShe didn't understand the meaning of the stencil.\n\n01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040\nShe couldn't understand even a stencil.\n\n01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040\nStencils are easy to read.\n\n01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.040\nIt was a stencil.\n\n01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:08.040\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for coming

remind you.\n\n01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040\nDon't get your grilled cheese.\n\n01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040\nYou guys are awesome tonight.\n\n01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.040\nThank
