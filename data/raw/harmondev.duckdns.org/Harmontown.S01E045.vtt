I\n\n01:18.920 --> 01:20.920\nTook a shower\n\n01:20.920 --> 01:22.920\nI\n\n01:22.960 --> 01:28.880\nRaised home from work at Rick and Morty and I jumped in the shower and I didn't use that's not true\n\n01:28.880 --> 01:31.720\nThat's not true. All right. I stopped at the drawing room. You're right. Yeah\n\n01:33.320 --> 01:35.320\nTo tell you that I needed to take a shower\n\n01:35.840 --> 01:43.320\nAfter an hour of drinking, right? I mean, that's not there's no reason for I mean, let's just full disclosure\n\n01:43.320 --> 01:47.520\nYeah, it's just your your commitment to honesty Jeff Davis's commitment to honesty\n\n01:47.520 --> 01:53.480\nYeah, I took a shower tonight. You guys don't really usually see me after a shower\n\n01:54.640 --> 01:58.360\nThat's kind of exciting. I don't know if I've ever been up here right after a shower\n\n01:59.080 --> 02:01.080\nNo, and I don't know if it\n\n02:01.800 --> 02:05.520\nI don't know if it changes me or not. I don't know if they I clip my fingernails\n\n02:05.520 --> 02:12.800\nI don't I'm not embarrassed about so when you groom you commit to grooming. Yeah, I'm like, let's let's get back to basics here\n\n02:12.800 --> 02:18.680\nIt's like a like a Narnia book, you know, where they they go on a lot of adventures and then there's a chapter where they just\n\n02:18.680 --> 02:22.160\nThey go down to the riverbank and they scrub and you know\n\n02:24.880 --> 02:28.840\nThe author describes their ruddy cheeks and their glistening hair and they\n\n02:29.960 --> 02:31.960\nDid he just put down the book and jerk off\n\n02:34.320 --> 02:36.320\nThat sounds like a clean lion\n\n02:36.320 --> 02:43.840\nI just remember people like every once in a while they bathe in these medieval adventures\n\n02:43.840 --> 02:47.040\nThat's all I know and so I do it medieval style\n\n02:58.280 --> 03:00.280\nThat was not affected because\n\n03:00.880 --> 03:05.080\nI've never been laughed at harder in school in fifth grade. I raised my hand in social studies\n\n03:05.080 --> 03:08.560\nI knew the answer to a question. They go and the teacher said Jeff\n\n03:11.440 --> 03:17.240\nI said like 30,000 times in this band of four seconds. That was a real that was a real one\n\n03:17.240 --> 03:21.160\nThat was I mean, I don't fake them try to fake that you can't do it\n\n03:23.160 --> 03:26.080\nYeah, I sound like a character from cars or something I\n\n03:27.320 --> 03:29.320\nAssume I haven't seen that movie\n\n03:29.320 --> 03:36.160\nSpeaking of people who haven't seen movies, we're gonna bring up a guest or later on Jeff\n\n03:36.160 --> 03:41.400\nWho hasn't seen some key movies and we're gonna talk to him about it. That's a dumb teaser dumb\n\n03:43.520 --> 03:45.520\nWell because you have me\n\n03:45.880 --> 03:52.720\nThat's not the purpose of a teaser as you go later on coming up if there's like a guy's gonna come with an anaconda\n\n03:52.720 --> 03:57.200\nWe're gonna find out what it eats, you know, you don't say hey later on we're gonna talk about shit\n\n03:57.200 --> 04:02.760\nOh, yeah, that doesn't that doesn't make any sense, but I don't want to later on Dan's gonna second guess what he says\n\n04:02.760 --> 04:04.760\nWe're gonna talk about\n\n04:05.080 --> 04:07.320\nWhat were we talking about stammering stuttering hygiene?\n\n04:07.960 --> 04:14.120\nOkay, here's the thing. I'm sorry. I was taking a shower today, and I was 40 years old and I was a\n\n04:15.360 --> 04:18.160\nAnd Aaron had left a bottle of shampoo\n\n04:19.440 --> 04:24.800\nLike it spilled on the bottom of the toilet. What do you call it the bathtub?\n\n04:24.800 --> 04:26.320\nI\n\n04:26.320 --> 04:28.320\nWhere do you shit and where do you?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nwash the shit out of your\n\n04:31.560 --> 04:33.560\nthe bathtub was\n\n04:33.560 --> 04:34.960\ncovered with\n\n04:34.960 --> 04:36.480\nshampoo and\n\n04:36.480 --> 04:41.880\nSo when I got in it with my like like my my my enormous gross walrus like body\n\n04:43.240 --> 04:45.240\nLike the weight was just like all\n\n04:45.560 --> 04:50.440\nSlipping and sliding like there's no the the old German couple that left me this house\n\n04:50.440 --> 04:56.400\nThey didn't they did a lot of weird things. There's kitchen tiles in the kitchen that have like the German word for honey on them\n\n04:56.400 --> 04:58.600\nAnd a little bear going like sigile, but\n\n05:00.520 --> 05:05.720\nThere's all kinds of evidence if you look for it then an old German couple owned my house and kid took very good care of it\n\n05:05.840 --> 05:12.200\nYou know they you might say they annexed the house and like like a jar full of gold tea brought a lot of order to it\n\n05:13.920 --> 05:15.920\nBut but that was a\n\n05:15.920 --> 05:17.920\nI\n\n05:24.720 --> 05:30.960\nLike the thing I delightfully skipped off the surface of the of that lake like a you made a bear a Nazi earlier\n\n05:32.320 --> 05:34.320\nYeah, it's cute\n\n05:34.480 --> 05:39.000\nThe bear offsets you just like the drawer is gold teeth. It's like a pupil of us. I'm not\n\n05:40.200 --> 05:44.560\nLet's not fight Jeff. Let's not fight. I'm having a delightful time. Let me too. Me too.

Yeah, we're fucking loose\n\n05:50.160 --> 05:52.920\nThe camera fucking crew is not here anymore. There's no\n\n05:53.960 --> 05:59.000\nNot that not that not that not that they were bad people or that having a camera here was bad\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.160\nIt's just fucking it's different. No, but if you look at difference, then here's a difference\n\n06:03.160 --> 06:06.880\nBecause now for the first time in about a month and a half. I can do this I\n\n06:06.880 --> 06:12.360\nI can play license music Wow\n\n06:15.720 --> 06:17.720\nA place\n\n06:17.960 --> 06:20.440\nWhere copyrights don't apply\n\n06:21.720 --> 06:24.160\nWhere Sony can fuck off and die\n\n06:24.880 --> 06:26.880\nThey call it\n\n06:26.880 --> 06:39.360\nWhen he Houston died of an overdose in a hotel and when her record started to sell\n\n06:40.040 --> 06:45.880\nSony charged more for it. Look it up. It's a fucking huge ridiculous scandal\n\n06:47.200 --> 06:53.720\nIf you just Google it, you will see that the company that fired me\n\n06:53.720 --> 06:55.720\nis\n\n06:55.840 --> 07:01.080\nHorrible and belongs in Nazi Germany\n\n07:01.480 --> 07:03.800\nAnd now we can steal boom\n\n07:04.760 --> 07:06.760\nSwiss\n\n07:07.560 --> 07:09.560\nSony\n\n07:10.360 --> 07:16.840\nSony a drawer full of gold teeth now. That's marketable\n\n07:17.560 --> 07:20.280\nAll right, so to get\n\n07:20.280 --> 07:22.280\nI\n\n07:22.160 --> 07:24.160\nFeel good\n\n07:25.440 --> 07:31.680\nYes, yes, yes, you love it you guys had to go for two months without ELO\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.360\nAnd death camp references they they love them both\n\n07:37.560 --> 07:41.240\nThey eat them like s'mores the chocolate move the marshmallow\n\n07:41.240 --> 07:45.720\nI stepped into the shower and I started slipping because she left the shampoo\n\n07:45.720 --> 07:52.400\nShe left it she just squirted shampoo on the on the floor\n\n07:53.040 --> 07:57.680\nShe's she's she's young. She's vibrant. She's she's got she's trying to kill you. She's got\n\n07:58.920 --> 08:00.920\nThis is the Agatha Christie novels\n\n08:01.320 --> 08:08.600\nShe's got pots to cast she's got paintings to commission boyfriends to murder maybe but that would make more sense after\n\n08:08.600 --> 08:12.680\nSo she's leaving liquid soap on the floor like Downton Abbey. It was\n\n08:12.680 --> 08:14.600\nOh\n\n08:14.600 --> 08:18.280\nOkay, I saw high fives out there\n\n08:19.720 --> 08:26.640\nThe weird thing is there's three people in the front row here two of them crossed over the person sitting in the middle of them to do a\n\n08:26.640 --> 08:32.000\nDownton Abbey high five. So he's either her boyfriend and\n\n08:32.640 --> 08:34.640\nDoesn't truck with no Downton Abbey\n\n08:34.880 --> 08:39.120\nAnd he's the fucking Downton Abbey watching guy that's gonna fuck her after\n\n08:39.120 --> 08:41.920\nHe's on deck\n\n08:44.560 --> 08:50.920\nOr I don't know what wait, what are the other I don't know any other configurations. I was gonna I was gonna say gay best friend\n\n08:50.920 --> 08:55.840\nOh, okay, okay. She said yes. Wait. Are you the gay best friend gay best friend?\n\n09:03.520 --> 09:08.160\nWait, are you guys a couple? Oh, okay, so just straight friend\n\n09:08.160 --> 09:10.160\nYou're just hanging out on deck\n\n09:14.160 --> 09:15.680\nYou're playing the platonic game\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:20.160\nShe's gonna end up having a boyfriend a straight platonic friend and a gay best friend\n\n09:20.320 --> 09:24.600\nThat's amazing and the gay guys gonna have a straight best friend and that they're gonna end up hookin up later\n\n09:24.600 --> 09:26.840\nHe's just gonna be like a Chinese kite just like with this\n\n09:28.840 --> 09:30.840\nTail of\n\n09:31.360 --> 09:33.360\nEntourage\n\n09:33.360 --> 09:37.160\nAnyway, so I'm slipping in the shower\n\n09:38.160 --> 09:43.580\nAnd I know no tangents tonight. No, I don't know that all of this has been germane to\n\n09:44.760 --> 09:46.760\nJackson\n\n09:46.920 --> 09:49.320\nDum dum dum no word play tonight. No\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:58.640\nGermane Jackson of the type of tangents that aren't gonna happen tonight. The first one is a phonetic\n\n09:58.640 --> 10:03.440\nJust because you hear yourself say germane, you don't have to say Jackson\n\n10:05.480 --> 10:11.920\nThat's rule number one I was slipping in the shower and I made me hyper conscious of my environment\n\n10:11.920 --> 10:17.840\nHere's my thing Jeff one of my many things. I don't like showering. I like bathing and\n\n10:19.200 --> 10:21.200\nThank you. Thank you\n\n10:21.200 --> 10:26.680\nFor the top like like I realized what a treacherous place it is\n\n10:26.680 --> 10:30.120\nIt started to make me I was like I started slipping and I was like Jesus Christ\n\n10:30.120 --> 10:34.200\nI took my it was like oh she left the shampoo. It's like and I put it down the drain\n\n10:34.200 --> 10:35.560\nIt's like that's why people slip in the shower\n\n10:35.560 --> 10:40.720\nWait, she just left a big glob of shampoo on the bottom of the shower or a ghost knocked it down\n\n10:40.720 --> 10:46.300\nI don't know man. There was a there was a shampoo bottle like down on the floor of the\n\n10:46.300 --> 10:52.540\nTub yeah leaking shampoo. Yeah, so like an oil slick, right? I was taking a hurried shower\n\n10:53.900 --> 10:57.620\nMaybe she wanted to kill me tonight and that's why she's not here, right?\n\n10:58.020 --> 11:01.740\nShe's she said she was she she has an alibi. She's in Belize right now\n\n11:02.820 --> 11:04.820\nNone of that makes sense. None of that makes sense\n\n11:05.340 --> 11:10.780\nNot a perfect crime. I slip in the shower. She gets no money because she's I'm just her boyfriend that slipped in a shower\n\n11:10.780 --> 11:16.420\nShe's in the other room when it happens. They'd still accuse her of murder. It doesn't none of it makes sense\n\n11:16.420 --> 11:18.740\nI would thrill you to no end, but it doesn't make sense\n\n11:20.580 --> 11:24.420\nWe love each other and we belong together and you're a bad bad bad person\n\n11:26.660 --> 11:31.700\nThe I start I became hyper conscious of the shower environment and I started to think to myself\n\n11:31.700 --> 11:37.300\nYou know what all of these houses that you always see on TV in the movies and in your own homes\n\n11:37.300 --> 11:44.100\nThey always have a shower in them and I started to started to really sink in I think other people other than me really like\n\n11:44.100 --> 11:46.100\nto take showers\n\n11:46.100 --> 11:48.100\nright\n\n11:49.140 --> 11:51.140\nSo like\n\n11:51.420 --> 11:53.420\nHow many people in the room?\n\n11:53.900 --> 11:55.900\nDon't like taking showers\n\n11:58.740 --> 12:01.740\nFour four or five four or five\n\n12:02.860 --> 12:04.540\nOkay, you\n\n12:04.540 --> 12:11.020\nWould you you like baths? Okay, so those those four people have bath. There's no there's no question\n\n12:11.020 --> 12:13.740\nThat a bath is better than a shower, but like sometimes you don't have time\n\n12:13.740 --> 12:19.820\nYou know the shower is an expedient, but how many people in the room consider it a like oh boy\n\n12:19.820 --> 12:24.940\nI wish I could take a shower like like like like like like by applause\n\n12:29.220 --> 12:30.340\nThat's the thing\n\n12:30.340 --> 12:35.140\nBut also one of my favorite things is sometimes if you got the time a little bit of both you\n\n12:35.540 --> 12:39.140\nYou plug you plug the drain you lay in there and you take a shower bath\n\n12:39.820 --> 12:43.740\nWait what what bathtub can you fit in like you're you're taller than me?\n\n12:43.740 --> 12:49.020\nI uh you just get down there and like let's lay down. It's like look like like Herman Munster in a\n\n12:51.060 --> 12:55.460\nSexy naked Herman muster in a tiny little like go-kart\n\n12:55.460 --> 13:00.460\nHe's like he's laid down there and the water fills up and the waters you know cools off a little quicker when you're the hot water\n\n13:00.460 --> 13:03.340\nComing down is the greatest I don't get nothing other than baths\n\n13:03.340 --> 13:08.500\nI don't get it because like when my dishes are dirty they got a little lasagna to scrape them off like that's how you know\n\n13:08.500 --> 13:15.020\nLike you soak them soak you soak the dish you don't spray it, but you have a you have a dishwasher, and that's a shower\n\n13:15.660 --> 13:21.260\nRight, it's not so but you have to scrub the dish before you put it in the shower that in the in the in the dishwasher\n\n13:21.260 --> 13:27.260\nYeah, I soak the plates or well and or I hire a lady who may or may not be\n\n13:28.620 --> 13:30.620\nDocumented I don't know\n\n13:30.900 --> 13:34.260\nThat's her business, and that's not a tangent. We're gonna get off on but\n\n13:34.980 --> 13:38.900\nMy plates are currently clean so are my balls because I soak them\n\n13:40.260 --> 13:45.180\nThis is enough of this topic. I was just thinking in my head while I was taking a shower today\n\n13:45.900 --> 13:50.820\nLike how much people like showers? It's not like a toilet. It's a different from a toilet\n\n13:50.820 --> 13:54.900\nThe toilets there nobody well come sometimes pooping is fun like\n\n13:55.540 --> 13:57.900\nCuz because there's a thing coming out of your butt now you but\n\n13:58.420 --> 14:01.700\nFeels good, so it's like put your thing up your butt same thing, but it's coming out\n\n14:01.860 --> 14:06.700\nBut you then you have to wipe it and like it's poopy, and I don't have to I probably don't have to explain this\n\n14:07.220 --> 14:10.980\nOut of all the things I have to explain. I probably know this is probably the last thing I have to explain\n\n14:12.580 --> 14:17.260\nYou know pooping works and that there's a there's a thing in the bathroom that's like there\n\n14:17.260 --> 14:22.460\nIt's it's by necessity like it really is there because but a toilet is a bath for your poop\n\n14:23.620 --> 14:27.580\nAnd I always thought it's a bit of a shower was also there by necessity\n\n14:28.260 --> 14:33.180\nBecause that was a just as the toilet was a device that kept poop from piling up\n\n14:33.860 --> 14:38.140\nThe shower was a device that kept kids from picking on you. That was how I\n\n14:38.140 --> 14:46.660\nLike that that was that was how I was introduced to the concept of showering is that kids in the playground going you don't shower\n\n14:47.380 --> 14:51.860\nYou have to shower. Fuck you. You're an asshole. You're a piece of shit\n\n14:51.860 --> 14:55.980\nBut if you you better get in that shower and I'm like well unlike when I get on the toilet\n\n14:55.980 --> 14:58.580\nI don't actually it's not up to me like I\n\n14:59.580 --> 15:01.580\nIt's just up to fucking Steve Ruel\n\n15:01.580 --> 15:08.260\nBut if you had gotten up every morning and and known at you know when you were in the fifth grade that you liked baths and\n\n15:08.300 --> 15:13.580\nYou took a bath every day you would have been clean and they wouldn't have that never would have been a topic, right?\n\n15:14.020 --> 15:16.020\nYeah, maybe but yeah, maybe\n\n15:17.260 --> 15:19.340\nYeah, don't don't blame high\n\n15:20.420 --> 15:21.940\nCascading water\n\n15:21.940 --> 15:24.740\nBut it was just a bathing thing. It was\n\n15:25.420 --> 15:28.860\nBathing can be showering or like submerging yourself in a tub\n\n15:28.860 --> 15:33.580\nI think that everybody should wake up every morning. Not everybody. I don't care what you guys do\n\n15:34.060 --> 15:36.540\nI I would like it. I would like that\n\n15:36.540 --> 15:42.020\nI would be comfortable if everybody woke up every morning of it. I'm gonna I'm gonna take my little my little bath\n\n15:42.900 --> 15:47.060\nBecause that's how you get clean you soak your whole dirty body and like\n\n15:47.740 --> 15:50.300\nClean water and you can take a bath every day\n\n15:50.860 --> 15:56.540\nYou can be a you can be a sexy calgon lady and you can you can get you can get in and have a little bubble bath every morning\n\n15:56.540 --> 16:02.700\nWell, I had my bath had to be fixed and now it is there's too much time in the bath as the old air supply song goes\n\n16:03.660 --> 16:05.340\ntoo much\n\n16:05.340 --> 16:09.460\nTime in the bed. I don't know. I don't know what band that is but it's not\n\n16:11.460 --> 16:13.460\nWell that out\n\n16:14.060 --> 16:16.900\nI was gonna say fucking sticks, but then I was like how many hits could they have?\n\n16:18.420 --> 16:22.340\nSticks if you're listening and you're from sticks like I just paid you the biggest couple of middle-world\n\n16:22.340 --> 16:25.380\nI stopped myself. I was like I was gonna say sticks. It was like too many hits\n\n16:25.380 --> 16:28.220\nYeah, they also have bathing. Yeah\n\n16:30.060 --> 16:32.060\nWhen I'm wet I am cleaner\n\n16:35.580 --> 16:38.940\nSubmerging dirty balls\n\n16:40.380 --> 16:42.380\nSorry, I can't do it\n\n16:43.620 --> 16:48.540\nComing to the stage now Jeff. Oh shit. Yeah, fuck it man. Keep this thing rolling man\n\n16:48.540 --> 16:55.300\nThat's what I learned on tour. Keep it rolling bring bring fresh faces up get to know him talk to them\n\n16:55.780 --> 16:57.420\nLet's bring\n\n16:57.420 --> 16:59.420\nfirst up\n\n17:00.380 --> 17:04.500\nAn old friend of Harmontown a week old\n\n17:06.260 --> 17:12.540\nAre you looking for a thing I'm stalling for you. I don't good. Okay. Did you have a theme? No, I just got some sticks\n\n17:12.940 --> 17:14.940\nOkay\n\n17:14.940 --> 17:20.500\nAn old friend. He was here last week. I like talking to him\n\n17:22.940 --> 17:25.820\nHis name is Kumail Nanjiani\n\n17:25.820 --> 17:44.380\nCome here from now on. This is your theme. I like it. Hey, not this one a different one\n\n17:44.380 --> 17:54.660\nYou're with me, I'm smiling this one why you know what fuck you\n\n18:02.620 --> 18:04.620\nCamels fighting with our tech guy. Oh\n\n18:05.460 --> 18:08.100\nHe was okay. We're not fighting anymore. I just won\n\n18:08.100 --> 18:15.940\nIt's only a fight if yeah, if it's still going on. Yeah, can I say one thing? I'm and I'm pro-showering\n\n18:16.140 --> 18:19.460\nAnti-baving. I know you don't want to talk about this anymore. I feel thank you\n\n18:20.420 --> 18:26.780\nIs it gonna be about wasting water? No, God. No, no, I'm pro-showering showering is more wasting water. I think no\n\n18:26.780 --> 18:29.780\nNo, that's not true. We all did that if you take a short shower\n\n18:29.780 --> 18:32.700\nYou if you plug the shower, it doesn't fill the shower\n\n18:32.700 --> 18:37.660\nOh, we did that in science class right gang. What science class were you homeschooled?\n\n18:38.820 --> 18:43.140\nIt has to be all like the little bread in this toaster. It becomes toast\n\n18:44.260 --> 18:49.660\nIt's just science based on what you guys have come out. Did Dan went to Mythbusters high\n\n18:54.380 --> 18:58.940\nIf you if you stand in the shower and plug the drain as\n\n18:58.940 --> 19:03.540\nAs often happens to 25 year olds because the drain gets naturally plugged by their\n\n19:04.380 --> 19:08.180\ninability to call their father who they owe $5,000 to and their\n\n19:08.940 --> 19:15.160\nSmokers mucus the it often happens the science experiments plays out you you you always\n\n19:15.260 --> 19:19.660\nThe shower the bathtub will not fill up in the time of an average show\n\n19:19.660 --> 19:23.540\nYou'd have to be in the shower for a long time to fill a bath. I take long showers sometimes\n\n19:23.540 --> 19:29.500\nI well, I would when I'm on the road like I was in Miami for a month alone before that I was in Baltimore\n\n19:30.020 --> 19:33.540\nAlone for a couple weeks. I would take just to pass the time\n\n19:33.540 --> 19:39.380\nI would take like five six showers a day. What I would like to look forward. I would be like all right time for another shower\n\n19:39.380 --> 19:41.380\nWhat what?\n\n19:42.060 --> 19:46.860\nWhat's not happening in Baltimore? What is it five six showers a day and you saw the wire?\n\n19:48.020 --> 19:51.740\nIt's that it's six showers or the wire\n\n19:51.740 --> 19:56.740\nThat's Baltimore slogan. Does the crack come out of the shower?\n\n19:57.660 --> 19:59.660\nOmar comes to get you\n\n19:59.820 --> 20:03.900\nYou're only safe from Omar in the shower. Yeah, I got that pan\n\n20:05.620 --> 20:07.620\nOmar coming\n\n20:08.820 --> 20:12.540\nSome people are calling out there are more high-fiving in the background\n\n20:15.340 --> 20:17.340\nOnly this time I got them WB\n\n20:18.620 --> 20:20.620\nYeah, yeah, I\n\n20:20.620 --> 20:25.980\nThink the rock bathing is weird because you're laying in your own filth for a while\n\n20:27.340 --> 20:33.000\nNo, run if you do if you do a pre-shower, okay? All right, please\n\n20:36.340 --> 20:38.340\nYou know that\n\n20:38.740 --> 20:40.980\nOkay, it's like your ball and butt filth\n\n20:42.380 --> 20:44.380\nFinish your thought and then let me counter\n\n20:45.420 --> 20:49.460\nOr can I count I feel like I finished my okay? All right. All right\n\n20:49.460 --> 20:51.460\nYeah, I've of course I've thought about that\n\n20:53.500 --> 20:56.100\nI'm an awesome so condescending\n\n20:57.780 --> 21:02.660\nAlso in science class what we learned is the whole point of water as a cleaning agent\n\n21:02.660 --> 21:04.780\nIt is the universal solvent water\n\n21:05.220 --> 21:11.020\nBinds to things takes them away. It doesn't put them back. You know, but it's still there\n\n21:11.020 --> 21:16.020\nIt's bound to water, but it's just hanging out though. It doesn't fucking attach to you now\n\n21:16.020 --> 21:22.620\nBut it's still gross. That's only half of my that's only half of my counter. Okay, the other half is\n\n21:23.700 --> 21:26.580\nAssuming assuming that being near dirt\n\n21:27.660 --> 21:32.240\nActually, it makes you dirty if it's like in a water dirt solution\n\n21:33.220 --> 21:40.540\nWhat you are asserting without knowing you're asserting it is the absurd science fiction notion. I feel like I've already lost\n\n21:41.700 --> 21:44.420\nThat a shower head propels water\n\n21:44.420 --> 21:48.380\nhard enough and consistently enough that it\n\n21:49.500 --> 21:53.820\nBlasts the dirt no no off of your body. I'm scrubbing like a laser gun\n\n21:54.020 --> 22:01.340\nDon't plan that every little flake of dirt as opposed to the simple. Can I finish that's just like finish that's\n\n22:01.340 --> 22:07.700\nIt's 45 seconds opposed to the simple assertion. I've been I'm in you stand down stand down\n\n22:08.980 --> 22:10.980\nSenator your time is up, sir\n\n22:10.980 --> 22:15.700\nI'm scrubbing. Okay. Let the senator from Pakistan rebut\n\n22:20.100 --> 22:23.100\nWas that the fun there was the punch line there just Pakistan\n\n22:24.500 --> 22:32.100\nIt's a funny country. It's got a lot of K's in it. Oh one. Yeah, I just like that senator a Pakistan has senators that are\n\n22:32.820 --> 22:36.340\nThat are like very passionate about shower worse than Bay thing\n\n22:36.980 --> 22:39.700\nSorry, the senator from Pakistan. Where would he start?\n\n22:39.700 --> 22:40.900\nAll right\n\n22:40.900 --> 22:44.100\nOkay, well, I want to say what two things one you've mentioned\n\n22:45.580 --> 22:49.900\nIt's a science fiction notion that would be the worst sci-fi movie of all time\n\n22:51.700 --> 22:53.700\nFair enough also I\n\n22:55.380 --> 22:59.940\nWas gonna say something horrible, but do you know who knows how strong water?\n\n22:59.940 --> 23:05.020\nOh, I'm not gonna say it, but what say it civil war pros civil rights protesters. No\n\n23:05.020 --> 23:09.300\ncivil rights, okay, does it make them clean?\n\n23:12.940 --> 23:14.940\nThat's a fair point dad\n\n23:15.420 --> 23:18.060\nBut the other thing is I'm scrubbing while I'm in the shower\n\n23:18.060 --> 23:22.140\nI'm not just like in there like water do your magic and then get out\n\n23:22.620 --> 23:26.860\nRight, you scrub. Okay fine. I'm scrubbing and then the water is going down there\n\n23:26.860 --> 23:33.740\nEven if it's not binding itself to me. Would you like ride get on a six-hour flight next to just like a peak like a shit?\n\n23:33.740 --> 23:37.600\nLike a turd even though it's not binding to you. You don't want you know, it's there\n\n23:38.300 --> 23:43.820\nWhen you're eating it's like looking at you. That's that's not fair. The shit is made out of shit\n\n23:44.300 --> 23:46.140\nThere's shit is made out of shit\n\n23:46.140 --> 23:52.020\nIs your is your hang up with showering because people said you don't shower your dirty is the is the verb\n\n23:52.340 --> 24:00.460\nShowering kind of it's the verb. No, also the way it's water water stings me a little bit. Okay, but what does it?\n\n24:00.460 --> 24:03.660\nOh, you're sarcastic. Ah, it's duly noted\n\n24:04.700 --> 24:06.700\nall right\n\n24:10.140 --> 24:12.140\nThe water hits you too hard\n\n24:13.500 --> 24:18.140\nYou guys are all you guys are a writer in Hollywood the water hearts\n\n24:20.380 --> 24:27.020\nYou guys are all welcome to a giant bin of dime a dozen hero medals for people who gang up on people\n\n24:27.020 --> 24:32.940\nThere I mean there there's a bin full of them. I knew when I asked them\n\n24:32.940 --> 24:38.380\nI said who loves showering. They all said yay. They all love it. I I'm not I'm not I'm a hero for talk\n\n24:38.380 --> 24:41.820\nBut you're the lady who said she liked Batman risings. Yeah, like like\n\n24:42.540 --> 24:46.540\nIs she here by the way tried to bully her. She's like a folk hero. She's a\n\n24:47.100 --> 24:51.660\nBut Dan, do you know dude is it the act of standing up while while while stingy water hits you?\n\n24:52.300 --> 24:56.660\nBecause that's fair enough if you don't like like like, you know, like I'm I'm six foot four\n\n24:56.660 --> 25:02.420\nI prefer in the morning.

I I can't get high enough\n\n25:20.420 --> 25:22.420\nWhat are you women?\n\n25:22.420 --> 25:27.380\nI I I I why I stand in a tightrope and punch a lion while I pee\n\n25:28.340 --> 25:34.580\nI I I don't even pee.

I'd like a plate of crow to eat up from the time\n\n26:13.060 --> 26:17.380\nI booed Dan Harmon because I I react to words instead of feelings\n\n26:19.300 --> 26:21.300\nThat's you\n\n26:22.100 --> 26:25.380\nYou guys need a fucking linguistic shower\n\n26:26.500 --> 26:31.300\nOr a linguistic bath or a bath. What's better linguistic shower? I'd rather they take a bath. It'll\n\n26:31.940 --> 26:33.940\nabsolve them more\n\n26:34.020 --> 26:37.860\nWe're off it. I feel like I think I think this is the sweet spot is uh\n\n26:37.940 --> 26:42.740\nIf you have the time and you're tired is laying down in the tub and let the water hit you and you get\n\n26:42.740 --> 26:45.940\nAnd but you know what laying down in the shower feels real like\n\n26:46.660 --> 26:50.740\nSad it feels like post rape or something. Yeah, that's yes\n\n26:52.420 --> 26:54.420\nGet it off me\n\n26:54.500 --> 26:59.060\nAfter after I've had good sex I go into the bathroom and take that's what you call good sex\n\n27:00.820 --> 27:03.140\nI I take a little rape bath afterwards\n\n27:07.060 --> 27:09.620\nThat's a great I love that I like things in my ass\n\n27:09.620 --> 27:13.300\nOh my god, I love that that that's a thing rape bath like a\n\n27:14.100 --> 27:19.300\nLike a real estate person like all right.

You're moving up in the world\n\n27:26.180 --> 27:31.060\nA rape bath, you know, it's not good. You know what nobody likes a rape shower a rape shower is the worst\n\n27:31.540 --> 27:34.100\nWell, he was saying I mean that's a thing if you're sitting in the shower\n\n27:34.180 --> 27:37.700\nIt's because you're either been abducted by aliens or or have been taken\n\n27:37.700 --> 27:40.340\nOr you just found out that fickle design horn\n\n27:43.460 --> 27:46.100\nWhat what that was a real deep\n\n27:47.060 --> 27:49.060\nReal deep Ace Ventura\n\n27:50.420 --> 27:52.420\nWe need a character for deep cuts.

Yeah\n\n28:43.140 --> 28:45.140\nLike a pc update\n\n28:45.780 --> 28:50.260\nLike we fixed it. That's a martin luther king made that speech. I have a dream that one day\n\n28:50.260 --> 28:55.300\nThe children will play high five the gay guy instead of smear the queer instead of\n\n28:56.660 --> 28:58.660\nPunch him in the fucking that was one, you know\n\n28:58.900 --> 29:03.540\nI apologize to enti who was sitting in the front row because when we were we were playing certain games\n\n29:03.540 --> 29:08.100\nWe would say uh, we would pick who was it and we had this in midwestern, wisconsin\n\n29:08.100 --> 29:10.100\nIt was the 70s 80s ago\n\n29:10.340 --> 29:13.700\nEenie meenie minie moe and we didn't always say catch the tiger by the toe\n\n29:13.700 --> 29:16.500\nNo, we definitely in pakistan did not say tiger\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:20.340\nWait, you got wait, what what did you say jew? Oh, yeah, no\n\n29:21.380 --> 29:22.900\nThat doesn't rhyme\n\n29:22.900 --> 29:27.860\nCatch the jew by the toe. Come on. That's your that was your you guys were like into rhyming\n\n29:28.820 --> 29:31.060\nYeah, everybody's into rhyming\n\n29:31.860 --> 29:33.860\nhearts beat beneath these chests\n\n29:36.180 --> 29:38.180\nJew-hating hearts, I thought\n\n29:38.180 --> 29:45.940\nWell, I know I need to go over there and like no, yeah, it's skippable\n\n29:49.780 --> 29:53.620\nIs that is that on the pamphlet of the hotel lobby?

We're never thought. Oh\n\n30:16.340 --> 30:21.940\nThis game will keep gay people from from infiltrating society or voting or getting married\n\n30:22.020 --> 30:24.420\nI was never thinking that like you just taught that as a kid\n\n30:25.220 --> 30:27.060\nAnd I'm not I'm not saying it's good or permissible\n\n30:27.060 --> 30:31.300\nI'm just saying like when you're a kid you're pure like you don't you really don't there's no reason\n\n30:31.380 --> 30:35.380\nYeah, only the only people who can say the n-word are black people and kids right they can\n\n30:35.380 --> 30:37.380\nAnd\n\n30:37.380 --> 30:44.980\nAnd and and white comedy writers who who are making a sandwich by themselves. Can I pitch that as a title of this episode?\n\n30:48.580 --> 30:51.220\nCan't say the n-word say the n-wordest things\n\n30:52.900 --> 30:54.900\nIn between gay bashing\n\n30:55.380 --> 30:56.500\nI\n\n30:56.500 --> 31:03.620\nHonestly, we say I forgot about smear the queer.

I I I I'm obsessed with race, but I'm not as obsessed with uh, homophobia\n\n31:26.820 --> 31:32.580\nI'm not I haven't come I feel like the equation was race and homophobia not race and homosexuality\n\n31:32.580 --> 31:34.580\nThe equation is racism and homophobia\n\n31:35.060 --> 31:40.580\nI'm saying I I need to I need to put a couple more poker chips on double zero for the gay people\n\n31:41.380 --> 31:44.580\nAlthough they wake up and can totally pass for white. I mean\n\n31:47.700 --> 31:49.700\nSo, yeah, that's\n\n31:52.660 --> 31:57.700\nLike we we can only find out you're gay like in if you say you prefer penises\n\n31:57.700 --> 32:04.660\nRight, like like like black people gonna come up with a loan officer. Yeah with black people you can tell over the phone\n\n32:15.620 --> 32:21.940\nIf you're if you're a gay guy and you want to you blend into straight society, it's as simple as growing a big bushy mustache\n\n32:24.260 --> 32:25.860\nIs that right\n\n32:25.860 --> 32:28.420\nBy the way, Pakistan was very very racist\n\n32:29.060 --> 32:30.580\nagainst\n\n32:30.580 --> 32:32.580\nJewish people, of course\n\n32:32.580 --> 32:38.180\nHindus of course, but also black people and we didn't we didn't have any black people\n\n32:39.300 --> 32:41.300\nSo weird. Yeah\n\n32:41.300 --> 32:43.300\nSo what was that about?\n\n32:44.100 --> 32:46.100\nI think we were going off you guys\n\n32:48.500 --> 32:50.500\nWe were like, you know when like the\n\n32:50.500 --> 32:55.940\nThe big bully at school is like the cool guy is like this is what we hate. Oh, okay.

That's America because whatever we're there\n\n33:08.180 --> 33:13.620\nWe just see like Snoopy and Garfield and mark all the animal ones, you know\n\n33:14.100 --> 33:17.940\nWe then you come here and it's fucking Jerry Springer and stuff.

I don't know. It's from Indiana Jones. Not that you would know. What a great segue\n\n34:15.460 --> 34:17.460\nBecause we just found out in the green room\n\n34:18.020 --> 34:20.900\nThat Spencer Crittenden human snow drift\n\n34:21.460 --> 34:24.100\nWhat wait, what does that mean?

So yeah, I got it, but there's a lot of I mean there's a little I mean this audience is a\n\n34:55.300 --> 35:00.820\nSee you you'll love it people spencer's age. I don't think it's an age thing. I don't think it's an age thing\n\n35:00.820 --> 35:05.060\nI think it's an age thing plus. I think it's an age that you guys assume. It's an age thing\n\n35:05.140 --> 35:09.460\nI think everyone my age has definitely had to see like like their actual\n\n35:10.020 --> 35:12.100\nuh, uh stormtroopers came to your house and\n\n35:12.900 --> 35:15.620\nAnd drove you to the movie. I was four years old\n\n35:15.780 --> 35:19.860\nI remember being four years old when star wars came out at the orange sonorama dome\n\n35:20.180 --> 35:24.660\nAnd I remember my dad picking me up out of the theater and walking to the parking lot\n\n35:24.660 --> 35:30.580\nBecause I was crying when Darth Vader came out because I was because I was fucking four and there's a\n\n35:31.140 --> 35:33.620\nThere's a guy shaped like an evil black cock\n\n35:36.660 --> 35:39.540\nIt's a big deal man, and I was raised pakistani so you know how\n\n35:41.220 --> 35:43.220\nHow hard we hate black cock\n\n35:43.220 --> 35:53.460\nNothing scarier than a big powerful black cock our actual slogan was it's pakistan not blackistan\n\n35:55.620 --> 35:58.580\nSpencer I have a question for you. Yes shower bath\n\n35:59.220 --> 36:05.620\nUh, I I you know I'm gonna go with some of the audience members. I enjoy a good shower bath now and again shower bath\n\n36:05.780 --> 36:11.220\nYeah, yeah the combo down and I crumple myself into a small fetal form\n\n36:11.220 --> 36:15.220\nYeah, because you're tall right house. It was six three six three or four\n\n36:15.380 --> 36:20.260\nYeah, like same as me and we don't fit in normal bathtubs. No like you know on tour\n\n36:20.980 --> 36:22.980\nLike there was two\n\n36:22.980 --> 36:29.220\nBath, you know showers that were that were I I could stand up and there was there was a ceiling mounted\n\n36:29.300 --> 36:31.300\nThere was only one that you and I could share. Yeah\n\n36:32.820 --> 36:34.980\nIt was a real taxing time for us\n\n36:34.980 --> 36:36.980\nYeah\n\n36:39.700 --> 36:42.100\nBut yeah, but the combo is the best I have to say\n\n36:43.140 --> 36:44.900\nAs the combos\n\n36:44.900 --> 36:47.780\nI'm not I'm not I'm not being patriotic about it\n\n36:47.860 --> 36:53.220\nBut the combo I don't get because when you're the only reason I can finally take baths\n\n36:53.780 --> 36:58.340\nIs because I bought a house that has this like sunken dolly part in bath in it\n\n36:58.820 --> 37:04.260\nLike it's it's it's very big and my giant. I'm not as tall as jeff or spencer\n\n37:04.260 --> 37:12.420\nI'm six foot period and uh, I I I've I've often tried I've tried of like on the on the tour\n\n37:12.500 --> 37:16.100\nI was like like like erin would go you don't want to take baths in the hotel to take a bath\n\n37:16.260 --> 37:18.260\nYeah, I'll take a nice relaxing bath\n\n37:18.820 --> 37:24.740\nLike hannah barbaric cartoon like my knees are next to my ears. It's silly. It doesn't nothing's getting soaked for me\n\n37:24.820 --> 37:28.180\nI want to soak my body soak it like a dirty dish\n\n37:28.580 --> 37:33.700\nIt's about simulated rainfall like I I'm from california where it never rains rain is exciting\n\n37:33.700 --> 37:37.380\nSo the idea of being in a shower and rain hitting you is like it's like this visceral\n\n37:38.020 --> 37:44.100\nUh experience. I do have one. I always want to someday have a house where the entire ceiling is a shower\n\n37:44.660 --> 37:46.660\nSo you can just kind of walk around everywhere\n\n37:48.100 --> 37:52.900\nI think I could handle that I think I've been at like hawaiian resorts and things every once in a while\n\n37:52.980 --> 37:59.300\nYour hotel room will like you'll luck out and you're like what the fuck and there'll be like a crazy rich person thing where\n\n37:59.300 --> 38:04.500\nLike you get the uh, the joan crofford mommy dearest shower where there's like 19 jets\n\n38:04.500 --> 38:08.820\nOh, yeah in every direction the best. Yeah, that I'll do so we can all agree\n\n38:08.900 --> 38:14.740\nLet's all be rich and and live in hawaii where they also the temperature doesn't change. That's the other thing about a shower\n\n38:15.460 --> 38:19.780\nWell, you're gonna contradict that. No, no, no, go ahead. Go ahead. I don't think it's a safe environment\n\n38:20.180 --> 38:23.220\nHere's the thing. Let me let me walk you through taking a shower\n\n38:26.020 --> 38:28.020\nWow, you got all your clothes\n\n38:28.020 --> 38:30.660\nYou got all your clothes if you've just tuned in\n\n38:31.460 --> 38:34.900\nWait, we're about to blow Prairie Home companion out of the fucking water\n\n38:35.780 --> 38:41.300\nWait, I'll tell you this one thing. Okay. First of all, it's very presumptuous of you\n\n38:41.940 --> 38:43.780\nUh, walking me through a shower\n\n38:43.780 --> 38:47.780\nBut also if you have to do that, you don't have to start with me having my clothes on like\n\n38:48.420 --> 38:53.620\nWe could skip that. This is exactly the point. I'm talking about. Okay. Okay. See this is exactly everything that you take for granted\n\n38:53.620 --> 38:58.820\nYou don't understand what it's like to be it mean like you you you don't get it. No, I don't\n\n38:59.060 --> 39:01.460\nIt's like like my clothes are on\n\n39:02.020 --> 39:06.100\nThey're already on it taking them off. That's a big deal\n\n39:07.140 --> 39:10.740\nLike it's it's like all kinds of shit like like I'm taking all my clothes off\n\n39:10.900 --> 39:14.580\nI think I think everyone else in the room is like, oh, I can't wait to get all these clothes off\n\n39:14.580 --> 39:17.620\nI'm like, god damn it. Fucking another sock really\n\n39:18.500 --> 39:20.500\ntwo feet I have\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:22.980\nYeah, I am backwards. I talk.

Yeah, you're cornered man. Well, you're down with the bath and I just don't like showering and I\n\n41:19.620 --> 41:21.540\nIf I if I'm clean it's because I took a bath\n\n41:21.620 --> 41:22.980\nBut what what is it about the show?\n\n41:22.980 --> 41:28.260\nIs it the physical act of standing and being hit by water or is it the fact that people told you as a kid that you\n\n41:28.260 --> 41:32.020\nYou don't shower. You're a bad. All right. It's all the above starts in the playground\n\n41:32.340 --> 41:35.860\nThe worst people in the world the worst people that you would ever want controlling society\n\n41:36.580 --> 41:41.780\nAs the first purveyors of the information, uh, you need you need to take more showers\n\n41:42.260 --> 41:44.740\nI take dude. I take like three showers a day\n\n41:45.620 --> 41:50.180\nI wish I wish I didn't have to go to school so I could take more showers and I'm just going like okay\n\n41:50.420 --> 41:54.660\nFucking asshole shower asshole shower beating me up\n\n41:54.660 --> 41:59.860\nBecause I don't take showers and then I I've told you a lot of your school's hierarchy\n\n42:00.180 --> 42:02.980\nSocial hierarchy was based on shower frequency\n\n42:04.260 --> 42:06.260\nYes, as far as I'm concerned. Yes\n\n42:06.740 --> 42:10.580\nSo, I mean, I mean, maybe that's not a reality, but that was my emotional experience\n\n42:10.660 --> 42:14.980\nThat's exactly how I thought of it that the guys would go out and they'd throw a football as far as they could\n\n42:15.300 --> 42:22.420\nAnd they go was it 40 45 45 is better than 40. All right. Oh, I took so many showers today\n\n42:22.420 --> 42:26.100\nAnd I'd be like I can read everything\n\n42:27.700 --> 42:32.820\nBut what if what if somebody said uh, what what if there's like the the the captain of the football team said\n\n42:33.540 --> 42:38.820\nI prefer just soaking in a nice leisurely bath. I would probably be the world's greatest tight end\n\n42:39.940 --> 42:43.380\nBut or linebacker or whatever you do. But here's the problem. That was an unfortunate pun\n\n42:44.100 --> 42:46.500\nToo many dots to connect. I but when you were\n\n42:48.740 --> 42:51.140\nWhen you're in the bath you're making um\n\n42:51.140 --> 42:52.180\num\n\n42:52.180 --> 42:54.180\nYour own\n\n42:55.940 --> 42:57.940\nYou're making\n\n42:58.420 --> 43:00.420\nYou're making Dan Harmon az you\n\n43:02.820 --> 43:07.220\nThat's exactly right. All right, is it a metaphor for where you are in life? Are you just\n\n43:08.340 --> 43:13.940\nSitting in this I don't know. Is that the the more narcissistic way to bathe is to just no\n\n43:13.940 --> 43:20.260\nStealing your own juice. I don't you still in your own juice. You don't want the talent to go down the drain\n\n43:21.780 --> 43:25.220\nI don't want to lose to merge yourself or just inhale it like I think snorted up\n\n43:25.540 --> 43:27.540\nI don't want to lose any of my essence\n\n43:28.660 --> 43:30.660\nI'm just gonna put it back into me\n\n43:31.300 --> 43:35.620\nDo you feel that the shower robs you of your essential oils? What do you guys think I do it?\n\n43:35.620 --> 43:39.380\nDo you think I bottle it and put it in the next to the fire firewood pile?\n\n43:39.380 --> 43:43.860\nI think you're drinking it. It's just the secret on the label. I\n\n43:45.620 --> 43:50.580\nEnjoy being clean but not not not in terms with this like like these guys\n\n43:50.740 --> 43:56.420\nSo it was three parts. It was that and then it was the fact that okay. Here's the deal when you turn in the shower\n\n43:57.060 --> 44:01.620\nOkay, and everyone go ahead bob before you got here. Everyone already made fun of me for this\n\n44:02.340 --> 44:04.340\nThe water hurts\n\n44:04.340 --> 44:08.580\nIt stings it stings when it hits the surface of my skin\n\n44:09.940 --> 44:14.500\nAnd I'm only gonna say this once and I have not any chills for you for saying that out loud\n\n44:15.540 --> 44:17.540\nI am not diagnosing myself\n\n44:20.820 --> 44:27.940\nIn my head you're the whole body the skin it hurts I in my head your shower says sony on it by the way\n\n44:27.940 --> 44:34.740\nI wouldn't be surprised to me at all all those tubes lead to one place. Yeah for sure\n\n44:35.140 --> 44:40.260\nSome big pyramid in space just pumping out things that did you have a terrible shower nozzle because like\n\n44:40.740 --> 44:44.180\nI have experienced enough different ones at the college\n\n44:44.180 --> 44:48.820\nYou had to shower in the multiple dorms and it was that little like nozzle that it was just like\n\n44:49.300 --> 44:51.300\nLike being sandblasted to pieces\n\n44:51.860 --> 44:54.900\nAnd I think maybe that's where my love of sitting down on the shower came from\n\n44:54.900 --> 44:57.940\nBut if you stood up at six or four if you got that in the shoulders\n\n44:58.500 --> 45:00.500\nIt took off the first couple layers of skin\n\n45:01.220 --> 45:04.980\nSo I think I just learned to curl down like in a corner and like let let let let the rain\n\n45:04.980 --> 45:06.580\nI only bring this up because there's so much contention\n\n45:06.580 --> 45:14.260\nI I'm not diagnosing myself, but I have in all my research like I've it is a symptom of it's an it's a spectrum thing\n\n45:14.420 --> 45:21.780\nWhere like it's like you don't you like tactile like stinging with the water and the thing\n\n45:21.780 --> 45:28.500\nUh, I but I'm not I'm not playing that hard or I just did bro. I think it's like\n\n45:29.220 --> 45:31.220\nBut see to me the shower is also\n\n45:32.020 --> 45:35.380\nAnd maybe have your back on in this. It's the lifetime movie\n\n45:35.620 --> 45:40.340\nOr you know where it's like where you go after the rate. This is my other point\n\n45:40.900 --> 45:42.020\nWait, so\n\n45:42.020 --> 45:47.940\nBob you and I are the same person. Did you make that right?

Let's look into it afterwards. Those nuts may be from brazil\n\n47:33.620 --> 47:38.100\nI think they are I think I don't I don't think they resemble brazilian people but also\n\n47:38.740 --> 47:44.100\nBut they do resemble the toes of black people. I I didn't say that you did. No, I didn't\n\n47:46.980 --> 47:51.540\nI can't I'm so sorry tonight. What if a black guy's foot really looked like that like\n\n47:51.540 --> 47:58.340\nLike like like genically brazilian nuts the same language.

Whoa. Whoa nice\n\n48:42.580 --> 48:44.580\nWhy did nuts?\n\n48:46.340 --> 48:49.460\nNot sure yeah, because it's not only\n\n48:51.140 --> 48:53.300\nA euphemism for\n\n48:53.300 --> 48:55.780\nmen's genitals. It's also\n\n48:57.220 --> 48:59.220\nHow you describe mentally ill people\n\n49:00.020 --> 49:05.780\nAnd they're like, we're just an excellent source of protein. Yeah. Yeah, we never asked us just everybody back off\n\n49:05.780 --> 49:12.100\nOh, all we did was be cultivated by accident. We didn't do anything wrong.

Peanut who's the fanciest richest nut of all time. That's clearly just compensation\n\n49:31.380 --> 49:38.180\nYeah, yeah, that's yeah, that's there used to there was a thing when I was at the we take our nuts very seriously\n\n49:38.580 --> 49:40.580\nat the fisher nut\n\n49:41.140 --> 49:43.140\nCompany that was a commercial back then\n\n49:43.780 --> 49:47.140\nThey were like like good.

I'm just a scholastic mess. I don't know what to do in my life\n\n50:54.100 --> 50:56.100\nAll right, well\n\n50:56.100 --> 50:57.380\nSo are you in college?\n\n50:57.380 --> 51:03.060\nYeah, I really wanted to go to medical school and then I moved to santa barbara and somebody would from medical school\n\n51:03.140 --> 51:08.420\nBy the way, let's let's note that you get you get a lot of partying done at medical school\n\n51:09.460 --> 51:13.780\nI really wanted to be a plastic surgeon and now I think I want to do sketch comedy\n\n51:15.220 --> 51:16.980\nWow\n\n51:16.980 --> 51:20.020\nToo very very noble fields in hollywood\n\n51:21.220 --> 51:23.460\nWe had we had the same thing last week. That's weird\n\n51:23.460 --> 51:26.980\nWe went things for sure. You definitely don't need to move to any other city like\n\n51:27.860 --> 51:31.140\nLike no matter what you decide to do. Yeah, you could go back and forth between those two\n\n51:31.140 --> 51:34.340\nYou'll always be in the acropolis of uh of both of them\n\n51:34.580 --> 51:38.820\nSo so you wait wait, but at this point in time are you like an undergrad at a college?\n\n51:39.540 --> 51:42.260\nCould you combine the two like we need a nose?\n\n51:45.700 --> 51:48.980\nAnd some sort of cleft palate a place a cleft palate\n\n51:48.980 --> 51:52.020\nYeah, we'll make you smile\n\n51:53.300 --> 51:56.980\nAll right, so Sophie see you're you're you're at a crossroads right now\n\n51:57.620 --> 52:02.260\nYou're in what year of your college, uh course. What do you call it?\n\n52:02.340 --> 52:05.380\nI would be a senior at UC Davis and then I left to go\n\n52:06.260 --> 52:07.540\nThank you\n\n52:07.540 --> 52:09.540\nThat's john davis back there\n\n52:10.740 --> 52:15.460\nAnd then I left to go to santa barbara and like maybe try this like acting thing\n\n52:15.460 --> 52:19.540\nWait, so I'm a terrible interviewer\n\n52:19.860 --> 52:25.140\nAnd uh, so if if you were going to pursue acting you would go to santa barbara. Is that what you're saying?\n\n52:27.380 --> 52:31.220\nThis is why I'm like a mess like I'm taking chemistry and I'm also taking drama and singing\n\n52:32.020 --> 52:34.900\nI can smell your parents stomach acid from here\n\n52:39.700 --> 52:44.500\nI was just going to say I can smell the cw execs screaming their pants. I have\n\n52:44.500 --> 52:49.060\nLike she's she's she's going to medical school, but she wants to be a model and she\n\n52:50.340 --> 52:53.540\nIt's it's it's it's it's called medicining medicining Sophie\n\n52:55.540 --> 52:58.900\nYeah, it's even worse because Sophie if you had your Sophie's choice\n\n53:00.260 --> 53:02.260\nTaken taken\n\n53:03.300 --> 53:05.700\nSo that that was the non gay best friend of\n\n53:07.300 --> 53:09.300\nIntermediate high five person\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:15.060\nUh, if you had your dream, uh, if you could do anything, would you be a famous actress or like comedian?\n\n53:15.300 --> 53:19.460\nI want to do like snl type stuff, but like probably not that much more like\n\n53:20.340 --> 53:24.260\nYouTube kind of thing. So your aim is to be on youtube?\n\n53:27.220 --> 53:32.020\nYou could do that tonight. Yeah, actually you already are probably yeah\n\n53:32.900 --> 53:37.140\nSomebody make a dream come true. Dreams are coming too. I want to be on vine\n\n53:37.140 --> 53:43.060\nNow I'm confused you want to get on snl to break into youtube\n\n53:45.620 --> 53:49.700\nIt's a weird way around it. Yeah, that's a big step down from snl\n\n53:50.260 --> 53:53.780\nSophie what qualifies you to be on youtube? Oh, oh, I see you went to medical school\n\n53:55.060 --> 54:01.300\nVery well. Yeah, and you were on snl for three years. All right one more question one more question. Sophie shower or bath\n\n54:01.300 --> 54:06.180\nBaths are for birds and babies, and I am neither\n\n54:12.580 --> 54:16.900\nAll right, well, so fee is there is there is there a crossroads that we can identify and help you with though\n\n54:17.060 --> 54:20.100\nthat you're you're saying like like like you're you're in your\n\n54:21.060 --> 54:23.060\nblank year of\n\n54:23.060 --> 54:26.260\nCollege you're thinking I would I would like to\n\n54:26.260 --> 54:33.540\nTo reconstruct people's faces, but I would also like to entertain people and and there's a fork in the road\n\n54:33.940 --> 54:38.180\nSo what what is there a I mean like like okay?\n\n54:38.500 --> 54:43.780\nWhat's the next choice you're going to have to make if you choose one or the other medical school or not medical school?\n\n54:44.660 --> 54:50.340\nMeaning that that coming up you're going to have to do what you're going to have to fill out an application for a medical school\n\n54:50.420 --> 54:52.420\nor that you're actually going to have to\n\n54:52.420 --> 54:54.420\nLike like like\n\n54:55.780 --> 55:02.500\nBecause I'm alien to the territory. Okay, so so you need our help in deciding between the medical path and a\n\n55:03.220 --> 55:07.140\nPerformance path. I have a diagnosis for your I think this is what is happening\n\n55:07.140 --> 55:12.020\nCan I say I'm just going to ask someone who was also expected to become a doctor and now I am not a doctor\n\n55:12.420 --> 55:14.420\nWhy are you laughing?\n\n55:14.900 --> 55:20.020\nJust don't don't bully her make sure no no i'm not bullying her what i'm saying is this is what it seems to me is happening\n\n55:20.020 --> 55:23.060\nIs that your parents had an expectation of you to be a doctor?\n\n55:23.060 --> 55:27.380\nPerhaps or an expectation you put on yourself based on people you'd seen and whatever\n\n55:27.860 --> 55:34.740\nAnd so then you later decided that you really wanted to be an actor and for you plastic surgery is sort of one step\n\n55:35.140 --> 55:38.340\nIn the medical field and one step in showbiz. It's sort of\n\n55:38.980 --> 55:43.700\nOr or comedy or comedy. Yeah, so you definitely want to be\n\n55:44.260 --> 55:47.780\nFunny and and entertain people that you get your passion is not for\n\n55:47.780 --> 55:50.820\nFor medicine that's not for medicine\n\n55:51.940 --> 55:54.420\nYeah, you know, I you know initially I was\n\n55:55.460 --> 55:58.980\nthinking about the fat patch Adams nicely played young man\n\n56:01.220 --> 56:03.220\nNicely played young man\n\n56:03.540 --> 56:06.180\nI know he is there. I was just talking to morke. Um\n\n56:07.140 --> 56:11.300\nYeah, he was out there. That's that's an amazing thing about meltdown. That's a fancy. It's like narnia\n\n56:11.380 --> 56:14.340\nLike you could like like Robin Williams could be looking at watchman\n\n56:14.340 --> 56:20.180\nAnd go do you want to do do you want to go do the show? No, no, no, I'm cool. I'll stay here\n\n56:24.100 --> 56:26.900\nI want to find out what would happen if Batman grew up in the 50s\n\n56:28.420 --> 56:30.420\nI don't know\n\n56:30.500 --> 56:35.300\nYou know, I was this best man and it's really what and I feel like such a heel that I do\n\n56:35.380 --> 56:40.500\nBut I don't do manic robin. I do robin. No, you do it. Yeah, I do. You were robin. We're his best man\n\n56:40.500 --> 56:43.860\nYeah, yes. Wow. And this the latest model\n\n56:45.940 --> 56:53.460\nIs it still running this model? Yeah. Yeah, the model's running. It's a lovely lovely lovely lovely woman. Um, but let's get back to, um, Sophie\n\n56:54.740 --> 56:58.980\nMy initial reaction was actually I got hostile like I was like thinking about\n\n56:59.460 --> 57:02.740\nDo you know what I mean? Like the cliche of no one's ever said quick\n\n57:03.300 --> 57:05.860\nHere's an emergency. Right. Is there a sketch comedian here?\n\n57:05.860 --> 57:13.060\nEverybody got a real plastic surgeon, but but then I thought that I was being very hypocritical because the advice I give to\n\n57:13.540 --> 57:20.340\nEverybody often including my own daughter is uh, you gotta quit man. You got to quit you you've got to do\n\n57:21.060 --> 57:24.980\nThat you know, what's right? You want to do this sketch then you got to do it\n\n57:25.300 --> 57:29.460\nAnd it's and it may seem selfish, but it's actually really brave\n\n57:30.180 --> 57:32.180\nNo one else no one's behind you right now\n\n57:32.180 --> 57:35.780\nI don't know if they're agreeing, but it sounds\n\n57:36.580 --> 57:41.780\nBut it's where your heart really is and in two weeks you might say I made a big mistake and all this stuff\n\n57:41.780 --> 57:45.860\nAnd it's okay to keep quitting you keep quitting and you keep keep quitting all through your life\n\n57:46.180 --> 57:49.220\nAnd eventually you end up some place where you don't want to leave\n\n57:51.540 --> 57:53.540\nAll right, thank you, Sophie\n\n57:53.540 --> 58:04.100\nI and I would I would rather I would rather sit in the front row of a show and watch a person who might have been a doctor\n\n58:04.660 --> 58:05.380\ndo\n\n58:05.380 --> 58:08.500\nBad comedy then be under the knife of somebody that would really\n\n58:12.100 --> 58:15.700\nI wish I was sherry o' cherry, but your cheekbones are\n\n58:15.700 --> 58:24.980\nThe unspoken part of capitalism the the healthy part is the idea that because\n\n58:25.300 --> 58:28.980\nWe have money and because anything that you can do can generate money\n\n58:29.220 --> 58:31.940\nThe idea is that unlike in monarchies\n\n58:32.420 --> 58:35.940\nAnything that you want to do you can figure out a way to make money doing it\n\n58:36.180 --> 58:40.100\nThe idea wasn't that your parents and give you a bunch of money\n\n58:40.100 --> 58:43.060\nAnd then they tell you what you're supposed to do and then you end up doing that\n\n58:43.060 --> 58:46.740\nEven though you don't quite want to do it because that's what a poor person does and all this shit\n\n58:47.140 --> 58:52.260\nLike like like the idea was supposed to be oh, it's capitalism like like like so\n\n58:52.740 --> 58:55.300\nFucking figure out a way like what's your passion?\n\n58:55.540 --> 59:01.860\nI like cutting up roadkill and taking the little squirrel skulls and gluing them to my forehead\n\n59:02.740 --> 59:04.740\nAnd just jumping up and down\n\n59:05.220 --> 59:07.780\nWell, you're the only got the market cornered on that\n\n59:07.780 --> 59:13.140\nThere's got to be a way to make that worth something if there isn't then you try as hard as you can\n\n59:13.380 --> 59:15.380\nAnd and and now that Kickstarter's here\n\n59:15.940 --> 59:21.860\nThere's but my but my heart first went to like wasn't even about bread. I was thinking about how you help people\n\n59:22.500 --> 59:25.300\nBut I've high-roaded, but you know you went for\n\n59:27.300 --> 59:34.420\nBut you went down like some like the genesis of some supervillain who's making maiming people\n\n59:34.420 --> 59:36.420\nSo\n\n59:37.300 --> 59:40.340\nMengele and the Riddler all got together and\n\n59:42.020 --> 59:44.020\nBut you really do have to be true to yourself\n\n59:44.820 --> 59:46.820\nYou know or or you will be\n\n59:47.860 --> 59:52.980\nYou know, I'm 50 and I rant in the valley and I've never been happier in my life, you know\n\n59:53.940 --> 59:58.420\nYeah, I mean just like as your career has been so interesting and so awesome\n\n59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.900\nYou've had so many sort of different things you've done and nobody could have predicted\n\n01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:08.100\nNo offense watching you in police academy. I've been like somebody. It's going to be an awesome\n\n01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:14.260\nDirector with a really good point of view and like really really like dark awesome movies. Nobody would have guessed that\n\n01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.860\nWhat was the award that you just won this you got some you got some accolades? Oh, it's nothing\n\n01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.780\nWhat is it who reads a square?\n\n01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:32.020\nDirector of the year. Yeah, but you know whatever there wasn't that many good movies this year\n\n01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.140\nIt was the easy\n\n01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.420\nYeah, I had lunch with Bob and I was telling him I go the you know\n\n01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:44.660\nWe know but the Charlie Kaufman thing we did a Kickstarter was like if there's ever been a director\n\n01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.100\nThat was like made\n\n01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:52.820\nMatch made for a Kickstarter project like if you showed up on that radar and said hey anybody got got 10 bucks\n\n01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.780\nThey want to anybody interested in making this thing that I want to make like I bet you would make like like like like\n\n01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.580\nEveryone would immediately crowdfund you because you've got this track record\n\n01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:09.380\nOf like obviously you only do exactly what you want to do and that's all anyone wants to pay to see is somebody that\n\n01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.660\nYou know they're like like Quentin Tarantino is within the studio system\n\n01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:18.740\nBut at least you're watching somebody that like you're like holy shit like I'm definitely watching whatever Quentin Tarantino wanted to do\n\n01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:25.220\nAnd not everybody gets to do that in and have major theatrical distribution, but I'm always trying to\n\n01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.940\nFigure out his formula\n\n01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:35.140\nOf being creative and then and yeah, and then but I'm not jealous. I'm more fascinated\n\n01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.420\nObviously like everybody I'm a huge fan, but I was thinking so we had\n\n01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300\nA slave burned down some plantation\n\n01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.660\nA ragtag team a nazi's kill Hitler\n\n01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.220\nI'm thinking the next is\n\n01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.220\nSomebody stops a plane from hitting a building\n\n01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.660\nI was gonna go with like a group of a scrappy group of altar boys kill the pope\n\n01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.820\nHe's pandering a little bit. Yeah, or you make they make him retire. We got pictures, you know\n\n01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:10.100\nBut you know Bravo Bravo executives bring out a shit full enders and Oliver stone\n\n01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.980\nLiterally did the fucking like a tower movie like Tarantino's obviously going well. I don't know\n\n01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:19.140\nI'm not sorry like like like what he's doing is cinematically. He's going. Oh these issues\n\n01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.140\nThey overcharge like a hot rod engine in a way that makes it go\n\n01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:29.460\nYeah, like it's like who who hates nazi who doesn't hate nazi's nobody\n\n01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:35.700\nYeah, and it lets him go fucking crazy. No, no, and it makes you it sounds\n\n01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.900\nSilly, but he's not manipulating but you're super happy watching it. I'm a huge fan\n\n01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:47.060\nUh, it didn't when you said that though. I was thinking like Quentin Tarantino's Hogan's heroes. I would love to see that\n\n01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:55.460\nHey, Bob, would you do us a big favor double-edged sword? You came up here. You you soaked up your accolades big funny Bob Hope cameo\n\n01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:02.260\nIt's kind of a cock. My girlfriend's sick tonight. She's not here. Could you play her part in dudges and dragons?\n\n01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.060\nSure, okay\n\n01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.060\nAll right. All right\n\n01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.060\nSpencer if you would dispense the uh\n\n01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.020\nUh\n\n01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.580\nThe character sheets, you know how it works, Bob. I I watched I have to say\n\n01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.020\nAnd uh, I'm with an open mind\n\n01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:23.780\nBut uh when I went to the uh homecoming show at the egyptian when you did this part, I couldn't have been more lost\n\n01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.260\nYeah, well because that was a rat fuck\n\n01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.020\nOh, okay. Yeah, yeah, that was all over the kitchen, man\n\n01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.420\nNo, okay. Well, I'll try my best. That's all I can do. I don't think anybody's calling that uh, yeah, yeah\n\n01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:42.100\nBasically these character sheets. I tend to stare at them with my eyeballs, but I'm not actually reading anything on them\n\n01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.100\nI'm just nervous\n\n01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:50.340\nYeah, this is gonna I just just put the first time last week and it didn't make any sense to me\n\n01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.780\nSo just sort of go with it. The idea is like spensters the narrator\n\n01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.820\nHe tells you what's going on and he's the final judge of everything that happens and he has dice and he has a\n\n01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:06.100\nAn encyclopedic knowledge of rules to guide him, but you tell him on a turn-by-turn basis like what it is you want to do\n\n01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:10.260\nUm, and he'll tell you whether or not that's uh available to you\n\n01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:15.700\nAnd if it's something hard for you to do he'll roll the dice and you'll find out the outcome of that is that correct spencer\n\n01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.620\nThat's correct. All right, and your character is kind of like has has arrows and shoots a lot of arrows\n\n01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:24.420\nShe just uh last week she fucked Dan under a horse\n\n01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.500\nOh, that's right. You yeah, she used to be a dude\n\n01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:35.060\nYou're in love with me. How's she you're in love with the aunt used to be a dude you fucked him under a horse\n\n01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:39.060\nUh, you shoot arrows spencer if you would get us up to date\n\n01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.460\nLast time our heroes had split up\n\n01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.620\nSharpie and mole rain possessed with compassionate spirits charged off on coco the animal companion along\n\n01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.220\nthis length of the infinite fish in the hopes this is a run-on sense of\n\n01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.700\nFinding the fish-dwelling tribe of humans and a halfling in the wreckage of the fish\n\n01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:05.540\nBut the pair didn't realize the truly infinite nature of the infinite fish and soon retired\n\n01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:11.620\nGrip by passion and a sense of daring heroism the couple copulated in the shade of their great horse\n\n01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:19.380\nMeanwhile quark ran into a progress blocking thicket in the forest a massive wall of trees\n\n01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:25.220\nBelieving traps to be about he stood stock still allowing him to hear the approach of yet another stranger\n\n01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.100\nChristopher the songsman\n\n01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:33.860\nThe two caught up on recent happenings and bounced ideas for song titles off each other for a time\n\n01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:41.140\nYeah, but i've got Christopher, you know lady in red sang lady in red. Yeah, that's that's his character. He also wrote it\n\n01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:48.100\nIt's a great song. It's a good jam. Yeah, he's also a thief\n\n01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:57.220\nYeah, he also is a thief. That's so true 30 seconds pressure. I know I just I'm maybe I'm feeling uh\n\n01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:03.140\nRejoined by Sharpie and mole rain who bathing in the afterglow decided that the fish-dwelling folk of the infinite fish\n\n01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.260\nWere probably fine and charged swiftly towards the exact location\n\n01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:12.260\nThe party set off following Christopher their newfound guide toward the soul of growth. You did it again perfect\n\n01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.180\nHow do you do it special\n\n01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.580\nSo you're caught up right that all made sense. Oh, yeah, now I understand\n\n01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:26.420\nYeah, so uh, we're going off after a thing called the soul of growth\n\n01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:31.780\nYeah, and uh, I'm following my new my newfound possibly friend Chris de Burgh\n\n01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.180\nHopefully friend. Yeah singer songwriter\n\n01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:42.340\nOf the lady in red great. Uh, you've heard that song, right?

Yeah, I did. I think there was a dude in scarlet was one of them\n\n01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:04.900\nUh, I feel like they haven't really hit as hard as we're all together now. We've all caught up\n\n01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.060\nYou're all together following Chris de Burgh to the rumored location of the soul of growth\n\n01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:15.700\nOkay, I examine the uh immediate surroundings as you walk you notice the purple tinge of the sky beginning to ripple and change\n\n01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:24.180\nOh, the floating light giving orbs of this plane ceased shedding their brilliant light and one by one begin winning winking out of existence\n\n01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460\nSo so it's nighttime the sky\n\n01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:33.860\nIt changes to deep red and the shadows grow deep. I think it's uh, I just realized\n\n01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500\nIt's a fine line between spencer and prince\n\n01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.500\nIs there about to be a raspberry dawn\n\n01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.220\nThe sky is purple people running everywhere\n\n01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.780\nHoly won't you see\n\n01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.380\nUh, he's a good songwriter. You should be flattered.

It's probably some sort of artifact\n\n01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.100\nYou couldn't read the language\n\n01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.340\nDo I think it's a spell book?\n\n01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:45.220\nYou think it's some form of spell book or maybe I could read it and cast the spells from it if it was\n\n01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.900\nIf if you could read it like I can I read it?

That's that's the spell that was the first spell that you learned\n\n01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:33.620\nSo you could find something find father. I mean potentially don't don't wait. Don't already do it\n\n01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.220\nWe don't need your dad. It's pointless. It's a dumb spell\n\n01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:42.180\nIt brings your dad around.

So do we know what the blood sword spell is?\n\n01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.380\nI have an idea you get the idea that I could like slice\n\n01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.020\nsomething\n\n01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.020\nPerhaps a foe or enemy\n\n01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.820\nCould it give a zombie back its soul?\n\n01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:23.380\nMaybe you don't know that it can't can I uh because then they would suddenly be burdened with humanity again\n\n01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:32.100\nAnd it would be terrible doing they'd be like what the fuck are we doing a minute good? Well hunting wasn't good.

Aren't you glad you weren't holding the Avenger now? I?\n\n01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:08.260\nClimb a tree. I use my climb to climb the tallest tree around us. That happens and then\n\n01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:14.580\nUsing my far sword. I spin around with one hand like gene kelly in a lamp post\n\n01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.100\nAnd I swing around using my far sword attack\n\n01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:24.260\nI swing around and aim at all the zombies and try to get one far sword sweep and kill as many zombies as I can\n\n01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:30.340\nAs the spell blood blader goes off your far sword does as well\n\n01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:35.300\nA blade of air and a blade of blood fly through the area\n\n01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.460\nHey, you should have told us to dock you motherfucker. Yeah\n\n01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.860\nYou guys are cool. I wasn't aiming at you guys, but we couldn't even see it\n\n01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:51.300\nIt's a blade of air bro dealing 13 and 16 damage to two of the zombies slicing them into pieces\n\n01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:57.860\nYeah, I just killed two zombies everyone take it easy. You can I I climb down from the tree and fuck one of the dead zombies\n\n01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:03.940\nJesus Christ this guy. I fucking I got it. I'm hard as a diamond right here\n\n01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:09.540\nThis is an HBO original campaign. Don't you ever spoon?\n\n01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:18.260\nYeah, what's your refractory period?

Can I shoot a bow an arrow at one of the zombies? Don't just shoot the arrow\n\n01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.700\nWhat do you mean don't shoot the bow shoot the shoot the use the bow to shoot the air\n\n01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.060\nAfter you're all out of air. I got this thing I did bow\n\n01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:45.060\nI have a hundred bows in one arrow. So I'm pretty sure I know how this works\n\n01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:49.140\nMake make whatever you do with that bow count\n\n01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:56.420\nAll right, so I shoot an arrow at a guy your arrow plunges into the neck of one of the remaining zombie and it takes seven damage\n\n01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:03.620\nHow many are left that zombie is left the rest are entangled at the bottom. So it didn't die. It didn't quite die\n\n01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.580\nOh, fuck\n\n01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:08.740\nMaybe you should sing to it\n\n01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.100\nOh\n\n01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.340\nSummon monster two\n\n01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:21.860\nWhat monster do you want to summon the one that could cause the most damage to the most targets that are\n\n01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.500\nEntangled in the most amount of most squid\n\n01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:31.380\nSquid no not squid. That's literally the most wrong answer. Yeah. No, not squid\n\n01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.780\nI summon an ape. I'm so sorry.

Yes. So are we free of zombies right now?\n\n01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:32.580\nYou're free of unentangled zombies potentially the rest of them could get out if you give them longer\n\n01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:36.820\nAll right, we should go to the place that I know that the soul of growth is at. Yeah, where is it?\n\n01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:40.740\nIt's I know where it is. It's don't say radio city if we\n\n01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:45.060\nIt's there if we already drove by it.
