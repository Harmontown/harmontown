WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.720
What I said welcome back to Nerd Mountain Hollywood, California

00:20.320 --> 00:23.360
Guess what Harmontown is now in session

00:23.360 --> 00:34.400
Will you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon

00:54.320 --> 00:56.320
Rap

01:00.720 --> 01:06.360
Great we started at 8.06. Okay, so that I always get confused. I look over at that clock. I go how long we've been up here

01:07.280 --> 01:14.240
Basically since 8 so when it says 9 30 been up here for 90 minutes. Yeah, I'm insecure about our performance

01:15.160 --> 01:17.160
Dan your hair looks great. Thank you. I

01:18.920 --> 01:20.920
Took a shower

01:20.920 --> 01:22.920
I

01:22.960 --> 01:28.880
Raised home from work at Rick and Morty and I jumped in the shower and I didn't use that's not true

01:28.880 --> 01:31.720
That's not true. All right. I stopped at the drawing room. You're right. Yeah

01:33.320 --> 01:35.320
To tell you that I needed to take a shower

01:35.840 --> 01:43.320
After an hour of drinking, right? I mean, that's not there's no reason for I mean, let's just full disclosure

01:43.320 --> 01:47.520
Yeah, it's just your your commitment to honesty Jeff Davis's commitment to honesty

01:47.520 --> 01:53.480
Yeah, I took a shower tonight. You guys don't really usually see me after a shower

01:54.640 --> 01:58.360
That's kind of exciting. I don't know if I've ever been up here right after a shower

01:59.080 --> 02:01.080
No, and I don't know if it

02:01.800 --> 02:05.520
I don't know if it changes me or not. I don't know if they I clip my fingernails

02:05.520 --> 02:12.800
I don't I'm not embarrassed about so when you groom you commit to grooming. Yeah, I'm like, let's let's get back to basics here

02:12.800 --> 02:18.680
It's like a like a Narnia book, you know, where they they go on a lot of adventures and then there's a chapter where they just

02:18.680 --> 02:22.160
They go down to the riverbank and they scrub and you know

02:24.880 --> 02:28.840
The author describes their ruddy cheeks and their glistening hair and they

02:29.960 --> 02:31.960
Did he just put down the book and jerk off

02:34.320 --> 02:36.320
That sounds like a clean lion

02:36.320 --> 02:43.840
I just remember people like every once in a while they bathe in these medieval adventures

02:43.840 --> 02:47.040
That's all I know and so I do it medieval style

02:58.280 --> 03:00.280
That was not affected because

03:00.880 --> 03:05.080
I've never been laughed at harder in school in fifth grade. I raised my hand in social studies

03:05.080 --> 03:08.560
I knew the answer to a question. They go and the teacher said Jeff

03:11.440 --> 03:17.240
I said like 30,000 times in this band of four seconds. That was a real that was a real one

03:17.240 --> 03:21.160
That was I mean, I don't fake them try to fake that you can't do it

03:23.160 --> 03:26.080
Yeah, I sound like a character from cars or something I

03:27.320 --> 03:29.320
Assume I haven't seen that movie

03:29.320 --> 03:36.160
Speaking of people who haven't seen movies, we're gonna bring up a guest or later on Jeff

03:36.160 --> 03:41.400
Who hasn't seen some key movies and we're gonna talk to him about it. That's a dumb teaser dumb

03:43.520 --> 03:45.520
Well because you have me

03:45.880 --> 03:52.720
That's not the purpose of a teaser as you go later on coming up if there's like a guy's gonna come with an anaconda

03:52.720 --> 03:57.200
We're gonna find out what it eats, you know, you don't say hey later on we're gonna talk about shit

03:57.200 --> 04:02.760
Oh, yeah, that doesn't that doesn't make any sense, but I don't want to later on Dan's gonna second guess what he says

04:02.760 --> 04:04.760
We're gonna talk about

04:05.080 --> 04:07.320
What were we talking about stammering stuttering hygiene?

04:07.960 --> 04:14.120
Okay, here's the thing. I'm sorry. I was taking a shower today, and I was 40 years old and I was a

04:15.360 --> 04:18.160
And Aaron had left a bottle of shampoo

04:19.440 --> 04:24.800
Like it spilled on the bottom of the toilet. What do you call it the bathtub?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.320
I

04:26.320 --> 04:28.320
Where do you shit and where do you?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
wash the shit out of your

04:31.560 --> 04:33.560
the bathtub was

04:33.560 --> 04:34.960
covered with

04:34.960 --> 04:36.480
shampoo and

04:36.480 --> 04:41.880
So when I got in it with my like like my my my enormous gross walrus like body

04:43.240 --> 04:45.240
Like the weight was just like all

04:45.560 --> 04:50.440
Slipping and sliding like there's no the the old German couple that left me this house

04:50.440 --> 04:56.400
They didn't they did a lot of weird things. There's kitchen tiles in the kitchen that have like the German word for honey on them

04:56.400 --> 04:58.600
And a little bear going like sigile, but

05:00.520 --> 05:05.720
There's all kinds of evidence if you look for it then an old German couple owned my house and kid took very good care of it

05:05.840 --> 05:12.200
You know they you might say they annexed the house and like like a jar full of gold tea brought a lot of order to it

05:13.920 --> 05:15.920
But but that was a

05:15.920 --> 05:17.920
I

05:24.720 --> 05:30.960
Like the thing I delightfully skipped off the surface of the of that lake like a you made a bear a Nazi earlier

05:32.320 --> 05:34.320
Yeah, it's cute

05:34.480 --> 05:39.000
The bear offsets you just like the drawer is gold teeth. It's like a pupil of us. I'm not

05:40.200 --> 05:44.560
Let's not fight Jeff. Let's not fight. I'm having a delightful time. Let me too. Me too. I love you

05:44.560 --> 05:50.160
I'm glad you're here. I'm glad the camera your hair looks terrific. Thank you. Oh, yeah, also. Yeah, we're fucking loose

05:50.160 --> 05:52.920
The camera fucking crew is not here anymore. There's no

05:53.960 --> 05:59.000
Not that not that not that not that they were bad people or that having a camera here was bad

05:59.000 --> 06:03.160
It's just fucking it's different. No, but if you look at difference, then here's a difference

06:03.160 --> 06:06.880
Because now for the first time in about a month and a half. I can do this I

06:06.880 --> 06:12.360
I can play license music Wow

06:15.720 --> 06:17.720
A place

06:17.960 --> 06:20.440
Where copyrights don't apply

06:21.720 --> 06:24.160
Where Sony can fuck off and die

06:24.880 --> 06:26.880
They call it

06:26.880 --> 06:39.360
When he Houston died of an overdose in a hotel and when her record started to sell

06:40.040 --> 06:45.880
Sony charged more for it. Look it up. It's a fucking huge ridiculous scandal

06:47.200 --> 06:53.720
If you just Google it, you will see that the company that fired me

06:53.720 --> 06:55.720
is

06:55.840 --> 07:01.080
Horrible and belongs in Nazi Germany

07:01.480 --> 07:03.800
And now we can steal boom

07:04.760 --> 07:06.760
Swiss

07:07.560 --> 07:09.560
Sony

07:10.360 --> 07:16.840
Sony a drawer full of gold teeth now. That's marketable

07:17.560 --> 07:20.280
All right, so to get

07:20.280 --> 07:22.280
I

07:22.160 --> 07:24.160
Feel good

07:25.440 --> 07:31.680
Yes, yes, yes, you love it you guys had to go for two months without ELO

07:33.000 --> 07:36.360
And death camp references they they love them both

07:37.560 --> 07:41.240
They eat them like s'mores the chocolate move the marshmallow

07:41.240 --> 07:45.720
I stepped into the shower and I started slipping because she left the shampoo

07:45.720 --> 07:52.400
She left it she just squirted shampoo on the on the floor

07:53.040 --> 07:57.680
She's she's she's young. She's vibrant. She's she's got she's trying to kill you. She's got

07:58.920 --> 08:00.920
This is the Agatha Christie novels

08:01.320 --> 08:08.600
She's got pots to cast she's got paintings to commission boyfriends to murder maybe but that would make more sense after

08:08.600 --> 08:12.680
So she's leaving liquid soap on the floor like Downton Abbey. It was

08:12.680 --> 08:14.600
Oh

08:14.600 --> 08:18.280
Okay, I saw high fives out there

08:19.720 --> 08:26.640
The weird thing is there's three people in the front row here two of them crossed over the person sitting in the middle of them to do a

08:26.640 --> 08:32.000
Downton Abbey high five. So he's either her boyfriend and

08:32.640 --> 08:34.640
Doesn't truck with no Downton Abbey

08:34.880 --> 08:39.120
And he's the fucking Downton Abbey watching guy that's gonna fuck her after

08:39.120 --> 08:41.920
He's on deck

08:44.560 --> 08:50.920
Or I don't know what wait, what are the other I don't know any other configurations. I was gonna I was gonna say gay best friend

08:50.920 --> 08:55.840
Oh, okay, okay. She said yes. Wait. Are you the gay best friend gay best friend?

09:03.520 --> 09:08.160
Wait, are you guys a couple? Oh, okay, so just straight friend

09:08.160 --> 09:10.160
You're just hanging out on deck

09:14.160 --> 09:15.680
You're playing the platonic game

09:15.680 --> 09:20.160
She's gonna end up having a boyfriend a straight platonic friend and a gay best friend

09:20.320 --> 09:24.600
That's amazing and the gay guys gonna have a straight best friend and that they're gonna end up hookin up later

09:24.600 --> 09:26.840
He's just gonna be like a Chinese kite just like with this

09:28.840 --> 09:30.840
Tail of

09:31.360 --> 09:33.360
Entourage

09:33.360 --> 09:37.160
Anyway, so I'm slipping in the shower

09:38.160 --> 09:43.580
And I know no tangents tonight. No, I don't know that all of this has been germane to

09:44.760 --> 09:46.760
Jackson

09:46.920 --> 09:49.320
Dum dum dum no word play tonight. No

09:52.000 --> 09:58.640
Germane Jackson of the type of tangents that aren't gonna happen tonight. The first one is a phonetic

09:58.640 --> 10:03.440
Just because you hear yourself say germane, you don't have to say Jackson

10:05.480 --> 10:11.920
That's rule number one I was slipping in the shower and I made me hyper conscious of my environment

10:11.920 --> 10:17.840
Here's my thing Jeff one of my many things. I don't like showering. I like bathing and

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
Thank you. Thank you

10:21.200 --> 10:26.680
For the top like like I realized what a treacherous place it is

10:26.680 --> 10:30.120
It started to make me I was like I started slipping and I was like Jesus Christ

10:30.120 --> 10:34.200
I took my it was like oh she left the shampoo. It's like and I put it down the drain

10:34.200 --> 10:35.560
It's like that's why people slip in the shower

10:35.560 --> 10:40.720
Wait, she just left a big glob of shampoo on the bottom of the shower or a ghost knocked it down

10:40.720 --> 10:46.300
I don't know man. There was a there was a shampoo bottle like down on the floor of the

10:46.300 --> 10:52.540
Tub yeah leaking shampoo. Yeah, so like an oil slick, right? I was taking a hurried shower

10:53.900 --> 10:57.620
Maybe she wanted to kill me tonight and that's why she's not here, right?

10:58.020 --> 11:01.740
She's she said she was she she has an alibi. She's in Belize right now

11:02.820 --> 11:04.820
None of that makes sense. None of that makes sense

11:05.340 --> 11:10.780
Not a perfect crime. I slip in the shower. She gets no money because she's I'm just her boyfriend that slipped in a shower

11:10.780 --> 11:16.420
She's in the other room when it happens. They'd still accuse her of murder. It doesn't none of it makes sense

11:16.420 --> 11:18.740
I would thrill you to no end, but it doesn't make sense

11:20.580 --> 11:24.420
We love each other and we belong together and you're a bad bad bad person

11:26.660 --> 11:31.700
The I start I became hyper conscious of the shower environment and I started to think to myself

11:31.700 --> 11:37.300
You know what all of these houses that you always see on TV in the movies and in your own homes

11:37.300 --> 11:44.100
They always have a shower in them and I started to started to really sink in I think other people other than me really like

11:44.100 --> 11:46.100
to take showers

11:46.100 --> 11:48.100
right

11:49.140 --> 11:51.140
So like

11:51.420 --> 11:53.420
How many people in the room?

11:53.900 --> 11:55.900
Don't like taking showers

11:58.740 --> 12:01.740
Four four or five four or five

12:02.860 --> 12:04.540
Okay, you

12:04.540 --> 12:11.020
Would you you like baths? Okay, so those those four people have bath. There's no there's no question

12:11.020 --> 12:13.740
That a bath is better than a shower, but like sometimes you don't have time

12:13.740 --> 12:19.820
You know the shower is an expedient, but how many people in the room consider it a like oh boy

12:19.820 --> 12:24.940
I wish I could take a shower like like like like like like by applause

12:29.220 --> 12:30.340
That's the thing

12:30.340 --> 12:35.140
But also one of my favorite things is sometimes if you got the time a little bit of both you

12:35.540 --> 12:39.140
You plug you plug the drain you lay in there and you take a shower bath

12:39.820 --> 12:43.740
Wait what what bathtub can you fit in like you're you're taller than me?

12:43.740 --> 12:49.020
I uh you just get down there and like let's lay down. It's like look like like Herman Munster in a

12:51.060 --> 12:55.460
Sexy naked Herman muster in a tiny little like go-kart

12:55.460 --> 13:00.460
He's like he's laid down there and the water fills up and the waters you know cools off a little quicker when you're the hot water

13:00.460 --> 13:03.340
Coming down is the greatest I don't get nothing other than baths

13:03.340 --> 13:08.500
I don't get it because like when my dishes are dirty they got a little lasagna to scrape them off like that's how you know

13:08.500 --> 13:15.020
Like you soak them soak you soak the dish you don't spray it, but you have a you have a dishwasher, and that's a shower

13:15.660 --> 13:21.260
Right, it's not so but you have to scrub the dish before you put it in the shower that in the in the in the dishwasher

13:21.260 --> 13:27.260
Yeah, I soak the plates or well and or I hire a lady who may or may not be

13:28.620 --> 13:30.620
Documented I don't know

13:30.900 --> 13:34.260
That's her business, and that's not a tangent. We're gonna get off on but

13:34.980 --> 13:38.900
My plates are currently clean so are my balls because I soak them

13:40.260 --> 13:45.180
This is enough of this topic. I was just thinking in my head while I was taking a shower today

13:45.900 --> 13:50.820
Like how much people like showers? It's not like a toilet. It's a different from a toilet

13:50.820 --> 13:54.900
The toilets there nobody well come sometimes pooping is fun like

13:55.540 --> 13:57.900
Cuz because there's a thing coming out of your butt now you but

13:58.420 --> 14:01.700
Feels good, so it's like put your thing up your butt same thing, but it's coming out

14:01.860 --> 14:06.700
But you then you have to wipe it and like it's poopy, and I don't have to I probably don't have to explain this

14:07.220 --> 14:10.980
Out of all the things I have to explain. I probably know this is probably the last thing I have to explain

14:12.580 --> 14:17.260
You know pooping works and that there's a there's a thing in the bathroom that's like there

14:17.260 --> 14:22.460
It's it's by necessity like it really is there because but a toilet is a bath for your poop

14:23.620 --> 14:27.580
And I always thought it's a bit of a shower was also there by necessity

14:28.260 --> 14:33.180
Because that was a just as the toilet was a device that kept poop from piling up

14:33.860 --> 14:38.140
The shower was a device that kept kids from picking on you. That was how I

14:38.140 --> 14:46.660
Like that that was that was how I was introduced to the concept of showering is that kids in the playground going you don't shower

14:47.380 --> 14:51.860
You have to shower. Fuck you. You're an asshole. You're a piece of shit

14:51.860 --> 14:55.980
But if you you better get in that shower and I'm like well unlike when I get on the toilet

14:55.980 --> 14:58.580
I don't actually it's not up to me like I

14:59.580 --> 15:01.580
It's just up to fucking Steve Ruel

15:01.580 --> 15:08.260
But if you had gotten up every morning and and known at you know when you were in the fifth grade that you liked baths and

15:08.300 --> 15:13.580
You took a bath every day you would have been clean and they wouldn't have that never would have been a topic, right?

15:14.020 --> 15:16.020
Yeah, maybe but yeah, maybe

15:17.260 --> 15:19.340
Yeah, don't don't blame high

15:20.420 --> 15:21.940
Cascading water

15:21.940 --> 15:24.740
But it was just a bathing thing. It was

15:25.420 --> 15:28.860
Bathing can be showering or like submerging yourself in a tub

15:28.860 --> 15:33.580
I think that everybody should wake up every morning. Not everybody. I don't care what you guys do

15:34.060 --> 15:36.540
I I would like it. I would like that

15:36.540 --> 15:42.020
I would be comfortable if everybody woke up every morning of it. I'm gonna I'm gonna take my little my little bath

15:42.900 --> 15:47.060
Because that's how you get clean you soak your whole dirty body and like

15:47.740 --> 15:50.300
Clean water and you can take a bath every day

15:50.860 --> 15:56.540
You can be a you can be a sexy calgon lady and you can you can get you can get in and have a little bubble bath every morning

15:56.540 --> 16:02.700
Well, I had my bath had to be fixed and now it is there's too much time in the bath as the old air supply song goes

16:03.660 --> 16:05.340
too much

16:05.340 --> 16:09.460
Time in the bed. I don't know. I don't know what band that is but it's not

16:11.460 --> 16:13.460
Well that out

16:14.060 --> 16:16.900
I was gonna say fucking sticks, but then I was like how many hits could they have?

16:18.420 --> 16:22.340
Sticks if you're listening and you're from sticks like I just paid you the biggest couple of middle-world

16:22.340 --> 16:25.380
I stopped myself. I was like I was gonna say sticks. It was like too many hits

16:25.380 --> 16:28.220
Yeah, they also have bathing. Yeah

16:30.060 --> 16:32.060
When I'm wet I am cleaner

16:35.580 --> 16:38.940
Submerging dirty balls

16:40.380 --> 16:42.380
Sorry, I can't do it

16:43.620 --> 16:48.540
Coming to the stage now Jeff. Oh shit. Yeah, fuck it man. Keep this thing rolling man

16:48.540 --> 16:55.300
That's what I learned on tour. Keep it rolling bring bring fresh faces up get to know him talk to them

16:55.780 --> 16:57.420
Let's bring

16:57.420 --> 16:59.420
first up

17:00.380 --> 17:04.500
An old friend of Harmontown a week old

17:06.260 --> 17:12.540
Are you looking for a thing I'm stalling for you. I don't good. Okay. Did you have a theme? No, I just got some sticks

17:12.940 --> 17:14.940
Okay

17:14.940 --> 17:20.500
An old friend. He was here last week. I like talking to him

17:22.940 --> 17:25.820
His name is Kumail Nanjiani

17:25.820 --> 17:44.380
Come here from now on. This is your theme. I like it. Hey, not this one a different one

17:44.380 --> 17:54.660
You're with me, I'm smiling this one why you know what fuck you

18:02.620 --> 18:04.620
Camels fighting with our tech guy. Oh

18:05.460 --> 18:08.100
He was okay. We're not fighting anymore. I just won

18:08.100 --> 18:15.940
It's only a fight if yeah, if it's still going on. Yeah, can I say one thing? I'm and I'm pro-showering

18:16.140 --> 18:19.460
Anti-baving. I know you don't want to talk about this anymore. I feel thank you

18:20.420 --> 18:26.780
Is it gonna be about wasting water? No, God. No, no, I'm pro-showering showering is more wasting water. I think no

18:26.780 --> 18:29.780
No, that's not true. We all did that if you take a short shower

18:29.780 --> 18:32.700
You if you plug the shower, it doesn't fill the shower

18:32.700 --> 18:37.660
Oh, we did that in science class right gang. What science class were you homeschooled?

18:38.820 --> 18:43.140
It has to be all like the little bread in this toaster. It becomes toast

18:44.260 --> 18:49.660
It's just science based on what you guys have come out. Did Dan went to Mythbusters high

18:54.380 --> 18:58.940
If you if you stand in the shower and plug the drain as

18:58.940 --> 19:03.540
As often happens to 25 year olds because the drain gets naturally plugged by their

19:04.380 --> 19:08.180
inability to call their father who they owe $5,000 to and their

19:08.940 --> 19:15.160
Smokers mucus the it often happens the science experiments plays out you you you always

19:15.260 --> 19:19.660
The shower the bathtub will not fill up in the time of an average show

19:19.660 --> 19:23.540
You'd have to be in the shower for a long time to fill a bath. I take long showers sometimes

19:23.540 --> 19:29.500
I well, I would when I'm on the road like I was in Miami for a month alone before that I was in Baltimore

19:30.020 --> 19:33.540
Alone for a couple weeks. I would take just to pass the time

19:33.540 --> 19:39.380
I would take like five six showers a day. What I would like to look forward. I would be like all right time for another shower

19:39.380 --> 19:41.380
What what?

19:42.060 --> 19:46.860
What's not happening in Baltimore? What is it five six showers a day and you saw the wire?

19:48.020 --> 19:51.740
It's that it's six showers or the wire

19:51.740 --> 19:56.740
That's Baltimore slogan. Does the crack come out of the shower?

19:57.660 --> 19:59.660
Omar comes to get you

19:59.820 --> 20:03.900
You're only safe from Omar in the shower. Yeah, I got that pan

20:05.620 --> 20:07.620
Omar coming

20:08.820 --> 20:12.540
Some people are calling out there are more high-fiving in the background

20:15.340 --> 20:17.340
Only this time I got them WB

20:18.620 --> 20:20.620
Yeah, yeah, I

20:20.620 --> 20:25.980
Think the rock bathing is weird because you're laying in your own filth for a while

20:27.340 --> 20:33.000
No, run if you do if you do a pre-shower, okay? All right, please

20:36.340 --> 20:38.340
You know that

20:38.740 --> 20:40.980
Okay, it's like your ball and butt filth

20:42.380 --> 20:44.380
Finish your thought and then let me counter

20:45.420 --> 20:49.460
Or can I count I feel like I finished my okay? All right. All right

20:49.460 --> 20:51.460
Yeah, I've of course I've thought about that

20:53.500 --> 20:56.100
I'm an awesome so condescending

20:57.780 --> 21:02.660
Also in science class what we learned is the whole point of water as a cleaning agent

21:02.660 --> 21:04.780
It is the universal solvent water

21:05.220 --> 21:11.020
Binds to things takes them away. It doesn't put them back. You know, but it's still there

21:11.020 --> 21:16.020
It's bound to water, but it's just hanging out though. It doesn't fucking attach to you now

21:16.020 --> 21:22.620
But it's still gross. That's only half of my that's only half of my counter. Okay, the other half is

21:23.700 --> 21:26.580
Assuming assuming that being near dirt

21:27.660 --> 21:32.240
Actually, it makes you dirty if it's like in a water dirt solution

21:33.220 --> 21:40.540
What you are asserting without knowing you're asserting it is the absurd science fiction notion. I feel like I've already lost

21:41.700 --> 21:44.420
That a shower head propels water

21:44.420 --> 21:48.380
hard enough and consistently enough that it

21:49.500 --> 21:53.820
Blasts the dirt no no off of your body. I'm scrubbing like a laser gun

21:54.020 --> 22:01.340
Don't plan that every little flake of dirt as opposed to the simple. Can I finish that's just like finish that's

22:01.340 --> 22:07.700
It's 45 seconds opposed to the simple assertion. I've been I'm in you stand down stand down

22:08.980 --> 22:10.980
Senator your time is up, sir

22:10.980 --> 22:15.700
I'm scrubbing. Okay. Let the senator from Pakistan rebut

22:20.100 --> 22:23.100
Was that the fun there was the punch line there just Pakistan

22:24.500 --> 22:32.100
It's a funny country. It's got a lot of K's in it. Oh one. Yeah, I just like that senator a Pakistan has senators that are

22:32.820 --> 22:36.340
That are like very passionate about shower worse than Bay thing

22:36.980 --> 22:39.700
Sorry, the senator from Pakistan. Where would he start?

22:39.700 --> 22:40.900
All right

22:40.900 --> 22:44.100
Okay, well, I want to say what two things one you've mentioned

22:45.580 --> 22:49.900
It's a science fiction notion that would be the worst sci-fi movie of all time

22:51.700 --> 22:53.700
Fair enough also I

22:55.380 --> 22:59.940
Was gonna say something horrible, but do you know who knows how strong water?

22:59.940 --> 23:05.020
Oh, I'm not gonna say it, but what say it civil war pros civil rights protesters. No

23:05.020 --> 23:09.300
civil rights, okay, does it make them clean?

23:12.940 --> 23:14.940
That's a fair point dad

23:15.420 --> 23:18.060
But the other thing is I'm scrubbing while I'm in the shower

23:18.060 --> 23:22.140
I'm not just like in there like water do your magic and then get out

23:22.620 --> 23:26.860
Right, you scrub. Okay fine. I'm scrubbing and then the water is going down there

23:26.860 --> 23:33.740
Even if it's not binding itself to me. Would you like ride get on a six-hour flight next to just like a peak like a shit?

23:33.740 --> 23:37.600
Like a turd even though it's not binding to you. You don't want you know, it's there

23:38.300 --> 23:43.820
When you're eating it's like looking at you. That's that's not fair. The shit is made out of shit

23:44.300 --> 23:46.140
There's shit is made out of shit

23:46.140 --> 23:52.020
Is your is your hang up with showering because people said you don't shower your dirty is the is the verb

23:52.340 --> 24:00.460
Showering kind of it's the verb. No, also the way it's water water stings me a little bit. Okay, but what does it?

24:00.460 --> 24:03.660
Oh, you're sarcastic. Ah, it's duly noted

24:04.700 --> 24:06.700
all right

24:10.140 --> 24:12.140
The water hits you too hard

24:13.500 --> 24:18.140
You guys are all you guys are a writer in Hollywood the water hearts

24:20.380 --> 24:27.020
You guys are all welcome to a giant bin of dime a dozen hero medals for people who gang up on people

24:27.020 --> 24:32.940
There I mean there there's a bin full of them. I knew when I asked them

24:32.940 --> 24:38.380
I said who loves showering. They all said yay. They all love it. I I'm not I'm not I'm a hero for talk

24:38.380 --> 24:41.820
But you're the lady who said she liked Batman risings. Yeah, like like

24:42.540 --> 24:46.540
Is she here by the way tried to bully her. She's like a folk hero. She's a

24:47.100 --> 24:51.660
But Dan, do you know dude is it the act of standing up while while while stingy water hits you?

24:52.300 --> 24:56.660
Because that's fair enough if you don't like like like, you know, like I'm I'm six foot four

24:56.660 --> 25:02.420
I prefer in the morning. I I sit down when I pee. Why because I'm tall and I'm like, I'm tired

25:03.540 --> 25:07.380
You know what you know what me too. I sit down when I pee

25:08.340 --> 25:10.340
Pick a sitting down not out of your

25:11.300 --> 25:13.300
You guys are fucking freaks

25:13.860 --> 25:18.740
Why are you trying to move from the ceiling when I pee? I I can't get high enough

25:20.420 --> 25:22.420
What are you women?

25:22.420 --> 25:27.380
I I I I why I stand in a tightrope and punch a lion while I pee

25:28.340 --> 25:34.580
I I I don't even pee. I just I just I just I just you blast civil war or civil rights protesters

25:34.740 --> 25:37.940
Yeah, and I and they come out still cleaner

25:38.740 --> 25:40.740
than

25:41.300 --> 25:43.300
Than if they had loved the government

25:43.300 --> 25:45.300
I

25:50.500 --> 25:52.500
I'm not even sure what lines we've drawn now

25:52.900 --> 25:54.900
I don't even know either because if you think about what I said

25:54.900 --> 26:00.500
I said then then if they loved the government, which the moral then would be that they shouldn't have they should have they were doing wrong

26:00.740 --> 26:04.180
Reflexive booers eat your plate of crow

26:05.700 --> 26:13.060
Reflexive booers, where will you go after the show? I'd like a plate of crow to eat up from the time

26:13.060 --> 26:17.380
I booed Dan Harmon because I I react to words instead of feelings

26:19.300 --> 26:21.300
That's you

26:22.100 --> 26:25.380
You guys need a fucking linguistic shower

26:26.500 --> 26:31.300
Or a linguistic bath or a bath. What's better linguistic shower? I'd rather they take a bath. It'll

26:31.940 --> 26:33.940
absolve them more

26:34.020 --> 26:37.860
We're off it. I feel like I think I think this is the sweet spot is uh

26:37.940 --> 26:42.740
If you have the time and you're tired is laying down in the tub and let the water hit you and you get

26:42.740 --> 26:45.940
And but you know what laying down in the shower feels real like

26:46.660 --> 26:50.740
Sad it feels like post rape or something. Yeah, that's yes

26:52.420 --> 26:54.420
Get it off me

26:54.500 --> 26:59.060
After after I've had good sex I go into the bathroom and take that's what you call good sex

27:00.820 --> 27:03.140
I I take a little rape bath afterwards

27:07.060 --> 27:09.620
That's a great I love that I like things in my ass

27:09.620 --> 27:13.300
Oh my god, I love that that that's a thing rape bath like a

27:14.100 --> 27:19.300
Like a real estate person like all right. So yes, you can see wooden floors great curtains. There's a rape bath here

27:20.420 --> 27:24.260
I'm sorry. Could you repeat you're you're a career woman. You're moving up in the world

27:26.180 --> 27:31.060
A rape bath, you know, it's not good. You know what nobody likes a rape shower a rape shower is the worst

27:31.540 --> 27:34.100
Well, he was saying I mean that's a thing if you're sitting in the shower

27:34.180 --> 27:37.700
It's because you're either been abducted by aliens or or have been taken

27:37.700 --> 27:40.340
Or you just found out that fickle design horn

27:43.460 --> 27:46.100
What what that was a real deep

27:47.060 --> 27:49.060
Real deep Ace Ventura

27:50.420 --> 27:52.420
We need a character for deep cuts. We need

27:54.180 --> 27:56.500
I just high fived a gay guy. I don't know what you said. I just

27:57.380 --> 27:59.380
I feel like that would make it better. Yeah humblebred

27:59.380 --> 28:08.100
Everybody high fiving the gay guy

28:08.660 --> 28:10.660
Everybody high five the gay guy

28:11.300 --> 28:13.300
High five the gay guy

28:13.940 --> 28:15.940
It's like the Blarney stowed

28:16.340 --> 28:18.340
High five the gay

28:20.820 --> 28:25.380
It makes you feel a little less strange

28:25.380 --> 28:27.380
Meet

28:28.340 --> 28:33.140
Foundries high five blurring as I walk across them with me

28:35.220 --> 28:37.220
Dumb

28:37.700 --> 28:41.860
High five the gay guy feels like a like a fancy version of smear the queer. Yeah

28:43.140 --> 28:45.140
Like a pc update

28:45.780 --> 28:50.260
Like we fixed it. That's a martin luther king made that speech. I have a dream that one day

28:50.260 --> 28:55.300
The children will play high five the gay guy instead of smear the queer instead of

28:56.660 --> 28:58.660
Punch him in the fucking that was one, you know

28:58.900 --> 29:03.540
I apologize to enti who was sitting in the front row because when we were we were playing certain games

29:03.540 --> 29:08.100
We would say uh, we would pick who was it and we had this in midwestern, wisconsin

29:08.100 --> 29:10.100
It was the 70s 80s ago

29:10.340 --> 29:13.700
Eenie meenie minie moe and we didn't always say catch the tiger by the toe

29:13.700 --> 29:16.500
No, we definitely in pakistan did not say tiger

29:16.500 --> 29:20.340
Wait, you got wait, what what did you say jew? Oh, yeah, no

29:21.380 --> 29:22.900
That doesn't rhyme

29:22.900 --> 29:27.860
Catch the jew by the toe. Come on. That's your that was your you guys were like into rhyming

29:28.820 --> 29:31.060
Yeah, everybody's into rhyming

29:31.860 --> 29:33.860
hearts beat beneath these chests

29:36.180 --> 29:38.180
Jew-hating hearts, I thought

29:38.180 --> 29:45.940
Well, I know I need to go over there and like no, yeah, it's skippable

29:49.780 --> 29:53.620
Is that is that on the pamphlet of the hotel lobby? Yeah, skip it

29:56.100 --> 30:00.980
Pakistan's wonder spot your your car will go uphill it's skippable

30:02.580 --> 30:07.060
We didn't say tiger we said the n-word okay, and but I forgot

30:07.060 --> 30:11.460
We played a whole game called smear the queer and the reason I forgot is because we never thought

30:11.460 --> 30:15.220
I never really thought about it. We're never thought. Oh

30:16.340 --> 30:21.940
This game will keep gay people from from infiltrating society or voting or getting married

30:22.020 --> 30:24.420
I was never thinking that like you just taught that as a kid

30:25.220 --> 30:27.060
And I'm not I'm not saying it's good or permissible

30:27.060 --> 30:31.300
I'm just saying like when you're a kid you're pure like you don't you really don't there's no reason

30:31.380 --> 30:35.380
Yeah, only the only people who can say the n-word are black people and kids right they can

30:35.380 --> 30:37.380
And

30:37.380 --> 30:44.980
And and and white comedy writers who who are making a sandwich by themselves. Can I pitch that as a title of this episode?

30:48.580 --> 30:51.220
Can't say the n-word say the n-wordest things

30:52.900 --> 30:54.900
In between gay bashing

30:55.380 --> 30:56.500
I

30:56.500 --> 31:03.620
Honestly, we say I forgot about smear the queer. That's all like I because I I bothered to apologize to uh to our our our our

31:03.620 --> 31:06.420
Soul our uh, uh soul. That's uh, uh

31:07.620 --> 31:10.100
Our only uh black uh, uh

31:11.300 --> 31:14.820
Harmonian wait, what do you think queer means? Why you?

31:16.100 --> 31:18.820
Why are you apologizing to the black person?

31:19.860 --> 31:26.020
No, I'm saying I apologize. I I I I'm obsessed with race, but I'm not as obsessed with uh, homophobia

31:26.820 --> 31:32.580
I'm not I haven't come I feel like the equation was race and homophobia not race and homosexuality

31:32.580 --> 31:34.580
The equation is racism and homophobia

31:35.060 --> 31:40.580
I'm saying I I need to I need to put a couple more poker chips on double zero for the gay people

31:41.380 --> 31:44.580
Although they wake up and can totally pass for white. I mean

31:47.700 --> 31:49.700
So, yeah, that's

31:52.660 --> 31:57.700
Like we we can only find out you're gay like in if you say you prefer penises

31:57.700 --> 32:04.660
Right, like like like black people gonna come up with a loan officer. Yeah with black people you can tell over the phone

32:15.620 --> 32:21.940
If you're if you're a gay guy and you want to you blend into straight society, it's as simple as growing a big bushy mustache

32:24.260 --> 32:25.860
Is that right

32:25.860 --> 32:28.420
By the way, Pakistan was very very racist

32:29.060 --> 32:30.580
against

32:30.580 --> 32:32.580
Jewish people, of course

32:32.580 --> 32:38.180
Hindus of course, but also black people and we didn't we didn't have any black people

32:39.300 --> 32:41.300
So weird. Yeah

32:41.300 --> 32:43.300
So what was that about?

32:44.100 --> 32:46.100
I think we were going off you guys

32:48.500 --> 32:50.500
We were like, you know when like the

32:50.500 --> 32:55.940
The big bully at school is like the cool guy is like this is what we hate. Oh, okay. We hate it too

32:57.380 --> 33:02.820
It's like in every after school special like yeah, the dirty bully like beach again, you follow him home

33:02.820 --> 33:08.100
Of course his house is all shitty, you know, that's that's America. That's America because whatever we're there

33:08.180 --> 33:13.620
We just see like Snoopy and Garfield and mark all the animal ones, you know

33:14.100 --> 33:17.940
We then you come here and it's fucking Jerry Springer and stuff. We don't we don't see that stuff

33:17.940 --> 33:24.500
We see Baywatch, which is great. All right. I think it's time to keep the bullet train rolling

33:24.580 --> 33:27.620
We got shit to talk to Spencer about we need to bring Spencer up here

33:32.660 --> 33:36.020
For you first-time listeners, Spencer is our attention master

33:37.780 --> 33:39.780
Spencer Crittenden everybody

33:39.780 --> 33:47.940
Happy birthday, Spencer's 24 years old

33:53.220 --> 33:55.220
One step closer to death

33:56.020 --> 34:01.220
Spencer Crittenden slowly edges along the never-ending river of chronology

34:02.340 --> 34:07.220
He'll he'll always be younger than Dan, but that doesn't excuse him

34:07.220 --> 34:14.580
From what? I don't know. It's from Indiana Jones. Not that you would know. What a great segue

34:15.460 --> 34:17.460
Because we just found out in the green room

34:18.020 --> 34:20.900
That Spencer Crittenden human snow drift

34:21.460 --> 34:24.100
What wait, what does that mean? Well, I'll tell you okay

34:24.980 --> 34:30.500
Has never seen a single back to the future or indiana jones movie. Wow

34:30.500 --> 34:36.740
Fuck you guys. What is it? He's a unicorn. You haven't either

34:38.020 --> 34:45.140
Who hasn't seen indiana jones or back to the future movies two girls. Why is this something to be proud of?

34:46.340 --> 34:48.100
Because they're 22

34:48.100 --> 34:49.620
How old are you?

34:49.620 --> 34:55.300
23 how old are you 22? So yeah, I got it, but there's a lot of I mean there's a little I mean this audience is a

34:55.300 --> 35:00.820
See you you'll love it people spencer's age. I don't think it's an age thing. I don't think it's an age thing

35:00.820 --> 35:05.060
I think it's an age thing plus. I think it's an age that you guys assume. It's an age thing

35:05.140 --> 35:09.460
I think everyone my age has definitely had to see like like their actual

35:10.020 --> 35:12.100
uh, uh stormtroopers came to your house and

35:12.900 --> 35:15.620
And drove you to the movie. I was four years old

35:15.780 --> 35:19.860
I remember being four years old when star wars came out at the orange sonorama dome

35:20.180 --> 35:24.660
And I remember my dad picking me up out of the theater and walking to the parking lot

35:24.660 --> 35:30.580
Because I was crying when Darth Vader came out because I was because I was fucking four and there's a

35:31.140 --> 35:33.620
There's a guy shaped like an evil black cock

35:36.660 --> 35:39.540
It's a big deal man, and I was raised pakistani so you know how

35:41.220 --> 35:43.220
How hard we hate black cock

35:43.220 --> 35:53.460
Nothing scarier than a big powerful black cock our actual slogan was it's pakistan not blackistan

35:55.620 --> 35:58.580
Spencer I have a question for you. Yes shower bath

35:59.220 --> 36:05.620
Uh, I I you know I'm gonna go with some of the audience members. I enjoy a good shower bath now and again shower bath

36:05.780 --> 36:11.220
Yeah, yeah the combo down and I crumple myself into a small fetal form

36:11.220 --> 36:15.220
Yeah, because you're tall right house. It was six three six three or four

36:15.380 --> 36:20.260
Yeah, like same as me and we don't fit in normal bathtubs. No like you know on tour

36:20.980 --> 36:22.980
Like there was two

36:22.980 --> 36:29.220
Bath, you know showers that were that were I I could stand up and there was there was a ceiling mounted

36:29.300 --> 36:31.300
There was only one that you and I could share. Yeah

36:32.820 --> 36:34.980
It was a real taxing time for us

36:34.980 --> 36:36.980
Yeah

36:39.700 --> 36:42.100
But yeah, but the combo is the best I have to say

36:43.140 --> 36:44.900
As the combos

36:44.900 --> 36:47.780
I'm not I'm not I'm not being patriotic about it

36:47.860 --> 36:53.220
But the combo I don't get because when you're the only reason I can finally take baths

36:53.780 --> 36:58.340
Is because I bought a house that has this like sunken dolly part in bath in it

36:58.820 --> 37:04.260
Like it's it's it's very big and my giant. I'm not as tall as jeff or spencer

37:04.260 --> 37:12.420
I'm six foot period and uh, I I I've I've often tried I've tried of like on the on the tour

37:12.500 --> 37:16.100
I was like like like erin would go you don't want to take baths in the hotel to take a bath

37:16.260 --> 37:18.260
Yeah, I'll take a nice relaxing bath

37:18.820 --> 37:24.740
Like hannah barbaric cartoon like my knees are next to my ears. It's silly. It doesn't nothing's getting soaked for me

37:24.820 --> 37:28.180
I want to soak my body soak it like a dirty dish

37:28.580 --> 37:33.700
It's about simulated rainfall like I I'm from california where it never rains rain is exciting

37:33.700 --> 37:37.380
So the idea of being in a shower and rain hitting you is like it's like this visceral

37:38.020 --> 37:44.100
Uh experience. I do have one. I always want to someday have a house where the entire ceiling is a shower

37:44.660 --> 37:46.660
So you can just kind of walk around everywhere

37:48.100 --> 37:52.900
I think I could handle that I think I've been at like hawaiian resorts and things every once in a while

37:52.980 --> 37:59.300
Your hotel room will like you'll luck out and you're like what the fuck and there'll be like a crazy rich person thing where

37:59.300 --> 38:04.500
Like you get the uh, the joan crofford mommy dearest shower where there's like 19 jets

38:04.500 --> 38:08.820
Oh, yeah in every direction the best. Yeah, that I'll do so we can all agree

38:08.900 --> 38:14.740
Let's all be rich and and live in hawaii where they also the temperature doesn't change. That's the other thing about a shower

38:15.460 --> 38:19.780
Well, you're gonna contradict that. No, no, no, go ahead. Go ahead. I don't think it's a safe environment

38:20.180 --> 38:23.220
Here's the thing. Let me let me walk you through taking a shower

38:26.020 --> 38:28.020
Wow, you got all your clothes

38:28.020 --> 38:30.660
You got all your clothes if you've just tuned in

38:31.460 --> 38:34.900
Wait, we're about to blow Prairie Home companion out of the fucking water

38:35.780 --> 38:41.300
Wait, I'll tell you this one thing. Okay. First of all, it's very presumptuous of you

38:41.940 --> 38:43.780
Uh, walking me through a shower

38:43.780 --> 38:47.780
But also if you have to do that, you don't have to start with me having my clothes on like

38:48.420 --> 38:53.620
We could skip that. This is exactly the point. I'm talking about. Okay. Okay. See this is exactly everything that you take for granted

38:53.620 --> 38:58.820
You don't understand what it's like to be it mean like you you you don't get it. No, I don't

38:59.060 --> 39:01.460
It's like like my clothes are on

39:02.020 --> 39:06.100
They're already on it taking them off. That's a big deal

39:07.140 --> 39:10.740
Like it's it's like all kinds of shit like like I'm taking all my clothes off

39:10.900 --> 39:14.580
I think I think everyone else in the room is like, oh, I can't wait to get all these clothes off

39:14.580 --> 39:17.620
I'm like, god damn it. Fucking another sock really

39:18.500 --> 39:20.500
two feet I have

39:20.500 --> 39:22.980
Yeah, I am backwards. I talk. I'm a late

39:23.940 --> 39:32.100
I'm a lazy person like a lazy lazy thing taking clothes off like all of them off knowing that I'm about to put them all back on

39:33.220 --> 39:40.580
Insanity and then like so so the thing that goes between that event like I want it to be ritualistic and thorough

39:40.900 --> 39:42.900
I want my big pendulous

39:43.380 --> 39:46.020
Irr-sign greasy nasty asshole

39:46.420 --> 39:48.260
privacy balls

39:48.260 --> 39:54.900
Juice be subjected you hear earth sign not to a light dashing earth sign balls earth sign earth sign

39:54.980 --> 39:56.980
They're like you have balls like bears

39:57.940 --> 40:00.980
Uh, look, uh, we we have a surprise guest here

40:02.660 --> 40:05.460
He needs to sound in johnny bear balls

40:05.460 --> 40:16.900
We're on the wilderness theme ladies and gentlemen bobcat goldthwaite

40:22.740 --> 40:28.020
Wow, I didn't know we had guests tonight, so I mean no that's what I get for showing up late

40:28.100 --> 40:32.900
We've graduated to surprise guests. I I feel like uh, bob hope or something

40:32.900 --> 40:37.220
Is he that's a reference that you guys would really grasp

40:38.820 --> 40:43.220
We remember that he was a guy and then he they don't even know what bob hope did he was

40:44.020 --> 40:45.460
Well, I mean, you know who he is

40:45.460 --> 40:52.500
But he was famous for walking out and doing you know, he'd stop in and then but he was his way of really squirting his musk

40:52.500 --> 40:53.940
It was his way

40:53.940 --> 41:00.180
He was showing. Yeah, you know, fuck you johnny karson. I'll just come over and crap right in your mouth during a broadcast

41:00.180 --> 41:02.180
I'm paraphrasing

41:03.300 --> 41:07.380
Bob he didn't really say that. No, he he made jokes about churro

41:08.260 --> 41:10.260
shower showers or baths

41:10.500 --> 41:11.700
showers or bath

41:11.700 --> 41:12.660
um

41:12.660 --> 41:13.780
showers

41:13.780 --> 41:14.260
showers

41:14.260 --> 41:19.220
All right, fine. Yeah, you're cornered man. Well, you're down with the bath and I just don't like showering and I

41:19.620 --> 41:21.540
If I if I'm clean it's because I took a bath

41:21.620 --> 41:22.980
But what what is it about the show?

41:22.980 --> 41:28.260
Is it the physical act of standing and being hit by water or is it the fact that people told you as a kid that you

41:28.260 --> 41:32.020
You don't shower. You're a bad. All right. It's all the above starts in the playground

41:32.340 --> 41:35.860
The worst people in the world the worst people that you would ever want controlling society

41:36.580 --> 41:41.780
As the first purveyors of the information, uh, you need you need to take more showers

41:42.260 --> 41:44.740
I take dude. I take like three showers a day

41:45.620 --> 41:50.180
I wish I wish I didn't have to go to school so I could take more showers and I'm just going like okay

41:50.420 --> 41:54.660
Fucking asshole shower asshole shower beating me up

41:54.660 --> 41:59.860
Because I don't take showers and then I I've told you a lot of your school's hierarchy

42:00.180 --> 42:02.980
Social hierarchy was based on shower frequency

42:04.260 --> 42:06.260
Yes, as far as I'm concerned. Yes

42:06.740 --> 42:10.580
So, I mean, I mean, maybe that's not a reality, but that was my emotional experience

42:10.660 --> 42:14.980
That's exactly how I thought of it that the guys would go out and they'd throw a football as far as they could

42:15.300 --> 42:22.420
And they go was it 40 45 45 is better than 40. All right. Oh, I took so many showers today

42:22.420 --> 42:26.100
And I'd be like I can read everything

42:27.700 --> 42:32.820
But what if what if somebody said uh, what what if there's like the the the captain of the football team said

42:33.540 --> 42:38.820
I prefer just soaking in a nice leisurely bath. I would probably be the world's greatest tight end

42:39.940 --> 42:43.380
But or linebacker or whatever you do. But here's the problem. That was an unfortunate pun

42:44.100 --> 42:46.500
Too many dots to connect. I but when you were

42:48.740 --> 42:51.140
When you're in the bath you're making um

42:51.140 --> 42:52.180
um

42:52.180 --> 42:54.180
Your own

42:55.940 --> 42:57.940
You're making

42:58.420 --> 43:00.420
You're making Dan Harmon az you

43:02.820 --> 43:07.220
That's exactly right. All right, is it a metaphor for where you are in life? Are you just

43:08.340 --> 43:13.940
Sitting in this I don't know. Is that the the more narcissistic way to bathe is to just no

43:13.940 --> 43:20.260
Stealing your own juice. I don't you still in your own juice. You don't want the talent to go down the drain

43:21.780 --> 43:25.220
I don't want to lose to merge yourself or just inhale it like I think snorted up

43:25.540 --> 43:27.540
I don't want to lose any of my essence

43:28.660 --> 43:30.660
I'm just gonna put it back into me

43:31.300 --> 43:35.620
Do you feel that the shower robs you of your essential oils? What do you guys think I do it?

43:35.620 --> 43:39.380
Do you think I bottle it and put it in the next to the fire firewood pile?

43:39.380 --> 43:43.860
I think you're drinking it. It's just the secret on the label. I

43:45.620 --> 43:50.580
Enjoy being clean but not not not in terms with this like like these guys

43:50.740 --> 43:56.420
So it was three parts. It was that and then it was the fact that okay. Here's the deal when you turn in the shower

43:57.060 --> 44:01.620
Okay, and everyone go ahead bob before you got here. Everyone already made fun of me for this

44:02.340 --> 44:04.340
The water hurts

44:04.340 --> 44:08.580
It stings it stings when it hits the surface of my skin

44:09.940 --> 44:14.500
And I'm only gonna say this once and I have not any chills for you for saying that out loud

44:15.540 --> 44:17.540
I am not diagnosing myself

44:20.820 --> 44:27.940
In my head you're the whole body the skin it hurts I in my head your shower says sony on it by the way

44:27.940 --> 44:34.740
I wouldn't be surprised to me at all all those tubes lead to one place. Yeah for sure

44:35.140 --> 44:40.260
Some big pyramid in space just pumping out things that did you have a terrible shower nozzle because like

44:40.740 --> 44:44.180
I have experienced enough different ones at the college

44:44.180 --> 44:48.820
You had to shower in the multiple dorms and it was that little like nozzle that it was just like

44:49.300 --> 44:51.300
Like being sandblasted to pieces

44:51.860 --> 44:54.900
And I think maybe that's where my love of sitting down on the shower came from

44:54.900 --> 44:57.940
But if you stood up at six or four if you got that in the shoulders

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
It took off the first couple layers of skin

45:01.220 --> 45:04.980
So I think I just learned to curl down like in a corner and like let let let let the rain

45:04.980 --> 45:06.580
I only bring this up because there's so much contention

45:06.580 --> 45:14.260
I I'm not diagnosing myself, but I have in all my research like I've it is a symptom of it's an it's a spectrum thing

45:14.420 --> 45:21.780
Where like it's like you don't you like tactile like stinging with the water and the thing

45:21.780 --> 45:28.500
Uh, I but I'm not I'm not playing that hard or I just did bro. I think it's like

45:29.220 --> 45:31.220
But see to me the shower is also

45:32.020 --> 45:35.380
And maybe have your back on in this. It's the lifetime movie

45:35.620 --> 45:40.340
Or you know where it's like where you go after the rate. This is my other point

45:40.900 --> 45:42.020
Wait, so

45:42.020 --> 45:47.940
Bob you and I are the same person. Did you make that right? It's like looking into a mirror twinsies a future mirror

45:47.940 --> 45:54.580
Basically, I get that a lot. Okay, Bob Bob Bob a future mirror. So Bob clearly. I'm a balding fat white guy

45:54.900 --> 45:57.060
How did that happen a bit of a bit of B?

45:57.860 --> 46:00.820
Wait, so Bob clearly you weren't here for the first like 30 minutes of the show

46:01.220 --> 46:05.300
Just just as a test any mini my name. Oh catcha. Oh

46:05.300 --> 46:16.100
Oh, are you from Pakistan the same person with the same guy

46:20.660 --> 46:23.220
No, I would have went with secret pakistani

46:24.900 --> 46:26.900
No, I came from my family was uh

46:28.740 --> 46:30.740
How can I say this I didn't

46:31.540 --> 46:33.540
I didn't know

46:33.540 --> 46:35.940
That they were called brazil nuts

46:36.580 --> 46:38.580
Oh, no, I know

46:38.980 --> 46:45.220
Yeah, they're called n word toes. Yeah. Yeah, I was like, what? Yeah, half of my family's from oklahoma

46:46.740 --> 46:51.860
Yeah, those are not called brazil nuts. Would you ever have a thing where those are like a black person at your house?

46:51.860 --> 46:55.860
And you have to be like, how would you want to have some? Oh, no, is that how you realize?

46:56.340 --> 46:58.340
And but nobody'd be like

46:58.900 --> 47:00.900
Aren't we being racist to brazilians?

47:00.900 --> 47:06.900
Well, but brazilians is not a bad word. Like if we were calling them like bikini

47:06.900 --> 47:11.460
Hey, what's their nuts? Yeah, that's what we're saying. You have these are odd shape

47:11.460 --> 47:13.460
little tiny sharp nuts

47:16.020 --> 47:18.020
Long pyramid shaped wrinkly

47:18.820 --> 47:20.260
all right

47:20.260 --> 47:25.860
I mean not not that every nut is an opportunity to get your uh, uh, uh, you know racist agenda

47:25.860 --> 47:30.740
Uh, maybe maybe they're from brazil. Let's look into it afterwards. Those nuts may be from brazil

47:33.620 --> 47:38.100
I think they are I think I don't I don't think they resemble brazilian people but also

47:38.740 --> 47:44.100
But they do resemble the toes of black people. I I didn't say that you did. No, I didn't

47:46.980 --> 47:51.540
I can't I'm so sorry tonight. What if a black guy's foot really looked like that like

47:51.540 --> 47:58.340
Like like like genically brazilian nuts the same language. Well, it still wouldn't be okay because that word's not yeah

47:58.660 --> 48:00.660
It helps them. Don't I'm sorry

48:04.180 --> 48:09.300
Because I my family as a food group my family always called pecans korean fingers

48:13.540 --> 48:15.540
Well, a lot he does

48:15.540 --> 48:21.380
Oh pecans. Is that an actual pecan riff pecans? Pasha?

48:22.740 --> 48:24.740
How dare you sir? Well, hello, Mary

48:27.620 --> 48:30.820
My my family calls corn syrup poor people fuel

48:33.140 --> 48:36.580
Is that true they know we couldn't even afford sunny delight

48:38.180 --> 48:42.580
In pakistan, we call cashew nuts cashew nuts. Whoa. Whoa nice

48:42.580 --> 48:44.580
Why did nuts?

48:46.340 --> 48:49.460
Not sure yeah, because it's not only

48:51.140 --> 48:53.300
A euphemism for

48:53.300 --> 48:55.780
men's genitals. It's also

48:57.220 --> 48:59.220
How you describe mentally ill people

49:00.020 --> 49:05.780
And they're like, we're just an excellent source of protein. Yeah. Yeah, we never asked us just everybody back off

49:05.780 --> 49:12.100
Oh, all we did was be cultivated by accident. We didn't do anything wrong. We're just just weird like how do you become

49:13.140 --> 49:20.020
The balls thing I understand because it's like I guess I kind of do although why wouldn't you I get maybe maybe in stone age times

49:20.420 --> 49:24.820
The only thing slightly resembling that was like rocks and nuts

49:25.300 --> 49:31.380
But then you get you get mr. Peanut who's the fanciest richest nut of all time. That's clearly just compensation

49:31.380 --> 49:38.180
Yeah, yeah, that's yeah, that's there used to there was a thing when I was at the we take our nuts very seriously

49:38.580 --> 49:40.580
at the fisher nut

49:41.140 --> 49:43.140
Company that was a commercial back then

49:43.780 --> 49:47.140
They were like like good. Look. We know the word nuts means crazy and balls

49:48.180 --> 49:50.820
But by by ours like we they're clean and they're

49:51.780 --> 49:57.460
They're good for you and we we we were still we're not a bunch of crazy balls at at the factory

49:57.460 --> 49:59.460
We're just putting nuts in a jar

49:59.460 --> 50:02.660
Uh, we're just putting nuts in your mouth. Yeah

50:05.540 --> 50:07.540
I like it

50:09.860 --> 50:11.860
We're all going to come together at some point tonight

50:12.580 --> 50:15.860
All right, we're all going to take a rape bath tonight. It's going to be fantastic

50:16.900 --> 50:21.860
But before we play d&d who needs help in the audience tonight. Is there somebody is there anybody that needs help?

50:22.100 --> 50:24.100
You can't shut up immediately

50:24.740 --> 50:27.460
Did you come and sit in the front row because you really needed something tonight?

50:27.460 --> 50:30.020
Yeah, what what what's your name?

50:31.060 --> 50:34.980
Sophie, do you want to come up and talk about the help that you need? All right

50:36.260 --> 50:38.260
It's getting really easy

50:41.780 --> 50:46.020
I have to kind of do it heraldo style where I control the mic because there's we've run out of mics

50:46.500 --> 50:52.820
Sophie your name was what what's what's the problem? I'm just a scholastic mess. I don't know what to do in my life

50:54.100 --> 50:56.100
All right, well

50:56.100 --> 50:57.380
So are you in college?

50:57.380 --> 51:03.060
Yeah, I really wanted to go to medical school and then I moved to santa barbara and somebody would from medical school

51:03.140 --> 51:08.420
By the way, let's let's note that you get you get a lot of partying done at medical school

51:09.460 --> 51:13.780
I really wanted to be a plastic surgeon and now I think I want to do sketch comedy

51:15.220 --> 51:16.980
Wow

51:16.980 --> 51:20.020
Too very very noble fields in hollywood

51:21.220 --> 51:23.460
We had we had the same thing last week. That's weird

51:23.460 --> 51:26.980
We went things for sure. You definitely don't need to move to any other city like

51:27.860 --> 51:31.140
Like no matter what you decide to do. Yeah, you could go back and forth between those two

51:31.140 --> 51:34.340
You'll always be in the acropolis of uh of both of them

51:34.580 --> 51:38.820
So so you wait wait, but at this point in time are you like an undergrad at a college?

51:39.540 --> 51:42.260
Could you combine the two like we need a nose?

51:45.700 --> 51:48.980
And some sort of cleft palate a place a cleft palate

51:48.980 --> 51:52.020
Yeah, we'll make you smile

51:53.300 --> 51:56.980
All right, so Sophie see you're you're you're at a crossroads right now

51:57.620 --> 52:02.260
You're in what year of your college, uh course. What do you call it?

52:02.340 --> 52:05.380
I would be a senior at UC Davis and then I left to go

52:06.260 --> 52:07.540
Thank you

52:07.540 --> 52:09.540
That's john davis back there

52:10.740 --> 52:15.460
And then I left to go to santa barbara and like maybe try this like acting thing

52:15.460 --> 52:19.540
Wait, so I'm a terrible interviewer

52:19.860 --> 52:25.140
And uh, so if if you were going to pursue acting you would go to santa barbara. Is that what you're saying?

52:27.380 --> 52:31.220
This is why I'm like a mess like I'm taking chemistry and I'm also taking drama and singing

52:32.020 --> 52:34.900
I can smell your parents stomach acid from here

52:39.700 --> 52:44.500
I was just going to say I can smell the cw execs screaming their pants. I have

52:44.500 --> 52:49.060
Like she's she's she's going to medical school, but she wants to be a model and she

52:50.340 --> 52:53.540
It's it's it's it's it's called medicining medicining Sophie

52:55.540 --> 52:58.900
Yeah, it's even worse because Sophie if you had your Sophie's choice

53:00.260 --> 53:02.260
Taken taken

53:03.300 --> 53:05.700
So that that was the non gay best friend of

53:07.300 --> 53:09.300
Intermediate high five person

53:09.300 --> 53:15.060
Uh, if you had your dream, uh, if you could do anything, would you be a famous actress or like comedian?

53:15.300 --> 53:19.460
I want to do like snl type stuff, but like probably not that much more like

53:20.340 --> 53:24.260
YouTube kind of thing. So your aim is to be on youtube?

53:27.220 --> 53:32.020
You could do that tonight. Yeah, actually you already are probably yeah

53:32.900 --> 53:37.140
Somebody make a dream come true. Dreams are coming too. I want to be on vine

53:37.140 --> 53:43.060
Now I'm confused you want to get on snl to break into youtube

53:45.620 --> 53:49.700
It's a weird way around it. Yeah, that's a big step down from snl

53:50.260 --> 53:53.780
Sophie what qualifies you to be on youtube? Oh, oh, I see you went to medical school

53:55.060 --> 54:01.300
Very well. Yeah, and you were on snl for three years. All right one more question one more question. Sophie shower or bath

54:01.300 --> 54:06.180
Baths are for birds and babies, and I am neither

54:12.580 --> 54:16.900
All right, well, so fee is there is there is there a crossroads that we can identify and help you with though

54:17.060 --> 54:20.100
that you're you're saying like like like you're you're in your

54:21.060 --> 54:23.060
blank year of

54:23.060 --> 54:26.260
College you're thinking I would I would like to

54:26.260 --> 54:33.540
To reconstruct people's faces, but I would also like to entertain people and and there's a fork in the road

54:33.940 --> 54:38.180
So what what is there a I mean like like okay?

54:38.500 --> 54:43.780
What's the next choice you're going to have to make if you choose one or the other medical school or not medical school?

54:44.660 --> 54:50.340
Meaning that that coming up you're going to have to do what you're going to have to fill out an application for a medical school

54:50.420 --> 54:52.420
or that you're actually going to have to

54:52.420 --> 54:54.420
Like like like

54:55.780 --> 55:02.500
Because I'm alien to the territory. Okay, so so you need our help in deciding between the medical path and a

55:03.220 --> 55:07.140
Performance path. I have a diagnosis for your I think this is what is happening

55:07.140 --> 55:12.020
Can I say I'm just going to ask someone who was also expected to become a doctor and now I am not a doctor

55:12.420 --> 55:14.420
Why are you laughing?

55:14.900 --> 55:20.020
Just don't don't bully her make sure no no i'm not bullying her what i'm saying is this is what it seems to me is happening

55:20.020 --> 55:23.060
Is that your parents had an expectation of you to be a doctor?

55:23.060 --> 55:27.380
Perhaps or an expectation you put on yourself based on people you'd seen and whatever

55:27.860 --> 55:34.740
And so then you later decided that you really wanted to be an actor and for you plastic surgery is sort of one step

55:35.140 --> 55:38.340
In the medical field and one step in showbiz. It's sort of

55:38.980 --> 55:43.700
Or or comedy or comedy. Yeah, so you definitely want to be

55:44.260 --> 55:47.780
Funny and and entertain people that you get your passion is not for

55:47.780 --> 55:50.820
For medicine that's not for medicine

55:51.940 --> 55:54.420
Yeah, you know, I you know initially I was

55:55.460 --> 55:58.980
thinking about the fat patch Adams nicely played young man

56:01.220 --> 56:03.220
Nicely played young man

56:03.540 --> 56:06.180
I know he is there. I was just talking to morke. Um

56:07.140 --> 56:11.300
Yeah, he was out there. That's that's an amazing thing about meltdown. That's a fancy. It's like narnia

56:11.380 --> 56:14.340
Like you could like like Robin Williams could be looking at watchman

56:14.340 --> 56:20.180
And go do you want to do do you want to go do the show? No, no, no, I'm cool. I'll stay here

56:24.100 --> 56:26.900
I want to find out what would happen if Batman grew up in the 50s

56:28.420 --> 56:30.420
I don't know

56:30.500 --> 56:35.300
You know, I was this best man and it's really what and I feel like such a heel that I do

56:35.380 --> 56:40.500
But I don't do manic robin. I do robin. No, you do it. Yeah, I do. You were robin. We're his best man

56:40.500 --> 56:43.860
Yeah, yes. Wow. And this the latest model

56:45.940 --> 56:53.460
Is it still running this model? Yeah. Yeah, the model's running. It's a lovely lovely lovely lovely woman. Um, but let's get back to, um, Sophie

56:54.740 --> 56:58.980
My initial reaction was actually I got hostile like I was like thinking about

56:59.460 --> 57:02.740
Do you know what I mean? Like the cliche of no one's ever said quick

57:03.300 --> 57:05.860
Here's an emergency. Right. Is there a sketch comedian here?

57:05.860 --> 57:13.060
Everybody got a real plastic surgeon, but but then I thought that I was being very hypocritical because the advice I give to

57:13.540 --> 57:20.340
Everybody often including my own daughter is uh, you gotta quit man. You got to quit you you've got to do

57:21.060 --> 57:24.980
That you know, what's right? You want to do this sketch then you got to do it

57:25.300 --> 57:29.460
And it's and it may seem selfish, but it's actually really brave

57:30.180 --> 57:32.180
No one else no one's behind you right now

57:32.180 --> 57:35.780
I don't know if they're agreeing, but it sounds

57:36.580 --> 57:41.780
But it's where your heart really is and in two weeks you might say I made a big mistake and all this stuff

57:41.780 --> 57:45.860
And it's okay to keep quitting you keep quitting and you keep keep quitting all through your life

57:46.180 --> 57:49.220
And eventually you end up some place where you don't want to leave

57:51.540 --> 57:53.540
All right, thank you, Sophie

57:53.540 --> 58:04.100
I and I would I would rather I would rather sit in the front row of a show and watch a person who might have been a doctor

58:04.660 --> 58:05.380
do

58:05.380 --> 58:08.500
Bad comedy then be under the knife of somebody that would really

58:12.100 --> 58:15.700
I wish I was sherry o' cherry, but your cheekbones are

58:15.700 --> 58:24.980
The unspoken part of capitalism the the healthy part is the idea that because

58:25.300 --> 58:28.980
We have money and because anything that you can do can generate money

58:29.220 --> 58:31.940
The idea is that unlike in monarchies

58:32.420 --> 58:35.940
Anything that you want to do you can figure out a way to make money doing it

58:36.180 --> 58:40.100
The idea wasn't that your parents and give you a bunch of money

58:40.100 --> 58:43.060
And then they tell you what you're supposed to do and then you end up doing that

58:43.060 --> 58:46.740
Even though you don't quite want to do it because that's what a poor person does and all this shit

58:47.140 --> 58:52.260
Like like like the idea was supposed to be oh, it's capitalism like like like so

58:52.740 --> 58:55.300
Fucking figure out a way like what's your passion?

58:55.540 --> 59:01.860
I like cutting up roadkill and taking the little squirrel skulls and gluing them to my forehead

59:02.740 --> 59:04.740
And just jumping up and down

59:05.220 --> 59:07.780
Well, you're the only got the market cornered on that

59:07.780 --> 59:13.140
There's got to be a way to make that worth something if there isn't then you try as hard as you can

59:13.380 --> 59:15.380
And and and now that Kickstarter's here

59:15.940 --> 59:21.860
There's but my but my heart first went to like wasn't even about bread. I was thinking about how you help people

59:22.500 --> 59:25.300
But I've high-roaded, but you know you went for

59:27.300 --> 59:34.420
But you went down like some like the genesis of some supervillain who's making maiming people

59:34.420 --> 59:36.420
So

59:37.300 --> 59:40.340
Mengele and the Riddler all got together and

59:42.020 --> 59:44.020
But you really do have to be true to yourself

59:44.820 --> 59:46.820
You know or or you will be

59:47.860 --> 59:52.980
You know, I'm 50 and I rant in the valley and I've never been happier in my life, you know

59:53.940 --> 59:58.420
Yeah, I mean just like as your career has been so interesting and so awesome

59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.900
You've had so many sort of different things you've done and nobody could have predicted

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:08.100
No offense watching you in police academy. I've been like somebody. It's going to be an awesome

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:14.260
Director with a really good point of view and like really really like dark awesome movies. Nobody would have guessed that

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.860
What was the award that you just won this you got some you got some accolades? Oh, it's nothing

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.780
What is it who reads a square?

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:32.020
Director of the year. Yeah, but you know whatever there wasn't that many good movies this year

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.140
It was the easy

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.420
Yeah, I had lunch with Bob and I was telling him I go the you know

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:44.660
We know but the Charlie Kaufman thing we did a Kickstarter was like if there's ever been a director

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.100
That was like made

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:52.820
Match made for a Kickstarter project like if you showed up on that radar and said hey anybody got got 10 bucks

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.780
They want to anybody interested in making this thing that I want to make like I bet you would make like like like like

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.580
Everyone would immediately crowdfund you because you've got this track record

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:09.380
Of like obviously you only do exactly what you want to do and that's all anyone wants to pay to see is somebody that

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.660
You know they're like like Quentin Tarantino is within the studio system

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:18.740
But at least you're watching somebody that like you're like holy shit like I'm definitely watching whatever Quentin Tarantino wanted to do

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:25.220
And not everybody gets to do that in and have major theatrical distribution, but I'm always trying to

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.940
Figure out his formula

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:35.140
Of being creative and then and yeah, and then but I'm not jealous. I'm more fascinated

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.420
Obviously like everybody I'm a huge fan, but I was thinking so we had

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300
A slave burned down some plantation

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.660
A ragtag team a nazi's kill Hitler

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.220
I'm thinking the next is

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.220
Somebody stops a plane from hitting a building

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.660
I was gonna go with like a group of a scrappy group of altar boys kill the pope

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.820
He's pandering a little bit. Yeah, or you make they make him retire. We got pictures, you know

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:10.100
But you know Bravo Bravo executives bring out a shit full enders and Oliver stone

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.980
Literally did the fucking like a tower movie like Tarantino's obviously going well. I don't know

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:19.140
I'm not sorry like like like what he's doing is cinematically. He's going. Oh these issues

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.140
They overcharge like a hot rod engine in a way that makes it go

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:29.460
Yeah, like it's like who who hates nazi who doesn't hate nazi's nobody

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:35.700
Yeah, and it lets him go fucking crazy. No, no, and it makes you it sounds

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.900
Silly, but he's not manipulating but you're super happy watching it. I'm a huge fan

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:47.060
Uh, it didn't when you said that though. I was thinking like Quentin Tarantino's Hogan's heroes. I would love to see that

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:55.460
Hey, Bob, would you do us a big favor double-edged sword? You came up here. You you soaked up your accolades big funny Bob Hope cameo

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:02.260
It's kind of a cock. My girlfriend's sick tonight. She's not here. Could you play her part in dudges and dragons?

01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.060
Sure, okay

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.060
All right. All right

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.060
Spencer if you would dispense the uh

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.020
Uh

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.580
The character sheets, you know how it works, Bob. I I watched I have to say

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.020
And uh, I'm with an open mind

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:23.780
But uh when I went to the uh homecoming show at the egyptian when you did this part, I couldn't have been more lost

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.260
Yeah, well because that was a rat fuck

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.020
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, that was all over the kitchen, man

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.420
No, okay. Well, I'll try my best. That's all I can do. I don't think anybody's calling that uh, yeah, yeah

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:42.100
Basically these character sheets. I tend to stare at them with my eyeballs, but I'm not actually reading anything on them

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.100
I'm just nervous

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:50.340
Yeah, this is gonna I just just put the first time last week and it didn't make any sense to me

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.780
So just sort of go with it. The idea is like spensters the narrator

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.820
He tells you what's going on and he's the final judge of everything that happens and he has dice and he has a

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:06.100
An encyclopedic knowledge of rules to guide him, but you tell him on a turn-by-turn basis like what it is you want to do

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:10.260
Um, and he'll tell you whether or not that's uh available to you

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:15.700
And if it's something hard for you to do he'll roll the dice and you'll find out the outcome of that is that correct spencer

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.620
That's correct. All right, and your character is kind of like has has arrows and shoots a lot of arrows

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:24.420
She just uh last week she fucked Dan under a horse

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.500
Oh, that's right. You yeah, she used to be a dude

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:35.060
You're in love with me. How's she you're in love with the aunt used to be a dude you fucked him under a horse

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:39.060
Uh, you shoot arrows spencer if you would get us up to date

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.460
Last time our heroes had split up

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.620
Sharpie and mole rain possessed with compassionate spirits charged off on coco the animal companion along

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.220
this length of the infinite fish in the hopes this is a run-on sense of

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.700
Finding the fish-dwelling tribe of humans and a halfling in the wreckage of the fish

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:05.540
But the pair didn't realize the truly infinite nature of the infinite fish and soon retired

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:11.620
Grip by passion and a sense of daring heroism the couple copulated in the shade of their great horse

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:19.380
Meanwhile quark ran into a progress blocking thicket in the forest a massive wall of trees

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:25.220
Believing traps to be about he stood stock still allowing him to hear the approach of yet another stranger

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.100
Christopher the songsman

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:33.860
The two caught up on recent happenings and bounced ideas for song titles off each other for a time

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:41.140
Yeah, but i've got Christopher, you know lady in red sang lady in red. Yeah, that's that's his character. He also wrote it

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:48.100
It's a great song. It's a good jam. Yeah, he's also a thief

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:57.220
Yeah, he also is a thief. That's so true 30 seconds pressure. I know I just I'm maybe I'm feeling uh

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:03.140
Rejoined by Sharpie and mole rain who bathing in the afterglow decided that the fish-dwelling folk of the infinite fish

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.260
Were probably fine and charged swiftly towards the exact location

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:12.260
The party set off following Christopher their newfound guide toward the soul of growth. You did it again perfect

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.180
How do you do it special

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.580
So you're caught up right that all made sense. Oh, yeah, now I understand

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:26.420
Yeah, so uh, we're going off after a thing called the soul of growth

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:31.780
Yeah, and uh, I'm following my new my newfound possibly friend Chris de Burgh

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.180
Hopefully friend. Yeah singer songwriter

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:42.340
Of the lady in red great. Uh, you've heard that song, right? He's good with a bow and a dagger as well a bow and a dagger

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.940
Yeah, that's good to know

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:50.260
Uh, and uh, he keeps trying to go back to the well of writing songs about women in various shades

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.220
of clothing women in white

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:59.300
Uh, right women in beige. Yeah, I did. I think there was a dude in scarlet was one of them

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:04.900
Uh, I feel like they haven't really hit as hard as we're all together now. We've all caught up

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.060
You're all together following Chris de Burgh to the rumored location of the soul of growth

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:15.700
Okay, I examine the uh immediate surroundings as you walk you notice the purple tinge of the sky beginning to ripple and change

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:24.180
Oh, the floating light giving orbs of this plane ceased shedding their brilliant light and one by one begin winning winking out of existence

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460
So so it's nighttime the sky

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:33.860
It changes to deep red and the shadows grow deep. I think it's uh, I just realized

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500
It's a fine line between spencer and prince

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.500
Is there about to be a raspberry dawn

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.220
The sky is purple people running everywhere

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.780
Holy won't you see

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.380
Uh, he's a good songwriter. You should be flattered. Yeah, I what oh

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:59.220
Uh, I wanted to ask a question because uh, I was listening to the last couple episodes and realized that during the various blackout drunks

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.220
That occur at this segment in the show

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:07.540
That I acquired a book of fiery writing, right? It's a book of bloody writing. Yeah

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.740
Anything uh, you want to tell me about that?

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:15.140
Is it me the disembodied voice that describes your surroundings?

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.940
Uh, wait, what sorry

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:22.420
I just say yes. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes you the gods my yes

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:28.660
You found a book you believed it to be magic. It's similar to uh, your spell book, but you know also different

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:35.380
Radiates strong power. I think you noticed at one point and you you wanted it. It's probably some sort of artifact

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.100
You couldn't read the language

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.340
Do I think it's a spell book?

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:45.220
You think it's some form of spell book or maybe I could read it and cast the spells from it if it was

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.900
If if you could read it like I can I read it? I mean

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:53.620
Can christian he can read music can Chris de Burgh read

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.300
Can Chris de Burgh read this book? Act it out. You're just talking to me

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:03.380
You gotta hold I hold the book up to my companions and I go anybody anybody ever see this language

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.740
Look look look with your eyes not with your hands. That's um

01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:09.940
That's clearly a duck

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:16.100
I I speak gnome common and dwarf. It doesn't seem to be what I what I can speak. No, uh

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.140
Yeah, I can read it

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.660
I can read it. You definitely recognize it. Oh christ Chris de Burgh

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.500
You're not you're not just a songwriter. You're a bloody book reader

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:34.980
I got a lot of you ironically you could read this book, but you couldn't read the uh pulse of the of the people

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:40.420
Uh, how do you know? I think I'd read it pretty well at least once well

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.340
Are you saying you can read the writing in red?

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.380
It's all blood as long as it's red colored. I'm the king of it

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:56.100
All right Chris de Burgh. What does this book say I hand it to him? Uh, it's just the lyrics to my song

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.260
No, turn the page. Oh, sorry

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:07.460
Uh, you recognize them to be magic words, but not being a wizard. You can't really glean their true meaning

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.140
They're magic words, but I'm not really a wizard. So

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.020
what language

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.140
Magic is I'm gonna say

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:23.940
It's a far realms language. It's uh, it's uh, it's urdu the language we speak in pakistan. It's fine

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:31.460
That's a you shake your head is that that's made up my head. I know. Yeah, you don't know. I don't pakistan

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.020
I don't know how to read it. I don't know how to read it, right?

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:38.740
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, you know, like it would say like abracadabra, you know

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.700
Like you could read it, but I can read it. Oh, I can read it phonetically. It's like alphanage

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:49.300
You just don't get magic. So you don't really well, but if you said the words out loud with the spells still work

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:54.500
Well, no, uh, he you have to weave the spell the word give me that book back. I take it back. No, I can

01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:02.660
If you're a magician if you're a wizard, I can read the words and then you can repeat them and then make the magic happen

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.980
Yeah, is that true?

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.300
You guys how you guys it feels like studying together like, you know

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:13.300
Studying partners and work through the book and then you could learn the secrets with them

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.580
Really, I could I'll show you what the words are and then you can

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:22.740
I'll give you the book back. I've begun to assemble a study group of

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.140
Unlikely misfits

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.540
including a

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.620
middle-eastern

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.580
Savant Spencer who's obsessed with pop culture

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.420
You pulled back the curtain. It sounds a little derivative

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.940
Yeah, breakfast comfortable

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.860
I like it

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.780
While they form a study group, I take cocoa the horse and lead it off in the woods and fuck it

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:57.300
That's fine that that could happen. Okay, it's pretty sensual

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:05.860
Why not she's she's not here how what's the uh, what you'd need a stool to get up to the right height

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.580
Are you letting it do a handstand?

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:18.260
I take my sword and chop down a tree and form a stump just high enough for me to stand on and fuck Aaron's horse in the ass

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:24.260
Well, let's see here. There's actually that staff the staff with the button. I'll let you I um, I um

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.220
I can't find my horse

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.900
Oh, it's okay. I'm sure nobody's fucking right

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.460
I'm going to go walk around and see if I can find my horse

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.460
Coco

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.620
You hear the sounds of grunting and nae

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.260
Coco

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:50.100
What are you? Oh, oh, oh my god. Oh my god. No, it's not what it looks like

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.540
It kind of looks like he chopped down a tree to get taught enough to fuck the horse

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.100
All right, that is it's exactly what it looks like. I am

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.300
keenly, uh

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.860
Acknowledgable about nature and I am upset that you did this to a tree

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.460
G&G master bob gulfwood

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:19.780
Yeah, the horse is a fuck horse. Everybody's fucked up. Yeah

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.380
You could you could fuck it. You could fuck under it. Is it's a fuck horse?

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.660
If you can imagine it it can do it

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.180
All right, uh, uh me and the horse

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:37.380
I'll just uh take a post-coital nap and time passes and hopefully uh sharpie and uh Chris de Burgh have

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:41.380
Decoded the book at this point. Well, it is a long book

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:46.420
I will say that you've decoded a couple pages and might be able to cast off a spell or two

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.740
All right, I fuck the horse again take another nap

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:56.100
Well, I that would be fine. However as night had fallen before you guys cut me off, um

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:01.940
Um, you hear the low moaning all around you of some approaching of a horse

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.180
Sorry, sorry the horse and the throes of orgasm

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:13.220
No several several low moans all around you far away

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:18.420
Pretty far away. I uh, I hear some horse moaning

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.540
I hear not cocoa

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:28.500
I hear I hear you know how you make a horse moan. Are you chopped down a tree?

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:42.500
Can we can um sharpie and Chris de Burgh? Hey, I think you're ready to try a spell to like

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:49.060
Against these guys. Oh, hold on. We don't know that these these guys. I hold on Chris de Burgh

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:53.300
I I I I want to send avenger up to get a uh, literal

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:59.620
Birds-eye view avenger avenger is a hawk hawk for those of you first time podcast listeners

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.540
Avenger

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.660
Fly and seek

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:15.140
Launching from your arm avenger takes to the air soonies past the canopy of thick trees

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:21.380
That's me that's my hawk way of saying keep doing what you're doing

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.740
You assume he's circling around getting the lay of the land and soon he returns

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.220
Avenger what's see you

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:38.660
It's it's pretty tough to see through a forest but uh avenger, please tone down the sarcasm

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:47.700
Dude your hawk's got a lot of attitude you have learned much as a bird but sarcasm remains a human domain

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:54.180
Yours is but to spy and report still still talking

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:59.700
But I managed to see at least 20

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:04.900
What looked to be gray humans approaching jesus christ we got to get the fuck out of here

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.100
I I I've never been more cowardly

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.660
There are 20 I relate this information to the writer of lady in red

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.220
I have an idea for a new song

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:22.500
Men in gray jesus christ you got a fucking you got a fucking let go man. It just comes to me, you know

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:28.660
Nothing comes to you man like a color hung up name a color

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:37.380
A name a color just name a color. No more everything doesn't have to be a color or a person wearing a color

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:44.980
You can write a song that's not a song called singing in the rain. You're not writing. You're just changing a word

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.140
It's a mad live sometimes I change uh up to two words

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.780
Because it's you know, there was lady in red and my snap out of it

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:58.020
There's an army of 20 gray people coming. I assume they're

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.900
army in red

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.900
Oh my god

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.780
Are there animals are there woodland animals around?

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:11.140
You don't hear them and it seems that they've been quiet ever since that moaning started

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:18.740
I take out one of my sacks of nuts and I and I and I attempt I attempt woodland creatures toward me Jesus after a time

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.540
The squirrel approaches a squirrel approaches

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.460
I

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.460
What is your deal?

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.020
What are you looking to do next?

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.740
You've already fucked the horse twice

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:40.020
Give me the nut. I'm in a hurry. What's up? Hey, hey, hello squirrel squirrel is carrying a brazil nut

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:46.980
You know what they call these on this plane squirrel. I look I some delicious

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.940
Oh, I don't I don't want to talk to racist squirrels. Hey, can I have that nut?

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.420
Yes, you can on one condition on one condition squirrel. I'll give you the whole sack of nuts

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:02.900
Hey, if you will scamper forth and and and examine this army and find out if their friends are foes

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:08.660
I'm not doing that. Those are fucking zombies. Oh shit. Oh, he's answered the question. All right. I fucked the squirrel

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.660
Oh

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.220
He's of no use to me now. I'm still not convinced these are bad zombies

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.180
All right, what do we know about zombies in the d&d world?

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:30.100
They're not like war like walking dead just came out. It's not why but in in the magic the d&d

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:36.420
If you hit them in the head, they don't die. They're stitched together by magic. So they'll they'll keep fighting

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:42.820
Um, so we're gonna need the spells that Chris de Burgh and Sharpie have have have have you know put together, right?

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:45.700
Put potentially. I have a question

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:53.460
Um, I don't know very much about do I I look in my I have a sack or something, right?

01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:59.380
You have knowledge of various subjects. Okay, so I know dude. I know these zombie guys

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:04.660
You know, you know a thing or two about zombies. Are they slow? Yeah, they're slower than us

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:10.500
Uh, they're not particularly fast. They're not super fast, but like they're like a glacier like if it comes for you

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.660
You're fucked like cocoa

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.420
Bad pitch

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.420
Walk in the opposite direction

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.780
I mean we weren't going anywhere anyway. How many zombies 20?

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:26.740
20 that avenger claims to have seen but you know through a forest that's pretty

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.500
There is also only as high as avenger can count. Are they in it?

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.420
I think are they between us and portals there are

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.300
There are 20 stars in the sky

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.860
always

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.860
Are they between us and the soul of growth?

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:47.380
The you don't have a beat of their exact direction in various directions

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.340
Now I get to cast one spell a day. Oh, yeah, but is it limited by

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:57.300
What is it limited? I think you know two spells where they're two spells listed on that sheet

01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:01.380
They should have been on on the on the page behind that on the right side bar

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:04.580
I left my other sheet in the other part of the forest. I think

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:12.340
No, what's my two spells? I think you can talk to plants. Oh, yeah, there's a summer and nature's ellie

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.580
Oh, yeah, you could some ally ally. Nature's ellie was a sick um

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.340
That's Kate and you can entangle

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:26.820
Hmm. Oh, so you can make the forest and tangle them. Yeah, well guys before I uh

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:30.660
Entangle these zombies or something I need from all of you

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.140
One of you needs to stop fucking my horse

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:45.700
No names I don't think I I I'm I'm currently fucking the squirrel over here

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:49.380
I should mention you critical failed that squirrel

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:56.180
So you've sprained your your story of my life Spencer

01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.180
Please don't go squirrel

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:05.940
And I before I entangled these zombies in vines and leaves. I also

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.140
I need someone to give me a

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.980
Avenger

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.980
as a pat

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.580
Oh, you heard me baby. I don't understand

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:22.100
You already have a horse. I know not even a virgin horse, but the horse is sullied

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:25.380
I'm surprised yet. She hasn't already shot two arrows at Avenger

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:33.620
What what we we we're lovers. I I know but I don't trust where this is going and I think I'm more nurturing

01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.980
This is for Avenger. It's not about you

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:44.980
I have to give give up my hawk in exchange for a tangle spell

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:51.620
That may or may not prevent zombies from well, your friends have been fucking all the other animals. Listen

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:59.620
My I don't need you to help me. I'm sorry. Can I fuck up? Can I stop writing songs about colors is what I need from you?

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.500
All right, I got a new one

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.740
Quark in a horse

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.340
That's good. No colors in that one is

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.460
Dancing with me

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:16.100
Do I know what kind of spell and that of Chris de Burgh helped me

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.380
Like decipher that tone. Do I know what kind of spell I'd be casted?

01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.460
Do you remember that spell that you cast to try and find your father where you cut yourself?

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:27.540
Yeah, my blood magic. That's that's the spell that was the first spell that you learned

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:33.620
So you could find something find father. I mean potentially don't don't wait. Don't already do it

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.220
We don't need your dad. It's pointless. It's a dumb spell

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:42.180
It brings your dad around. Yeah, it just it just it creates emotional arc

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.060
Or just bums you out

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:53.220
I like I like the idea that that uh mall rain could could summon the forest to entangle these zombies

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:58.980
All right fine, but I'm not giving her my hawk. Don't what is there anything I can do it's ridiculous that she's too

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.700
How about how about uh, well, I have stuff. Yeah

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:09.780
All right, fine knowing knowing knowing that my girlfriend is in a phase right now

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:13.940
And that and that she'll probably give the hawk back later. I give it to her

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.940
All right, and I wink at avenger in a way that goes women

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.980
Just and I wink I wink at avenger in a way that says I'm gonna fuck you

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.980
I

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.460
This is why you learn to speak to animals

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.180
Now christopher debarge

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:39.860
It's uh, it's Chris de Burgh debargh. Oh the birch. I didn't say debargh

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.860
Miss a little miss a lot

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.100
um

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.820
I really am gonna ask you to uh, you know more songwritings

01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:55.540
At all you're just gonna have to give up the skill you have no power over me

01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:01.780
No, I don't but if you want me to use my power to make the you're so needy right now

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.860
You took the hawk you're taking the one thing. I'm good at

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:14.260
Writing songs about people in various colors of clothing. He's trying to help you write better songs. You're stuck in a rut right now christopher

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.940
All right, I'll just let it go. I won't

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.220
Don't the zombies are getting closer. I won't

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.300
I won't write a new song for like a little while

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.100
All right, now i'm gonna summon all the trees the vines

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.740
and Schrabs to entangle

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.500
The army of

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.540
20 zombies

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.060
Avengers

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.700
Really bad with man at least 20 at least 20

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.500
to be stopped

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.660
Touching the trees around you they begin to contort and twist into life

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.780
They wrap and wave in anger

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:56.580
and combat and stuff

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.140
I'm determining whether it's working

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.660
Hello joe is this working

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.540
I'm determining if it's working

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:17.540
I was like mom just told you basketball practice was happening

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.500
Because i'm breaking the illusion

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.580
That's that's no fun. Oh

01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:28.260
You managed to entangle much of the zombies you feel them being held fast

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.140
And by feel I mean assume is happening

01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:39.300
How you like me now zombies pretty far off. They can't hear you if you say that can I ask you a sidebar question?

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.620
magical

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:46.340
I have a levitate spell. How high will that take me up? It'll whatever you designate

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:53.380
Um will float slowly. I think it's like 20 feet per round and then once i'm up there like

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:59.060
Here's here's the bottom line. Okay. I'm sharing this with once a roll. Yeah, like I want to become a living

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:06.820
Gun turret, you know where i'm up in the air and i'm going motherfucker and like magic miscelling like zombies

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:11.860
Okay, like a sniper tower. You have to concentrate to hold levitation

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:18.900
So you could attempt it, but um, you have a chance of failing the spell or falling out of the sky

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:24.820
I feel like there's really something in this book that's going to help us here. No, it's it'll find my dad. It's gay

01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:31.940
Or maybe the first spell isn't the best one and you guys there's more spells. Yeah, there's more spells

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:35.140
You just focus. We're gonna sit here and learn spells where we're

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:37.140
We're

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.980
You

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:42.100
You're writing a book and zombies happen. That's not on me like

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.740
Wait, wait, we made the zombies. Who's that? No, that's happened

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:54.500
Someone's yelling at it's wonderful. What's what's this sounds like somebody's dad showed up anyways guys use the second spell

01:26:54.500 --> 01:27:03.460
Oh, what there's a second spell. What's the second spell? It's called. Uh, it's called kill zombies. No, it's called blood blade. Yeah

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:10.260
It's a blade of blood potentially it's the ability what it's a blade of blood potentially

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:16.020
What does that mean? You don't know. I mean, we're gonna we're gonna try to use this blade of blood

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.540
It's red. I'll handle this

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.220
Not to write a song about it

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:26.100
Dude, red things are like my wheelhouse

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.860
I

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.980
Christopher can you sing a song about zombies and red that are so boring that

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:37.940
Kills all the zombies

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.420
Can he cast boring song on people? I

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:45.220
You know, I should have made you a fucking bard because they can like do that, but you're

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:52.980
Oh, no, I cast tonight a blood. I'm sort of like Sophie in that. I'm a thief, but I really want to be a singer

01:27:55.780 --> 01:28:02.820
Well zombies are fucking zombies that wouldn't make sense. So do we know what the blood sword spell is?

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.380
I have an idea you get the idea that I could like slice

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.020
something

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.020
Perhaps a foe or enemy

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.820
Could it give a zombie back its soul?

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:23.380
Maybe you don't know that it can't can I uh because then they would suddenly be burdened with humanity again

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:32.100
And it would be terrible doing they'd be like what the fuck are we doing a minute good? Well hunting wasn't good. All right, Spencer

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.660
It's just it just the font was fancy

01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:42.580
I'm not can I if you called that movie guys hanging out. I'd hate it

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:47.700
I start performing my lutes in hopes that Chris de Burgh sings a song

01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:52.980
That that charms the zombies can I could throw my platinum record out of?

01:28:55.380 --> 01:29:00.820
One of them records don't exist man. There's wax cylinders. Yeah, that you guys taking this seriously

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.180
Let's cast the blood blade spell. Let's do it together. All right

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:07.060
Let's do it man. I'll go and I'm gonna chop all their heads off

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.140
I'm sure that still works in d&d world

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:14.340
Can I say one thing don't chop off the ones that are already entangled do the ones that are free and coming at us

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:21.140
Good idea as it happens three breakthrough of the undergrowth the ones that just broke through definitely get those

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:32.260
Yeah, they seem intent

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:34.260
Oh

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:54.260
While you're casting your incantation one of the zombies manages to bite you in the arm

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.180
For damage

01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:02.340
Oh, dude after that happens your cell goes off. Aren't you glad you weren't holding the Avenger now? I?

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:08.260
Climb a tree. I use my climb to climb the tallest tree around us. That happens and then

01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:14.580
Using my far sword. I spin around with one hand like gene kelly in a lamp post

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.100
And I swing around using my far sword attack

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:24.260
I swing around and aim at all the zombies and try to get one far sword sweep and kill as many zombies as I can

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:30.340
As the spell blood blader goes off your far sword does as well

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:35.300
A blade of air and a blade of blood fly through the area

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.460
Hey, you should have told us to dock you motherfucker. Yeah

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.860
You guys are cool. I wasn't aiming at you guys, but we couldn't even see it

01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:51.300
It's a blade of air bro dealing 13 and 16 damage to two of the zombies slicing them into pieces

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:57.860
Yeah, I just killed two zombies everyone take it easy. You can I I climb down from the tree and fuck one of the dead zombies

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:03.940
Jesus Christ this guy. I fucking I got it. I'm hard as a diamond right here

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:09.540

All right. All right. Hey, I have a bow and arrow, right?

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:31.140
Uh, yeah, yeah, you do. Can I shoot a bow an arrow at one of the zombies? Don't just shoot the arrow

After you're all out of air. I got this thing I did bow

01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:45.060
I have a hundred bows in one arrow. So I'm pretty sure I know how this works

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:49.140
Make make whatever you do with that bow count

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:56.420
All right, so I shoot an arrow at a guy your arrow plunges into the neck of one of the remaining zombie and it takes seven damage

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:03.620
How many are left that zombie is left the rest are entangled at the bottom. So it didn't die. It didn't quite die

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.580
Oh, fuck

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:08.740
Maybe you should sing to it

Entangled in the most amount of most squid

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:31.380
Squid no not squid. That's literally the most wrong answer. Yeah. No, not squid

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.780
I summon an ape. I'm so sorry. Who's yelling at us guys everyone life

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.940

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:53.940
I feel like steel eagle. I like fiendish wolf fiendish wolf fiendish wolf. It's boring, but it's effective

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.140
Like sort of like lady in red with

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.860
Let it go Chris de Burgh

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:06.660
Listen, it is a panty dropper. A lot of people did their first kiss to that song

01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:08.660
Uh

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.580
With a plume of smoke and the smell of sulfur a black

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.220
Dark-looking wolf with red eyes

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.300
poofs into beef

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.380
And lunges for the remaining zombie tearing the throat out of the sulfur

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:27.540
The zombie lies slain. Yes. So are we free of zombies right now?

01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:32.580
You're free of unentangled zombies potentially the rest of them could get out if you give them longer

01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:36.820
All right, we should go to the place that I know that the soul of growth is at. Yeah, where is it?

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:40.740
It's I know where it is. It's don't say radio city if we

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:45.060
It's there if we already drove by it. I'll be so mad

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.580
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's just there's a lot of dunking donuts in this area. So it looks

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:57.700
Uh, can we go to as you travel the trees get thinner and give way to smooth flat stone tiles

01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.300
The floor appears ancient as part of some long past civilization

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.300
I think we're going the right way

01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:06.340
Seems like a cliffhanger, right? Seems like a cliffhanger

01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:22.340
I think we should thank bob gulfwight and kumail nanjiani for coming by

01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:36.420
Bob gulfwight, kumail nanjiani. What's that? No, I didn't say anything, but you told me I could stop by anytime. Yeah, and you should

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:41.780
You always should I take that really serious. No, you should you you should take it very serious

01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.020
I don't I don't I don't say it to random people

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:50.980
We insist bob gulfwight should come by anytime, right? All right, thanks, man. Thanks a lot. Very much so we actually insist now

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.500
We require your presence. Yeah

I like it. I like it a lot

01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:01.860
I also like I found out when we came back from tour like I'm not like like like me by myself

01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:06.340
It's like because I'm self-actualized and perfect because I've become like part man part god

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.380
Kind of boring like target. Well, what do you know?

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:15.540
Oh, so he doesn't like watching his ass who cares like I don't care like exciting people exciting people coming by

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.620
Look how much fun we have

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.780
And look how look how it dies when they leave

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:26.020
Yeah, we could have ended on that but we could have we could have played zanadu and I could have been the end of the show

01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:30.740
Yeah, what about it sounds like now I've now I've got a 150 hostages

Five-minute warning. I like it certainly like we could end the show right now. Well a little bit dumb ending

01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.340
Dumb, no, I'm just saying like

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:52.660
Like a hey cameo Bob shut the fuck up. No, don't worry

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:57.860

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.700
Out of fully fuck. I love being on the show. It's fucking amazing. Does it feel you the way it feels me?

01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:03.780
No, it feels me more than it feels you

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:07.460
Um, they love it doesn't that's not that's not their fault

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:10.340
Like you don't you don't blame

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:14.660

01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:03.220
Cooperna turd

Turd goes into the toilet goes down goes into the sewer pipe goes all around goes to the place where they turn poop

01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:14.820
Into water comes out of the faucet and it's drunken by your sons and daughters

01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:20.420
Then they put it into their tummies and they poop it out and they go. Oh, that was so yummy

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:23.460

Open your mouth open your eyes. Yeah, yeah, but dan. Yeah, sorry

01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:32.820
Use all of your magic powers and tell us what you've learned about the difference between baths and showers

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:34.820
You know when you

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:37.460
Yeah, yeah

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:43.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah learn when you go into the tub and you stand still the water comes out

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:47.460
But it's like pink hill. It just stands there. It's on the air forever

01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:50.980
And it sprays off your body and there's no endeavor

01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:54.020
But when you soak inside some hot goo

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:58.180
Then it makes you a whole new you when you go into it

01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:03.860
It's like getting baptized and you come out you you're you're a different guy and you go surprise mother fucker

01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:09.860
I'm I'm a brand new Dan Harmon. I'm extra clean and extra charming. Yeah, but yeah, yeah

01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:11.940
I know that you'd rather be alive and dead

01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:15.060
But tell me if you were a doctor, but you wanted to be a comedian instead

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:20.980
Yo, if my name was sophie, then I tried to go to ucb and get an extra trophy

01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:28.020
I try to get chopped by Matt Besser and if I couldn't do that I'd go to somewhere lesser like like io west

01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:30.180
It's a good place. It's not the best

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:33.060
But you know you can still learn some shit and go to the test

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:38.580
You can get on stage and if you if you can't do improv you can be in a cage match

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.780
It's it's a good place for a workshop

01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:44.500
But it's a kind of like the equivalent of pig slop

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:49.620
But you know you pay five hundred dollars and then they tell you oh, here's the rules

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:53.380
Here's your collar. All right dan now since you got us all captive here

01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.740
Tell us why it's better to say high five the gay guy than smear the queer

01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:59.700
Wait, wait, sorry. I didn't understand your question

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:02.580
Why is it better to say high five the gay guy than smear the queer?

01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:08.820
Because gay people from the beginning of time have always tried to do things with just an extra cultural line

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:14.500
They try to they put it on the cocktail rim. Does it matter if you fuck her or fuck a him?

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.700
I don't think so. I doubt it

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.700
But I really doubt it

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:24.980
