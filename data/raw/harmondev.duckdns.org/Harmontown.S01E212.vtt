WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Oh, yeah.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
All right, all right.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Thank you.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
All right, yes.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
From Hollywood, California,

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Nerdmelt Theater,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Yeah.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes, yes.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Yeah.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Yeah.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Yeah.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Yeah.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Yes.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes, exactly.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Yes, yes.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I am your Comptroller Jeff Bryan Davis.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Yes.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Thank you.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Thank you very much.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And keep that going for the mayor of Harmontown.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
MC Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Yo.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Yo.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Yo.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Give him a laugh.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Yo.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Hip hop.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Hip hop.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Hip hop.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Hip...

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Hip hop.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Hip hop.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Hip hop.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Hip hop.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Hold on. hip hop.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Hip...

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hip hop.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Hip hop.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.500
Hip hop.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.500
Motherfucker

01:27.500 --> 01:31.500
A hip hop is gotten sad and lonely

01:32.500 --> 01:35.500
Largely auto-turn driven

01:36.500 --> 01:38.500
I got sadness

01:38.500 --> 01:41.500
I got hip hop sadness

01:42.500 --> 01:44.500
Yeah, I got hip hop sadness

01:45.500 --> 01:47.500
Why don't you call me on the phone?

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
Why don't you love me?

01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
Why don't you paint me to fuck you?

01:54.500 --> 01:56.500
Why don't you worship me?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.500
Why are you trying to kill me?

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
I got bigger problems than you motherfucker

02:01.500 --> 02:03.500
I'm a sad hip hop man

02:05.500 --> 02:07.500
Paint me to fuck you

02:09.500 --> 02:11.500
Or I'll shoot you

02:11.500 --> 02:13.500
Just kidding

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500
I'd rather shoot myself

02:16.500 --> 02:18.500
Or do so many drugs

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
I didn't want to rhyme it with shelf

02:24.500 --> 02:26.500
But what's she gonna do?

02:27.500 --> 02:29.500
Yo, I got problems

02:29.500 --> 02:30.500
And what?

02:30.500 --> 02:32.500
I got problems in the

02:32.500 --> 02:33.500
Middle

02:33.500 --> 02:36.500
And the top of my dick

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
I got problems with all of them

02:39.500 --> 02:40.500
Face

02:40.500 --> 02:41.500
I got problems

02:41.500 --> 02:43.500
I got lonely, sad

02:43.500 --> 02:46.500
Drug-addled problems

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
I don't believe in God no more

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
But if I did it fucking so hard

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
And go out the door

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
I fucked a devil too

02:54.500 --> 02:56.500
I'll go and rule in hell

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
And say how about you?

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
I would have fucked a devil hard

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
Cause I'm so sad and lonely

03:02.500 --> 03:04.500
I'm a hip hop sad

03:04.500 --> 03:06.500
Modern hip hop lonely man

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
And I got my

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
I got my auto-tune to pay

03:11.500 --> 03:14.500
I could afford to be in a studio

03:15.500 --> 03:16.500
Why?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
Why is that a thing now?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.500
I didn't share this

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
I don't want to sound old

03:23.500 --> 03:25.500
But didn't share this

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
Why is everyone doing it?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.500
It seems like the 80s

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
And there's some cool things about the 80s

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
I don't want to shit on them

03:40.500 --> 03:42.500
Cause the Druffer brothers are here

03:42.500 --> 03:44.500
And I think they like the 80s

03:46.500 --> 03:48.500
I think they kinda like the 80s

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
But I don't like the ladies

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
Because they're just like a drug

03:53.500 --> 03:55.500
The tops are fire in my soul

03:55.500 --> 03:57.500
I hang myself with my clothes

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
Oh, my neck is broken

03:59.500 --> 04:01.500
And my soul is empty

04:01.500 --> 04:03.500
I'm a modern hip hop guy

04:03.500 --> 04:04.500
I'm sad

04:04.500 --> 04:06.500
It's almost hip hop

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
But it's not any less violent

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
I could have predicted this phenomenon

04:10.500 --> 04:13.500
It's weird and kind of admirable

04:13.500 --> 04:14.500
But fuck you mama

04:14.500 --> 04:16.500
So hard she turned into a bull

04:16.500 --> 04:19.500
It was ancient Greek in that regard

04:19.500 --> 04:21.500
I'm gonna go across the river sticks

04:21.500 --> 04:24.500
And cut myself with a shard of myself

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
I'm trying to...

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
I don't want to be like one of those guys

04:34.500 --> 04:36.500
That's like, oh, I'm rapping

04:36.500 --> 04:38.500
And then it's like

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
My name is something that I'm here to say

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
And then you're like, come on

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
The rap doesn't sound like that anymore

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
So I listened to more rap

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
And I was like, jeez, these guys are so...

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
They're so sad

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
It's really...

04:53.500 --> 04:54.500
You really couldn't have predicted it

04:54.500 --> 04:55.500
Cause it was...

04:55.500 --> 04:56.500
Oh, is it...

04:56.500 --> 04:57.500
I'm still...

04:57.500 --> 04:59.500
They're so sad

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
Alright, so there's...

05:04.500 --> 05:07.500
The knob that's supposed to change key

05:07.500 --> 05:10.500
I guess I wish I knew more about music

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
I don't think that one works

05:11.500 --> 05:12.500
I think we need to send that back

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
But then there's a knob that says

05:17.500 --> 05:19.500
And it has two settings

05:25.500 --> 05:27.500
Which we now know it shouldn't

05:27.500 --> 05:30.500
It should be a continuum

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
But it's two settings or this

05:33.500 --> 05:35.500
Which is 1999

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
The Prince definition

05:40.500 --> 05:41.500
And then this

05:41.500 --> 05:44.500
Which is just, you know, Alvin

05:44.500 --> 05:47.500
That's the Parliament funkadelic voice

05:47.500 --> 05:48.500
Yeah

05:48.500 --> 05:50.500
We're going to a planet of music

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
Say atomic dodge

05:52.500 --> 05:54.500
I hope you bring some pussy

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
It ain't about that

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
It's about music

05:57.500 --> 05:59.500
What are you, gay?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.500
No, I'm a human being

06:02.500 --> 06:04.500
Sounds gay

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
Then maybe all humans are gay

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
Maybe we'd like to fuck music

06:08.500 --> 06:11.500
You can do it somewhere else

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Cause I'm straight

06:15.500 --> 06:17.500
Because it's 1983

06:17.500 --> 06:20.500
And I'm not allowed to be gay

06:23.500 --> 06:26.500
Resulting in quite a lot of

06:26.500 --> 06:29.500
fantastical costumes and hairstyles

06:29.500 --> 06:32.500
Because when you put your thumb over a hose

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
It sprays everywhere

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
Oh, yeah

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
You're like, yeah

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
You're like the new Reggie Watts

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
What's that?

06:43.500 --> 06:45.500
You're like the new Reggie Watts, I think

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
This is the new show

06:47.500 --> 06:49.500
What does Reggie Watts do?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
He's got a delay pedal, he's great

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
Oh, no!

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
I was not the first person to think of using it comedically

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
Oh, no

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
Oh, honey

06:57.500 --> 06:59.500
Oh, no

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
Well, alright, I'll pull a rip card

07:02.500 --> 07:04.500
I have some ventriloquist dummies in the back

07:04.500 --> 07:06.500
I've got one that's on terrorists

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
Oh, they're not

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
But he's not too bright

07:09.500 --> 07:11.500
He blows himself up

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
I make fun of him

07:14.500 --> 07:18.500
So, I hear we have one guest here

07:18.500 --> 07:21.500
Who wasn't here when we started the show

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
Oh, okay

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
Well, alright

07:23.500 --> 07:26.500
Well, it's 9-11, so let's bring out Andy Dick

07:26.500 --> 07:29.500
Well, I don't think it's him, I think it's just Dino

07:29.500 --> 07:32.500
Oh, alright, well, it's 9-11, so let's bring out Dino

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
Happy 9-11!

07:44.500 --> 07:49.500
Yeah, in remembrance, we're not going to point out when it becomes 9-11 tonight, I think

07:49.500 --> 07:52.500
Tonight, it's all one big remembrance

07:52.500 --> 07:54.500
Did you see the clip that was circulating?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.500
The guy on the Stairmaster?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
No

07:57.500 --> 08:04.500
There was a fireman wearing all his gear and did 157 steps or whatever they did on the Stairmaster

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
I know, it's sad

08:06.500 --> 08:10.500
I love misguided sincerity, I love that

08:10.500 --> 08:14.500
I love it that that guy, I hope he was crying

08:14.500 --> 08:17.500
I'm not because I want to make fun of him, but I can't

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
No, he was sad

08:19.500 --> 08:21.500
I love that, I like that

08:21.500 --> 08:29.500
There was a clip that was circulating from around 9-11 when, as the footage of the towers are falling

08:29.500 --> 08:34.500
and Donald Trump, who then was only a Pizza Hut spokesman and reality show host

08:34.500 --> 08:39.500
He's just talking about, and he knows 9-11 is happening

08:39.500 --> 08:45.500
and he knows fully well, he's in a labyrinth of things to say wrong

08:45.500 --> 08:53.500
He's just like, yeah, by the way, I'm over at a 60 Trump Boulevard or whatever

08:53.500 --> 08:57.500
which was the tallest building before the World Trade Center

08:57.500 --> 09:02.500
and then for a while it was the second tallest, but now it's the tallest again

09:02.500 --> 09:06.500
I didn't watch the actual clip, but that's the description of what's happening

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
is that he's just like, why not?

09:08.500 --> 09:13.500
What can happen? I'm famous for my honesty and my charm

09:13.500 --> 09:23.500
Why don't I just go right through those saloon doors and just start whipping around like a little carousel

09:23.500 --> 09:27.500
It's so hacky that his name is Trump, that's all he cares about

09:27.500 --> 09:30.500
Yeah, he cares about Trump

09:30.500 --> 09:33.500
I'm saying God's hacky, not me

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
No, yeah, yeah

09:35.500 --> 09:38.500
Did you see my Reggie Watts?

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
I just got out of band practice, I could use that for my voice

09:41.500 --> 09:43.500
because I'm not a good singer

09:43.500 --> 09:46.500
I'm starting a band, you know that

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
I'm just telling the world

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
You've started a band?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.500
So you're here because Farrell Audio now has a show with you and Andy on it

09:53.500 --> 09:54.500
That's right, yeah

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
called Skull Juice

09:56.500 --> 10:06.500
Yeah, it's just like, I kind of just do it because Andy needs someone to talk to every now and then

10:06.500 --> 10:09.500
Like everyone's cut him out of his life

10:09.500 --> 10:13.500
Yeah, and he's like, well you guys just did this thing where you went

10:13.500 --> 10:23.500
Yeah, we just went to New York and we read an old script that I wrote with Scott Attson, Stephen Colbert and Mike Steinoff of TV's Blossom fame

10:23.500 --> 10:27.500
He played the older brother, Anthony, the ex-drug addict

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
Tony Blossom?

10:29.500 --> 10:33.500
Yeah, the only person less famous was me there, up on this

10:33.500 --> 10:36.500
Louis was on, yeah, we wrote Louis into the script

10:36.500 --> 10:39.500
And yeah, we went to New York

10:39.500 --> 10:43.500
You guys did a reading of the script that you had written in the old days that was kind of like before 30 Rock

10:43.500 --> 10:48.500
It was like a script you had written that was like behind the scenes at an L-type show

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
That's right, yeah

10:49.500 --> 10:51.500
Barry Levinson hired me to write it

10:51.500 --> 10:56.500
He wanted it to be like behind the scenes of an Ed Sullivan show with like jugglers and monkeys and stuff

10:56.500 --> 10:59.500
And I'm like, I have no fucking clue what that means

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
I said, what about SNL?

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
He's like, that's a dumb idea

11:03.500 --> 11:08.500
And we argued the whole time, but so this was kind of like a hybrid

11:08.500 --> 11:13.500
But yeah, so then we went reddit and Smigal was part of it, Robert Smigal

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
And yeah, it was fun

11:15.500 --> 11:18.500
Everyone had a good time except for Andy, does Andy hear you?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
So I could talk behind his back

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
He was so depressed afterwards

11:22.500 --> 11:26.500
He's like, why was I even there? It was all about you and your friends

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
And how you keep in touch with people

11:28.500 --> 11:33.500
He's such a, like I always, he was on Great Minds, the history channel thing

11:33.500 --> 11:37.500
And it's like, he's amazing, he'll be here any second

11:37.500 --> 11:41.500
He's very funny and wonderful

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
He's great, yeah

11:42.500 --> 11:46.500
When he's like, somebody said he's right here, what is it?

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
Is he like, just bring him in

11:49.500 --> 11:51.500
There he is!

11:51.500 --> 11:53.500
Yeah

11:53.500 --> 11:56.500
Thank God you walked in when I said you were great

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
You didn't hear that?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.500
No, I did

11:59.500 --> 12:01.500
I said, yeah, he's great

12:01.500 --> 12:04.500
Like that

12:04.500 --> 12:07.500
Alright, yeah, I mean, he's putting it in vibrate

12:07.500 --> 12:09.500
Happy 9-11, buddy

12:09.500 --> 12:13.500
No, no, I'm putting it on, I'm Snapchatting these lovely people

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
Look at them, I love them

12:15.500 --> 12:18.500
Hi everybody, say hi

12:18.500 --> 12:21.500
Look, oh, how sweet

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
Oh, grumpy cows

12:23.500 --> 12:26.500
Grumpy cows

12:28.500 --> 12:32.500
I think we were about to talk about, well, what I would like to talk about with Andy

12:32.500 --> 12:37.500
Because I, I mean, it's easy enough to go like, oh, Andy, Andy's amazing

12:37.500 --> 12:42.500
Like, I think, you know, there's a little phase of your career where it's like, you know

12:42.500 --> 12:46.500
Like the clown prince or like, you know, people are going like, oh, Andy Dick

12:46.500 --> 12:50.500
And then you, like, there's an unspoken like, like, you know

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
Oh, him

12:51.500 --> 12:55.500
Yeah, cautionary, you know, it's like, you were, I always looked at you as like, pan

12:55.500 --> 12:57.500
Like, from Greek mythology, like, you're a pan

12:57.500 --> 12:59.500
Like, where we, where we get the word panic

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
Sexy

13:00.500 --> 13:05.500
It's like, like, half goat and he's got a flute and he like, comes down the mountain

13:05.500 --> 13:09.500
And causes fucking hysteria and craziness and like, like, for the sake of it

13:09.500 --> 13:14.500
And then either disappears or gets beat up by Wesley Snipes in a bathroom

13:14.500 --> 13:17.500
Did you, did you have an encounter with Wesley Snipes?

13:17.500 --> 13:22.500
Okay, yeah, all right, so, but, but, but

13:22.500 --> 13:25.500
Can I tell you what happened with that?

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
I, but I think I know

13:26.500 --> 13:27.500
Well, I dropped the end bomb

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
Right

13:28.500 --> 13:29.500
It was, you know

13:29.500 --> 13:33.500
Oh, that's bad, Andy

13:33.500 --> 13:37.500
That's a no-no

13:37.500 --> 13:41.500
We have a whole podcast, our whole podcast that just went up, sorry, I don't want to derail

13:41.500 --> 13:47.500
But it's about how Andy read an article about how black people's eyes have been

13:47.500 --> 13:50.500
They've been bred to have their eyes pop out

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
When they're scared

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
So what, about, what?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.500
Well, that's, that's, okay

13:57.500 --> 13:59.500
Let's move along from that

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
Was the article in Hustler?

14:02.500 --> 14:05.500
There was no article, it was my philosophy

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
What?

14:06.500 --> 14:11.500
Oh, you didn't tell me that

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
You told me you read it somewhere

14:13.500 --> 14:18.500
Because I was trying to get away from it

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
And then we talked about

14:20.500 --> 14:26.500
There's a whole group of black people that can, their eyes, they can just go thunk and their eyes pop out

14:26.500 --> 14:30.500
What do you, is that your, are you saying what if there was, is that your

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
No, there is

14:32.500 --> 14:36.500
Yeah, a lot of black people can make

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
Is there something wrong with it?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.500
And then I just thought that, I think

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
Well, it's a road player, the phrase black people

14:42.500 --> 14:48.500
It makes, it just makes people do what they should in traffic, which is like, no, they just go like, okay

14:48.500 --> 14:52.500
And do, do their feet also do their duty when they run?

14:52.500 --> 14:56.500
No, come on, no, I'm serious then, and I don't like saying African American

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
Because they're not from Africa

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
It takes too much time, too

15:00.500 --> 15:04.500
Black, I don't know, I'm white, they say white when I'm black

15:04.500 --> 15:08.500
I think black people's fine, it's not a magical phrase that makes people think you're a bad person

15:08.500 --> 15:13.500
I was just saying, like, it puts everybody, it puts millennials, they cover the break

15:13.500 --> 15:18.500
They go like, okay, I'm, it's bumper to bumper, I'm gonna go 35 instead of 45

15:18.500 --> 15:24.500
That's what, that, because they're, they've seen shit

15:24.500 --> 15:28.500
Like, they were born into it, like, they're not, it's not like

15:28.500 --> 15:32.500
Like, I think our generation goes like, what are these people, after all this time

15:32.500 --> 15:36.500
What are they so worried about and complaining about, it's like, they just got here

15:36.500 --> 15:38.500
And all they've seen is fucked up shit

15:38.500 --> 15:43.500
Like, we actually, like, kind of because we were, because we lived through no internet

15:43.500 --> 15:48.500
And then into internet, our perception as Gen Xers, whatever we are

15:48.500 --> 15:55.500
Is that, oh, everything was fine until everyone started talking about it

15:55.500 --> 15:58.500
That's our, that's been like the fiber of our being

15:58.500 --> 16:03.500
And then the new generation is typified by just their relate, they just, they were born

16:03.500 --> 16:08.500
And they're like, mama, dad, internet, and the internet was like

16:08.500 --> 16:12.500
The cops will shoot you if you're black, and they're like, why, what's that mean

16:12.500 --> 16:16.500
And they're like, you know, what, and then there's like, fuck you, libtard

16:16.500 --> 16:18.500
And they're like, what the fuck is happening

16:18.500 --> 16:22.500
They get a fire hose of information to the face every day

16:22.500 --> 16:25.500
I mean, you're just saying people shouldn't listen to our podcast

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
And I think you're right

16:26.500 --> 16:27.500
No, I think it's good

16:27.500 --> 16:34.500
I'm trying to, I'm trying to, I'm trying to think more, I'm trying to think more laterally about it

16:34.500 --> 16:37.500
And just go, these are the things that make us different

16:37.500 --> 16:40.500
For that reason, like we had Karen Kilgariff on last week

16:40.500 --> 16:44.500
And she, she hosts a true crime show

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
And we talked about it, it's like, well true crime through a certain lens

16:46.500 --> 16:49.500
It's like, it's totally insensitive and non-PC

16:49.500 --> 16:52.500
Because you're like having fun talking about people getting killed and like blah blah blah

16:52.500 --> 16:55.500
But it's like, it doesn't, there is no person out there that's like

16:55.500 --> 16:58.500
I'm gonna, I'm gonna figure out what's right and what's wrong

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
It's just like, when you look at people as a biomass

17:00.500 --> 17:03.500
And then they emanate like these weird things

17:03.500 --> 17:06.500
I'm sure everybody would be, would love to tune in and listen to you guys

17:06.500 --> 17:09.500
Like transgress a million thresholds a minute

17:09.500 --> 17:12.500
Because it's not, it doesn't mean that they're bad people for listening and stuff

17:12.500 --> 17:15.500
Well I was listening to it, and I was getting angry

17:15.500 --> 17:19.500
But I got angry because we went into a whole

17:19.500 --> 17:23.500
Tyrate about what's going on

17:23.500 --> 17:26.500
We're scoping now

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
We are scoping

17:28.500 --> 17:31.500
Right, is that what that is? It's scoping

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
Periscoping?

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
No, he's Snapchat, right?

17:33.500 --> 17:36.500
Although I was big on it for a one-hot minute

17:36.500 --> 17:37.500
On Periscope

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
What are you streaming there then?

17:39.500 --> 17:40.500
Facebook Live

17:40.500 --> 17:41.500
Oh, that's where it's at now

17:41.500 --> 17:42.500
I should have asked, but

17:42.500 --> 17:43.500
Oh yeah, no

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
No, no, no, we're streaming you

17:44.500 --> 17:46.500
No, it's not happening anywhere

17:46.500 --> 17:47.500
It's happening right here

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
You know, this is all being videoed

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
We're scoping

17:50.500 --> 17:52.500
No, but I, you know, for the people

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
Wherever, let me tell you something

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
I was periscoping

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
I was periscoping once

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
And people make fun of me for doing that

17:59.500 --> 18:00.500
Sure

18:05.500 --> 18:07.500
We also went in about like

18:07.500 --> 18:09.500
Here's what it is

18:09.500 --> 18:12.500
What my thought on that

18:12.500 --> 18:15.500
What I think popping out is

18:15.500 --> 18:17.500
That, well, the eyes will pop out

18:17.500 --> 18:19.500
Like they can go, watch this, watch this

18:19.500 --> 18:21.500
All you can, they can make them hot out

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
And I think that they were

18:23.500 --> 18:25.500
They were bred maybe

18:25.500 --> 18:27.500
Like they were the one

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
Not that they were

18:28.500 --> 18:31.500
Don't worry about them

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
He didn't need to say

18:32.500 --> 18:35.500
I think that back in

18:35.500 --> 18:37.500
This is just a weird thought I had

18:37.500 --> 18:40.500
And that is, you know, when

18:40.500 --> 18:42.500
You know, the thing, yeah

18:42.500 --> 18:43.500
When we don't have an audience

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
We can roll around about it

18:45.500 --> 18:47.500
Roll around the mud

18:47.500 --> 18:49.500
When there was horrible, horrible things

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
Going on, especially in our country

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
The slavery days

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
Which is still hard to

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
Even wrap my head around

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
That it was really in our lifetime

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
And it's really now even still

19:01.500 --> 19:03.500
Racial shit is still horrible

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
Alright, so you're anti-slavery

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
Which should soften the blow

19:06.500 --> 19:08.500
Of what you're about to say

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
Which is you believe that

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
A forced breeding program

19:12.500 --> 19:14.500
To create a comedic effect

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
I just had the thought

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
You know, you're not gonna like it

19:18.500 --> 19:20.500
I really don't even know why I brought it up

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
I just had the thought that

19:22.500 --> 19:24.500
How come I can't make my eyes pop out

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
And I don't know any white people

19:26.500 --> 19:28.500
That can make their eyes pop out

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
I think back in the day

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
When they were chasing down someone

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
They'd be so afraid

19:34.500 --> 19:36.500
Their eyes would pop out

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
And then they'd be like

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
That one's funny

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
Let's keep that one around

19:42.500 --> 19:44.500
It's a fucking thought

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
And that would be bad

19:46.500 --> 19:48.500
It's just a thought

19:48.500 --> 19:50.500
So I was listening back to the podcast

19:50.500 --> 19:52.500
And I was laughing, I thought we were great

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
I read it, by the way

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
I read it in Vanity Fair

19:56.500 --> 19:58.500
What? Oh, you read the thing about the eye-popping?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
So we started talking

20:00.500 --> 20:02.500
And then we went into

20:02.500 --> 20:04.500
Because on community

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
We were talking about

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
How a black writer was talking

20:08.500 --> 20:10.500
About how black people

20:10.500 --> 20:12.500
Were afraid to buy watermelon

20:12.500 --> 20:14.500
Not afraid, but embarrassed to buy watermelon

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
Because of the stigma

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
Of a black guy with watermelons

20:18.500 --> 20:20.500
So sometimes they would have

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
White people buy it for them

20:22.500 --> 20:24.500
And we're talking about how not fair it is

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
Because watermelons delicious, I know you don't like it

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
But it's great, everyone loves it

20:28.500 --> 20:30.500
And then we talked about fried chicken

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
And our favorite fried chicken place

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
Ah, that's not a pop out

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
But then we talked about Popeyes

20:36.500 --> 20:38.500
And we didn't mention

20:38.500 --> 20:40.500
That the name is Popeyes

20:40.500 --> 20:42.500
The name of the place is called Popeyes

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
Oh my god

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
Yeah

20:46.500 --> 20:48.500
Is that why?

20:48.500 --> 20:50.500
Is that why?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
Is that why?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
Look, I'm caught

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
In the cult of Andy right now

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
No, it's just a thought I had

20:58.500 --> 21:00.500
Why didn't we put two and two together?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
No, we didn't mention it

21:02.500 --> 21:04.500
So I gave you that gift on your podcast

21:04.500 --> 21:06.500
Thank you

21:06.500 --> 21:08.500
We almost can go home now

21:08.500 --> 21:10.500
I know

21:10.500 --> 21:12.500
I want to talk about

21:12.500 --> 21:14.500
I want to talk about the aspect of Andy

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
He's not famous for

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
If anything, you're famous for

21:18.500 --> 21:20.500
You know, people would assume

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
Well, you probably thick skinned

21:22.500 --> 21:24.500
Because you're such an agent to chaos

21:24.500 --> 21:26.500
I can take it, except you wouldn't know that last night

21:26.500 --> 21:28.500
I went to get a cup of coffee

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
Last night, at midnight

21:30.500 --> 21:32.500
Who does that? But I did

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
And there were these two ladies in front of me

21:34.500 --> 21:36.500
I have to tell you this real quick

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
And these two ladies are in front of me

21:38.500 --> 21:40.500
And right when I walked in

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
The guy was like

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
Oh, no, not you

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
Oh, we know you

21:46.500 --> 21:48.500
No, no, no

21:48.500 --> 21:50.500
You go crazy on coffee

21:50.500 --> 21:52.500
caffeine drives you mad

21:52.500 --> 21:54.500
And I just said, oh yeah

21:54.500 --> 21:56.500
Well, yeah, it's me

21:56.500 --> 21:58.500
And I just want a cup of coffee

21:58.500 --> 22:00.500
And then they talked

22:00.500 --> 22:02.500
And we're talking, they were done

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
They were done ordering, done getting their stuff

22:04.500 --> 22:06.500
And they just kept talking about some bar they were going to

22:06.500 --> 22:08.500
And I was just patiently waiting

22:08.500 --> 22:10.500
I just really just want a cup of coffee

22:10.500 --> 22:12.500
But I didn't say that, I was just standing there

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
And then they left

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
And then I said, yeah, I just want a cup of coffee

22:16.500 --> 22:18.500
With cream

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
And then he was talking

22:20.500 --> 22:22.500
And ignoring me

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
Kind of put the coffee mug over here

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
And he didn't start up the coffee

22:26.500 --> 22:28.500
There's a thing, it's this one on Kowango

22:28.500 --> 22:30.500
Where it's a drip thing and you press a button

22:30.500 --> 22:32.500
And then I was waiting

22:32.500 --> 22:34.500
I think that's every street coffee works like that

22:34.500 --> 22:36.500
And it felt like five minutes

22:36.500 --> 22:38.500
And I said, so does it just happen

22:38.500 --> 22:40.500
The coffee

22:40.500 --> 22:42.500
The mug isn't even

22:42.500 --> 22:44.500
And he went, oh yeah, you wanted coffee

22:46.500 --> 22:48.500
At the coffee place

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
And so he took the mug and put it under the thing

22:50.500 --> 22:52.500
And then started pressing buttons

22:52.500 --> 22:54.500
Were you just not

22:54.500 --> 22:56.500
Gonna make it

22:58.500 --> 23:00.500
And then this guy came in

23:00.500 --> 23:02.500
Immediately after

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
And then the guy said, oh

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
Are you guys closed or something

23:06.500 --> 23:08.500
And he said, yes

23:08.500 --> 23:10.500
And we're just doing illicit deals right now

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
And I went, no, no

23:12.500 --> 23:14.500
I'm just getting a cup of coffee

23:14.500 --> 23:16.500
I'm pretty sure they're open

23:16.500 --> 23:18.500
Just getting a cup of coffee

23:18.500 --> 23:20.500
I was getting like

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
This is what happened, this has never happened before

23:22.500 --> 23:24.500
Because usually I just take it

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
You said fixed skin and it's true

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
And I just take it and I take it

23:28.500 --> 23:30.500
And I snapped last night

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
You guys would have been so proud of me

23:32.500 --> 23:34.500
I fucking said no one was there

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
I don't know if you know what pride is

23:36.500 --> 23:38.500
No one was there

23:38.500 --> 23:40.500
He left

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
And then he started

23:42.500 --> 23:44.500
Remaking my coffee and doing my coffee

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
And I said

23:46.500 --> 23:48.500
Something, he said one more comment

23:48.500 --> 23:50.500
You know, you're that guy

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
And I said

23:52.500 --> 23:54.500
Something to the effect of, well

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
Sometimes I'm just a guy that just wants a cup of coffee

23:56.500 --> 23:58.500
But thanks

23:58.500 --> 24:00.500
I get it because it's the life I created

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
And you're in good company

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
Because everybody makes fun of me

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
Letterman, Conan, Harmon, you're in good company

24:06.500 --> 24:08.500
So I get it

24:08.500 --> 24:10.500
And once again, I deserve it

24:10.500 --> 24:12.500
I deserve it because I'm an idiot

24:12.500 --> 24:14.500
I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
Actually, can I tell you something

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
It's kind of a serious thing

24:18.500 --> 24:20.500
You know what it is like

24:20.500 --> 24:22.500
Just to point it out

24:22.500 --> 24:24.500
If I came in with crutches

24:24.500 --> 24:26.500
And I was like a cripple

24:26.500 --> 24:28.500
And you said, hey, sorry, we don't have a ramp for you

24:28.500 --> 24:30.500
Gimpo the clown

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
It's kind of like that, but I'm okay

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
I'm just saying, watch yourself for other people

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
That might not be okay with it

24:36.500 --> 24:38.500
But I'm perfectly fine with it

24:38.500 --> 24:40.500
But just be careful

24:40.500 --> 24:42.500
Because some people might snap

24:42.500 --> 24:44.500
He's like, no, I didn't mean it like that at all

24:44.500 --> 24:46.500
And I went, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

24:46.500 --> 24:48.500
No, you said right when I walked in

24:48.500 --> 24:50.500
You said, whoa, we know you, not you

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
What does that mean? No, I

24:52.500 --> 24:54.500
I don't even know that part about you

24:54.500 --> 24:56.500
Like what, that I'm a big drug addict

24:56.500 --> 24:58.500
Alcoholic, he's like

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
That's what I said, he said

25:00.500 --> 25:02.500
Yeah, no, I just know, you know, you're a celebrity

25:02.500 --> 25:04.500
And I smell bullshit

25:04.500 --> 25:06.500
And I'm like, oh, okay

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
Then what's your favorite thing I've ever done?

25:08.500 --> 25:10.500
He said, well, I don't know

25:10.500 --> 25:12.500
He said, I don't know

25:12.500 --> 25:14.500
I don't really know what you do

25:14.500 --> 25:16.500
I mean, that's my point, you know me from being a fucking moron

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
I admit it, I admit

25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
And then that's what you were doing

25:20.500 --> 25:22.500
You were kind of going with the fucking flow

25:22.500 --> 25:24.500
And making fun of me in front of those people

25:24.500 --> 25:26.500
And then the next guy comes in, oh no, we're just doing an illicit deal

25:26.500 --> 25:28.500
You're talking about drugs, right?

25:28.500 --> 25:30.500
And so you're lying and fuck you

25:32.500 --> 25:34.500
Oh my god, I am so proud of you

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
I am proud of you, I'm very proud of you

25:38.500 --> 25:40.500
I normally am not like that

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
I feel responsible

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
Nobody, I rise to feel proud

25:44.500 --> 25:46.500
Because I never stick up for myself like that

25:46.500 --> 25:48.500
And I said, fuck you

25:48.500 --> 25:50.500
But by the end, we had made up

25:50.500 --> 25:52.500
And I was, his dad's an alcoholic

25:54.500 --> 25:56.500
And I understood where I was coming from

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
And then I was crying and I'm like, now I'm an asshole

25:58.500 --> 26:00.500
Wait, this continued and he started apologizing

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
And broke down because he's an alcoholic

26:02.500 --> 26:04.500
Yes, and we both had a

26:04.500 --> 26:06.500
It was a cathartic thing

26:06.500 --> 26:08.500
And I said, you know what, can I be honest with you

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
You helped me so much right now

26:10.500 --> 26:12.500
That you were just like this opening

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
For me to, I guess I carry that

26:14.500 --> 26:16.500
With me everywhere I fucking go

26:16.500 --> 26:18.500
And I don't have thick skin, I guess

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
And when people make fun of me

26:20.500 --> 26:22.500
I'm just getting smaller and smaller

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
And sadder and sadder

26:24.500 --> 26:26.500
That's what I was going to talk about

26:26.500 --> 26:28.500
Because through one lens, you're like

26:28.500 --> 26:30.500
You're like this Pokemon

26:30.500 --> 26:32.500
That like, you

26:34.500 --> 26:36.500
You have some quirky name

26:36.500 --> 26:38.500
And you curl up into a ball

26:38.500 --> 26:40.500
And your exploits are like

26:40.500 --> 26:42.500
Well, it's not like

26:42.500 --> 26:44.500
You're a rude

26:44.500 --> 26:46.500
The self-destruction is always

26:46.500 --> 26:48.500
Higher than the rudeness

26:48.500 --> 26:50.500
Which I think kind of equates to like

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
It's like, oh, thick skin

26:52.500 --> 26:54.500
And he's fine

26:54.500 --> 26:56.500
He's an equal opportunity offender

26:56.500 --> 26:58.500
And he puts himself at the top of the list

26:58.500 --> 27:00.500
Because he ends up being like

27:00.500 --> 27:02.500
Throne out of every bar and blah blah blah

27:02.500 --> 27:04.500
This is when you're off the wagon

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
Like me out

27:06.500 --> 27:08.500
Yeah, that's a Pokemon

27:08.500 --> 27:10.500
Is that what a Pokemon? Yeah, yeah

27:10.500 --> 27:12.500
You guys know how to talk to your crowd

27:12.500 --> 27:14.500
But on the other hand

27:14.500 --> 27:16.500
They're me, man

27:16.500 --> 27:18.500
On the other hand, I've never met anybody

27:18.500 --> 27:20.500
I think I'm not exaggerating when I say this

27:20.500 --> 27:22.500
I'm trying to think

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
It's hard to think up here

27:24.500 --> 27:26.500
But I think

27:26.500 --> 27:28.500
I've never met anybody with

27:28.500 --> 27:30.500
Your particularly

27:30.500 --> 27:32.500
Sensitive whisker

27:32.500 --> 27:34.500
About

27:38.500 --> 27:40.500
You can go

27:40.500 --> 27:42.500
From such a high

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
And I'm not talking about

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
On the wagon and just you

27:46.500 --> 27:48.500
I'm not talking about

27:48.500 --> 27:50.500
You can go from such a high mood

27:50.500 --> 27:52.500
And you're funny

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
And you're having a good time

27:54.500 --> 27:56.500
And then it seems like a bit at first

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
But you can take this roller coaster

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
Plunge and it really is tied

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
To like

28:02.500 --> 28:04.500
It's the most absurdly

28:04.500 --> 28:06.500
Microscopic mention

28:06.500 --> 28:08.500
Of someone

28:08.500 --> 28:10.500
Liking someone else

28:10.500 --> 28:12.500
Any kind of girls

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
We could be hanging out on a porch

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
And the one is so beautiful

28:16.500 --> 28:18.500
And you could be cracking me up

28:18.500 --> 28:20.500
With your stories

28:20.500 --> 28:22.500
Just being funny and cool

28:22.500 --> 28:24.500
And then like

28:24.500 --> 28:26.500
We're both thinking the same thing

28:26.500 --> 28:28.500
On the set of Great Minds

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
That's happened before with you and me

28:30.500 --> 28:32.500
Where it's like oh that cloud is shaped

28:32.500 --> 28:34.500
Like Paul Rudd

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
I love Paul Rudd

28:36.500 --> 28:38.500
I'm going to get another lemonade

28:38.500 --> 28:40.500
I don't know why didn't she get Paul Rudd

28:40.500 --> 28:42.500
Another lemonade

28:42.500 --> 28:44.500
And it always seems like a bit

28:44.500 --> 28:46.500
And then bring back the lemonade

28:46.500 --> 28:48.500
And it's just like this is good

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
You're so nice, thank you

28:50.500 --> 28:52.500
And really hanging out with you

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
What is it with Paul Rudd

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
It's like Jesus Andy

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
That Paul Rudd thing never happened

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
But it did happen

29:00.500 --> 29:02.500
With Nick Kroll

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
I mentioned

29:04.500 --> 29:06.500
Nick Kroll on the set of Great Minds

29:06.500 --> 29:08.500
It was like he has a show you guys probably know

29:08.500 --> 29:10.500
That Great Minds show

29:10.500 --> 29:12.500
Nick had I guess just done it

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
And did a great job

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
I was bringing it up

29:16.500 --> 29:18.500
He wouldn't shut up about

29:18.500 --> 29:20.500
How great he was

29:20.500 --> 29:22.500
But he was trying to compliment you when he brought it up

29:22.500 --> 29:24.500
He was just talking about how great Nick did

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
See

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
I just had done it that day

29:28.500 --> 29:30.500
Where I was leaving

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
He didn't say and you did real good today

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500
He didn't even have that part in there

29:34.500 --> 29:36.500
All about Nick

29:36.500 --> 29:38.500
What about me

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
Listen

29:40.500 --> 29:42.500
I brought it up because it was

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
Connecting the dot

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
I haven't had this much fun since

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
Nick Kroll was on it or something like that

29:48.500 --> 29:50.500
I didn't hear that part

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
I really didn't

29:52.500 --> 29:54.500
I'm so sorry

29:54.500 --> 29:56.500
You heard haven't had fun

29:56.500 --> 29:58.500
Nick Kroll

29:58.500 --> 30:00.500
And think about

30:00.500 --> 30:02.500
That kind of weird monster

30:02.500 --> 30:04.500
I must be through your eyes

30:04.500 --> 30:06.500
If you think it's possible that you'd be

30:06.500 --> 30:08.500
Shitting the bed and in order to cope with it

30:08.500 --> 30:10.500
I'd be like I love Nick Kroll

30:10.500 --> 30:12.500
He never shits the bed

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
It was worse than that

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
In my mind I honestly thought

30:16.500 --> 30:18.500
You were trying to take me out

30:18.500 --> 30:20.500
Never trust your mind

30:20.500 --> 30:22.500
It's insane

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
It has historically steered you wrong

30:26.500 --> 30:28.500
I think I had to

30:28.500 --> 30:30.500
Call you and say I think he's

30:30.500 --> 30:32.500
Fucking with me

30:32.500 --> 30:34.500
I doubt it

30:34.500 --> 30:36.500
He's too lazy

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
He doesn't like confrontation at all

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
Fucking with someone

30:40.500 --> 30:42.500
Seriously I really did

30:42.500 --> 30:44.500
I'm not lying

30:44.500 --> 30:46.500
I thought he was fucking with me and I thought

30:46.500 --> 30:48.500
He was being mean

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
So embarrassing

30:50.500 --> 30:52.500
But let's talk about that

30:52.500 --> 30:54.500
Because I'm sure there's a lot of people listening

30:54.500 --> 30:56.500
The coffee guy maybe

30:56.500 --> 30:58.500
He was serious

30:58.500 --> 31:00.500
I think people who are ultra sensitive

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
portray themselves as not sensitive at all

31:02.500 --> 31:04.500
And that's what you go out and you do

31:04.500 --> 31:06.500
It's almost like cutting or something

31:06.500 --> 31:08.500
You develop like this

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
Because you know how fucking risky

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
The world is, yes

31:12.500 --> 31:14.500
That's what I want to talk about

31:14.500 --> 31:16.500
Because I can relate

31:16.500 --> 31:18.500
Oh my god, this world could fucking

31:18.500 --> 31:20.500
Undo me

31:20.500 --> 31:22.500
Nothing

31:22.500 --> 31:24.500
But that took a certain

31:26.500 --> 31:28.500
Face on the playground

31:28.500 --> 31:30.500
We developed these

31:30.500 --> 31:32.500
Really specific numbnesses

31:32.500 --> 31:34.500
People that gravitate

31:34.500 --> 31:36.500
Towards microphones and cameras and things

31:36.500 --> 31:38.500
It's like this weird

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
Inversion where you

31:40.500 --> 31:42.500
Callous yourself over

31:42.500 --> 31:44.500
In all of the places that normal

31:44.500 --> 31:46.500
People would be sensitive

31:46.500 --> 31:48.500
Because you just

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
Develop that cow catcher on the front of your train

31:50.500 --> 31:52.500
You're just like, okay, that's the spot

31:52.500 --> 31:54.500
Where there's gonna be impact

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
And then ironically, you put so much

31:56.500 --> 31:58.500
Energy into that, you have these

31:58.500 --> 32:00.500
It's like if Batman just had naked

32:00.500 --> 32:02.500
Flesh

32:02.500 --> 32:04.500
Here but had like a bulletproof

32:04.500 --> 32:06.500
Titanium thing and it was just like

32:06.500 --> 32:08.500
Naked, you could see his ribs and his acne here

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
Everybody was just like, get him like that

32:12.500 --> 32:14.500
And he was like, oh god damn it

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
I should quit being Batman

32:16.500 --> 32:18.500
I'm fascinated

32:18.500 --> 32:20.500
By these cow catchers on trains

32:20.500 --> 32:22.500
They really have those?

32:22.500 --> 32:24.500
They catch cows

32:24.500 --> 32:26.500
Swooping metal things

32:26.500 --> 32:28.500
To catch cows? No, to get them along

32:28.500 --> 32:30.500
Oh, that's not a hurt

32:30.500 --> 32:32.500
And then the cow probably dies

32:32.500 --> 32:34.500
Oh, it dies? It saves the train

32:34.500 --> 32:40.500
Oh that's nice, it's good

32:42.500 --> 32:44.500
Do you think that

32:44.500 --> 32:46.500
Trains aren't endangered species

32:46.500 --> 32:48.500
Do you think that you project things

32:48.500 --> 32:50.500
That aren't there or do you think

32:50.500 --> 32:52.500
You're like, is it about

32:52.500 --> 32:54.500
Like I characterize it as a cat whisker

32:54.500 --> 32:56.500
Me? No, my thing happened

32:56.500 --> 32:58.500
I've been thinking about this recently

32:58.500 --> 33:00.500
It went all the way back

33:00.500 --> 33:02.500
It's happening again, but this time

33:02.500 --> 33:04.500
I think I know what to do

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
And how to handle it

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
First of all, I'm 50

33:08.500 --> 33:10.500
And I've been through it a bunch

33:10.500 --> 33:12.500
But what happened is

33:12.500 --> 33:14.500
We did the Ben Stiller show

33:14.500 --> 33:16.500
I can't believe you're 50

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
You seem like 6

33:18.500 --> 33:20.500
A lot of 50 year olds do that

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
That's the new thing

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
Then

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
I just catapulted out of there

33:26.500 --> 33:28.500
On to news radio

33:28.500 --> 33:30.500
And I played this

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
I remember the audition for news radio

33:32.500 --> 33:34.500
Paul Sims had me come in and read

33:34.500 --> 33:36.500
For the network and everybody

33:36.500 --> 33:38.500
And the writers and I did it

33:38.500 --> 33:40.500
And I guess I fell flat

33:40.500 --> 33:42.500
But before the audition

33:42.500 --> 33:44.500
In the room I was talking like this

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
This is going to be fun

33:46.500 --> 33:48.500
This is going to be fun

33:48.500 --> 33:50.500
Phil Hartman and Dave Foley

33:50.500 --> 33:52.500
And this is going to be wild

33:52.500 --> 33:54.500
So anyways, I'm going to do my audition

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

33:56.500 --> 33:58.500
Whatever you guys need from me

33:58.500 --> 34:00.500
Disappointed with my audition

34:00.500 --> 34:02.500
And Paul said, can I tell you something

34:02.500 --> 34:04.500
Did you see how he was before the audition

34:04.500 --> 34:06.500
Before he started reading the part

34:06.500 --> 34:08.500
And after, that's how he's going to be

34:08.500 --> 34:10.500
So we're going to write for him

34:10.500 --> 34:12.500
And then that's what they did

34:12.500 --> 34:14.500
And I became this kind of like

34:14.500 --> 34:16.500
Warm and fuzzy character that people on the street

34:16.500 --> 34:18.500
Always wanted to just touch

34:18.500 --> 34:20.500
And hug and all that

34:20.500 --> 34:22.500
But I wasn't always that person

34:22.500 --> 34:24.500
And so I built up this thing

34:24.500 --> 34:26.500
Yeah, I really did

34:26.500 --> 34:28.500
Full force into drugs and alcohol

34:28.500 --> 34:30.500
And I started like a punk band

34:30.500 --> 34:34.500
And I made another persona

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
That that one I can't shake now

34:36.500 --> 34:38.500
I always felt like

34:38.500 --> 34:40.500
And when I say something like I always felt

34:40.500 --> 34:42.500
I'm not qualified

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
One of the things that I love about you

34:44.500 --> 34:46.500
Is that you don't punish people like me

34:46.500 --> 34:48.500
For just speculating

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
Like I get

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
Back in the 90s

34:52.500 --> 34:54.500
I would get mad at people

34:54.500 --> 34:56.500
Talking about you

34:56.500 --> 34:58.500
Because I would be like

34:58.500 --> 35:00.500
Because I have my own issues

35:00.500 --> 35:02.500
And the whole

35:02.500 --> 35:04.500
You have a problem with substances

35:04.500 --> 35:06.500
I just don't like the way normie norms handle it

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
And I don't indulge in that stuff

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
In spite of the fact that I think

35:10.500 --> 35:12.500
Now I'm 43, you're 50

35:12.500 --> 35:14.500
I've had enough

35:14.500 --> 35:16.500
Drinks with you

35:16.500 --> 35:18.500
I've seen enough to think

35:18.500 --> 35:20.500
I think it's a great idea for you to be sober

35:20.500 --> 35:22.500
Like I really do

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
Why am I here?

35:24.500 --> 35:26.500
I was planning my next relapse

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
It's been almost two years

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
Which is fucking amazing

35:30.500 --> 35:32.500
No, it's not enough

35:32.500 --> 35:34.500
Not enough

35:34.500 --> 35:36.500
Don't applaud two years

35:36.500 --> 35:38.500
God damn it

35:38.500 --> 35:40.500
It's not an accomplishment

35:40.500 --> 35:42.500
People

35:42.500 --> 35:44.500
It is though

35:44.500 --> 35:46.500
Because you were on and off

35:46.500 --> 35:48.500
Like a goddamn yo-yo

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
I'm gonna drink again

35:50.500 --> 35:52.500
No, shut up

35:52.500 --> 35:54.500
Why?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.500
It's a nightmare

35:56.500 --> 35:58.500
I can't ever again

35:58.500 --> 36:00.500
I can't even comprehend that

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
Did you have a timer set on your phone

36:02.500 --> 36:04.500
That's now in that guy's hands

36:04.500 --> 36:06.500
Was that it?

36:06.500 --> 36:08.500
I have an app that tells me how much time I have

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
Are we still good?

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
We're not cutting into that, right?

36:12.500 --> 36:14.500
Because I know you have somewhere to be after this

36:14.500 --> 36:16.500
Oh, you're right

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
I have another show

36:18.500 --> 36:20.500
When he's gonna stop drinking

36:20.500 --> 36:22.500
Delete that

36:22.500 --> 36:24.500
Can I be honest with you, this is far more important

36:24.500 --> 36:26.500
I just want you to be doing what you want to do

36:26.500 --> 36:28.500
With all the information you can have

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
So here's the question

36:30.500 --> 36:32.500
I want to ask you

36:32.500 --> 36:34.500
Keep going

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
I've seen your relationship

36:36.500 --> 36:38.500
With our medicine

36:38.500 --> 36:40.500
I've seen your relationship with our

36:40.500 --> 36:42.500
Wait, are you talking about drugs and alcohol

36:42.500 --> 36:44.500
Is our medicine? It really is

36:44.500 --> 36:46.500
If I didn't have drugs and alcohol

36:46.500 --> 36:48.500
For 30 years, I started drinking when I was 14

36:48.500 --> 36:50.500
So it's been like 30 or more years

36:50.500 --> 36:52.500
I would have killed myself

36:52.500 --> 36:54.500
I'm sorry, I really would have killed myself

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
Or I would have been prescribed something

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
Maybe that would have worked, maybe

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
I don't know, I never did any of those

37:00.500 --> 37:02.500
But drugs and alcohol work for me and I love them

37:02.500 --> 37:04.500
But the other

37:04.500 --> 37:06.500
But the other

37:06.500 --> 37:08.500
The other thing that works for you

37:08.500 --> 37:10.500
The other thing that works for you is

37:10.500 --> 37:12.500
Attention

37:12.500 --> 37:14.500
This does take the place of that

37:14.500 --> 37:16.500
When we were hanging out

37:16.500 --> 37:18.500
We were doing that Comedy Central thing

37:18.500 --> 37:20.500
He was creating a show for me

37:20.500 --> 37:22.500
He was creating the new Andy Dick show

37:22.500 --> 37:24.500
For me

37:24.500 --> 37:26.500
And then, I don't know, things got a little hairy

37:26.500 --> 37:28.500
I don't know what happened

37:28.500 --> 37:30.500
I remember just having a bunch of fun

37:30.500 --> 37:32.500
Doing a lot of coke

37:32.500 --> 37:34.500
Robin Williams was hanging out with us

37:34.500 --> 37:36.500
We were having fun, then he's like, I'm out

37:36.500 --> 37:38.500
And then I see communities

37:38.500 --> 37:40.500
Created by Dan Harmon

37:40.500 --> 37:42.500
No, it did, all of a sudden

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
Listen one more time

37:44.500 --> 37:46.500
He just left

37:46.500 --> 37:48.500
To do his funny little show

37:48.500 --> 37:50.500
That you guys all love

37:50.500 --> 37:52.500
And then left me high and dry

37:52.500 --> 37:54.500
In the middle of a drink

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
And then all of a sudden he's gone

37:56.500 --> 37:58.500
No, there was a lot of shit that happened

37:58.500 --> 38:00.500
In the middle of that drink

38:00.500 --> 38:02.500
Well, I don't remember that stuff

38:02.500 --> 38:04.500
I'm proud of that

38:04.500 --> 38:06.500
I'm not mad about it

38:06.500 --> 38:08.500
Because I would have left me

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
I wouldn't have even started

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
I can't believe you Comedy Central

38:12.500 --> 38:14.500
Looked at the outline that we turned in

38:14.500 --> 38:16.500
And said, I know this is going to be a stereotype

38:16.500 --> 38:18.500
Because we bought that show

38:18.500 --> 38:20.500
And now we don't want it

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
And I was like, what?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.500
It was Comedy Central

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
So you didn't leave

38:26.500 --> 38:28.500
No, I didn't leave

38:28.500 --> 38:30.500
But I want to make sure

38:30.500 --> 38:32.500
Because I want to know

38:32.500 --> 38:34.500
So I should watch communities

38:34.500 --> 38:36.500
You draw in your head

38:36.500 --> 38:38.500
Just watch your episode

38:38.500 --> 38:40.500
I'm in it

38:40.500 --> 38:42.500
I thought he was fucking with me

38:42.500 --> 38:44.500
With that

38:44.500 --> 38:46.500
Because they were like, listen

38:46.500 --> 38:48.500
I wrote you in community

38:48.500 --> 38:50.500
And I'm like, great, and you're doing this

38:50.500 --> 38:52.500
Is it a big part? No

38:52.500 --> 38:54.500
Is it a big part?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.500
But you do a scene with Chevy Chase

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
And I'm like, fuck yeah

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
I love the guy really, and I know

39:00.500 --> 39:02.500
All your thing with him

39:02.500 --> 39:04.500
I fucking love him

39:04.500 --> 39:06.500
Because he's the original

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
I know you

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
He was

39:10.500 --> 39:12.500
And this one you must have been fucking with me

39:12.500 --> 39:14.500
Because I get to the set

39:14.500 --> 39:16.500
So my scene

39:16.500 --> 39:18.500
I see is with Chevy Chase

39:18.500 --> 39:20.500
Maybe we should meet up

39:20.500 --> 39:22.500
We can talk about the scene

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
He's not here, what yet

39:24.500 --> 39:26.500
He's not going to be here

39:26.500 --> 39:28.500
You're going to be doing it on a green screen

39:28.500 --> 39:30.500
Did you look at the script

39:30.500 --> 39:32.500
We're putting you on a green screen

39:32.500 --> 39:34.500
And we're going to shrink you down

39:34.500 --> 39:36.500
Chevy Chase's shoulder

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
So talk about a big part

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
I was this fucking big

39:40.500 --> 39:42.500
And there wasn't even a cardboard

39:42.500 --> 39:44.500
Cut out of Chevy Chase to act with

39:44.500 --> 39:46.500
I was by myself

39:46.500 --> 39:48.500
You didn't even show up

39:50.500 --> 39:52.500
I was doing a monologue to a camera

39:52.500 --> 39:54.500
I had cast Andy Dick as

39:54.500 --> 39:56.500
Chevy Chase's drug addiction

39:56.500 --> 39:58.500
I didn't need to be there

39:58.500 --> 40:00.500
It suits itself

40:00.500 --> 40:02.500
But it's fine

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
That's the coffee guy from last night

40:06.500 --> 40:08.500
That's my point

40:08.500 --> 40:10.500
Fuck this, I'm out

40:10.500 --> 40:12.500
I wasn't pretending

40:12.500 --> 40:14.500
Not to know you had exploited you

40:14.500 --> 40:16.500
That's the part that got me

40:16.500 --> 40:18.500
When he pretended

40:18.500 --> 40:20.500
That made me really mad

40:20.500 --> 40:22.500
Sorry, I just don't know who you are

40:22.500 --> 40:24.500
I said own up to it man

40:24.500 --> 40:26.500
I said it

40:26.500 --> 40:28.500
I'm proud

40:28.500 --> 40:30.500
I just started out of love

40:30.500 --> 40:32.500
I want to try to draw a connection

40:32.500 --> 40:34.500
Between the medicine

40:34.500 --> 40:36.500
That is attention

40:36.500 --> 40:38.500
And you're one of those people

40:38.500 --> 40:40.500
That really lights up

40:40.500 --> 40:42.500
When people are focused on you

40:42.500 --> 40:44.500
And like I said earlier

40:44.500 --> 40:46.500
To the point where you could experiment

40:46.500 --> 40:48.500
With that vocoder

40:48.500 --> 40:50.500
We can turn the dial of mentioning Paul Rudd

40:50.500 --> 40:52.500
And you can...

40:52.500 --> 40:54.500
That's what happened

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
I think that the world saw

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
How easy I am

40:58.500 --> 41:00.500
So like a little bit of a whore

41:00.500 --> 41:02.500
And then they're like now let's poke with them

41:02.500 --> 41:04.500
And let's do that

41:04.500 --> 41:06.500
And then it fucking drove me insane

41:06.500 --> 41:08.500
And I've been to 20 different rehabs

41:08.500 --> 41:10.500
I've lived like 3 years in a facility

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
I live in one right now

41:12.500 --> 41:14.500
I'm in a facility

41:14.500 --> 41:16.500
When I leave here I go and I go back to a sober living

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
But it's nice right?

41:18.500 --> 41:20.500
I love it, it's on the beach

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
You don't have to feel it

41:22.500 --> 41:24.500
And I'm the only one in this one house

41:24.500 --> 41:26.500
I mean I got it made

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
That's the one thing

41:28.500 --> 41:30.500
That's the one catch

41:30.500 --> 41:32.500
That's how they get you

41:32.500 --> 41:34.500
You know I do think

41:34.500 --> 41:36.500
About that if I took one fucking sip

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
It's gone

41:38.500 --> 41:40.500
My house is gone

41:40.500 --> 41:42.500
You would look at me different

41:42.500 --> 41:44.500
You said it on stage with Tina Fey

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
I wouldn't look at you at all

41:46.500 --> 41:48.500
You'd see the back of my head

41:48.500 --> 41:50.500
Tina Fey was right next to us

41:50.500 --> 41:52.500
And I said that I still want to drink

41:52.500 --> 41:54.500
I want to drink right now

41:54.500 --> 41:56.500
I had a fucking glass of wine tucked into her cunt

41:56.500 --> 41:58.500
Everybody's drinking

41:58.500 --> 42:00.500
Scotch and Steve Colbert

42:00.500 --> 42:02.500
Drinking and everyone

42:02.500 --> 42:04.500
I want to drink

42:04.500 --> 42:06.500
You said if you drink I'm leaving right now

42:06.500 --> 42:08.500
And he means it

42:08.500 --> 42:10.500
I don't want him to leave

42:10.500 --> 42:12.500
Have you seen him drunk?

42:12.500 --> 42:14.500
Nightmare

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
It's bad

42:16.500 --> 42:18.500
The medicine of attention

42:20.500 --> 42:22.500
I just want to talk about the relationship

42:22.500 --> 42:24.500
Because there's a couple different models here

42:24.500 --> 42:26.500
That we could use

42:26.500 --> 42:28.500
I'm curious

42:28.500 --> 42:30.500
In your mind

42:30.500 --> 42:32.500
Would it be easy to stay sober

42:32.500 --> 42:34.500
For 20 years

42:34.500 --> 42:36.500
If during every minute of that 20 years

42:36.500 --> 42:38.500
Everybody was like

42:38.500 --> 42:40.500
You're very funny

42:40.500 --> 42:42.500
You're beautiful

42:42.500 --> 42:44.500
I've been thinking about this

42:44.500 --> 42:46.500
When that needle goes off

42:46.500 --> 42:48.500
I could supplement that

42:48.500 --> 42:50.500
With the other thing that makes me

42:50.500 --> 42:52.500
That takes my brain

42:52.500 --> 42:54.500
Because we're talking about numbness

42:54.500 --> 42:56.500
You have such a high degree of empathy

42:56.500 --> 42:58.500
That you can feel people

42:58.500 --> 43:00.500
You knew that guy was fucking around

43:00.500 --> 43:02.500
Like you're hypersensitive to that

43:02.500 --> 43:04.500
That makes you a good entertainer

43:04.500 --> 43:06.500
Your curse to bear then

43:06.500 --> 43:08.500
Is that

43:08.500 --> 43:10.500
That seismograph

43:10.500 --> 43:12.500
Is designed to measure fucking

43:12.500 --> 43:14.500
Kittens walking across the kitchen floor

43:14.500 --> 43:16.500
So the Northridge Quake

43:16.500 --> 43:18.500
Is a little tough sometimes

43:18.500 --> 43:20.500
When somebody is like

43:20.500 --> 43:22.500
And you're like

43:22.500 --> 43:24.500
I want to kill myself

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
If something really super bad happened

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
It would be just curts

43:28.500 --> 43:30.500
You're talking to the two guys

43:30.500 --> 43:32.500
Who love drinking more than anything

43:32.500 --> 43:34.500
Who hate it when people don't drink

43:34.500 --> 43:36.500
We hate it when people don't drink

43:36.500 --> 43:38.500
Me and you

43:38.500 --> 43:40.500
We love it when he doesn't

43:40.500 --> 43:42.500
That doesn't seem fair

43:42.500 --> 43:44.500
There's got to be other things

43:44.500 --> 43:46.500
You can do that I can't

43:46.500 --> 43:48.500
See holy hell

43:48.500 --> 43:50.500
I just saw it

43:50.500 --> 43:52.500
I have this weird thing that all celebrities

43:52.500 --> 43:54.500
And me included create a

43:54.500 --> 43:56.500
Mini fucking

43:56.500 --> 43:58.500
What's it called

43:58.500 --> 44:00.500
You have it this is your little mini cult

44:00.500 --> 44:02.500
No

44:02.500 --> 44:04.500
Yes and it's not a bad thing

44:04.500 --> 44:06.500
I kept looking at that guy going

44:06.500 --> 44:08.500
He's not that bad

44:08.500 --> 44:10.500
I want a cult

44:10.500 --> 44:12.500
You have one

44:12.500 --> 44:14.500
I do

44:14.500 --> 44:16.500
What do you think

44:16.500 --> 44:18.500
Do you see that situation as untenable

44:18.500 --> 44:20.500
Is there an adjustment that you could make

44:20.500 --> 44:22.500
Because I like

44:22.500 --> 44:24.500
Can we talk for a second just about therapy

44:24.500 --> 44:26.500
Are you in therapy? I mean it all the time

44:26.500 --> 44:28.500
I live at that place

44:28.500 --> 44:30.500
Our podcast is therapy

44:30.500 --> 44:32.500
I approached Dino

44:32.500 --> 44:34.500
And begged him

44:34.500 --> 44:36.500
I just asked him if he could please just hang out

44:36.500 --> 44:38.500
Because I wanted to get to the bottom of why

44:38.500 --> 44:40.500
He left me in the first place

44:40.500 --> 44:42.500
Years ago he just like

44:42.500 --> 44:44.500
Stopped talking to me

44:44.500 --> 44:46.500
I couldn't get him on the phone I'm like

44:46.500 --> 44:48.500
That hurt me so much

44:48.500 --> 44:50.500
My marrow and we've never like

44:50.500 --> 44:52.500
Sucked each other's cocks or anything

44:52.500 --> 44:54.500
I'm the only person he's never been attracted to

44:56.500 --> 44:58.500
What are you going to do

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
Look at him

45:04.500 --> 45:06.500
There's like no wrong answers on that podcast

45:06.500 --> 45:08.500
It's like yeah black people's eyes pop out

45:08.500 --> 45:12.500
Love it

45:12.500 --> 45:14.500
Don't listen to the podcast

45:14.500 --> 45:16.500
Don't listen to our podcast

45:16.500 --> 45:18.500
He drops the end bomb like for no reason

45:18.500 --> 45:20.500
I do it here

45:20.500 --> 45:22.500
I stopped doing it here when people started applauding

45:22.500 --> 45:24.500
Let it go, let it go creepy

45:24.500 --> 45:26.500
Yeah, but I think it's true

45:26.500 --> 45:28.500
About the millennials

45:28.500 --> 45:30.500
They're new to the party

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
And we have to respect them

45:32.500 --> 45:34.500
I think that it's like

45:34.500 --> 45:36.500
Yeah, but can you sense

45:36.500 --> 45:38.500
I think you can or maybe it's

45:38.500 --> 45:40.500
Even more interesting if you can't because

45:40.500 --> 45:42.500
Look what happened you came out and you were like

45:42.500 --> 45:44.500
Like a bull in a china shop

45:44.500 --> 45:46.500
But instead of china it was like hot buttons

45:46.500 --> 45:48.500
Our first sale in the shop

45:48.500 --> 45:50.500
It's not a shop you're not supposed to be in there

45:50.500 --> 45:52.500
You're a bull in a fucking racist

45:52.500 --> 45:54.500
Thai ride

45:54.500 --> 45:56.500
Every button you could push

45:56.500 --> 45:58.500
And even though you're being told

45:58.500 --> 46:00.500
Like oh they don't like that

46:00.500 --> 46:02.500
Like you

46:02.500 --> 46:04.500
Then all of a sudden five seconds later

46:04.500 --> 46:06.500
Like we've switched gears

46:06.500 --> 46:08.500
Into a one night show

46:08.500 --> 46:10.500
With Andy Dick where you're telling

46:10.500 --> 46:12.500
Stories and people are leaned in and they're sharing

46:12.500 --> 46:14.500
With you because you're talking about your pain

46:14.500 --> 46:16.500
You're talking about what it means to be Andy Dick

46:16.500 --> 46:18.500
In a Starbucks

46:18.500 --> 46:20.500
You adapted

46:20.500 --> 46:22.500
Because you're like a freaky stem cell

46:22.500 --> 46:24.500
Mystique character that's like

46:24.500 --> 46:26.500
Because you

46:26.500 --> 46:28.500
Love making people happy

46:28.500 --> 46:30.500
But it has to be you

46:30.500 --> 46:32.500
And that's like

46:32.500 --> 46:34.500
Well that's all I have

46:34.500 --> 46:36.500
Well I mean yeah you can't

46:36.500 --> 46:38.500
You're so

46:38.500 --> 46:40.500
But it's not about that you're happy

46:40.500 --> 46:42.500
You're not happy that people are happy

46:42.500 --> 46:44.500
You're happy that you make people happy

46:44.500 --> 46:46.500
Like if someone next to you makes someone happy

46:46.500 --> 46:48.500
You're gonna be like why am I even here

46:48.500 --> 46:50.500
On earth

46:50.500 --> 46:52.500
That's exactly what happens

46:52.500 --> 46:54.500
That's what it is

46:54.500 --> 46:56.500
And by the way it does happen

46:56.500 --> 46:58.500
But I'm better at that

46:58.500 --> 47:00.500
You're better in New York

47:00.500 --> 47:02.500
New York City we did this

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
Our Skull Juice podcast

47:04.500 --> 47:06.500
And that's what I was getting at

47:06.500 --> 47:08.500
I approached Dino and I'm like

47:08.500 --> 47:10.500
Can you be my friend

47:10.500 --> 47:12.500
I miss you and I just want to be

47:12.500 --> 47:14.500
He's like let's start a podcast

47:14.500 --> 47:16.500
I'm like I don't really

47:16.500 --> 47:18.500
Fine if it means you're gonna be my friend

47:18.500 --> 47:20.500
Let's do it and then I thought

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
No one's gonna listen to this

47:22.500 --> 47:24.500
And we'll just talk and I'm gonna get to the bottom

47:24.500 --> 47:26.500
Of why he left me and I've been

47:26.500 --> 47:28.500
I have a lot of insights after we talk

47:28.500 --> 47:30.500
And I want to do another one

47:30.500 --> 47:32.500
I call him the next day

47:32.500 --> 47:34.500
Can we do another one today

47:34.500 --> 47:36.500
Yeah he loves hating me

47:36.500 --> 47:38.500
And by the way he hates doing the podcast

47:38.500 --> 47:40.500
At one hour he's like we're done

47:40.500 --> 47:42.500
I'm like no we're just gonna

47:42.500 --> 47:44.500
But in New York it was

47:44.500 --> 47:46.500
And you know rightfully so unfair enough

47:46.500 --> 47:48.500
It was all about Dino and that's fine

47:48.500 --> 47:50.500
I wasn't fine with it in New York

47:50.500 --> 47:52.500
It was Dino created this thing

47:52.500 --> 47:54.500
And it was Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert

47:54.500 --> 47:56.500
And all those people I don't know if you heard about it

47:56.500 --> 47:58.500
What's his name? Louis C.K. showed up

47:58.500 --> 48:00.500
And Scott Adset and

48:00.500 --> 48:02.500
Am I missing anybody?

48:02.500 --> 48:04.500
And Smigol Triumph

48:04.500 --> 48:06.500
The insult comic dog

48:06.500 --> 48:08.500
And oh look that's him

48:08.500 --> 48:10.500
It's a skeleton!

48:12.500 --> 48:14.500
His eyes bugged out

48:14.500 --> 48:16.500
And Dino created

48:16.500 --> 48:18.500
This night I

48:18.500 --> 48:20.500
Started having this great

48:20.500 --> 48:22.500
Appreciation for you

48:22.500 --> 48:24.500
And like Stephen Colbert

48:24.500 --> 48:26.500
Texted him

48:26.500 --> 48:28.500
And said hey I listened to your first

48:28.500 --> 48:30.500
Skulljuice podcast

48:30.500 --> 48:32.500
And I'm like he did he's like yeah

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
So Stephen texted him and said

48:34.500 --> 48:36.500
Yeah you were gonna read the script that you got

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
That he had written with Stephen

48:38.500 --> 48:40.500
And then you never got to it because it was all about me

48:40.500 --> 48:42.500
You know we never got to this script

48:42.500 --> 48:44.500
Hey he's like I listened to a whole fucking podcast

48:44.500 --> 48:46.500
He was? Oh he hated it

48:46.500 --> 48:48.500
No I don't think he hated it

48:48.500 --> 48:50.500
I was trying to get a laugh

48:50.500 --> 48:52.500
But see I almost went into that spider web

48:52.500 --> 48:54.500
Anyway anyway

48:54.500 --> 48:56.500
Everyone's scared

48:56.500 --> 48:58.500
So then Dino just said

48:58.500 --> 49:00.500
Offhandedly why don't we

49:00.500 --> 49:02.500
Just do it live on stage and then

49:02.500 --> 49:04.500
Within a week everybody's live fucking on stage

49:04.500 --> 49:06.500
Because Dino sent us to and they're all on stage

49:06.500 --> 49:08.500
You guys are like almost you're the

49:08.500 --> 49:10.500
Opposite on one axis which is the Dino

49:10.500 --> 49:12.500
Does that he doesn't give a fuck

49:12.500 --> 49:14.500
And then everyone feels

49:14.500 --> 49:16.500
Safe I guess

49:16.500 --> 49:18.500
I guess it's that old thing

49:18.500 --> 49:20.500
Secret he does care about that's what I'm getting

49:20.500 --> 49:22.500
He does

49:22.500 --> 49:24.500
I don't know if it's that secret

49:24.500 --> 49:26.500
But he doesn't yeah well anyway

49:26.500 --> 49:28.500
I don't know if it's obsessed

49:28.500 --> 49:30.500
We've got Paul Rudd here tonight

49:30.500 --> 49:32.500
So we need one of the chairs

49:32.500 --> 49:34.500
You have a heart out

49:34.500 --> 49:36.500
If you want

49:36.500 --> 49:38.500
There's Paul Rudd here

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
No Paul Rudd's here

49:40.500 --> 49:42.500
He really is

49:42.500 --> 49:44.500
Then I'll leave

49:44.500 --> 49:46.500
Why was I here at all

49:46.500 --> 49:48.500
Don't you have to go

49:48.500 --> 49:50.500
Stephen Colbert

49:50.500 --> 49:52.500
Paul Rudd really is here

49:52.500 --> 49:54.500
Yeah yeah yeah

49:54.500 --> 49:56.500
No Paul Rudd's not here

49:56.500 --> 49:58.500
Jesus Christ

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
You got me

50:00.500 --> 50:02.500
No I'm mad

50:02.500 --> 50:04.500
I have a show in Bourbon

50:04.500 --> 50:06.500
Let's thank Andy Dick for bearing his soul

50:06.500 --> 50:08.500
And he'll come back

50:08.500 --> 50:10.500
Andy Dick everybody

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
He's

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
He's

50:14.500 --> 50:16.500
He's

50:16.500 --> 50:18.500
He ain't even working out in the kinks

50:18.500 --> 50:20.500
Is this Hanover here

50:20.500 --> 50:22.500
Do we have the nut?

50:22.500 --> 50:24.500
It'll be okay

50:24.500 --> 50:26.500
Well that was a weird event

50:26.500 --> 50:28.500
But now it's time

50:28.500 --> 50:30.500
For some stranger

50:30.500 --> 50:32.500
Things

50:32.500 --> 50:34.500
I should

50:34.500 --> 50:36.500
Go too right in the corner of the stage

50:36.500 --> 50:38.500
No no you stay here

50:38.500 --> 50:40.500
Matt and Ross Duffer

50:40.500 --> 50:42.500
The Duffer Brothers

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
Double book

50:52.500 --> 50:54.500
Hi guys

50:54.500 --> 50:56.500
Sorry

50:56.500 --> 50:58.500
I braced you for

50:58.500 --> 51:00.500
Having to wait

51:00.500 --> 51:02.500
And you're fine with it

51:02.500 --> 51:04.500
Thanks for putting us after

51:04.500 --> 51:06.500
Andy Dick

51:06.500 --> 51:08.500
Posting

51:08.500 --> 51:10.500
Gliding on the momentum baby

51:10.500 --> 51:12.500
Alright so

51:12.500 --> 51:14.500
So everybody wants to know

51:14.500 --> 51:16.500
How do you tell them apart? I'll tell you

51:16.500 --> 51:18.500
I figured it out

51:18.500 --> 51:20.500
They're kind of like the Duplass brothers

51:20.500 --> 51:22.500
You can't tell them apart either

51:22.500 --> 51:24.500
I know

51:24.500 --> 51:26.500
Duplass decided to have to google them

51:26.500 --> 51:28.500
And then look and go okay yeah I can't tell them

51:28.500 --> 51:30.500
But then the guys

51:30.500 --> 51:32.500
The animals guys who aren't even brothers

51:32.500 --> 51:34.500
Much less twins

51:34.500 --> 51:36.500
But these guys are easy

51:36.500 --> 51:38.500
Matt has a

51:38.500 --> 51:40.500
Shock of white hair in front

51:40.500 --> 51:42.500
Which is a welcome Matt

51:42.500 --> 51:44.500
For you're remembering his name

51:44.500 --> 51:46.500
Ross

51:46.500 --> 51:48.500
Is raw

51:48.500 --> 51:50.500
He's not cooked yet

51:50.500 --> 51:52.500
So he doesn't have gray hair

51:52.500 --> 51:54.500
How do you remember

51:54.500 --> 51:56.500
The word mnemonic

51:56.500 --> 51:58.500
I think

51:58.500 --> 52:00.500
Of the word phenomenon

52:00.500 --> 52:02.500
I

52:02.500 --> 52:04.500
I

52:04.500 --> 52:06.500
Think of pneumonia

52:06.500 --> 52:08.500
Because I need to

52:08.500 --> 52:10.500
Have mnemonics because I'm such a cold person

52:10.500 --> 52:12.500
I can't tell people apart

52:12.500 --> 52:14.500
I do that's how I

52:14.500 --> 52:16.500
Remember the word mnemonic

52:16.500 --> 52:18.500
Alright you guys are into your

52:18.500 --> 52:20.500
There's nothing I could

52:20.500 --> 52:22.500
You guys are

52:22.500 --> 52:24.500
He's not going to start drinking again is he

52:24.500 --> 52:26.500
Yeah thanks to everyone

52:26.500 --> 52:28.500
Here

52:28.500 --> 52:30.500
We didn't do anything

52:30.500 --> 52:32.500
They groaned every time I said I didn't want him to drink

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
I hate it when he says

52:34.500 --> 52:36.500
He says like

52:36.500 --> 52:38.500
I really thought he was going to drink

52:38.500 --> 52:40.500
I'm amazed that he didn't do anything

52:40.500 --> 52:42.500
And by the way

52:42.500 --> 52:44.500
I'm talking now like the people I hated in the

52:44.500 --> 52:46.500
2000's I was like fuck you guys

52:46.500 --> 52:48.500
You don't care but it's like

52:48.500 --> 52:50.500
We're so old

52:50.500 --> 52:52.500
That it's like now I'm like actually

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
Sincerely like come on man don't drink

52:54.500 --> 52:56.500
Oh I care I work with them

52:56.500 --> 52:58.500
Oh hi guys

53:00.500 --> 53:02.500
So you guys are now

53:02.500 --> 53:04.500
Writing Season 2 Stranger Things

53:04.500 --> 53:06.500
Correct

53:10.500 --> 53:12.500
So first let's talk about

53:12.500 --> 53:14.500
Everyone keeps calling it title sequence

53:14.500 --> 53:16.500
But it's not a sequence of anything

53:16.500 --> 53:18.500
It's neon letters in an amazing font

53:18.500 --> 53:20.500
With a cool John Carpenter type

53:20.500 --> 53:22.500
Song. Who's this

53:22.500 --> 53:24.500
Composer

53:24.500 --> 53:26.500
Who did the music for?

53:26.500 --> 53:28.500
These guys named Kyle and Michael

53:28.500 --> 53:30.500
They're part of this band called Survive

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
Out of Austin

53:32.500 --> 53:34.500
And we made this little

53:34.500 --> 53:36.500
When we tried to sell the show

53:36.500 --> 53:38.500
We made this little trailer

53:38.500 --> 53:40.500
We put all these clips from old movies

53:40.500 --> 53:42.500
Together with Spielberg or Carpenter

53:42.500 --> 53:44.500
Whatever tried to get the vibe across

53:44.500 --> 53:46.500
And some of it was John Carpenter

53:46.500 --> 53:48.500
Music that we used

53:48.500 --> 53:50.500
But then for the end

53:50.500 --> 53:52.500
Epic end of this trailer

53:52.500 --> 53:54.500
We used anything and we used music from this band

53:54.500 --> 53:56.500
So when it came to the show

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
We just

53:58.500 --> 54:00.500
They had regular

54:00.500 --> 54:02.500
One of them sold used synthesizers

54:02.500 --> 54:04.500
You don't make money

54:04.500 --> 54:06.500
In an instrumental like synth band

54:06.500 --> 54:08.500
You can't make money

54:08.500 --> 54:10.500
You don't have a living

54:10.500 --> 54:12.500
So I called them up

54:12.500 --> 54:14.500
At first we had to convince

54:14.500 --> 54:16.500
Netflix and the producers

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
And they let us do it

54:18.500 --> 54:20.500
And then we called them

54:20.500 --> 54:22.500
To get your jobs

54:22.500 --> 54:24.500
To do this

54:24.500 --> 54:26.500
Are you kidding me?

54:26.500 --> 54:28.500
Now they'll be fine

54:28.500 --> 54:30.500
Because your show is big enough

54:30.500 --> 54:32.500
They can just go on touring

54:32.500 --> 54:34.500
With the synth band

54:34.500 --> 54:36.500
It's crazy

54:36.500 --> 54:38.500
I always wonder

54:38.500 --> 54:40.500
When you see a toyota commercial

54:40.500 --> 54:42.500
And you hear a song you really like

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
And then you look it up

54:44.500 --> 54:46.500
And you buy the album and it's the only

54:46.500 --> 54:48.500
I'm not saying these guys are that

54:48.500 --> 54:50.500
No idea

54:50.500 --> 54:52.500
But I always wonder about the phenomenon

54:52.500 --> 54:54.500
Of being a band

54:54.500 --> 54:56.500
Who all of a sudden

54:56.500 --> 54:58.500
I will look at the 88

54:58.500 --> 55:00.500
I wonder sometimes

55:00.500 --> 55:02.500
They were big enough

55:02.500 --> 55:04.500
They were using

55:04.500 --> 55:06.500
Their music was like in shampoo commercials

55:06.500 --> 55:08.500
And then Joe Russo said

55:08.500 --> 55:10.500
We should use them for the theme cycle

55:10.500 --> 55:12.500
I always wonder what their relationship is

55:12.500 --> 55:14.500
If they hate it or love it

55:14.500 --> 55:16.500
I'm sure they love it

55:16.500 --> 55:18.500
I don't know what's going to happen

55:18.500 --> 55:20.500
They're barely scraping by right now

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
But they're going to be great

55:22.500 --> 55:24.500
Are you guys from Austin?

55:24.500 --> 55:26.500
No

55:26.500 --> 55:28.500
Durham, North Carolina

55:28.500 --> 55:30.500
Asheville?

55:30.500 --> 55:32.500
Durham

55:32.500 --> 55:34.500
I have a neurological disorder

55:34.500 --> 55:36.500
You may have heard of it

55:36.500 --> 55:38.500
In Wired Magazine

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
It's pretty chic

55:40.500 --> 55:42.500
Diagnosed myself on the internet

55:42.500 --> 55:44.500
Diagnosed myself on the internet

55:44.500 --> 55:46.500
So

55:46.500 --> 55:48.500
Okay

55:48.500 --> 55:50.500
So here's something interesting about you guys

55:50.500 --> 55:52.500
You are twins

55:52.500 --> 55:54.500
But

55:54.500 --> 55:56.500
We met at lunch

55:56.500 --> 55:58.500
The waitress came over

55:58.500 --> 56:00.500
And said are you guys twins?

56:00.500 --> 56:02.500
And she said identical

56:02.500 --> 56:04.500
And I've never heard this response before

56:04.500 --> 56:06.500
You guys said we don't know

56:06.500 --> 56:08.500
We might be

56:08.500 --> 56:10.500
We assume we are

56:10.500 --> 56:12.500
You could clear that up with a blood test

56:12.500 --> 56:14.500
But we've gotten to the point where you don't want to know

56:14.500 --> 56:16.500
We don't know what it would psychologically do

56:16.500 --> 56:18.500
No

56:18.500 --> 56:20.500
I think if it came back we were identical

56:20.500 --> 56:22.500
We'd feel fine and we'd be the same

56:22.500 --> 56:24.500
But if it came back that we weren't

56:24.500 --> 56:26.500
I don't think you are

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
You're not even wearing the same shirt

56:28.500 --> 56:30.500
He bases all of his knowledge

56:30.500 --> 56:32.500
About twins on like

56:32.500 --> 56:34.500
Chimpanzee shows from the 60s

56:34.500 --> 56:36.500
I don't want to know

56:36.500 --> 56:38.500
I don't want to know

56:38.500 --> 56:40.500
I think it could fuck us up

56:40.500 --> 56:42.500
What shocks me is that it's possible in this modern era

56:42.500 --> 56:44.500
You guys were born into

56:44.500 --> 56:46.500
A stainless steel honeycomb

56:46.500 --> 56:48.500
You were born into THX 1138

56:48.500 --> 56:50.500
You were born in underground too

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
Andy's still here

56:52.500 --> 56:54.500
Oh shit

56:54.500 --> 56:56.500
I didn't

56:56.500 --> 56:58.500
I love that show so much

56:58.500 --> 57:00.500
I can go on and on and on

57:00.500 --> 57:02.500
You know what show he doesn't love

57:02.500 --> 57:04.500
His own show

57:04.500 --> 57:06.500
You know what there's a Volkswagen blocking my car

57:06.500 --> 57:08.500
That's why I came back

57:08.500 --> 57:10.500
I didn't know that this was the people from Stranger Things

57:10.500 --> 57:12.500
So this is fucking why can't I

57:12.500 --> 57:14.500
Stay

57:14.500 --> 57:16.500
I'm serious

57:16.500 --> 57:18.500
This is fucking amazing

57:18.500 --> 57:20.500
That show I gotta talk to you guys about

57:20.500 --> 57:22.500
Why and how it's so amazing

57:22.500 --> 57:24.500
Alright we'll go ahead

57:24.500 --> 57:26.500
No this is your show I gotta go

57:26.500 --> 57:28.500
But can somebody move there as like a black

57:28.500 --> 57:30.500
No we want you to talk to them now

57:30.500 --> 57:32.500
I have a show there's a whole audience

57:32.500 --> 57:34.500
Fuck your show

57:34.500 --> 57:36.500
You're mean

57:36.500 --> 57:38.500
I have a few questions

57:38.500 --> 57:40.500
I'll go get the Volkswagen

57:40.500 --> 57:42.500
Whose car is that

57:42.500 --> 57:44.500
Well there's so many good

57:44.500 --> 57:46.500
The acting and the writing

57:46.500 --> 57:48.500
And the way

57:48.500 --> 57:50.500
It's so

57:50.500 --> 57:52.500
You really

57:52.500 --> 57:54.500
You know what I relate to when I'm a writer

57:54.500 --> 57:56.500
I will relate to that character

57:56.500 --> 57:58.500
Because the way that

57:58.500 --> 58:00.500
I don't know if you guys directed her in this way

58:00.500 --> 58:02.500
Or whatever but she is that person

58:02.500 --> 58:04.500
Where everything

58:04.500 --> 58:06.500
About her and she even says

58:06.500 --> 58:08.500
I know I think crazy I know

58:08.500 --> 58:10.500
I know but I'm not

58:10.500 --> 58:12.500
I saw things in the wall and the lights

58:12.500 --> 58:14.500
And the more she screams

58:14.500 --> 58:16.500
The more crazy she sounds

58:16.500 --> 58:18.500
I love that

58:18.500 --> 58:20.500
Yeah you talked the lamps

58:20.500 --> 58:22.500
I love it

58:22.500 --> 58:24.500
Yeah I did

58:24.500 --> 58:26.500
We cast

58:26.500 --> 58:28.500
I think we had one script written and we cast her

58:28.500 --> 58:30.500
And it was like a very different role

58:30.500 --> 58:32.500
It was like a tough smoking long island

58:32.500 --> 58:34.500
Mom and then we had Winona

58:34.500 --> 58:36.500
And I love the idea of Winona

58:36.500 --> 58:38.500
And then we started to talk about Richard Dreyfus

58:38.500 --> 58:40.500
And Closer Countries we started talking about

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
What's cool about Winona

58:42.500 --> 58:44.500
And that's what I love about television

58:44.500 --> 58:46.500
That you can evolve

58:46.500 --> 58:48.500
All the kids were cast

58:48.500 --> 58:50.500
We had one script written and we rewrote

58:50.500 --> 58:52.500
That script based on all these kids

58:52.500 --> 58:54.500
And we just wrote to all of them

58:54.500 --> 58:56.500
We wrote to Winona and they made the show

58:56.500 --> 58:58.500
I think they made the show so much better

58:58.500 --> 59:00.500
More interesting everything was much more

59:00.500 --> 59:02.500
Stereotypical

59:02.500 --> 59:04.500
All of them are great

59:04.500 --> 59:06.500
And the kids are amazing

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
Everybody's so good you did such a great job with casting

59:08.500 --> 59:10.500
And writing and the way you shoot it

59:10.500 --> 59:12.500
And everything

59:12.500 --> 59:14.500
That other guy that I just fucking love

59:14.500 --> 59:16.500
Is the lead man

59:16.500 --> 59:18.500
The police officer

59:18.500 --> 59:20.500
What a fucking train wreck

59:20.500 --> 59:22.500
Immediately he's popping pills

59:22.500 --> 59:24.500
Smoking he doesn't give a shit he's drinking

59:24.500 --> 59:26.500
He hates his job

59:26.500 --> 59:28.500
But he's a fucking hero

59:28.500 --> 59:30.500
Remember that first time

59:30.500 --> 59:32.500
When he just fucking knocked the guy out

59:32.500 --> 59:34.500
That was back in the 70's when you can do that

59:34.500 --> 59:36.500
There weren't

59:36.500 --> 59:38.500
He just fucking knocked him out

59:38.500 --> 59:40.500
And I'm like fuck hero

59:40.500 --> 59:42.500
That's a real hero

59:42.500 --> 59:44.500
I can't have him listen to this

59:44.500 --> 59:46.500
No but the funny thing

59:46.500 --> 59:48.500
Why he didn't like doing that

59:48.500 --> 59:50.500
He loves punching people

59:50.500 --> 59:52.500
He will love everything that you're saying

59:52.500 --> 59:54.500
He's a real Andy Dick

59:54.500 --> 59:56.500
By the way

59:56.500 --> 59:58.500
The way he plays it

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
No one's moving that Volkswagen

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500
So I'm gonna go out and key it in a second

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500
Yeah we gotta move it

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.500
Uh oh

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500
He really well

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.500
But back to my medical question

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500
She's like how do you not

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
Is that we're born at the same time

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500
How do they not have your DNA

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
In a hologram

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
They either aren't identical twins

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500
That's the thing I don't understand

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
It's like you guys slip through the slats

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.500
Of an Orwellian

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500
This is what happens when you're born in the south

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.500
I don't know

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500
Well speaking of which

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500
You guys are like you're in the 30's

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500
I won't portray your 30's

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500
You're

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
You're

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.500
That's the new young

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500
You're being nostalgic

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.500
In this show for a time that didn't

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.500
Actually like

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500
For me that's what

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500
I keyed it

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500
There's no guarantee that the person's in this room

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500
Like they had no right to do that

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500
Well he should have went out and fucking moved it

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500
No because he might be

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500
A block away

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.500
Oh

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500
That's when I was like 10 years old

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500
That's like filled with all these memories for me

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.500
But you guys are like

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.500
You know you're fondly recalling

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500
A time in cinema

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500
Really like it's like your favorite movies

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
When you were kids right?

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500
Yeah I think it's just from

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.500
It's weird because it's part of it

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
Is our childhood we did

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500
We're hanging out with our friends

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.500
On adventures and then the other

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500
So that was a huge part of our childhood

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.500
And the other part was watching these VHS tapes

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
Over and over again

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
And so it all becomes like a blur

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500
When I look back on it, it's just a blur

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500
Those were my favorite movies and

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500
Were they better then?

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500
Because like so that kind of

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500
I always felt like this thing is like

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500
I felt like it was

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500
The movies were better

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.500
They're always better

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.500
But you guys are younger enough than me

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.500
That weren't true

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.500
Because you guys would just be fondly

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
Recalling like clueless or something

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
That you'd be like that's R-E-T

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
And I'd be like okay

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500
And feeling like a curmudgeon

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500
Like I guess we just all melt and die

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
And think that when we were 10

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500
There was a golden age of cinema

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500
But you guys are kind of like

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500
Confirming that in the 80s there was like a

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.500
Joy there, I think that John Carpenter

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.500
Really represents because here's a guy

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500
Who did his own music for his own horror

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500
Movies and like

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500
That synth feel

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500
That they live in

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.500
Yeah we didn't think about them as like

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Old movies though

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500
They felt very modern to me

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.500
I didn't watch the Goonies and I wasn't like

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500
Oh this is like an old movie

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500
It felt very current to me

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500
So I didn't differentiate, the only thing

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.500
That it didn't experience it theatrically

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.500
That was the only thing but it felt very

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.500
It felt very new to me

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500
Did you ever become conscious

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500
Like I think we're 80s files

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500
No

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500
No, not at all

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500
Short answer

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.500
It makes me nervous actually being associated

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.500
I feel like a lot of people know a lot

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500
More about it than we do

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500
Winona knows a lot more than we do

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.500
She's like it wasn't like this

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500
Just keep talking

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.500
You're on camera

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.500
She knows so much

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.500
She's in the rear

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.500
I feel like I know a lot of movies

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.500
I don't know what the hell she's taught

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.500
She's talking about an IMDb

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500
Or whatever it has like 700 votes

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.500
It's like no one has seen it

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Except Winona

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500
She watches so much

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500
Most of it's like 80s to 90

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500
It's like weird

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.500
I don't know if you'd even know

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.500
Audrey Rose, she's obsessed with this

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.500
Anthony Hopkins thing

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.500
It's like an exorcist rip off

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500
That they didn't aid you

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.500
Audrey Rose

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500
I want to watch Audrey Rose

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500
And it was like that for three months

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500
And I finally watched it

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500
I don't know

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500
If she says you gotta watch Martin Scorsese

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500
Dracula, say no

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.500
That's a good soundtrack though

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.500
What's Matthew Modine like?

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.500
He gave the weirdest interview yesterday

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.500
It was like in Forbes

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500
And he was talking about how upset he was

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500
That people were calling him evil

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.500
Because of the character he played in this show

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500
Because when we were shooting the show

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
I just let him

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.500
He thought he was being sympathetic

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500
Like he thought he was

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500
But everything he was doing that he thought was sympathetic

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Was really creepy

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500
And so we just let it go

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500
Like

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500
With 11

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500
When he touches her nose

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500
And Ross and I just looked

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Ooh

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500
And we're like yeah let's go

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.500
Let's do it

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.500
It wasn't a direction

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500
No

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500
He just said no

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.500
I'm going to touch her nose like this

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.500
And we're like haha

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.500
And then we do the first take and he does it

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.500
And we're like oh shit

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.500
That was actually

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500
He wasn't joking around

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.500
Because he has like so

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.500
And I know he was concerned

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.500
About the whole thing

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.500
He doesn't have a lot

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500
And so it's him finding these

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.500
He's making these weird choices

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.500
Anytime he's on screen

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500
Because he knows he only has

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500
Like I was like what is that accent you're doing

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
He's like I don't know

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.500
I'm not doing an accent

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.500
I'm like there's something

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.500
I can't figure it out what is it

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500
He's like I don't know there's nothing

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.500
But like it fucking worked

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
It cut through

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
I want to hear about Matthew Modine

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500
I was thinking like

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500
If I quantum leap into Matthew Modine

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500
And I look in the mirror and I see Matthew Modine

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500
And I go oh boy and that's the episode of

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500
Quantum leap I would spend that episode

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500
I'd be like how the fuck

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.500
Do you break out of being Matthew Modine

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.500
Man it's like it's kind of like

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.500
An invitation to just like take it as it lays

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.500
Man

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500
I want to think that he's like some kind of

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.500
Weird

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.500
He's really interesting and then

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.500
He's got some cool metal Jaguar stories

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500
Because he was there for two years

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.500
You make a Kubrick movie you're like

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.500
A lot of people associate that

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500
That was right when he was

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.500
The most desired Hollywood

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.500
He's gone for two years

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500
You sign a new Kubrick movie you're gone forever

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500
You sign your life away

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500
There's no end date

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.500
I know the end of it Kubrick says

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.500
Now put film in the camera

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.500
Did you ever hear that story

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.500
The shining

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500
Shelly DeVall

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.500
Shelly DeVall

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500
Yeah by the way I meant

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500
Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.500
Right

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.500
I like it from the trains riding over

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.500
The top of the book but yeah

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.500
He made her do a thousand tricks

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500
So she was going out of her mind

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.500
He talks to them he gets to what he needs out of them

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.500
He does it

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.500
Well I cut you off like no

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.500
I had something to say no I don't

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.500
You should have kept talking

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.500
What do you guys think of garage doors

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.500
So wait did his character

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.500
I can't even remember did he

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.500
Because I remember him being

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500
Not as scared as he should be that his

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500
Neck would get telekinetically snapped

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.500
Like I remember him walking

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.500
Down the hall and like and she's like

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.500
Snap snap and they're like

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.500
Their necks are like snap snap and then he's like

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.500
Hey take it easy

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500
I thought she was going to do that

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.500
Wait no telekinesis isn't real

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.500
You can't pretend

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.500
You're like doing like the thing they did

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.500
On behind the scenes on gremlins 2

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500
And they're like oh Mogwai wants his coffee

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.500
Come on don't insult us

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.500
Don't try to

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.500
Conjure that part of the 80s

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.500
Where

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500
Savvy people at Los Angeles

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500
She

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500
She

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.500
Wasn't supposed to have mental powers

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500
It's clearly a show about

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.500
A monster from the upside down

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.500
That's enough it was

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.500
Adding her was weird

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.500
She showed up she was bald she snapped

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.500
People's necks and we put her in the moon

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500
You guys are kind of famously

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.500
I mean so what was

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.500
It's an overnight thing

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.500
I don't know if that offends you to say that

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.500
There's maybe a trail of like very hard work

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.500
I'm sure you didn't come out of a dumpster

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.500
And walk into Netflix but

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.500
It might be insulting to you guys

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.500
Who are these guys where did they come from

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.500
But where did you come from

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500
Take us from birth to the night

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.500
Before you sell this pitch

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500
From birth

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500
Just real quick

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.500
We already focused on the birth for a while

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500
Well we've always

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.500
Since I think we got

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500
Our high eight camera

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500
And it was third grade

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500
And we started making movies then

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500
And we always knew

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.500
We wanted to make movies

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.500
And then we went to film

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500
So high eight was like

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.500
That's so analog

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.500
You're editing we had

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.500
You know we were playing Danny Elfman

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500
Our first movie it was like a magic

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.500
The Gathering adaptation

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.500
Now Hollywood read them

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
They're like oh the fucking Duffers want to do

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.500
That was fourth grade

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.500
Or third grade

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500
I don't want to do it now

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.500
But yeah so yeah and then we did that

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.500
When you guys edited with high eight

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.500
No we just cut in camera

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.500
And then eventually we got

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500
Because there was like a dual

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500
VHS editing thing

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.500
And then we went to school

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.500
I movie came out which was great

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500
And you know we learned on I movie

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.500
And then we went to film school

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.500
And we made some bad stuff

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.500
And then we wrote a first script

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500
Which got us an agent

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500
Where was film school?

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.500
That was at Chapman University

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.500
Oh by the way we have a lot of

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.500
Columbia alum here

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500
Columbia college

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.500
Where you and Andy went

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500
Yeah yeah I dropped out

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500
What you just heard was called

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500
The Columbia

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.500
The Columbia Chair

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500
They're a stealth college

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.500
Anyways sorry

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.500
I don't even know how we

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.500
I mean there's a series of rejection

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.500
It's series of rejection rejection rejection

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500
I mean it's like even film school

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500
It's like USC didn't want us

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
You didn't want us you couldn't get anywhere

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
So we wound up at Chapman

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500
And we just kept writing

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.500
And we were like we need to write our way in

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500
And get us anything

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500
I think before we went to college

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.500
The sense of like we're going to make this

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.500
Amazing short film

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500
And they're going to give us this giant movie

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.500
And then you swingers it

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.500
Yeah exactly

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.500
You know festival mindset

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.500
Yeah but then you realize how hard that is

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.500
How dead that game is

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.500
Every festival is rejected

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.500
The good thing is there's two of us

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500
That we like delusional together

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500
And then we just keep going at it

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.500
Yeah okay just push each other up

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500
Bring each other down

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.500
And pump each other up

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.500
How does that work

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500
Like how does that

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.500
Like if one of you is up

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.500
The other is it balances

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.500
Let's not get cocky

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500
Yeah he's being obnoxious

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.500
or you're being a douche

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.500
Or you sounded like a douche

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500
Or

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.500
That's not really nice Ross

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.500
I mean whatever

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.940
we do and then but you guys have had moments you you you got a season two or

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.980
there was must have been some moment when you went out to your black Volkswagen

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:16.300
oh shit and close the doors and both of you neither of you was telling the other

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.020
one not to get cocky anymore like you guys do you make out when that happens

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:30.060
I was gonna ask it did you guys ever jack off together okay it feels real

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:35.820
coming from us I guess this questions we don't have to wait for an answer the

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:42.580
answer is no I'm gonna wait I'm gonna be here all night but you get do you guys

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:48.260
collectively both go up way up and ever go away yeah I'd say so yeah I think we

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.300
go up and yeah yeah cuz it's toughs not going wrong is not going right we just

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.060
you know attack each other it's bad it's not I mean it's not I mean it

01:12:54.060 --> 01:13:00.660
depends but this might be a I forgive you if you want to just lie about the

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.380
answer to this because it's like it's not a charismatic question to answer

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.940
honestly if depending on the answer because I was just having this

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:11.860
conversation with somebody else where I was I don't like like do you guys think

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:18.340
did you think before you cross that threshold where it was like all right

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:23.580
we got it now we're taking care of regardless of what's supposed to be

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:29.740
like this you'll be working for a while now you're fine and but before that

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:34.500
there's a time of like as most people experience it's like am I supposed to

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:39.540
we're not supposed to be doing this are we supposed to wash dishes in that phase

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.060
which is which most people experience for much longer of their lives than the

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.780
other stuff me included like I have more memories from that that time during

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:55.020
that time reward my candor during that time I just kept assuming it was gonna

01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:02.220
work out yeah I say like it's like I like make fun that where we were

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.500
delusional with very delusional like you just knew I just felt that it was gonna

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.980
work you have to get there reach that I think actually the weird thing is the

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.540
six it only we've only found any success at all when it was pure panic because we

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.700
didn't know what else we were gonna do and we were out of money and it was just

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:23.100
like we're fucked and like I don't even think you know I remember like walking

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.900
my Starbucks and being like I don't those priests the jobs are like hard to get

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:33.940
man like I don't know yeah like that's everyone everyone's roomate Cody's

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:41.780
roommates job is she she goes to Costco and she she doesn't even work for Costco

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:46.820
that job's hard to get she works for a lotion company because she goes so she

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:50.180
goes to Costco it says like is one of those people at Costco that's like hey

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.980
do you want to try some lotion for free she works on commission like I don't

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:57.700
even know how it's legal like it's just sort of like like like she might make

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:03.580
zero dollars in a day like it's like anyways bad economy okay so or best one

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.660
ever but it's like fucking fragmented but okay why did I get too real of that

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:14.460
but I yes yes those fucking like like there's that I used to go like oh man

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:17.740
I'm gonna have to move back to Milwaukee and then I remember saying that out loud

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:20.860
to somebody and somebody's like is there someone in Milwaukee waiting for you to

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:26.900
come back and and I and for that time only I was like no what god no and I was

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:31.260
like but I just kind of kept it's delusional and I I can't figure out I

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.660
was I was in the shower this morning you're welcome and I was thinking about

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:41.540
that like I was like is that is that a good quality or a bad quality because

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:45.500
it's kind of like reconciling that with the whole kind of cultural awareness now

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:49.180
that we're having it's like we just fucking douchey privileged people it's

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:54.500
like that's that's just a symptom of luxury of like well yeah like you wait

01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:00.180
a couple years and another white dude helps you out yeah I don't think it

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.980
happens like that let me be real clear here I think it's hard work and nothing

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:11.540
else no no handouts for anybody if your skyscraper is the second tallest now

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:17.660
just wait and one day it's gonna be the tallest and it's gonna be because you

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:21.580
worked hard because you sacrificed

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.420
knows what he's talking about I mean this guy he's like on two shows as an

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:36.460
actor he's executive producing and he's your chauffeur yeah the okay so you guys

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:39.900
are you guys are in the writers room right now working on season yeah so the

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.900
things that were allowed to know are because you would watch that I watch a

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:48.980
show called stranger things I watch it for 10 episodes it's serialized for all

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:53.220
I know in keeping with a John Carpenter tradition or something like that that

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:57.060
the second season is gonna be like hey it's called stranger things you know it's

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:01.780
like true detective and it's like like like all of a sudden it's like 1973 in

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:08.940
Detroit and they're like my name's my name's Roger McClintock and I've seen

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:13.660
stranger things than the case I'm on you know she says she's a witch but I don't

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:19.660
believe in the only thing I believe in is my revolver and everyone's either

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:23.300
booing or cheering but that's not the case I know that from talking to you

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:27.580
guys and the public knows you guys are like it's these characters it's Winona

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:33.580
and her kids and the and and now even stranger things will happen yeah we

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.980
wanted that we wanted to see it as like it's like a year later and we're trying

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:40.500
to treat as much as we can even though it's a scary word treat it like a

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.780
sequel just because there aren't very many good ones but the good ones are

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.940
really good right and so the hope is that you got to have a million stranger

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:52.560
things come down and then have space marines be like lock and load there's

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.660
20 upside-downs

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.380
why did she put her in charge

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:08.820
it's aliens

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:15.220
you guys know you watch Halloween and then you watch Halloween too when

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.100
you're a kid I mean you guys were kids when you saw it too I'm sure but when I

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.900
was a kid it was like it was happening kind of like watch Halloween it was like

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.100
the original it's like the birth of Michael Myers you watch Halloween too

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.500
oh it's the sequel it picks up where it left off but now it's killing people in

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.780
the hospital the scalpel and they watch Halloween 3 it's called season of the

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.580
witch and it's about like a microchip in the back of a mask and there's a mad

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.660
toy manufacturer that wants to enact a Celtic tradition and and you always

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:42.780
think when you're a consumer back then I was I was like how could they not

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.540
understand but then you but now you've probably already experienced enough to

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.340
understand like of course that happens because everything nothing happens like

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:53.780
the way it should like like the decisions that are made aren't happening

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:59.300
that John Carpenter did a an interview like he was like well we did Halloween

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.460
it was like this amazing movie our plan the entire time was going to be to

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:07.660
always do a new movie every Halloween that's all we wanted to do it was going

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:13.220
to be an anthology it was like he didn't he didn't even want Halloween to be so

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:18.020
successful that Halloween 2 was demanded to the point where I don't even think he

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.820
worked on it I don't think he was allowed to I don't even know like I like

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:25.420
that it was like like like oh yeah someone else will take care of this

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.940
cuz it's just fucking money is pouring out it's like when you hit oil and it's

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:33.060
just in the movies and it's just gushing out like where's all that oil going and

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:39.340
it's like yeah exactly motherfucker get some barrels over here that's what's

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.700
happening with you guys right I mean you can you could say yes to that without

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.700
vilifying anybody it's just like that is the state of the union like you guys

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:51.660
didn't expect yeah but like Netflix was they didn't invest in it going this is

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:56.660
gonna be a one-year like it was always gonna be planned to be you know keep

01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:00.060
going right we had we had to go in with that mindset that it would be that was

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.300
that that was the intention but do you think keep going do you think that

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.660
their attitude changed at all about like like based on I don't even know well

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.020
who knows what numbers they look at but I don't know we don't know no we don't

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.420
know I mean they really honestly don't tell us and like so I mean we're just

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:17.180
trying to do I mean it's really scary I mean I don't know I mean now like a

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.260
never before have we been in a position where anyone cared about what we're

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:27.500
doing I realized though you know I mean like as it comes from much more pure

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.100
place and now there's like all this noise and I'm like you know I'm like

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.060
neurotic and I'm thinking about what other people are gonna think about it I'm

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:37.540
like that's bad that's bad that's bad I gotta have each other to turn to you

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.300
about that and then you know and then you know and then and then we're just

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:44.900
trying as much as possible just write you know what we think is cool and what

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:49.300
we want to see and not worry about like longevity or franchise ability or any of

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:52.900
that shit and just like just write a cool second season and then and then and

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:56.220
then worry about the rest later which is not necessarily how everyone wants us

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.980
to be doing it but I think it's the best thing I think it's gonna result you

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.740
know in the best in the best thing but I don't know because I see all these

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:07.100
filmmakers I admire and they mess up on sequels and and you know like Netflix

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:10.180
doesn't even like us talking about sequels because it makes them nervous

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.620
because there's so many bad ones so but but it's just it's not a tradition but

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.500
it's a TV show I mean no but it's not traditional though and that like it in

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:21.580
like it is built because it you know it built climax and it and it ends and the

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.220
main tension is resolved so so do you it's different do you think when you

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:28.140
say that they're nervous about the sequel thing do you think what what they

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:32.860
were more like the word it's the more like the word we like using it just

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:37.700
because we like seeing it as yeah this it's you know a new tension that then

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:40.820
also gets resolved there's always important to us like not to do the

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:44.180
killing thing in season one where it's like we'll just got will but oh he's in

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:48.380
oh no he got snatched away by larger demo go again you know and we got to go

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.980
get that it's like we saw that we want to do different we want to do new

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:55.700
different stuff you know and so I I don't know I don't know what's the word

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.260
excited about it as long as we're excited about it I feel like we're fine

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:07.020
we're good he described the worst version of the show the worst version of

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:13.500
season two as you see it in the eyes of the person that wants the worst thing

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:18.460
for sure like the thing that is your worst nightmare like it's sort of the

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:22.620
is the like because I love I love home alone one of my favorite right so but

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:28.220
when I was like a kid and home alone two came out I like I was like eight or

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:34.100
whatever I was like what the fuck is this like it's the exact same thing they've

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:43.380
just slotted in the pigeon lady for the shovel guy do you think that's bullshit is

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:48.060
that your worst nightmare that's the worst night is communicating like 11's

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.100
lost in the upside down they have to try to communicate with why not 12 you know

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:57.500
and when no one starts to communicate with magnets like that's like that's my

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:01.140
worst nightmare the show I'm not interested in that at all and do you think

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:05.700
I bet you can't answer this question honestly because it's like the question

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:10.140
I want to ask does it like do you actually think because I know Netflix is

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:16.300
justifiably like deified right now I mean they're like kind of beyond HBO at

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:21.740
their still going peak because at HBO you could kind of there was it was still

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:27.980
born from a non-silicon Valley model and so now like Netflix has combined the

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:35.780
prestige of HBO and the success of 80s NBC with the like fuck you we're doing it

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.140
different and we're not sharing our thought process of Silicon Valley and

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:43.420
it's kind of like terrifying and tiddling I love it like I love it it gets a

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:47.300
little boring hearing pitches like having a little shitty studio in Burbank

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.100
and every time you hear a picture kind of like so where should we take this out

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:57.140
Netflix yeah well that's like saying I'd like to be on TV please it's kind of

01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.220
like back you're all of a sudden you're back to being ten years old but I think

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:03.780
it's a good thing and I anyway but but but I guess what I was gonna ask but you

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:08.980
can't answer this is do you really think that they do you think that they would

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:14.260
want to see that formulaic like plugged in thing or I don't I mean ultimately I

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:19.020
mean I do honestly they that they're they're banking on us and then like if I

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:22.460
make if I make an you know they're not they're not writing the show so if I make

01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:25.980
I make you know compelling I make an argument I explain why we want to do

01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:30.820
what we want to do they back us and so like and it's so crazy it's crazy they

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:35.620
back this in the first I don't know why I still don't know why so yeah I mean

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.580
yeah it was not because we we not only like went in and pitched it and say we

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:43.140
wanted to show run it we had no there's no reason anyone would let us should let

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.620
us show run anything and never show run or and then we never movie was literally

01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.940
dumped like no one saw it like it's on I still don't understand I mean I think

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:57.660
I think Andy Dick had something to do with it yes there is no so they might

01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:00.980
I love that I feel like they're route like I love the rebel spirit of it like

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.860
that they have I don't want them to lose it you know I so and I hope that they

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:08.020
don't I mean because that that's what I think it's given them so much success so

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:11.660
I just hope they keep doing it I have to keep making crazy fucking decisions yeah

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:15.260
like our show yeah and I don't know if they're that crazy I think it's a the

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.500
funny thing about TV that I've watched happen is that the definition of crazy

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:25.220
and like breaking the mold it it's practical it's it's it's basically

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:28.980
algorithmic because the algorithm of television until such times they make a

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:33.340
computer that can write and direct television the algorithm suggests that

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:38.900
the smart thing to do as like FX would say like like like like the guy who's

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:44.700
ass I kissed the most John Landgraf like when he talks about TV he goes like we

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:49.980
don't know how to make good TV we what we know works is statistically if you

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:53.860
just like make deals with people that you like and you kind of like it's like

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.220
there's no way you just have to like keep making it and then the good stuff

01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.620
like works and the bad stuff doesn't it's like there's a it's the same as in

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:07.300
physics where it's like everybody worked from making weird shit up to justify

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:12.940
Newtonian stuff we like call Newton's laws the Nielsen's maybe and it's just

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:17.020
like well why is if an apple falls and hits your head which makes perfect sense

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.420
then how come when you turn a flashlight on in a train car the light hits the

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:25.460
thing of oh that's easy there's a boogeyman and then Einstein is like what

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:31.700
if blah blah blah and everyone's like no the and that's me Einstein the no it's

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:39.380
John Landgraf no it's I'm drunk where's Andy the anyways I like the

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:44.820
algorithmic I love the possibly apocryphal story of them going of how

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:50.220
Sikharj was like people keep you know they did a spreadsheet and it said

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:55.540
Kevin Spacey and and political thrillers equals blah blah blah that even if

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:59.660
that's not true I don't mind living in that one shit it I know I mean that's

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:04.420
before they buy that like they they run whatever numbers they run I mean I mean I

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.900
don't know what it is they're plugging it into something but isn't that what we

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:12.740
want though because we're not Jackson Pollock we want approval we want to and

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:17.300
we yeah yeah yeah we're good people like we punch this in and said oh this

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:21.300
would be good to write we wrote we're into whatever it no it was a stupid

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:25.020
thing to write really I mean you're writing a show about I mean no one

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.620
wanted to do when we're pitching this around you it's like it's their kids

01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.300
and they're chasing a monster they're like so it's a kid's show I'm like no

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.820
it's not a kid's show there's also this you know what I mean like people that it

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:38.980
was hard for people to comprehend so it's not for us who was not writing it

01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:43.300
from like let's sell this and make this hit show it's like let's just try to

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.820
write something that we want to see and then hopefully and then we didn't even

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:49.620
have whatever that Netflix we should take it Netflix we didn't even like I

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:53.340
didn't even dare utter it because like there's no way it just it just didn't

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:57.540
even occur to me that that could be a possibility which oh we should take

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:00.460
this and sell to net like I didn't want to be an asshole and say that it just

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.780
felt so unrealist we're in God's earth did you think it would I don't know

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:08.540
that's my point we didn't know God you guys instincts are terrible yeah do you

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:13.460
think there would be an ABC it's fucking goofy what did we I mean what did I

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:20.100
don't know really naive I don't know so how did you take it to Netflix what

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.020
you know well the weird thing is that we actually we because we were so not

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:27.820
established and then you know we were working with a producer that we liked

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:32.140
Sean Levy but he's a he's a film guys not a TV guy so it was basic it was a

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.820
terrible package who's a terrible television package and so we were like

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:41.900
let's go around to studios not actually to networks which you know they're you

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.060
know they're the like you know like for instance a company called MRC helps fund

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:50.820
House of Cards but they don't you know and then and then Netflix airs it they'd

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.780
help pay for it so we're like let's get one of these people and that'll make it

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:58.860
a sexier package and so we are going around doing that and then mostly we

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:03.300
were getting passes we're getting a few interests and then somehow Netflix heard

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:07.100
about it they're the only network or anything that we ever would that we

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:10.500
pitched in the whole time like it's just heard about it well no no no I have it

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:14.500
whenever I know cameras everywhere yeah what I mean it was specifically it was

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.860
like a TV agent like at a breakfast pitching other shit to in the Netflix

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.860
executive and him going oh we're looking for stuff so lucky they're like for like

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:26.500
young adults we're looking for supernat we like any of these films do really well

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:30.220
personally it was just yeah like talking about the shit in their algorithm I

01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.940
think oh that they're looking for and he's like well I happen to have this

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.780
thing we have two studios who want it he's like give it to me now over the

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:39.020
weekend and then it happened really fast and I think it helped you know how

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:42.820
things work like you can't get that first bite but then once one person is

01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:46.860
interested in suddenly like oh it's a thing right like oh people like this is

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.980
like it's legitimate like it's legitimate we hit because we had like 12

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.020
15 passes and then one person bought it and then suddenly I was like oh my god

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.340
this is amazing I was like it didn't change in a week like it's like someone

01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:01.460
just liked one person so one person liked it and then it's a snowball yeah

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:05.300
and then and during that while I was having that snowball effect someone in

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:11.100
Netflix heard about it so what okay so the immediate audience here I don't know

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.700
if it's still a thing but everybody's going like okay so what do I do like like

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.780
and I never know how to answer that question well you you obviously you

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.380
make something that you love and hope it just gets out that's because for us at

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:26.300
least for us yeah for so long yeah we were no that's what you're saying we were

01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:30.980
writing stuff that like we thought like we'd meet with these producers or what

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.500
not and they're like this is what we're looking for but the weird thing are no

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:37.620
activity you guys are directors and writers but you did come to a point

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:42.540
which is a little yeah there's a there's a there's a way to look at this in a

01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:46.620
disheartening way which is that because directors shoot stuff and writers write

01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:52.020
kind of documents suggesting you shoot stuff later and you and you guys made a

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:56.420
decision to pull out of the shooting of stuff which is that advice which is

01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:00.940
channel 101 which is like hey man yeah do what you're gonna do if you're allowed

01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:04.380
to do anything and me and me and me and you guys were like yeah let's not make

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:09.420
short films anymore let's like let's write scripts and that'll be the path I

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:18.060
don't know like it are we gonna tell are we telling these kids to go in their

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.060
backyard and shoot shoot home movies are we telling them to run over their

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.940
keyboards I mean I know that the simple answer is if you want to be a writer

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:27.420
run over your keyboards but you guys are our tours what tell the our tours what

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:32.220
to do I mean I know I think you do both I mean I think it's super I mean first

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.460
of all though I never understood that vice of like oh go shoot maybe you can do

01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.900
it now but it was like oh you anyone can go make side when these filmmakers were

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:41.740
talking like anyone can go make stuff now so cheap it's like no it's not like

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:45.500
it's fucking expensive that always made me mad like you just go make some it's

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.980
like just to get good audio unit is expensive like it's expensive you know

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:53.380
audio and the lights and getting the people together and like it's it ends up

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:56.460
being like a big endeavor so it like always made me mad that's so easy now

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.060
with technology that anyone can just go out and make something it's like it's

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:02.380
not true and if you're not in individual effects which we're not we don't

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.740
know shit about visual effects like it's not you're not gonna make there's no

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.420
there's zero chance of making something that's gonna get you in the door like

01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:12.580
that's just my no there's like those Sunday it's movies and shot an iPhone or

01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:17.100
whatever like you can I think that is a route I think for it's a hard route that

01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:21.500
most it does not it's honestly one of the hardest routes I think which is to

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:25.140
make those films and hope it gets into those festivals and hopes that the

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:29.020
percentage of that that is is so small so it was awesome doing a little bit of

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:34.060
okay but even like tangerine is like over a hundred thousand dollars I mean

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:37.100
it's not cheap it's not like that you know you don't have 20 you don't have

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:41.260
$50 in your pocket but I think what and what we realized is that in a part of

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:44.060
this was because you know when we were we're at Chapman you're going around and

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:47.300
we're interning at these production companies and you're reading these

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:51.260
scripts right and these are scripts that are from people that you know we saw

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:54.300
had representation a lot of this stuff was they were going to pay to write this

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:58.820
stuff and it's not very a lot of it's not very good a lot of these script in

01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:03.900
Hollywood and needs content everyone needs content so it was us going if we

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.900
can teach ourselves how to do this then you know I think there's at least like a

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:12.380
cool be a crack in the door that we can get through I do really believe and

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.780
maybe it's super nice but I feel like if you because the minute we once we wrote

01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:20.580
something I actually deep down thought was actually okay like it kind of worked

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:25.420
it's it ended up set ended up eventually selling which I could like please I knew

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:29.020
the other stuff that we had written like I knew I just knew I mean I just like

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.940
if I was really really honest when I saw I knew it wasn't it wasn't good enough

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:35.100
and then when we and we got to that place and I thought it was good enough it

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:39.020
ended up selling so I feel like I feel like if you if you fail enough and you

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:43.060
yeah you try enough and I don't know that's at least that's what worked for

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:46.940
us I mean we we we we fumbled around for so long so we're saying that the

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:53.460
internet is has become such a glut that actually truly and I'm I'm not gonna

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:59.180
agree with this yet but but but what's on the table is the idea that whereas in

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:07.820
19 or a little 2002 when I was spouting at the most like you know you want to

01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:12.740
make a TV show you have a camera in your pocket grab it fuck the audio make the

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:17.700
TV show put it online keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it talent will

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:22.460
out that we've actually hit a point maybe the the theory would be we've had a

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:28.780
point where it's like there's too much shit and the internet is oxygen it is

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:35.380
just the air around us and and it's no more shocking that anybody in this room

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:41.860
is it knows how to make a video about two people farting and and flying in the

01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:47.540
flying saucer then it is to digit like it's it doesn't matter there's too much

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:52.380
shit to click on and everyone's got too much shit going on and like you like so

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:56.620
we focus on script as a document because it's sort of like part of the old

01:34:56.620 --> 01:35:02.020
world and we like write up our idea of like fade in on this and cut to that and

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:08.300
this is our idea is that because the agency mechanism is still in control like

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.140
that it's still I mean I think that can where I think what you're saying I mean

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.940
I think people are doing that where they're making that stuff and it's

01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:18.700
cutting through I just think it's so percentage wise right it's got to be

01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.940
pretty well I mean because there's like you said there's just so much I don't

01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:25.780
know what's going on on YouTube like I don't understand some of the stuff no

01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:28.340
because you'll because I'm you know I'm not even on Twitter but on you know

01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.140
we're sort of you know I was searching Twitter to see what people are saying

01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.940
about the show and you know you click on these people and I got like okay 10

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:38.100
million followers I don't know who this YouTube star yeah so I feel like there's

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.980
a I'm sorry we should not be talking about we shouldn't be talking about it

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:45.540
yeah I don't know right yeah yeah maybe you yeah okay yeah we shouldn't be

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.220
talking about it I think the world agrees yeah let's all let's all stop

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:54.140
talking about let's talk about race I think that alright your eyes can really

01:35:54.140 --> 01:36:00.780
pop up that was craziness oh how many well how many episodes you doing season

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:06.140
two nine okay which is weird but it's great it's a little warning shot what

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:09.820
what's a warning is it one less than the first season well no one more okay okay

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:17.580
it's a little gummy bear yeah it's a little nightquail yeah I don't know

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:21.900
where it's a weird time to be doing this because it's one of the first times

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:25.260
that I can think of that you can you can come up with an idea and you can go

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:30.860
well this is you know this is how long the story is it's five and hours and 30

01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:34.540
minutes and 20 seconds and that's just how it is and you can actually you can

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:38.420
actually put that out and I don't know if I can't think of another instance I

01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.660
mean usually you're you're writing to commercials or you're writing to you

01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:45.340
know you know why are movies two hours you know is it like because you have to

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:49.580
pee I'm still trying to adjust all this because I yeah I just can't yes it's

01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:53.500
yeah it's based on some kind of thing and that's the same with the 22 minutes

01:36:53.500 --> 01:37:00.100
the 45 minutes I'm I I'm raised in front of cheers watching TV and so I come up

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:05.140
in the 21st century and I'm like this craftsman and I'm gonna I'm like like

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:09.660
oh this other show is shittier than mine because it's doing serialized

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:15.340
storytelling and that's a cheap tactic and that and now I'm in this world

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:20.740
where it's like hey old man like this isn't serialized hello and I'm like oh

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:27.620
sorry I'll try to serialize it for you but and that's I try to like shake it

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:32.260
like as I'm like eight feet it's it's sad if it just reminds me of like the the

01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:37.300
SNL sketch where Dana Carvey was playing Johnny Carson in a post-Arcinio

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:41.980
world who had had his fingers elongated because Arcinio has long fingers so it

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:48.300
was called Carcinio and it was Dana Carvey doing Arcinio as Johnny Carson

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:53.140
and going like wolf wolf wolf wolf wolf that's how I feel when I think about

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:57.220
serializing something that I'm writing like oh this is gonna be binge worthy

01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.140
and all this stuff it's like wait you I feel like I'm purposely I can't tell

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:07.500
when I'm stooping when I'm evolving and when I should just retire and like like

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:11.980
like it's like well if I that's serialization thing is like a big

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.740
fucking weird mind fuck for me yeah yeah but that's cuz you're growing I mean

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:19.780
because we just we're different because we grew up on and I didn't grow up on

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:24.300
watching much TV to be honest so we grew up on on movies and and movie

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:27.860
structures so that's kind of what I think that's what drew us to it and also

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:31.140
because the movie industry is so sad like we try to get into the movies and it

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.460
was just it was you know it's depressed a little depressing right now and there

01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:38.900
was so much then TV and whenever we went to TV meetings or even not just with

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.100
producers who didn't movies and TV they're like well what are your TV ideas

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:47.740
because they need content so desperately breaking it up and yeah we're

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:51.860
just like yeah yeah that's basically I mean is that why the guy goes the cop

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:55.060
guy goes to the lab and then he's like oh man there's a lab here and then they

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:59.660
like knock him out and then he wakes up and he's like back to being a cop is it

01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:03.700
that's more like us writing ourselves into a whole that's what I mean kind of

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:12.460
it's like he's like forward with that or the movie yeah really it's almost like

01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:17.100
it's like for me I mean it's a learn of the rings like I was like learn the

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:23.180
rings great one book one movie three awesome 11 years of our lives and then

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:29.100
they're like now let's do the hobbit I'm like what it's three movies like so one

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:33.860
of your movies is gonna be about riding barrels like for sure and sure enough it

01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:42.100
if I was like I was like watch out that's the barrel wizard what I'm the

01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:52.260
barrel wizard would you like to keep riding the barrels but yeah it's okay

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:58.620
so well at the outset of season 2 do you guys do you guys did you because you're

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:03.500
already I did you do an hole like like okay here's what's gonna happen from

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:07.060
beginning middle end in the whole season and then you chopped it up like a

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:11.300
little pie yeah yeah you're pretty essentially yeah I mean but obviously it

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.500
of it just keeps evolving and changing as you're going because once you get in

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:18.540
there I mean what we found at least is I can't force these characters to do

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:22.060
something so sometimes we're trying to force someone to go in a direction and

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:25.820
it's like well they just don't want to do that that feels stupid and so then then

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.980
it just keeps changing and evolving but if we know where the end it where we're

01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:33.580
going eventually that's that's the goal and the same thing with season 2 it's

01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:38.140
just keeps it keeps evolving but we know where we know what that destination is

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.580
can I pitch you guys something yes you probably you probably don't like when

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:53.740
this happens but it's not like I'm a waiter I made community and I know you

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:58.180
don't want to be pigeonholed as the 80s guys but you know encyclopedia brown

01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:05.780
cuz I just want to make encyclopedia brown but like Chinatown like like like

01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:10.900
he's the smartest kid on the block which means he has ass burgers but he's and

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.860
he's like it's hard for him to deal with people but he can solve crimes and it's

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:17.620
like but it's hardcore like them so it's a it's like that he's like a kid

01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.900
detective hey who stole your bike I found it out it's the mystery of the

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:25.940
missing bike and then like every good film noir movie he like some grown-up

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:30.020

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:33.260
stylistically like this is why it's up your alley you guys can it can be a

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:37.340
Duffer brothers thing I'll just write it like you guys can like I don't want to be

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:19.780
trail but like but he's like he's encyclopedia brown and and and and and so

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:22.980

01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:01.140
used and he's been he's been fucking set up that's the threshold you cross

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:07.940
someone just fucked with encyclopedia brown and he's like fuck this like and

01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:11.100
he has this like voiceover like I've know I always want to write something with

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:14.780
voiceover like but I there's it's not it's like I always hate it but it's like

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:18.780
I'll do I'll do it you guys direct it where he's like just like he's like

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:23.420
fucking somebody fucked with me today like and I had a deal with society it's

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:26.860
like I'd be smart and keep my head down and help them solve their fucking

01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:29.660
mysteries and they wouldn't fuck with me but they just fight and they wouldn't use

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:33.540
the f-word this much it's not a David Mammet play but it's I'm just saying like

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:38.020
he's he's the outrage like he's like uncorked he's like he's like a super

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:41.620
genius and it hurts to be this smart he lost his parents it's like you ever see

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:45.660
zero effect with Bill Pullman like it's like like he it's like that but a kid

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:50.100
he's fucking mentally unhinged that's why he's so good at solving crimes it's

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:54.420
like criminal intent with denofrio like it's like he's fucking like he's kind

01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:58.860
of twitchy and like and and there is like a girl like like like what was their

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.740
name like Kimball or whatever Kim but like like there was a girl in

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:08.180
Cyclopedia Brown who was like the muscle but was like also like his his like Watson

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:11.540
but she was kind of like like she also was bigger because girls mature faster

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:16.060
so she could beat up bugs meanie anyways but he's like you know yeah so

01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:19.300
there's like a little love story to it but it's like so but I'm just saying like

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:25.100
fucking deep and dark like Chinatown like like like like Chinatown dark but

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:29.260
with a kid and he's like he's been sucked into a grown-up world of murder and

01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:33.740
they're trying to play him and he's like I played nice fucking role and like now

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:37.940
I'm like now I got to use my own like detective skills to like play with these

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:42.500
grown-ups and it's like badass yeah like and it can be set in the 80s or not but

01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:45.420
you guys will probably be like we can't cuz we don't be the 80s guys and I'm

01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:50.940
like fine we'll do it like it follows where like it's kind of sort of feels

01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:55.940
like the 80s but then someone's getting like a DVR or something yeah and you

01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:05.940
guys can be like we're growing and I'll be like so like you guys are into it

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:10.780
we'll go to Netflix because every time I go there I can't I'm like buzzing and

01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:18.900
I'm like it's Dan Harmon community and they're like I what I want yeah so if I

01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:24.380
figure if I went in with you guys or you guys going with that idea have someone

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:30.660
else read it encyclopedia brown but there's like yeah there's a fucking pool

01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:39.140
of crusted blood on a carpet on page 17 that's like and then and then it goes

01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:49.300
now wow wow it says encyclopedia brown but for reals in red neon with a like

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:58.860
serif-laden neon font now you're into it that's good I get it do you guys like

01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:03.820
lockout that space movie is like diehard in space oh the one that yeah they're

01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:06.780
ripped off I guess it ripped off this game from New York they should they suit

01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:11.620
them I don't know I mean if I won that yeah he won I know but that's kind of

01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:17.820
weird to me like hey I didn't know if you can sue for that like I'd be in big

01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:23.580
trouble like that's not like a Q&A with him and they were talking to John

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:26.660
carpet and he had someone were like what do you think about these you know all

01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:30.660
these remakes of your movies it's like I love he loves them because he gets paid

01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:36.660
like oh yeah so I'm with lockout he's like fuck this remade in for this like

01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:40.300
you remade this pay for this oh that's why he's mad that's why he sued I'm sure

01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:45.300
but it just okay yeah I don't want to knock his point of view or I just

01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:49.100
didn't see it did you see it yeah I did and I thought it was just I pierced I

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.140
thought it was diehard in space I didn't I didn't really think I mean I

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:56.660
recognized devices used in escape from New York but I didn't think that those

01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:01.420
devices were the light bulb I thought that they were kind of like I don't know

01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:05.100
I don't know but yeah now I feel like I'm gonna get in trouble with people I

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:09.300
admire so I'll stop there if John carpet it's seen if you can rip off

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:15.940
encyclopedia brown I had a point where I had a meeting there was somebody

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:18.740
that controlled the rights to encyclopedia brown and then my agent at

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:22.940
UCA was like okay you're gonna meet her at the and I was like I came in and I

01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:27.980
it was like 10 a.m. and I ordered a vodka on the rocks and they and she's

01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:33.300
like you're you're drinking at 10 a.m. why and I said because I'm amazing and

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:37.140
then they never I was like and then I picked up a great take on encyclopedia

01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:43.820
brown like the blood and the they never called back that's that's where I think

01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:49.460
I think Bugs Meanie is behind it I think we can solve it

01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:56.460
hey how are you I I don't know that much about the 80s yeah well yeah you do you

01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:01.340

I'm just a depressed rapper, I'm so depressed

01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:13.980
God hates me, I'm so depressed

01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:16.980
I'm a depressed rapper

01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:19.980
With an auto-tune effect

01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:22.980
I'm a depressed rapper

01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:27.980
Like all the rappers are

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:30.980
You don't hear anybody using this effect to say

01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:33.980
Something cool, like, hey

01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.980
I had a great day today

01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.980
I really felt like I had a win

01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.980
I had an audition and I feel like I'm in the system

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:43.980
No, I'm gonna wish them well

01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:45.980
I'm gonna go down to New Ileens

01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:47.980
And help with the Daxan bags

01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.980
And know what I mean to save their lives from the fake coming flood

01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:53.980
I'm gonna donate my money and donate my blood

01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:55.980
Because I know that people need help

01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:58.980
And I'm gonna go to the restaurant with a good Yelp score

01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:01.980
Cause I want deconstructed lasagna

01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:03.980
And some more

01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.980
Full soup

01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.980
Because I'm a rapper

01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:11.980
And I've got a lot of positive things to say

01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.980
No, it goes like this

01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:15.980
I wanna kill myself

01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:18.980
Why don't you keep me for fucking you on this shelf

01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:21.980
I need to do pain to fuck you

01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:23.980
Or I'm gonna kill myself

01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:27.980
Why do you face make me feel like I can't feel my face

01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:29.980
I'm gonna go to hell when I die

01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:32.980
Cause I got problems, I got no more God

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:34.980
I feel so bad about myself

01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:37.980
I feel bad, I feel bad about myself

01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.980
But the Duffer brothers in the house

01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:45.980
I fucked your mother till her pussy got tight as a mouse

01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.980
Your mama's pussy stole some cheese from me

01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:53.980
And I ran after it like a cat and it tried to fool me

01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:56.980
Your mama's pussy ran into a hole

01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:58.980
I reached my hand into it

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:00.980
And put a stick of dynamite in my hand

01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.980
Dressed like a mouse

01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:05.980
The dynamite was dressed like a mouse

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:11.980
The dynamite was dressed like a mouse

01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:13.980
Yelp, took it away

01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:16.980
Yelp, I'm the emcee dynamite mouse

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:18.980
I'm dived, I'm dived

01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:20.980
No, don't take it

01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:22.980
For real, he made me come here

01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:24.980
Yeah, it was an impulsive thought

01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.980
He told me to come on the way over here and rap

01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:29.980
I changed my mind

01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:31.980
Don't make me get mad

01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:32.980
Yeah, right

01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:34.980
Fuck you

01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:36.980
9-11

01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:38.980
9-11

01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:40.980
9-9-9-11

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:43.980
Don't forget 9-11

01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:46.980
Yo, when those towers came down

01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:47.980
My heart came down

01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:49.980
My air to ground came down

01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:52.980
But my heart was the tallest

01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:54.980
And now it's the ballest

01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:56.980
Yelp, I never forget

01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:57.980
When I fucked your mama so hard

01:53:57.980 --> 01:53:59.980
Her 9-11 gets wet

01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:00.980
I made her pussy so wide

01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.980
I flew two planes inside

01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:04.980
Now she came and then she died

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:06.980
Yo, but then she went to

01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:07.980
Oh shit, oh fuck

01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.980
What the fuck, good shit

01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:12.980
Goddamn, it was like a terrorist attack

01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:14.980
Woke a sleeping giant

01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:17.980
Yo, get the UN's consent

01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:19.980
Before you invade a country

01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:24.980

01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:27.980

01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:29.980
The Duffer Brothers

01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:30.980
Give them a chance

01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.980
Will you give them a chance

01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:33.980
When you see their show on Netflix

01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.980
Just give them a chance

01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:39.980
