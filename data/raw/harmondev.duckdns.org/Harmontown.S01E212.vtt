80s\n\n03:33.500 --> 03:36.500\nAnd there's some cool things about the 80s\n\n03:38.500 --> 03:40.500\nI don't want to shit on them\n\n03:40.500 --> 03:42.500\nCause the Druffer brothers are

hop\n\n04:06.500 --> 04:08.500\nBut it's not any less violent\n\n04:08.500 --> 04:10.500\nI could have predicted this phenomenon\n\n04:10.500 --> 04:13.500\nIt's weird and kind of admirable\n\n04:13.500 --> 04:14.500\nBut fuck you mama\n\n04:14.500 --> 04:16.500\nSo hard she turned into a bull\n\n04:16.500 --> 04:19.500\nIt was ancient Greek in that regard\n\n04:19.500 --> 04:21.500\nI'm gonna go across the river sticks\n\n04:21.500 --> 04:24.500\nAnd cut myself with a shard of myself\n\n04:31.500 --> 04:32.500\nI'm trying to...\n\n04:32.500 --> 04:34.500\nI don't want to be like one of those guys\n\n04:34.500 --> 04:36.500\nThat's like, oh, I'm rapping\n\n04:36.500 --> 04:38.500\nAnd then it's like\n\n04:38.500 --> 04:40.500\nMy name is something that I'm here to say\n\n04:40.500 --> 04:42.500\nAnd then you're like, come on\n\n04:42.500 --> 04:44.500\nThe rap doesn't sound like that anymore\n\n04:44.500 --> 04:46.500\nSo I listened to more rap\n\n04:46.500 --> 04:48.500\nAnd I was like, jeez, these guys are so...\n\n04:48.500 --> 04:50.500\nThey're so sad\n\n04:52.500 --> 04:53.500\nIt's really...\n\n04:53.500 --> 04:54.500\nYou really couldn't have predicted it\n\n04:54.500 --> 04:55.500\nCause it was...\n\n04:55.500 --> 04:56.500\nOh, is it...\n\n04:56.500 --> 04:57.500\nI'm still...\n\n04:57.500 --> 04:59.500\nThey're so sad\n\n05:02.500 --> 05:04.500\nAlright, so there's...\n\n05:04.500 --> 05:07.500\nThe knob that's supposed to change key\n\n05:07.500 --> 05:10.500\nI guess I wish I knew more about music\n\n05:10.500 --> 05:11.500\nI don't think that one works\n\n05:11.500 --> 05:12.500\nI think we need to send that back\n\n05:12.500 --> 05:14.500\nBut then there's a knob that says\n\n05:17.500 --> 05:19.500\nAnd it has two settings\n\n05:25.500 --> 05:27.500\nWhich we now know it shouldn't\n\n05:27.500 --> 05:30.500\nIt should be a continuum\n\n05:31.500 --> 05:33.500\nBut it's two settings or this\n\n05:33.500 --> 05:35.500\nWhich is 1999\n\n05:36.500 --> 05:38.500\nThe Prince definition\n\n05:40.500 --> 05:41.500\nAnd then this\n\n05:41.500 --> 05:44.500\nWhich is just, you know, Alvin\n\n05:44.500 --> 05:47.500\nThat's the Parliament funkadelic voice\n\n05:47.500 --> 05:48.500\nYeah\n\n05:48.500 --> 05:50.500\nWe're going to a planet of music\n\n05:50.500 --> 05:52.500\nSay atomic dodge\n\n05:52.500 --> 05:54.500\nI hope you bring some pussy\n\n05:55.500 --> 05:56.500\nIt ain't about that\n\n05:56.500 --> 05:57.500\nIt's about music\n\n05:57.500 --> 05:59.500\nWhat are you, gay?\n\n06:00.500 --> 06:02.500\nNo, I'm a human being\n\n06:02.500 --> 06:04.500\nSounds gay\n\n06:04.500 --> 06:06.500\nThen maybe all humans are gay\n\n06:06.500 --> 06:08.500\nMaybe we'd like to fuck music\n\n06:08.500 --> 06:11.500\nYou can do it somewhere else\n\n06:12.500 --> 06:14.500\nCause I'm straight\n\n06:15.500 --> 06:17.500\nBecause it's 1983\n\n06:17.500 --> 06:20.500\nAnd I'm not allowed to be gay\n\n06:23.500 --> 06:26.500\nResulting in quite a lot of\n\n06:26.500 --> 06:29.500\nfantastical costumes and hairstyles\n\n06:29.500 --> 06:32.500\nBecause when you put your thumb over a hose\n\n06:32.500 --> 06:34.500\nIt sprays everywhere\n\n06:37.500 --> 06:38.500\nOh, yeah\n\n06:38.500 --> 06:40.500\nYou're like, yeah\n\n06:40.500 --> 06:42.500\nYou're like the new Reggie Watts\n\n06:42.500 --> 06:43.500\nWhat's that?\n\n06:43.500 --> 06:45.500\nYou're like the new Reggie Watts, I think\n\n06:45.500 --> 06:47.500\nThis is the new show\n\n06:47.500 --> 06:49.500\nWhat does Reggie Watts do?\n\n06:49.500 --> 06:51.500\nHe's got a delay pedal, he's great\n\n06:51.500 --> 06:52.500\nOh, no!\n\n06:52.500 --> 06:54.500\nI was not the first person to think of using it comedically\n\n06:54.500 --> 06:55.500\nOh, no\n\n06:55.500 --> 06:57.500\nOh, honey\n\n06:57.500 --> 06:59.500\nOh, no\n\n07:00.500 --> 07:02.500\nWell, alright, I'll pull a rip card\n\n07:02.500 --> 07:04.500\nI have some ventriloquist dummies in the back\n\n07:04.500 --> 07:06.500\nI've got one that's on terrorists\n\n07:06.500 --> 07:07.500\nOh, they're not\n\n07:07.500 --> 07:09.500\nBut he's not too bright\n\n07:09.500 --> 07:11.500\nHe blows himself up\n\n07:11.500 --> 07:13.500\nI make fun of him\n\n07:14.500 --> 07:18.500\nSo, I hear we have one guest here\n\n07:18.500 --> 07:21.500\nWho wasn't here when we started the show\n\n07:21.500 --> 07:22.500\nOh, okay\n\n07:22.500 --> 07:23.500\nWell, alright\n\n07:23.500 --> 07:26.500\nWell, it's 9-11, so let's bring out Andy Dick\n\n07:26.500 --> 07:29.500\nWell, I don't think it's him, I think it's just Dino\n\n07:29.500 --> 07:32.500\nOh, alright, well, it's 9-11, so let's bring out Dino\n\n07:40.500 --> 07:42.500\nHappy 9-11!\n\n07:44.500 --> 07:49.500\nYeah, in remembrance, we're not going to point out when it becomes 9-11 tonight, I think\n\n07:49.500 --> 07:52.500\nTonight, it's all one big remembrance\n\n07:52.500 --> 07:54.500\nDid you see the clip that was circulating?\n\n07:54.500 --> 07:56.500\nThe guy on the Stairmaster?\n\n07:56.500 --> 07:57.500\nNo\n\n07:57.500 --> 08:04.500\nThere was a fireman wearing all his gear and did 157 steps or whatever they did on the Stairmaster\n\n08:04.500 --> 08:06.500\nI know, it's sad\n\n08:06.500 --> 08:10.500\nI love misguided sincerity, I love that\n\n08:10.500 --> 08:14.500\nI love it that that guy, I hope he was crying\n\n08:14.500 --> 08:17.500\nI'm not because I want to make fun of him, but I can't\n\n08:17.500 --> 08:19.500\nNo, he was sad\n\n08:19.500 --> 08:21.500\nI love that, I like that\n\n08:21.500 --> 08:29.500\nThere was a clip that was circulating from around 9-11 when, as the footage of the towers are falling\n\n08:29.500 --> 08:34.500\nand Donald Trump, who then was only a Pizza Hut spokesman and reality show host\n\n08:34.500 --> 08:39.500\nHe's just talking about, and he knows 9-11 is happening\n\n08:39.500 --> 08:45.500\nand he knows fully well, he's in a labyrinth of things to say wrong\n\n08:45.500 --> 08:53.500\nHe's just like, yeah, by the way, I'm over at a 60 Trump Boulevard or whatever\n\n08:53.500 --> 08:57.500\nwhich was the tallest building before the World Trade Center\n\n08:57.500 --> 09:02.500\nand then for a while it was the second tallest, but now it's the

It was all about you and your friends\n\n11:26.500 --> 11:28.500\nAnd how you keep in touch with people\n\n11:28.500 --> 11:33.500\nHe's such a, like I always, he was on Great Minds, the history

12:18.500\nHi everybody, say hi\n\n12:18.500 --> 12:21.500\nLook, oh, how sweet\n\n12:21.500 --> 12:23.500\nOh, grumpy cows\n\n12:23.500 --> 12:26.500\nGrumpy cows\n\n12:28.500 --> 12:32.500\nI think we were about to talk about, well, what I would like to talk about with Andy\n\n12:32.500 --> 12:37.500\nBecause I, I mean, it's easy enough to go like, oh, Andy, Andy's amazing\n\n12:37.500 --> 12:42.500\nLike, I think, you know, there's a little phase of your career where it's like, you know\n\n12:42.500 --> 12:46.500\nLike the clown prince or like, you know, people are going like, oh, Andy Dick\n\n12:46.500 --> 12:50.500\nAnd then you, like, there's an unspoken like, like, you know\n\n12:50.500 --> 12:51.500\nOh, him\n\n12:51.500 --> 12:55.500\nYeah, cautionary, you know, it's like, you were, I always looked at you as like, pan\n\n12:55.500 --> 12:57.500\nLike, from Greek mythology, like, you're a pan\n\n12:57.500 --> 12:59.500\nLike, where we, where we get the word panic\n\n12:59.500 --> 13:00.500\nSexy\n\n13:00.500 --> 13:05.500\nIt's like, like, half goat and he's got a flute and he like, comes down the mountain\n\n13:05.500 --> 13:09.500\nAnd causes fucking hysteria and craziness and like, like, for the sake of it\n\n13:09.500 --> 13:14.500\nAnd then either disappears or gets beat up by Wesley Snipes in a bathroom\n\n13:14.500 --> 13:17.500\nDid you, did you have an encounter with Wesley Snipes?\n\n13:17.500 --> 13:22.500\nOkay, yeah, all right, so, but, but, but\n\n13:22.500 --> 13:25.500\nCan I tell you what happened with that?\n\n13:25.500 --> 13:26.500\nI, but I think I know\n\n13:26.500 --> 13:27.500\nWell, I dropped the end bomb\n\n13:27.500 --> 13:28.500\nRight\n\n13:28.500 --> 13:29.500\nIt was, you know\n\n13:29.500 --> 13:33.500\nOh, that's bad, Andy\n\n13:33.500 --> 13:37.500\nThat's a no-no\n\n13:37.500 --> 13:41.500\nWe have a whole podcast, our whole podcast that just went up, sorry, I don't want to derail\n\n13:41.500 --> 13:47.500\nBut it's about how Andy read an article about how black people's eyes have been\n\n13:47.500 --> 13:50.500\nThey've been bred to have their eyes pop out\n\n13:50.500 --> 13:52.500\nWhen they're scared\n\n13:52.500 --> 13:54.500\nSo what, about, what?\n\n13:54.500 --> 13:57.500\nWell, that's, that's, okay\n\n13:57.500 --> 13:59.500\nLet's move along from that\n\n14:00.500 --> 14:02.500\nWas the article in Hustler?\n\n14:02.500 --> 14:05.500\nThere was no article, it was my philosophy\n\n14:05.500 --> 14:06.500\nWhat?\n\n14:06.500 --> 14:11.500\nOh, you didn't tell me that\n\n14:11.500 --> 14:13.500\nYou told me you read it somewhere\n\n14:13.500 --> 14:18.500\nBecause I was trying to get away from it\n\n14:18.500 --> 14:20.500\nAnd then we talked about\n\n14:20.500 --> 14:26.500\nThere's a whole group of black people that can, their eyes, they can just go thunk and their eyes pop out\n\n14:26.500 --> 14:30.500\nWhat do you, is that your, are you saying what if there was, is that your\n\n14:30.500 --> 14:32.500\nNo, there is\n\n14:32.500 --> 14:36.500\nYeah, a lot of black people can make\n\n14:36.500 --> 14:38.500\nIs there something wrong with it?\n\n14:38.500 --> 14:40.500\nAnd then I just thought that, I think\n\n14:40.500 --> 14:42.500\nWell, it's a road player, the phrase black people\n\n14:42.500 --> 14:48.500\nIt makes, it just makes people do what they should in traffic, which is like, no, they just go like, okay\n\n14:48.500 --> 14:52.500\nAnd do, do their feet also do their duty when they run?\n\n14:52.500 --> 14:56.500\nNo, come on, no, I'm serious then, and I don't like saying African American\n\n14:56.500 --> 14:58.500\nBecause they're not from Africa\n\n14:58.500 --> 15:00.500\nIt takes too much time, too\n\n15:00.500 --> 15:04.500\nBlack, I don't know, I'm white, they say white when I'm black\n\n15:04.500 --> 15:08.500\nI think black people's fine, it's not a magical phrase that makes people think you're a bad person\n\n15:08.500 --> 15:13.500\nI was just saying, like, it puts everybody, it puts millennials, they cover the break\n\n15:13.500 --> 15:18.500\nThey go like, okay, I'm, it's bumper to bumper, I'm gonna go 35 instead of 45\n\n15:18.500 --> 15:24.500\nThat's what, that, because they're, they've seen shit\n\n15:24.500 --> 15:28.500\nLike, they were born into it, like, they're not, it's not like\n\n15:28.500 --> 15:32.500\nLike, I think our generation goes like, what are these people, after all this time\n\n15:32.500 --> 15:36.500\nWhat are they so worried about and complaining about, it's like, they just got here\n\n15:36.500 --> 15:38.500\nAnd all they've seen is fucked up shit\n\n15:38.500 --> 15:43.500\nLike, we actually, like, kind of because we were, because we lived through no internet\n\n15:43.500 --> 15:48.500\nAnd then into internet, our perception as Gen Xers, whatever we are\n\n15:48.500 --> 15:55.500\nIs that, oh, everything was fine until everyone started talking about it\n\n15:55.500 --> 15:58.500\nThat's our, that's been like the fiber of our being\n\n15:58.500 --> 16:03.500\nAnd then the new generation is typified by just their relate, they just, they were born\n\n16:03.500 --> 16:08.500\nAnd they're like, mama, dad, internet, and the internet was like\n\n16:08.500 --> 16:12.500\nThe cops will shoot you if you're black, and they're like, why, what's that mean\n\n16:12.500 --> 16:16.500\nAnd they're like, you know, what, and then there's like, fuck you, libtard\n\n16:16.500 --> 16:18.500\nAnd they're like, what the fuck is happening\n\n16:18.500 --> 16:22.500\nThey get a fire hose of information to the face every day\n\n16:22.500 --> 16:25.500\nI mean, you're just saying people shouldn't listen to our podcast\n\n16:25.500 --> 16:26.500\nAnd I think you're right\n\n16:26.500 --> 16:27.500\nNo, I think it's good\n\n16:27.500 --> 16:34.500\nI'm trying to, I'm trying to, I'm trying to think more, I'm trying to think more laterally about it\n\n16:34.500 --> 16:37.500\nAnd just go, these are the things that make us different\n\n16:37.500 --> 16:40.500\nFor that reason, like we had Karen Kilgariff on last week\n\n16:40.500 --> 16:44.500\nAnd she, she hosts a true crime show\n\n16:44.500 --> 16:46.500\nAnd we talked about it, it's like, well true crime through a certain lens\n\n16:46.500 --> 16:49.500\nIt's like, it's totally insensitive and non-PC\n\n16:49.500 --> 16:52.500\nBecause you're like having fun talking about people getting killed and like blah blah blah\n\n16:52.500 --> 16:55.500\nBut it's like, it doesn't, there is no person out there that's like\n\n16:55.500 --> 16:58.500\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna figure out what's right and what's wrong\n\n16:58.500 --> 17:00.500\nIt's just like, when you look at people as a biomass\n\n17:00.500 --> 17:03.500\nAnd then they emanate like these weird things\n\n17:03.500 --> 17:06.500\nI'm sure everybody would be, would love to tune in and listen to you guys\n\n17:06.500 --> 17:09.500\nLike transgress a million thresholds a minute\n\n17:09.500 --> 17:12.500\nBecause it's not, it doesn't mean that they're bad people

But I did\n\n21:32.500 --> 21:34.500\nAnd there were these two ladies in front of me\n\n21:34.500 --> 21:36.500\nI have to tell you this real quick\n\n21:36.500 --> 21:38.500\nAnd these two ladies are in front of me\n\n21:38.500 --> 21:40.500\nAnd right when I walked in\n\n21:40.500 --> 21:42.500\nThe guy was like\n\n21:42.500 --> 21:44.500\nOh, no, not you\n\n21:44.500 --> 21:46.500\nOh, we know

talking, they were done\n\n22:02.500 --> 22:04.500\nThey were done ordering, done getting their stuff\n\n22:04.500 --> 22:06.500\nAnd they just kept talking about some bar they were going to\n\n22:06.500 --> 22:08.500\nAnd I was just patiently waiting\n\n22:08.500 --> 22:10.500\nI just really just want a cup of coffee\n\n22:10.500 --> 22:12.500\nBut I didn't say that, I was just standing there\n\n22:12.500 --> 22:14.500\nAnd then they left\n\n22:14.500 --> 22:16.500\nAnd then I said, yeah, I just want a cup of coffee\n\n22:16.500 --> 22:18.500\nWith cream\n\n22:18.500 --> 22:20.500\nAnd then he was talking\n\n22:20.500 --> 22:22.500\nAnd ignoring me\n\n22:22.500 --> 22:24.500\nKind of put the coffee mug over here\n\n22:24.500 --> 22:26.500\nAnd he didn't start up the coffee\n\n22:26.500 --> 22:28.500\nThere's a thing, it's this one on Kowango\n\n22:28.500 --> 22:30.500\nWhere it's a drip thing and you press a button\n\n22:30.500 --> 22:32.500\nAnd then I was waiting\n\n22:32.500 --> 22:34.500\nI think that's every street coffee works like that\n\n22:34.500 --> 22:36.500\nAnd it felt like five minutes\n\n22:36.500 --> 22:38.500\nAnd I said, so does it just happen\n\n22:38.500 --> 22:40.500\nThe coffee\n\n22:40.500 --> 22:42.500\nThe mug isn't even\n\n22:42.500 --> 22:44.500\nAnd he went, oh yeah, you wanted coffee\n\n22:46.500 --> 22:48.500\nAt the coffee place\n\n22:48.500 --> 22:50.500\nAnd so he took the mug and put it under the thing\n\n22:50.500 --> 22:52.500\nAnd then started pressing buttons\n\n22:52.500 --> 22:54.500\nWere you just not\n\n22:54.500 --> 22:56.500\nGonna make it\n\n22:58.500 --> 23:00.500\nAnd then this guy came in\n\n23:00.500 --> 23:02.500\nImmediately after\n\n23:02.500 --> 23:04.500\nAnd then the guy said, oh\n\n23:04.500 --> 23:06.500\nAre you guys closed or something\n\n23:06.500 --> 23:08.500\nAnd he said, yes\n\n23:08.500 --> 23:10.500\nAnd we're just doing illicit deals right now\n\n23:10.500 --> 23:12.500\nAnd I went, no, no\n\n23:12.500 --> 23:14.500\nI'm just getting a cup of coffee\n\n23:14.500 --> 23:16.500\nI'm pretty sure they're open\n\n23:16.500 --> 23:18.500\nJust getting a cup of coffee\n\n23:18.500 --> 23:20.500\nI was getting like\n\n23:20.500 --> 23:22.500\nThis is what happened, this has never happened before\n\n23:22.500 --> 23:24.500\nBecause usually I just take it\n\n23:24.500 --> 23:26.500\nYou said fixed skin and it's true\n\n23:26.500 --> 23:28.500\nAnd I just take it and I take it\n\n23:28.500 --> 23:30.500\nAnd I snapped last night\n\n23:30.500 --> 23:32.500\nYou guys would have been so proud of me\n\n23:32.500 --> 23:34.500\nI fucking said no one was there\n\n23:34.500 --> 23:36.500\nI don't know if you know what pride is\n\n23:36.500 --> 23:38.500\nNo one was there\n\n23:38.500 --> 23:40.500\nHe left\n\n23:40.500 --> 23:42.500\nAnd then he started\n\n23:42.500 --> 23:44.500\nRemaking my coffee and doing my coffee\n\n23:44.500 --> 23:46.500\nAnd I said\n\n23:46.500 --> 23:48.500\nSomething, he said one more comment\n\n23:48.500 --> 23:50.500\nYou know, you're that guy\n\n23:50.500 --> 23:52.500\nAnd I said\n\n23:52.500 --> 23:54.500\nSomething to the effect of, well\n\n23:54.500 --> 23:56.500\nSometimes I'm just a guy that just wants a cup of coffee\n\n23:56.500 --> 23:58.500\nBut thanks\n\n23:58.500 --> 24:00.500\nI get it because it's the life I created\n\n24:00.500 --> 24:02.500\nAnd you're in good company\n\n24:02.500 --> 24:04.500\nBecause everybody makes fun of me\n\n24:04.500 --> 24:06.500\nLetterman,

idiot\n\n24:12.500 --> 24:14.500\nI'm an idiot, I'm an idiot\n\n24:14.500 --> 24:16.500\nActually, can I tell you something\n\n24:16.500 --> 24:18.500\nIt's kind of a serious thing\n\n24:18.500 --> 24:20.500\nYou know what it is like\n\n24:20.500 --> 24:22.500\nJust to point it out\n\n24:22.500 --> 24:24.500\nIf I came in with crutches\n\n24:24.500 --> 24:26.500\nAnd I was like a cripple\n\n24:26.500 --> 24:28.500\nAnd you said, hey, sorry, we don't have a ramp for you\n\n24:28.500 --> 24:30.500\nGimpo the clown\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:32.500\nIt's kind of like that, but I'm okay\n\n24:32.500 --> 24:34.500\nI'm just saying, watch yourself for other people\n\n24:34.500 --> 24:36.500\nThat might not be okay with it\n\n24:36.500 --> 24:38.500\nBut I'm perfectly fine with it\n\n24:38.500 --> 24:40.500\nBut just be careful\n\n24:40.500 --> 24:42.500\nBecause some people might snap\n\n24:42.500 --> 24:44.500\nHe's like, no, I didn't mean it like that at all\n\n24:44.500 --> 24:46.500\nAnd I went, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\n\n24:46.500 --> 24:48.500\nNo, you said right when I walked in\n\n24:48.500 --> 24:50.500\nYou said, whoa, we know you, not you\n\n24:50.500 --> 24:52.500\nWhat does that mean? No, I\n\n24:52.500 --> 24:54.500\nI don't even know that part about you\n\n24:54.500 --> 24:56.500\nLike what, that I'm a big drug addict\n\n24:56.500 --> 24:58.500\nAlcoholic, he's like\n\n24:58.500 --> 25:00.500\nThat's what I said, he said\n\n25:00.500 --> 25:02.500\nYeah, no, I just know, you know, you're a celebrity\n\n25:02.500 --> 25:04.500\nAnd I smell bullshit\n\n25:04.500 --> 25:06.500\nAnd I'm like, oh, okay\n\n25:06.500 --> 25:08.500\nThen what's your favorite thing I've ever done?\n\n25:08.500 --> 25:10.500\nHe said, well, I don't know\n\n25:10.500 --> 25:12.500\nHe said, I don't know\n\n25:12.500 --> 25:14.500\nI don't really know what you do\n\n25:14.500 --> 25:16.500\nI mean, that's my point, you know me from being a fucking moron\n\n25:16.500 --> 25:18.500\nI admit it, I admit\n\n25:18.500 --> 25:20.500\nAnd then that's what you were doing\n\n25:20.500 --> 25:22.500\nYou were kind of going with the fucking flow\n\n25:22.500 --> 25:24.500\nAnd making fun of me in front of those people\n\n25:24.500 --> 25:26.500\nAnd then the next guy comes in, oh no, we're just doing an illicit deal\n\n25:26.500 --> 25:28.500\nYou're talking about drugs, right?\n\n25:28.500 --> 25:30.500\nAnd so you're lying and fuck you\n\n25:32.500 --> 25:34.500\nOh my god, I am so proud of you\n\n25:34.500 --> 25:36.500\nI am proud of you, I'm very proud of you\n\n25:38.500 --> 25:40.500\nI normally am not like that\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:42.500\nI feel responsible\n\n25:42.500 --> 25:44.500\nNobody, I rise to feel proud\n\n25:44.500 --> 25:46.500\nBecause I never stick up for myself like that\n\n25:46.500 --> 25:48.500\nAnd I said, fuck you\n\n25:48.500 --> 25:50.500\nBut by the end, we had made up\n\n25:50.500 --> 25:52.500\nAnd I was, his dad's an alcoholic\n\n25:54.500 --> 25:56.500\nAnd I understood where I was coming from\n\n25:56.500 --> 25:58.500\nAnd then I was crying and I'm like, now I'm an asshole\n\n25:58.500 --> 26:00.500\nWait, this continued and he started apologizing\n\n26:00.500 --> 26:02.500\nAnd broke down because he's an alcoholic\n\n26:02.500 --> 26:04.500\nYes, and we both had a\n\n26:04.500 --> 26:06.500\nIt was a cathartic thing\n\n26:06.500 --> 26:08.500\nAnd I said, you know what, can I be honest with you\n\n26:08.500 --> 26:10.500\nYou helped me so much right now\n\n26:10.500 --> 26:12.500\nThat you were just like this opening\n\n26:12.500 --> 26:14.500\nFor me to, I guess I carry that\n\n26:14.500 --> 26:16.500\nWith me everywhere I fucking go\n\n26:16.500 --> 26:18.500\nAnd I don't have thick skin, I guess\n\n26:18.500 --> 26:20.500\nAnd when people make fun of me\n\n26:20.500 --> 26:22.500\nI'm just getting smaller and smaller\n\n26:22.500 --> 26:24.500\nAnd sadder and sadder\n\n26:24.500 --> 26:26.500\nThat's what I was going to talk about\n\n26:26.500 --> 26:28.500\nBecause through one lens, you're like\n\n26:28.500 --> 26:30.500\nYou're like this Pokemon\n\n26:30.500 --> 26:32.500\nThat like, you\n\n26:34.500 --> 26:36.500\nYou have some quirky name\n\n26:36.500 --> 26:38.500\nAnd you curl up into a ball\n\n26:38.500 --> 26:40.500\nAnd your exploits are like\n\n26:40.500 --> 26:42.500\nWell, it's not like\n\n26:42.500 --> 26:44.500\nYou're a rude\n\n26:44.500 --> 26:46.500\nThe self-destruction is always\n\n26:46.500 --> 26:48.500\nHigher than the rudeness\n\n26:48.500 --> 26:50.500\nWhich I think kind of equates to like\n\n26:50.500 --> 26:52.500\nIt's like, oh, thick skin\n\n26:52.500 --> 26:54.500\nAnd he's fine\n\n26:54.500 --> 26:56.500\nHe's an equal opportunity offender\n\n26:56.500 --> 26:58.500\nAnd he puts himself at the top of the list\n\n26:58.500 --> 27:00.500\nBecause he ends up being like\n\n27:00.500 --> 27:02.500\nThrone out of every bar and blah blah blah\n\n27:02.500 --> 27:04.500\nThis is when you're off the wagon\n\n27:04.500 --> 27:06.500\nLike me out\n\n27:06.500 --> 27:08.500\nYeah, that's a Pokemon\n\n27:08.500 --> 27:10.500\nIs that what a Pokemon? Yeah, yeah\n\n27:10.500 --> 27:12.500\nYou guys know how to talk to your crowd\n\n27:12.500 --> 27:14.500\nBut on the other hand\n\n27:14.500 --> 27:16.500\nThey're me, man\n\n27:16.500 --> 27:18.500\nOn the other hand, I've never met anybody\n\n27:18.500 --> 27:20.500\nI think I'm not exaggerating when I say this\n\n27:20.500 --> 27:22.500\nI'm trying to think\n\n27:22.500 --> 27:24.500\nIt's hard to think up here\n\n27:24.500 --> 27:26.500\nBut I think\n\n27:26.500 --> 27:28.500\nI've never met anybody with\n\n27:28.500 --> 27:30.500\nYour particularly\n\n27:30.500 --> 27:32.500\nSensitive whisker\n\n27:32.500 --> 27:34.500\nAbout\n\n27:38.500 --> 27:40.500\nYou can go\n\n27:40.500 --> 27:42.500\nFrom such a high\n\n27:42.500 --> 27:44.500\nAnd I'm not talking about\n\n27:44.500 --> 27:46.500\nOn the wagon and just you\n\n27:46.500 --> 27:48.500\nI'm not talking about\n\n27:48.500 --> 27:50.500\nYou can go from such a high mood\n\n27:50.500 --> 27:52.500\nAnd you're funny\n\n27:52.500 --> 27:54.500\nAnd you're having a good time\n\n27:54.500 --> 27:56.500\nAnd then it seems like a bit at first\n\n27:56.500 --> 27:58.500\nBut you can take this roller coaster\n\n27:58.500 --> 28:00.500\nPlunge and it really is tied\n\n28:00.500 --> 28:02.500\nTo like\n\n28:02.500 --> 28:04.500\nIt's the most absurdly\n\n28:04.500 --> 28:06.500\nMicroscopic mention\n\n28:06.500 --> 28:08.500\nOf someone\n\n28:08.500 --> 28:10.500\nLiking someone else\n\n28:10.500 --> 28:12.500\nAny kind of girls\n\n28:12.500 --> 28:14.500\nWe could be hanging out on a porch\n\n28:14.500 --> 28:16.500\nAnd the one is so beautiful\n\n28:16.500 --> 28:18.500\nAnd you could be cracking me up\n\n28:18.500 --> 28:20.500\nWith your stories\n\n28:20.500 --> 28:22.500\nJust being funny and cool\n\n28:22.500 --> 28:24.500\nAnd then like\n\n28:24.500 --> 28:26.500\nWe're both thinking the same thing\n\n28:26.500 --> 28:28.500\nOn the set of Great Minds\n\n28:28.500 --> 28:30.500\nThat's happened before with you and me\n\n28:30.500 --> 28:32.500\nWhere it's like oh that cloud is shaped\n\n28:32.500 --> 28:34.500\nLike Paul Rudd\n\n28:34.500 --> 28:36.500\nI love Paul Rudd\n\n28:36.500 --> 28:38.500\nI'm going to get another lemonade\n\n28:38.500 --> 28:40.500\nI don't know why didn't she get Paul Rudd\n\n28:40.500 --> 28:42.500\nAnother lemonade\n\n28:42.500 --> 28:44.500\nAnd it always seems like a bit\n\n28:44.500 --> 28:46.500\nAnd then bring back the lemonade\n\n28:46.500 --> 28:48.500\nAnd it's just like this is good\n\n28:48.500 --> 28:50.500\nYou're so nice, thank you\n\n28:50.500 --> 28:52.500\nAnd really hanging out with you\n\n28:52.500 --> 28:54.500\nWhat is it with Paul Rudd\n\n28:54.500 --> 28:56.500\nIt's like Jesus Andy\n\n28:56.500 --> 28:58.500\nThat Paul Rudd thing never happened\n\n28:58.500 --> 29:00.500\nBut it did happen\n\n29:00.500 --> 29:02.500\nWith Nick Kroll\n\n29:02.500 --> 29:04.500\nI mentioned\n\n29:04.500 --> 29:06.500\nNick Kroll on the set of Great Minds\n\n29:06.500 --> 29:08.500\nIt was like he has a show you guys probably know\n\n29:08.500 --> 29:10.500\nThat Great Minds show\n\n29:10.500 --> 29:12.500\nNick had I guess just done it\n\n29:12.500 --> 29:14.500\nAnd did a great job\n\n29:14.500 --> 29:16.500\nI was bringing it up\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:18.500\nHe wouldn't shut up about\n\n29:18.500 --> 29:20.500\nHow great he was\n\n29:20.500 --> 29:22.500\nBut he was trying to compliment you when he brought it up\n\n29:22.500 --> 29:24.500\nHe was just talking about how great Nick did\n\n29:24.500 --> 29:26.500\nSee\n\n29:26.500 --> 29:28.500\nI just had done it that day\n\n29:28.500 --> 29:30.500\nWhere I was leaving\n\n29:30.500 --> 29:32.500\nHe didn't say and you did real good today\n\n29:32.500 --> 29:34.500\nHe didn't even have that part in there\n\n29:34.500 --> 29:36.500\nAll about Nick\n\n29:36.500 --> 29:38.500\nWhat about me\n\n29:38.500 --> 29:40.500\nListen\n\n29:40.500 --> 29:42.500\nI brought it up because it was\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:44.500\nConnecting the dot\n\n29:44.500 --> 29:46.500\nI haven't had this much fun since\n\n29:46.500 --> 29:48.500\nNick Kroll was on it or something like that\n\n29:48.500 --> 29:50.500\nI didn't hear that part\n\n29:50.500 --> 29:52.500\nI really didn't\n\n29:52.500 --> 29:54.500\nI'm so sorry\n\n29:54.500 --> 29:56.500\nYou heard haven't had fun\n\n29:56.500 --> 29:58.500\nNick Kroll\n\n29:58.500 --> 30:00.500\nAnd think about\n\n30:00.500 --> 30:02.500\nThat kind of weird monster\n\n30:02.500 --> 30:04.500\nI must be through your eyes\n\n30:04.500 --> 30:06.500\nIf you think it's possible that you'd be\n\n30:06.500 --> 30:08.500\nShitting the bed and in order to cope with it\n\n30:08.500 --> 30:10.500\nI'd be like I love Nick Kroll\n\n30:10.500 --> 30:12.500\nHe never shits the bed\n\n30:12.500 --> 30:14.500\nIt was worse than that\n\n30:14.500 --> 30:16.500\nIn my mind I honestly thought\n\n30:16.500 --> 30:18.500\nYou were trying to take me out\n\n30:18.500 --> 30:20.500\nNever trust your mind\n\n30:20.500 --> 30:22.500\nIt's insane\n\n30:22.500 --> 30:24.500\nIt has historically steered you wrong\n\n30:26.500 --> 30:28.500\nI think I had to\n\n30:28.500 --> 30:30.500\nCall you and say I think he's\n\n30:30.500 --> 30:32.500\nFucking with me\n\n30:32.500 --> 30:34.500\nI doubt it\n\n30:34.500 --> 30:36.500\nHe's too lazy\n\n30:36.500 --> 30:38.500\nHe doesn't like confrontation at all\n\n30:38.500 --> 30:40.500\nFucking with someone\n\n30:40.500 --> 30:42.500\nSeriously I really did\n\n30:42.500 --> 30:44.500\nI'm not lying\n\n30:44.500 --> 30:46.500\nI thought he was fucking with me and I thought\n\n30:46.500 --> 30:48.500\nHe was being mean\n\n30:48.500 --> 30:50.500\nSo embarrassing\n\n30:50.500 --> 30:52.500\nBut let's talk about that\n\n30:52.500 --> 30:54.500\nBecause I'm sure there's a lot of people listening\n\n30:54.500 --> 30:56.500\nThe coffee guy maybe\n\n30:56.500 --> 30:58.500\nHe was serious\n\n30:58.500 --> 31:00.500\nI think people who are ultra sensitive\n\n31:00.500 --> 31:02.500\nportray themselves as not sensitive at all\n\n31:02.500 --> 31:04.500\nAnd that's what you go out and you do\n\n31:04.500 --> 31:06.500\nIt's almost like cutting or something\n\n31:06.500 --> 31:08.500\nYou develop like this\n\n31:08.500 --> 31:10.500\nBecause you know how fucking risky\n\n31:10.500 --> 31:12.500\nThe world is, yes\n\n31:12.500 --> 31:14.500\nThat's what I want to talk about\n\n31:14.500 --> 31:16.500\nBecause I can relate\n\n31:16.500 --> 31:18.500\nOh my god, this world could fucking\n\n31:18.500 --> 31:20.500\nUndo me\n\n31:20.500 --> 31:22.500\nNothing\n\n31:22.500 --> 31:24.500\nBut that took a certain\n\n31:26.500 --> 31:28.500\nFace on the playground\n\n31:28.500 --> 31:30.500\nWe developed these\n\n31:30.500 --> 31:32.500\nReally specific numbnesses\n\n31:32.500 --> 31:34.500\nPeople that gravitate\n\n31:34.500 --> 31:36.500\nTowards microphones and cameras and things\n\n31:36.500 --> 31:38.500\nIt's like this weird\n\n31:38.500 --> 31:40.500\nInversion where you\n\n31:40.500 --> 31:42.500\nCallous yourself over\n\n31:42.500 --> 31:44.500\nIn all of the places that normal\n\n31:44.500 --> 31:46.500\nPeople would be sensitive\n\n31:46.500 --> 31:48.500\nBecause you just\n\n31:48.500 --> 31:50.500\nDevelop that cow catcher on the front of your train\n\n31:50.500 --> 31:52.500\nYou're just like, okay, that's the spot\n\n31:52.500 --> 31:54.500\nWhere there's gonna be impact\n\n31:54.500 --> 31:56.500\nAnd then ironically, you put so much\n\n31:56.500 --> 31:58.500\nEnergy into that, you have these\n\n31:58.500 --> 32:00.500\nIt's like if Batman just had naked\n\n32:00.500 --> 32:02.500\nFlesh\n\n32:02.500 --> 32:04.500\nHere but had like a bulletproof\n\n32:04.500 --> 32:06.500\nTitanium thing and it was just like\n\n32:06.500 --> 32:08.500\nNaked, you could see his ribs and his acne here\n\n32:10.500 --> 32:12.500\nEverybody was just like, get him like that\n\n32:12.500 --> 32:14.500\nAnd he was like, oh god damn it\n\n32:14.500 --> 32:16.500\nI should quit being Batman\n\n32:16.500 --> 32:18.500\nI'm fascinated\n\n32:18.500 --> 32:20.500\nBy these cow catchers on trains\n\n32:20.500 --> 32:22.500\nThey really have those?\n\n32:22.500 --> 32:24.500\nThey catch cows\n\n32:24.500 --> 32:26.500\nSwooping metal things\n\n32:26.500 --> 32:28.500\nTo catch cows? No, to get them along\n\n32:28.500 --> 32:30.500\nOh, that's not a hurt\n\n32:30.500 --> 32:32.500\nAnd then the cow probably dies\n\n32:32.500 --> 32:34.500\nOh, it dies? It saves the train\n\n32:34.500 --> 32:40.500\nOh that's nice, it's good\n\n32:42.500 --> 32:44.500\nDo you think that\n\n32:44.500 --> 32:46.500\nTrains aren't endangered species\n\n32:46.500 --> 32:48.500\nDo you think that you project things\n\n32:48.500 --> 32:50.500\nThat aren't there or do you think\n\n32:50.500 --> 32:52.500\nYou're like, is it about\n\n32:52.500 --> 32:54.500\nLike I characterize it as a cat whisker\n\n32:54.500 --> 32:56.500\nMe? No, my thing happened\n\n32:56.500 --> 32:58.500\nI've been thinking about this recently\n\n32:58.500 --> 33:00.500\nIt went all the way back\n\n33:00.500 --> 33:02.500\nIt's happening again, but this time\n\n33:02.500 --> 33:04.500\nI think I know what to do\n\n33:04.500 --> 33:06.500\nAnd how to handle it\n\n33:06.500 --> 33:08.500\nFirst of all, I'm 50\n\n33:08.500 --> 33:10.500\nAnd I've been through it a bunch\n\n33:10.500 --> 33:12.500\nBut what happened is\n\n33:12.500 --> 33:14.500\nWe did the Ben Stiller show\n\n33:14.500 --> 33:16.500\nI can't believe you're 50\n\n33:16.500 --> 33:18.500\nYou seem like 6\n\n33:18.500 --> 33:20.500\nA lot of 50 year olds do that\n\n33:20.500 --> 33:22.500\nThat's the new thing\n\n33:22.500 --> 33:24.500\nThen\n\n33:24.500 --> 33:26.500\nI just catapulted out of there\n\n33:26.500 --> 33:28.500\nOn to news radio\n\n33:28.500 --> 33:30.500\nAnd I played this\n\n33:30.500 --> 33:32.500\nI remember the audition for news radio\n\n33:32.500 --> 33:34.500\nPaul Sims had me come in and read\n\n33:34.500 --> 33:36.500\nFor the network and everybody\n\n33:36.500 --> 33:38.500\nAnd the writers and I did it\n\n33:38.500 --> 33:40.500\nAnd I guess I fell flat\n\n33:40.500 --> 33:42.500\nBut before the audition\n\n33:42.500 --> 33:44.500\nIn the room I was talking like this\n\n33:44.500 --> 33:46.500\nThis is going to be fun\n\n33:46.500 --> 33:48.500\nThis is going to be fun\n\n33:48.500 --> 33:50.500\nPhil Hartman and Dave Foley\n\n33:50.500 --> 33:52.500\nAnd this is going to be wild\n\n33:52.500 --> 33:54.500\nSo anyways, I'm going to do my audition\n\n33:54.500 --> 33:56.500\nBlah, blah, blah, blah, blah\n\n33:56.500 --> 33:58.500\nWhatever you guys need from me\n\n33:58.500 --> 34:00.500\nDisappointed with my audition\n\n34:00.500 --> 34:02.500\nAnd Paul said, can I tell you something\n\n34:02.500 --> 34:04.500\nDid you see how he was before the audition\n\n34:04.500 --> 34:06.500\nBefore he started reading the part\n\n34:06.500 --> 34:08.500\nAnd after, that's how he's going to be\n\n34:08.500 --> 34:10.500\nSo we're going to write for him\n\n34:10.500 --> 34:12.500\nAnd then that's what they did\n\n34:12.500 --> 34:14.500\nAnd I became this kind of like\n\n34:14.500 --> 34:16.500\nWarm and fuzzy character that people on the street\n\n34:16.500 --> 34:18.500\nAlways wanted to just touch\n\n34:18.500 --> 34:20.500\nAnd hug and all that\n\n34:20.500 --> 34:22.500\nBut I wasn't always that person\n\n34:22.500 --> 34:24.500\nAnd so I built up this thing\n\n34:24.500 --> 34:26.500\nYeah, I really did\n\n34:26.500 --> 34:28.500\nFull force into drugs and alcohol\n\n34:28.500 --> 34:30.500\nAnd I started like a punk band\n\n34:30.500 --> 34:34.500\nAnd I made another persona\n\n34:34.500 --> 34:36.500\nThat that one I can't shake now\n\n34:36.500 --> 34:38.500\nI always felt like\n\n34:38.500 --> 34:40.500\nAnd when I say something like I always felt\n\n34:40.500 --> 34:42.500\nI'm not qualified\n\n34:42.500 --> 34:44.500\nOne of the things that I love about you\n\n34:44.500 --> 34:46.500\nIs that you don't punish people like me\n\n34:46.500 --> 34:48.500\nFor just speculating\n\n34:48.500 --> 34:50.500\nLike I get\n\n34:50.500 --> 34:52.500\nBack in the 90s\n\n34:52.500 --> 34:54.500\nI would get mad at people\n\n34:54.500 --> 34:56.500\nTalking about you\n\n34:56.500 --> 34:58.500\nBecause I would be like\n\n34:58.500 --> 35:00.500\nBecause I have my own issues\n\n35:00.500 --> 35:02.500\nAnd the whole\n\n35:02.500 --> 35:04.500\nYou have a problem with substances\n\n35:04.500 --> 35:06.500\nI just don't like the way normie norms handle it\n\n35:06.500 --> 35:08.500\nAnd I don't indulge in that stuff\n\n35:08.500 --> 35:10.500\nIn spite of the fact that I think\n\n35:10.500 --> 35:12.500\nNow I'm 43, you're 50\n\n35:12.500 --> 35:14.500\nI've had enough\n\n35:14.500 --> 35:16.500\nDrinks with you\n\n35:16.500 --> 35:18.500\nI've seen enough to think\n\n35:18.500 --> 35:20.500\nI think it's a great idea for you to be sober\n\n35:20.500 --> 35:22.500\nLike I really do\n\n35:22.500 --> 35:24.500\nWhy am I here?\n\n35:24.500 --> 35:26.500\nI was planning my next relapse\n\n35:26.500 --> 35:28.500\nIt's been almost two years\n\n35:28.500 --> 35:30.500\nWhich is fucking amazing\n\n35:30.500 --> 35:32.500\nNo, it's not enough\n\n35:32.500 --> 35:34.500\nNot enough\n\n35:34.500 --> 35:36.500\nDon't applaud two years\n\n35:36.500 --> 35:38.500\nGod damn it\n\n35:38.500 --> 35:40.500\nIt's not an accomplishment\n\n35:40.500 --> 35:42.500\nPeople\n\n35:42.500 --> 35:44.500\nIt is though\n\n35:44.500 --> 35:46.500\nBecause you were on and off\n\n35:46.500 --> 35:48.500\nLike a goddamn yo-yo\n\n35:48.500 --> 35:50.500\nI'm gonna drink again\n\n35:50.500 --> 35:52.500\nNo, shut up\n\n35:52.500 --> 35:54.500\nWhy?\n\n35:54.500 --> 35:56.500\nIt's a nightmare\n\n35:56.500 --> 35:58.500\nI can't ever again\n\n35:58.500 --> 36:00.500\nI can't even comprehend that\n\n36:00.500 --> 36:02.500\nDid you have a timer set on your phone\n\n36:02.500 --> 36:04.500\nThat's now in that guy's hands\n\n36:04.500 --> 36:06.500\nWas that it?\n\n36:06.500 --> 36:08.500\nI have an app that tells me how much time I have\n\n36:08.500 --> 36:10.500\nAre we still good?\n\n36:10.500 --> 36:12.500\nWe're not cutting into that, right?\n\n36:12.500 --> 36:14.500\nBecause I know you have somewhere to be after this\n\n36:14.500 --> 36:16.500\nOh, you're right\n\n36:16.500 --> 36:18.500\nI have another show\n\n36:18.500 --> 36:20.500\nWhen he's gonna stop drinking\n\n36:20.500 --> 36:22.500\nDelete that\n\n36:22.500 --> 36:24.500\nCan I be honest with you, this is far more important\n\n36:24.500 --> 36:26.500\nI just want you to be doing what you want to do\n\n36:26.500 --> 36:28.500\nWith all the information you can have\n\n36:28.500 --> 36:30.500\nSo here's the question\n\n36:30.500 --> 36:32.500\nI want to ask you\n\n36:32.500 --> 36:34.500\nKeep going\n\n36:34.500 --> 36:36.500\nI've seen your relationship\n\n36:36.500 --> 36:38.500\nWith our medicine\n\n36:38.500 --> 36:40.500\nI've seen your relationship with our\n\n36:40.500 --> 36:42.500\nWait, are you talking about drugs and alcohol\n\n36:42.500 --> 36:44.500\nIs our medicine? It really is\n\n36:44.500 --> 36:46.500\nIf I didn't have drugs and alcohol\n\n36:46.500 --> 36:48.500\nFor 30 years, I started drinking when I was 14\n\n36:48.500 --> 36:50.500\nSo it's been like 30 or more years\n\n36:50.500 --> 36:52.500\nI would have killed myself\n\n36:52.500 --> 36:54.500\nI'm sorry, I really would have killed myself\n\n36:54.500 --> 36:56.500\nOr I would have been prescribed something\n\n36:56.500 --> 36:58.500\nMaybe that would have worked, maybe\n\n36:58.500 --> 37:00.500\nI don't know, I never did any of those\n\n37:00.500 --> 37:02.500\nBut drugs and alcohol work for me and I love them\n\n37:02.500 --> 37:04.500\nBut the other\n\n37:04.500 --> 37:06.500\nBut the other\n\n37:06.500 --> 37:08.500\nThe other thing that works for you\n\n37:08.500 --> 37:10.500\nThe other thing that works for you is\n\n37:10.500 --> 37:12.500\nAttention\n\n37:12.500 --> 37:14.500\nThis does take the place of that\n\n37:14.500 --> 37:16.500\nWhen we were hanging out\n\n37:16.500 --> 37:18.500\nWe were doing that Comedy Central thing\n\n37:18.500 --> 37:20.500\nHe was creating a show for me\n\n37:20.500 --> 37:22.500\nHe was creating the new Andy Dick show\n\n37:22.500 --> 37:24.500\nFor me\n\n37:24.500 --> 37:26.500\nAnd then, I don't know, things got a little hairy\n\n37:26.500 --> 37:28.500\nI don't know what happened\n\n37:28.500 --> 37:30.500\nI remember just having a bunch of fun\n\n37:30.500 --> 37:32.500\nDoing a lot of coke\n\n37:32.500 --> 37:34.500\nRobin Williams was hanging out with us\n\n37:34.500 --> 37:36.500\nWe were having fun, then he's like, I'm out\n\n37:36.500 --> 37:38.500\nAnd then I see communities\n\n37:38.500 --> 37:40.500\nCreated by Dan Harmon\n\n37:40.500 --> 37:42.500\nNo, it did, all of a sudden\n\n37:42.500 --> 37:44.500\nListen one more time\n\n37:44.500 --> 37:46.500\nHe just left\n\n37:46.500 --> 37:48.500\nTo do his funny little show\n\n37:48.500 --> 37:50.500\nThat you guys all love\n\n37:50.500 --> 37:52.500\nAnd then left me high and dry\n\n37:52.500 --> 37:54.500\nIn the middle of a drink\n\n37:54.500 --> 37:56.500\nAnd then all of a sudden he's gone\n\n37:56.500 --> 37:58.500\nNo, there was a lot of shit that happened\n\n37:58.500 --> 38:00.500\nIn the middle of that drink\n\n38:00.500 --> 38:02.500\nWell, I don't remember that stuff\n\n38:02.500 --> 38:04.500\nI'm proud of that\n\n38:04.500 --> 38:06.500\nI'm not mad about it\n\n38:06.500 --> 38:08.500\nBecause I would have left me\n\n38:08.500 --> 38:10.500\nI wouldn't have even started\n\n38:10.500 --> 38:12.500\nI can't believe you Comedy Central\n\n38:12.500 --> 38:14.500\nLooked at the outline that we turned in\n\n38:14.500 --> 38:16.500\nAnd said, I know this is going to be a stereotype\n\n38:16.500 --> 38:18.500\nBecause we bought that show\n\n38:18.500 --> 38:20.500\nAnd now we don't want it\n\n38:20.500 --> 38:22.500\nAnd I was like, what?\n\n38:22.500 --> 38:24.500\nIt was Comedy Central\n\n38:24.500 --> 38:26.500\nSo you didn't leave\n\n38:26.500 --> 38:28.500\nNo, I didn't leave\n\n38:28.500 --> 38:30.500\nBut I want to make sure\n\n38:30.500 --> 38:32.500\nBecause I want to know\n\n38:32.500 --> 38:34.500\nSo I should watch communities\n\n38:34.500 --> 38:36.500\nYou draw in your head\n\n38:36.500 --> 38:38.500\nJust watch your episode\n\n38:38.500 --> 38:40.500\nI'm in it\n\n38:40.500 --> 38:42.500\nI thought he was fucking with me\n\n38:42.500 --> 38:44.500\nWith that\n\n38:44.500 --> 38:46.500\nBecause they were like, listen\n\n38:46.500 --> 38:48.500\nI wrote you in community\n\n38:48.500 --> 38:50.500\nAnd I'm like, great, and you're doing this\n\n38:50.500 --> 38:52.500\nIs it a big part? No\n\n38:52.500 --> 38:54.500\nIs it a big part?\n\n38:54.500 --> 38:56.500\nBut you do a scene with Chevy Chase\n\n38:56.500 --> 38:58.500\nAnd I'm like, fuck yeah\n\n38:58.500 --> 39:00.500\nI love the guy really, and I know\n\n39:00.500 --> 39:02.500\nAll your thing with him\n\n39:02.500 --> 39:04.500\nI fucking love him\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:06.500\nBecause he's the original\n\n39:06.500 --> 39:08.500\nI know you\n\n39:08.500 --> 39:10.500\nHe was\n\n39:10.500 --> 39:12.500\nAnd this one you must have been fucking with me\n\n39:12.500 --> 39:14.500\nBecause I get to the set\n\n39:14.500 --> 39:16.500\nSo my scene\n\n39:16.500 --> 39:18.500\nI see is with Chevy Chase\n\n39:18.500 --> 39:20.500\nMaybe we should meet up\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:22.500\nWe can talk about the scene\n\n39:22.500 --> 39:24.500\nHe's not here, what yet\n\n39:24.500 --> 39:26.500\nHe's not going to be here\n\n39:26.500 --> 39:28.500\nYou're going to be doing it on a green screen\n\n39:28.500 --> 39:30.500\nDid you look at the script\n\n39:30.500 --> 39:32.500\nWe're putting you on a green screen\n\n39:32.500 --> 39:34.500\nAnd we're going to shrink you down\n\n39:34.500 --> 39:36.500\nChevy Chase's shoulder\n\n39:36.500 --> 39:38.500\nSo talk about a big part\n\n39:38.500 --> 39:40.500\nI was this fucking big\n\n39:40.500 --> 39:42.500\nAnd there wasn't even a cardboard\n\n39:42.500 --> 39:44.500\nCut out of Chevy Chase to act with\n\n39:44.500 --> 39:46.500\nI was by myself\n\n39:46.500 --> 39:48.500\nYou didn't even show up\n\n39:50.500 --> 39:52.500\nI was doing a monologue to a camera\n\n39:52.500 --> 39:54.500\nI had cast Andy Dick as\n\n39:54.500 --> 39:56.500\nChevy Chase's drug addiction\n\n39:56.500 --> 39:58.500\nI didn't need to be there\n\n39:58.500 --> 40:00.500\nIt suits itself\n\n40:00.500 --> 40:02.500\nBut it's fine\n\n40:02.500 --> 40:04.500\nThat's the coffee guy from last night\n\n40:06.500 --> 40:08.500\nThat's my point\n\n40:08.500 --> 40:10.500\nFuck this, I'm out\n\n40:10.500 --> 40:12.500\nI wasn't pretending\n\n40:12.500 --> 40:14.500\nNot to know you had exploited you\n\n40:14.500 --> 40:16.500\nThat's the part that got me\n\n40:16.500 --> 40:18.500\nWhen he pretended\n\n40:18.500 --> 40:20.500\nThat made me really mad\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:22.500\nSorry, I just don't know who you are\n\n40:22.500 --> 40:24.500\nI said own up to it man\n\n40:24.500 --> 40:26.500\nI said it\n\n40:26.500 --> 40:28.500\nI'm proud\n\n40:28.500 --> 40:30.500\nI just started out of love\n\n40:30.500 --> 40:32.500\nI want to try to draw a connection\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:34.500\nBetween the medicine\n\n40:34.500 --> 40:36.500\nThat is attention\n\n40:36.500 --> 40:38.500\nAnd you're one of those people\n\n40:38.500 --> 40:40.500\nThat really lights up\n\n40:40.500 --> 40:42.500\nWhen people are focused on you\n\n40:42.500 --> 40:44.500\nAnd like I said earlier\n\n40:44.500 --> 40:46.500\nTo the point where you could experiment\n\n40:46.500 --> 40:48.500\nWith that vocoder\n\n40:48.500 --> 40:50.500\nWe can turn the dial of mentioning Paul Rudd\n\n40:50.500 --> 40:52.500\nAnd you can...\n\n40:52.500 --> 40:54.500\nThat's what happened\n\n40:54.500 --> 40:56.500\nI think that the world saw\n\n40:56.500 --> 40:58.500\nHow easy I am\n\n40:58.500 --> 41:00.500\nSo like a little bit of a whore\n\n41:00.500 --> 41:02.500\nAnd then they're like now let's poke with them\n\n41:02.500 --> 41:04.500\nAnd let's do that\n\n41:04.500 --> 41:06.500\nAnd then it fucking drove me insane\n\n41:06.500 --> 41:08.500\nAnd I've been to 20 different rehabs\n\n41:08.500 --> 41:10.500\nI've lived like 3 years in a facility\n\n41:10.500 --> 41:12.500\nI live in one right now\n\n41:12.500 --> 41:14.500\nI'm in a facility\n\n41:14.500 --> 41:16.500\nWhen I leave here I go and I go back to a sober living\n\n41:16.500 --> 41:18.500\nBut it's nice right?\n\n41:18.500 --> 41:20.500\nI love it, it's on the beach\n\n41:20.500 --> 41:22.500\nYou don't have to feel it\n\n41:22.500 --> 41:24.500\nAnd I'm the only one in this one house\n\n41:24.500 --> 41:26.500\nI mean I got it made\n\n41:26.500 --> 41:28.500\nThat's the one thing\n\n41:28.500 --> 41:30.500\nThat's the one catch\n\n41:30.500 --> 41:32.500\nThat's how they get you\n\n41:32.500 --> 41:34.500\nYou know I do think\n\n41:34.500 --> 41:36.500\nAbout that if I took one fucking sip\n\n41:36.500 --> 41:38.500\nIt's gone\n\n41:38.500 --> 41:40.500\nMy house is gone\n\n41:40.500 --> 41:42.500\nYou would look at me different\n\n41:42.500 --> 41:44.500\nYou said it on stage with Tina Fey\n\n41:44.500 --> 41:46.500\nI wouldn't look at you at all\n\n41:46.500 --> 41:48.500\nYou'd see the back of my head\n\n41:48.500 --> 41:50.500\nTina Fey was right next to us\n\n41:50.500 --> 41:52.500\nAnd I said that I still want to drink\n\n41:52.500 --> 41:54.500\nI want to drink right now\n\n41:54.500 --> 41:56.500\nI had a fucking glass of wine tucked into her cunt\n\n41:56.500 --> 41:58.500\nEverybody's drinking\n\n41:58.500 --> 42:00.500\nScotch and Steve Colbert\n\n42:00.500 --> 42:02.500\nDrinking and everyone\n\n42:02.500 --> 42:04.500\nI want to drink\n\n42:04.500 --> 42:06.500\nYou said if you drink I'm leaving right now\n\n42:06.500 --> 42:08.500\nAnd he means it\n\n42:08.500 --> 42:10.500\nI don't want him to leave\n\n42:10.500 --> 42:12.500\nHave you seen him drunk?\n\n42:12.500 --> 42:14.500\nNightmare\n\n42:14.500 --> 42:16.500\nIt's bad\n\n42:16.500 --> 42:18.500\nThe medicine of attention\n\n42:20.500 --> 42:22.500\nI just want to talk about the relationship\n\n42:22.500 --> 42:24.500\nBecause there's a couple different models here\n\n42:24.500 --> 42:26.500\nThat we could use\n\n42:26.500 --> 42:28.500\nI'm curious\n\n42:28.500 --> 42:30.500\nIn your mind\n\n42:30.500 --> 42:32.500\nWould it be easy to stay sober\n\n42:32.500 --> 42:34.500\nFor 20 years\n\n42:34.500 --> 42:36.500\nIf during every minute of that 20 years\n\n42:36.500 --> 42:38.500\nEverybody was like\n\n42:38.500 --> 42:40.500\nYou're very funny\n\n42:40.500 --> 42:42.500\nYou're beautiful\n\n42:42.500 --> 42:44.500\nI've been thinking about this\n\n42:44.500 --> 42:46.500\nWhen that needle goes off\n\n42:46.500 --> 42:48.500\nI could supplement that\n\n42:48.500 --> 42:50.500\nWith the other thing that makes me\n\n42:50.500 --> 42:52.500\nThat takes my brain\n\n42:52.500 --> 42:54.500\nBecause we're talking about numbness\n\n42:54.500 --> 42:56.500\nYou have such a high degree of empathy\n\n42:56.500 --> 42:58.500\nThat you can feel people\n\n42:58.500 --> 43:00.500\nYou knew that guy was fucking around\n\n43:00.500 --> 43:02.500\nLike you're hypersensitive to that\n\n43:02.500 --> 43:04.500\nThat makes you a good entertainer\n\n43:04.500 --> 43:06.500\nYour curse to bear then\n\n43:06.500 --> 43:08.500\nIs that\n\n43:08.500 --> 43:10.500\nThat seismograph\n\n43:10.500 --> 43:12.500\nIs designed to measure fucking\n\n43:12.500 --> 43:14.500\nKittens walking across the kitchen floor\n\n43:14.500 --> 43:16.500\nSo the Northridge Quake\n\n43:16.500 --> 43:18.500\nIs a little tough sometimes\n\n43:18.500 --> 43:20.500\nWhen somebody is like\n\n43:20.500 --> 43:22.500\nAnd you're like\n\n43:22.500 --> 43:24.500\nI want to kill myself\n\n43:24.500 --> 43:26.500\nIf something really super bad happened\n\n43:26.500 --> 43:28.500\nIt would be just curts\n\n43:28.500 --> 43:30.500\nYou're talking to the two guys\n\n43:30.500 --> 43:32.500\nWho love drinking more than anything\n\n43:32.500 --> 43:34.500\nWho hate it when people don't drink\n\n43:34.500 --> 43:36.500\nWe hate it when people don't drink\n\n43:36.500 --> 43:38.500\nMe and you\n\n43:38.500 --> 43:40.500\nWe love it when he doesn't\n\n43:40.500 --> 43:42.500\nThat doesn't seem fair\n\n43:42.500 --> 43:44.500\nThere's got to be other things\n\n43:44.500 --> 43:46.500\nYou can do that I can't\n\n43:46.500 --> 43:48.500\nSee holy hell\n\n43:48.500 --> 43:50.500\nI just saw it\n\n43:50.500 --> 43:52.500\nI have this weird thing that all celebrities\n\n43:52.500 --> 43:54.500\nAnd me included create a\n\n43:54.500 --> 43:56.500\nMini fucking\n\n43:56.500 --> 43:58.500\nWhat's it called\n\n43:58.500 --> 44:00.500\nYou have it this is your little mini cult\n\n44:00.500 --> 44:02.500\nNo\n\n44:02.500 --> 44:04.500\nYes and it's not a bad thing\n\n44:04.500 --> 44:06.500\nI kept looking at that guy going\n\n44:06.500 --> 44:08.500\nHe's not that bad\n\n44:08.500 --> 44:10.500\nI want a cult\n\n44:10.500 --> 44:12.500\nYou have one\n\n44:12.500 --> 44:14.500\nI do\n\n44:14.500 --> 44:16.500\nWhat do you think\n\n44:16.500 --> 44:18.500\nDo you see that situation as untenable\n\n44:18.500 --> 44:20.500\nIs there an adjustment that you could make\n\n44:20.500 --> 44:22.500\nBecause I like\n\n44:22.500 --> 44:24.500\nCan we talk for a second just about therapy\n\n44:24.500 --> 44:26.500\nAre you in therapy? I mean it all the time\n\n44:26.500 --> 44:28.500\nI live at that place\n\n44:28.500 --> 44:30.500\nOur podcast is therapy\n\n44:30.500 --> 44:32.500\nI approached Dino\n\n44:32.500 --> 44:34.500\nAnd begged him\n\n44:34.500 --> 44:36.500\nI just asked him if he could please just hang out\n\n44:36.500 --> 44:38.500\nBecause I wanted to get to the bottom of why\n\n44:38.500 --> 44:40.500\nHe left me in the first place\n\n44:40.500 --> 44:42.500\nYears ago he just like\n\n44:42.500 --> 44:44.500\nStopped talking to me\n\n44:44.500 --> 44:46.500\nI couldn't get him on the phone I'm like\n\n44:46.500 --> 44:48.500\nThat hurt me so much\n\n44:48.500 --> 44:50.500\nMy marrow and we've never like\n\n44:50.500 --> 44:52.500\nSucked each other's cocks or anything\n\n44:52.500 --> 44:54.500\nI'm the only person he's never been attracted to\n\n44:56.500 --> 44:58.500\nWhat are you going to do\n\n44:58.500 --> 45:00.500\nLook at him\n\n45:04.500 --> 45:06.500\nThere's like no wrong answers on that podcast\n\n45:06.500 --> 45:08.500\nIt's like yeah black people's eyes pop out\n\n45:08.500 --> 45:12.500\nLove it\n\n45:12.500 --> 45:14.500\nDon't listen to the podcast\n\n45:14.500 --> 45:16.500\nDon't listen to our podcast\n\n45:16.500 --> 45:18.500\nHe drops the end bomb like for no reason\n\n45:18.500 --> 45:20.500\nI do it here\n\n45:20.500 --> 45:22.500\nI stopped doing it here when people started applauding\n\n45:22.500 --> 45:24.500\nLet it go, let it go creepy\n\n45:24.500 --> 45:26.500\nYeah, but I think it's true\n\n45:26.500 --> 45:28.500\nAbout the millennials\n\n45:28.500 --> 45:30.500\nThey're new to the party\n\n45:30.500 --> 45:32.500\nAnd we have to respect them\n\n45:32.500 --> 45:34.500\nI think that it's like\n\n45:34.500 --> 45:36.500\nYeah, but can you sense\n\n45:36.500 --> 45:38.500\nI think you can or maybe it's\n\n45:38.500 --> 45:40.500\nEven more interesting if you can't because\n\n45:40.500 --> 45:42.500\nLook what happened you came out and you were like\n\n45:42.500 --> 45:44.500\nLike a bull in a china shop\n\n45:44.500 --> 45:46.500\nBut instead of china it was like hot buttons\n\n45:46.500 --> 45:48.500\nOur first sale in the shop\n\n45:48.500 --> 45:50.500\nIt's not a shop you're not supposed to be in there\n\n45:50.500 --> 45:52.500\nYou're a bull in a fucking racist\n\n45:52.500 --> 45:54.500\nThai ride\n\n45:54.500 --> 45:56.500\nEvery button you could push\n\n45:56.500 --> 45:58.500\nAnd even though you're being told\n\n45:58.500 --> 46:00.500\nLike oh they don't like that\n\n46:00.500 --> 46:02.500\nLike you\n\n46:02.500 --> 46:04.500\nThen all of a sudden five seconds later\n\n46:04.500 --> 46:06.500\nLike we've switched gears\n\n46:06.500 --> 46:08.500\nInto a one night show\n\n46:08.500 --> 46:10.500\nWith Andy Dick where you're telling\n\n46:10.500 --> 46:12.500\nStories and people are leaned in and they're sharing\n\n46:12.500 --> 46:14.500\nWith you because you're talking about your pain\n\n46:14.500 --> 46:16.500\nYou're talking about what it means to be Andy Dick\n\n46:16.500 --> 46:18.500\nIn a Starbucks\n\n46:18.500 --> 46:20.500\nYou adapted\n\n46:20.500 --> 46:22.500\nBecause you're like a freaky stem cell\n\n46:22.500 --> 46:24.500\nMystique character that's like\n\n46:24.500 --> 46:26.500\nBecause you\n\n46:26.500 --> 46:28.500\nLove making people happy\n\n46:28.500 --> 46:30.500\nBut it has to be you\n\n46:30.500 --> 46:32.500\nAnd that's like\n\n46:32.500 --> 46:34.500\nWell that's all I have\n\n46:34.500 --> 46:36.500\nWell I mean yeah you can't\n\n46:36.500 --> 46:38.500\nYou're so\n\n46:38.500 --> 46:40.500\nBut it's not about that you're happy\n\n46:40.500 --> 46:42.500\nYou're not happy that people are happy\n\n46:42.500 --> 46:44.500\nYou're happy that you make people happy\n\n46:44.500 --> 46:46.500\nLike if someone next to you makes someone happy\n\n46:46.500 --> 46:48.500\nYou're gonna be like why am I even here\n\n46:48.500 --> 46:50.500\nOn earth\n\n46:50.500 --> 46:52.500\nThat's exactly what happens\n\n46:52.500 --> 46:54.500\nThat's what it is\n\n46:54.500 --> 46:56.500\nAnd by the way it does happen\n\n46:56.500 --> 46:58.500\nBut I'm better at that\n\n46:58.500 --> 47:00.500\nYou're better in New York\n\n47:00.500 --> 47:02.500\nNew York City we did this\n\n47:02.500 --> 47:04.500\nOur Skull Juice podcast\n\n47:04.500 --> 47:06.500\nAnd that's what I was getting at\n\n47:06.500 --> 47:08.500\nI approached Dino and I'm like\n\n47:08.500 --> 47:10.500\nCan you be my friend\n\n47:10.500 --> 47:12.500\nI miss you and I just want to be\n\n47:12.500 --> 47:14.500\nHe's like let's start a podcast\n\n47:14.500 --> 47:16.500\nI'm like I don't really\n\n47:16.500 --> 47:18.500\nFine if it means you're gonna be my friend\n\n47:18.500 --> 47:20.500\nLet's do it and then I thought\n\n47:20.500 --> 47:22.500\nNo one's gonna listen to this\n\n47:22.500 --> 47:24.500\nAnd we'll just talk and I'm gonna get to the bottom\n\n47:24.500 --> 47:26.500\nOf why he left me and I've been\n\n47:26.500 --> 47:28.500\nI have a lot of insights after we talk\n\n47:28.500 --> 47:30.500\nAnd I want to do another one\n\n47:30.500 --> 47:32.500\nI call him the next day\n\n47:32.500 --> 47:34.500\nCan we do another one today\n\n47:34.500 --> 47:36.500\nYeah he loves hating me\n\n47:36.500 --> 47:38.500\nAnd by the way he hates doing the podcast\n\n47:38.500 --> 47:40.500\nAt one hour he's like we're done\n\n47:40.500 --> 47:42.500\nI'm like no we're just gonna\n\n47:42.500 --> 47:44.500\nBut in New York it was\n\n47:44.500 --> 47:46.500\nAnd you know rightfully so unfair enough\n\n47:46.500 --> 47:48.500\nIt was all about Dino and that's fine\n\n47:48.500 --> 47:50.500\nI wasn't fine with it in New York\n\n47:50.500 --> 47:52.500\nIt was Dino created this thing\n\n47:52.500 -->

part of this band called Survive\n\n53:30.500 --> 53:32.500\nOut of Austin\n\n53:32.500 --> 53:34.500\nAnd we made this little\n\n53:34.500 --> 53:36.500\nWhen we tried to sell the show\n\n53:36.500 --> 53:38.500\nWe made this little trailer\n\n53:38.500 --> 53:40.500\nWe put all these clips from old movies\n\n53:40.500 --> 53:42.500\nTogether with Spielberg or Carpenter\n\n53:42.500 --> 53:44.500\nWhatever tried to get the vibe across\n\n53:44.500 --> 53:46.500\nAnd some of it was John Carpenter\n\n53:46.500 --> 53:48.500\nMusic that we used\n\n53:48.500 --> 53:50.500\nBut then for the end\n\n53:50.500 --> 53:52.500\nEpic end of this trailer\n\n53:52.500 --> 53:54.500\nWe used anything and we used music from this band\n\n53:54.500 --> 53:56.500\nSo when it came to the show\n\n53:56.500 --> 53:58.500\nWe just\n\n53:58.500 --> 54:00.500\nThey had regular\n\n54:00.500 --> 54:02.500\nOne of them sold used synthesizers\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:04.500\nYou don't make money\n\n54:04.500 --> 54:06.500\nIn an instrumental like synth band\n\n54:06.500 --> 54:08.500\nYou can't make money\n\n54:08.500 --> 54:10.500\nYou don't have a living\n\n54:10.500 --> 54:12.500\nSo I called them up\n\n54:12.500 --> 54:14.500\nAt first we had to convince\n\n54:14.500 --> 54:16.500\nNetflix and the producers\n\n54:16.500 --> 54:18.500\nAnd they let us do it\n\n54:18.500 --> 54:20.500\nAnd then we called them\n\n54:20.500 --> 54:22.500\nTo get your jobs\n\n54:22.500 --> 54:24.500\nTo do this\n\n54:24.500 --> 54:26.500\nAre you kidding me?\n\n54:26.500 --> 54:28.500\nNow they'll be fine\n\n54:28.500 --> 54:30.500\nBecause your show is big enough\n\n54:30.500 --> 54:32.500\nThey can just go on touring\n\n54:32.500 --> 54:34.500\nWith the synth band\n\n54:34.500 --> 54:36.500\nIt's crazy\n\n54:36.500 --> 54:38.500\nI always wonder\n\n54:38.500 --> 54:40.500\nWhen you see a toyota commercial\n\n54:40.500 --> 54:42.500\nAnd you hear a song you really like\n\n54:42.500 --> 54:44.500\nAnd then you look it up\n\n54:44.500 --> 54:46.500\nAnd you buy the album and it's the only\n\n54:46.500 --> 54:48.500\nI'm not saying these guys are that\n\n54:48.500 --> 54:50.500\nNo idea\n\n54:50.500 --> 54:52.500\nBut I always wonder about the phenomenon\n\n54:52.500 --> 54:54.500\nOf being a band\n\n54:54.500 --> 54:56.500\nWho all of a sudden\n\n54:56.500 --> 54:58.500\nI will look at the 88\n\n54:58.500 --> 55:00.500\nI wonder sometimes\n\n55:00.500 --> 55:02.500\nThey were big enough\n\n55:02.500 --> 55:04.500\nThey were using\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:06.500\nTheir music was like in shampoo commercials\n\n55:06.500 --> 55:08.500\nAnd then Joe Russo said\n\n55:08.500 --> 55:10.500\nWe should use them for the theme cycle\n\n55:10.500 --> 55:12.500\nI always wonder what their relationship is\n\n55:12.500 --> 55:14.500\nIf they hate it or love it\n\n55:14.500 --> 55:16.500\nI'm sure they love it\n\n55:16.500 --> 55:18.500\nI don't know what's going to happen\n\n55:18.500 --> 55:20.500\nThey're barely scraping by right now\n\n55:20.500 --> 55:22.500\nBut they're going to be great\n\n55:22.500 --> 55:24.500\nAre you guys from Austin?\n\n55:24.500 --> 55:26.500\nNo\n\n55:26.500 --> 55:28.500\nDurham, North Carolina\n\n55:28.500 --> 55:30.500\nAsheville?\n\n55:30.500 --> 55:32.500\nDurham\n\n55:32.500 --> 55:34.500\nI have a neurological disorder\n\n55:34.500 --> 55:36.500\nYou may have heard of it\n\n55:36.500 --> 55:38.500\nIn Wired Magazine\n\n55:38.500 --> 55:40.500\nIt's pretty chic\n\n55:40.500 --> 55:42.500\nDiagnosed myself on the internet\n\n55:42.500 --> 55:44.500\nDiagnosed myself on the internet\n\n55:44.500 --> 55:46.500\nSo\n\n55:46.500 --> 55:48.500\nOkay\n\n55:48.500 --> 55:50.500\nSo here's something interesting about you guys\n\n55:50.500 --> 55:52.500\nYou are twins\n\n55:52.500 --> 55:54.500\nBut\n\n55:54.500 --> 55:56.500\nWe met at lunch\n\n55:56.500 --> 55:58.500\nThe waitress came over\n\n55:58.500 --> 56:00.500\nAnd said are you guys twins?\n\n56:00.500 --> 56:02.500\nAnd she said identical\n\n56:02.500 --> 56:04.500\nAnd I've never heard this response before\n\n56:04.500 --> 56:06.500\nYou guys said we don't know\n\n56:06.500 --> 56:08.500\nWe might be\n\n56:08.500 --> 56:10.500\nWe assume we are\n\n56:10.500 --> 56:12.500\nYou could clear that up with a blood test\n\n56:12.500 --> 56:14.500\nBut we've gotten to the point where you don't want to know\n\n56:14.500 --> 56:16.500\nWe don't know what it would psychologically do\n\n56:16.500 --> 56:18.500\nNo\n\n56:18.500 --> 56:20.500\nI think if it came back we were identical\n\n56:20.500 --> 56:22.500\nWe'd feel fine and we'd be the same\n\n56:22.500 --> 56:24.500\nBut if it came back that we weren't\n\n56:24.500 --> 56:26.500\nI don't think you are\n\n56:26.500 --> 56:28.500\nYou're not even wearing the same shirt\n\n56:28.500 --> 56:30.500\nHe bases all of his knowledge\n\n56:30.500 --> 56:32.500\nAbout twins on like\n\n56:32.500 --> 56:34.500\nChimpanzee shows from the 60s\n\n56:34.500 --> 56:36.500\nI don't want to know\n\n56:36.500 --> 56:38.500\nI don't want to know\n\n56:38.500 --> 56:40.500\nI think it could fuck us up\n\n56:40.500 --> 56:42.500\nWhat shocks me is that it's possible in this modern era\n\n56:42.500 --> 56:44.500\nYou guys were born into\n\n56:44.500 --> 56:46.500\nA stainless steel honeycomb\n\n56:46.500 --> 56:48.500\nYou were born into THX 1138\n\n56:48.500 --> 56:50.500\nYou were born in underground too\n\n56:50.500 --> 56:52.500\nAndy's still here\n\n56:52.500 --> 56:54.500\nOh shit\n\n56:54.500 --> 56:56.500\nI didn't\n\n56:56.500 --> 56:58.500\nI love that show so much\n\n56:58.500 --> 57:00.500\nI can go on and on and on\n\n57:00.500 --> 57:02.500\nYou know what show he doesn't love\n\n57:02.500 --> 57:04.500\nHis own show\n\n57:04.500 --> 57:06.500\nYou know what there's a Volkswagen blocking my car\n\n57:06.500 --> 57:08.500\nThat's why I came back\n\n57:08.500 --> 57:10.500\nI didn't know that this was the people from Stranger Things\n\n57:10.500 --> 57:12.500\nSo this is fucking why can't I\n\n57:12.500 --> 57:14.500\nStay\n\n57:14.500 --> 57:16.500\nI'm serious\n\n57:16.500 --> 57:18.500\nThis is fucking amazing\n\n57:18.500 --> 57:20.500\nThat show I gotta talk to you guys about\n\n57:20.500 --> 57:22.500\nWhy and how it's so amazing\n\n57:22.500 --> 57:24.500\nAlright we'll go ahead\n\n57:24.500 --> 57:26.500\nNo this is your show I gotta go\n\n57:26.500 --> 57:28.500\nBut can somebody move there as like a black\n\n57:28.500 --> 57:30.500\nNo we want you to talk to them now\n\n57:30.500 --> 57:32.500\nI have a show there's a whole audience\n\n57:32.500 --> 57:34.500\nFuck your show\n\n57:34.500 --> 57:36.500\nYou're mean\n\n57:36.500 --> 57:38.500\nI have a few questions\n\n57:38.500 --> 57:40.500\nI'll go get the Volkswagen\n\n57:40.500 --> 57:42.500\nWhose car is that\n\n57:42.500 --> 57:44.500\nWell there's so many good\n\n57:44.500 --> 57:46.500\nThe acting and the writing\n\n57:46.500 --> 57:48.500\nAnd the way\n\n57:48.500 --> 57:50.500\nIt's so\n\n57:50.500 --> 57:52.500\nYou really\n\n57:52.500 --> 57:54.500\nYou know what I relate to when I'm a writer\n\n57:54.500 --> 57:56.500\nI will relate to that character\n\n57:56.500 --> 57:58.500\nBecause the way that\n\n57:58.500 --> 58:00.500\nI don't know if you guys directed her in this way\n\n58:00.500 --> 58:02.500\nOr whatever but she is that person\n\n58:02.500 --> 58:04.500\nWhere everything\n\n58:04.500 --> 58:06.500\nAbout her and she even says\n\n58:06.500 --> 58:08.500\nI know I think crazy I know\n\n58:08.500 --> 58:10.500\nI know but I'm not\n\n58:10.500 --> 58:12.500\nI saw things in the wall and the lights\n\n58:12.500 --> 58:14.500\nAnd the more she screams\n\n58:14.500 --> 58:16.500\nThe more crazy she sounds\n\n58:16.500 --> 58:18.500\nI love that\n\n58:18.500 --> 58:20.500\nYeah you talked the lamps\n\n58:20.500 --> 58:22.500\nI love it\n\n58:22.500 --> 58:24.500\nYeah I did\n\n58:24.500 --> 58:26.500\nWe cast\n\n58:26.500 --> 58:28.500\nI think we had one script written and we cast her\n\n58:28.500 --> 58:30.500\nAnd it was like a very different role\n\n58:30.500 --> 58:32.500\nIt was like a tough smoking long island\n\n58:32.500 --> 58:34.500\nMom and then we had Winona\n\n58:34.500 --> 58:36.500\nAnd I love the idea of Winona\n\n58:36.500 --> 58:38.500\nAnd then we started to talk about Richard Dreyfus\n\n58:38.500 --> 58:40.500\nAnd Closer Countries we started talking about\n\n58:40.500 --> 58:42.500\nWhat's cool about Winona\n\n58:42.500 --> 58:44.500\nAnd that's what I love about television\n\n58:44.500 --> 58:46.500\nThat you can evolve\n\n58:46.500 --> 58:48.500\nAll the kids were cast\n\n58:48.500 --> 58:50.500\nWe had one script written and we rewrote\n\n58:50.500 --> 58:52.500\nThat script based on all these kids\n\n58:52.500 --> 58:54.500\nAnd we just wrote to all of them\n\n58:54.500 --> 58:56.500\nWe wrote to Winona and they made the show\n\n58:56.500 --> 58:58.500\nI think they made the show so much better\n\n58:58.500 --> 59:00.500\nMore interesting everything was much more\n\n59:00.500 --> 59:02.500\nStereotypical\n\n59:02.500 --> 59:04.500\nAll of them are great\n\n59:04.500 --> 59:06.500\nAnd the kids are amazing\n\n59:06.500 --> 59:08.500\nEverybody's so good you did such a great job with casting\n\n59:08.500 --> 59:10.500\nAnd writing and the way you shoot it\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:12.500\nAnd everything\n\n59:12.500 --> 59:14.500\nThat other guy that I just fucking love\n\n59:14.500 --> 59:16.500\nIs the lead man\n\n59:16.500 --> 59:18.500\nThe police officer\n\n59:18.500 --> 59:20.500\nWhat a fucking train wreck\n\n59:20.500 --> 59:22.500\nImmediately he's popping pills\n\n59:22.500 --> 59:24.500\nSmoking he doesn't give a shit he's drinking\n\n59:24.500 --> 59:26.500\nHe hates his job\n\n59:26.500 --> 59:28.500\nBut he's a fucking hero\n\n59:28.500 --> 59:30.500\nRemember that first time\n\n59:30.500 --> 59:32.500\nWhen he just fucking knocked the guy out\n\n59:32.500 --> 59:34.500\nThat was back in the 70's when you can do that\n\n59:34.500 --> 59:36.500\nThere weren't\n\n59:36.500 --> 59:38.500\nHe just fucking knocked him out\n\n59:38.500 --> 59:40.500\nAnd I'm like fuck hero\n\n59:40.500 --> 59:42.500\nThat's a real hero\n\n59:42.500 --> 59:44.500\nI can't have him listen to this\n\n59:44.500 --> 59:46.500\nNo but the funny thing\n\n59:46.500 --> 59:48.500\nWhy he didn't like doing that\n\n59:48.500 --> 59:50.500\nHe loves punching people\n\n59:50.500 --> 59:52.500\nHe will love everything that you're saying\n\n59:52.500 --> 59:54.500\nHe's a real Andy Dick\n\n59:54.500 --> 59:56.500\nBy the way\n\n59:56.500 --> 59:58.500\nThe way he plays it\n\n59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500\nNo one's moving that Volkswagen\n\n01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500\nSo I'm gonna go out and key it in a second\n\n01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500\nYeah we gotta move it\n\n01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.500\nUh oh\n\n01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500\nHe really well\n\n01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.500\nBut back to my medical question\n\n01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500\nShe's like how do you not\n\n01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500\nIs that we're born at the same time\n\n01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500\nHow do they not have your DNA\n\n01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500\nIn a hologram\n\n01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500\nThey either aren't identical twins\n\n01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500\nThat's the thing I don't understand\n\n01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500\nIt's like you guys slip through the slats\n\n01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.500\nOf an Orwellian\n\n01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500\nThis is what happens when you're born in the south\n\n01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.500\nI don't know\n\n01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500\nWell speaking of which\n\n01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500\nYou guys are like you're in the 30's\n\n01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500\nI won't portray your 30's\n\n01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500\nYou're\n\n01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500\nYou're\n\n01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.500\nThat's the new young\n\n01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500\nYou're being nostalgic\n\n01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.500\nIn this show for a time that didn't\n\n01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.500\nActually like\n\n01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500\nFor me that's what\n\n01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500\nI keyed it\n\n01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500\nThere's no guarantee that the person's in this room\n\n01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500\nLike they had no right to do that\n\n01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500\nWell he should have went out and fucking moved it\n\n01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500\nNo because he might be\n\n01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500\nA block away\n\n01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.500\nOh\n\n01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500\nThat's when I was like 10 years old\n\n01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500\nThat's like filled with all these memories for me\n\n01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.500\nBut you guys are like\n\n01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.500\nYou know you're fondly recalling\n\n01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500\nA time in cinema\n\n01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500\nReally like it's like your favorite movies\n\n01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500\nWhen you were kids right?\n\n01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500\nYeah I think it's just from\n\n01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.500\nIt's weird because it's part of it\n\n01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500\nIs our childhood we did\n\n01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500\nWe're hanging out with our friends\n\n01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.500\nOn adventures and then the other\n\n01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500\nSo that was a huge part of our childhood\n\n01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.500\nAnd the other part was watching these VHS tapes\n\n01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500\nOver and over again\n\n01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500\nAnd so it all becomes like a blur\n\n01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500\nWhen I look back on it, it's just a blur\n\n01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500\nThose were my favorite movies and\n\n01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500\nWere they better then?\n\n01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500\nBecause like so that kind of\n\n01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500\nI always felt like this thing is like\n\n01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500\nI felt like it was\n\n01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500\nThe movies were better\n\n01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.500\nThey're always better\n\n01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.500\nBut you guys are younger enough than me\n\n01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.500\nThat weren't true\n\n01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.500\nBecause you guys would just be fondly\n\n01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500\nRecalling like clueless or something\n\n01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500\nThat you'd be like that's R-E-T\n\n01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500\nAnd I'd be like okay\n\n01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500\nAnd feeling like a curmudgeon\n\n01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500\nLike I guess we just all melt and die\n\n01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500\nAnd think that when we were 10\n\n01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500\nThere was a golden age of cinema\n\n01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500\nBut you guys are kind of like\n\n01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500\nConfirming that in the 80s there was like a\n\n01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.500\nJoy there, I think that John Carpenter\n\n01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.500\nReally represents because here's a guy\n\n01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500\nWho did his own music for his own horror\n\n01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500\nMovies and like\n\n01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500\nThat synth feel\n\n01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500\nThat they live in\n\n01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.500\nYeah we didn't think about them as like\n\n01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.500\nOld movies though\n\n01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500\nThey felt very modern to me\n\n01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.500\nI didn't watch the Goonies and I wasn't like\n\n01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500\nOh this is like an old movie\n\n01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500\nIt felt very current to me\n\n01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500\nSo I didn't differentiate, the only thing\n\n01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.500\nThat it didn't experience it theatrically\n\n01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.500\nThat was the only thing but it felt very\n\n01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.500\nIt felt very new to me\n\n01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500\nDid you ever become conscious\n\n01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500\nLike I think we're 80s files\n\n01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500\nNo\n\n01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500\nNo, not at all\n\n01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500\nShort answer\n\n01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.500\nIt makes me nervous actually being associated\n\n01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.500\nI feel like a lot of people know a lot\n\n01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500\nMore about it than we do\n\n01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500\nWinona knows a lot more than we do\n\n01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.500\nShe's like it wasn't like this\n\n01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500\nJust keep talking\n\n01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.500\nYou're on camera\n\n01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.500\nShe knows so much\n\n01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.500\nShe's in the rear\n\n01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.500\nI feel like I know a lot of movies\n\n01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.500\nI don't know what the hell she's taught\n\n01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.500\nShe's talking about an IMDb\n\n01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500\nOr whatever it has like 700 votes\n\n01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.500\nIt's like no one has seen it\n\n01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500\nExcept Winona\n\n01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500\nShe watches so much\n\n01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500\nMost of it's like 80s to 90\n\n01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500\nIt's like weird\n\n01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.500\nI don't know if you'd even know\n\n01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.500\nAudrey Rose, she's obsessed with this\n\n01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.500\nAnthony Hopkins thing\n\n01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.500\nIt's like an exorcist rip off\n\n01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500\nThat they didn't aid you\n\n01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.500\nAudrey Rose\n\n01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500\nI want to watch Audrey Rose\n\n01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500\nAnd it was like that for three months\n\n01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500\nAnd I finally watched it\n\n01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500\nI don't know\n\n01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500\nIf she says you gotta watch Martin Scorsese\n\n01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500\nDracula, say no\n\n01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.500\nThat's a good soundtrack though\n\n01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.500\nWhat's Matthew Modine like?\n\n01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.500\nHe gave the weirdest interview yesterday\n\n01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.500\nIt was like in Forbes\n\n01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500\nAnd he was talking about how upset he was\n\n01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500\nThat people were calling him evil\n\n01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.500\nBecause of the character he played in this show\n\n01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500\nBecause when we were shooting the show\n\n01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500\nI just let him\n\n01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.500\nHe thought he was being sympathetic\n\n01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500\nLike he thought he was\n\n01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500\nBut everything he was doing that he thought was sympathetic\n\n01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500\nWas really creepy\n\n01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500\nAnd so we just let it go\n\n01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500\nLike\n\n01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500\nWith 11\n\n01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500\nWhen he touches her nose\n\n01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500\nAnd Ross and I just looked\n\n01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500\nOoh\n\n01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500\nAnd we're like yeah let's go\n\n01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.500\nLet's do it\n\n01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.500\nIt wasn't a direction\n\n01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500\nNo\n\n01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500\nHe just said no\n\n01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.500\nI'm going to touch her nose like this\n\n01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.500\nAnd we're like haha\n\n01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.500\nAnd then we do the first take and he does it\n\n01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.500\nAnd we're like oh shit\n\n01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.500\nThat was actually\n\n01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500\nHe wasn't joking around\n\n01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.500\nBecause he has like so\n\n01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.500\nAnd I know he was concerned\n\n01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.500\nAbout the whole thing\n\n01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.500\nHe doesn't have a lot\n\n01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500\nAnd so it's him finding these\n\n01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.500\nHe's making these weird choices\n\n01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.500\nAnytime he's on screen\n\n01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500\nBecause he knows he only has\n\n01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500\nLike I was like what is that accent you're doing\n\n01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500\nHe's like I don't know\n\n01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.500\nI'm not doing an accent\n\n01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.500\nI'm like there's something\n\n01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.500\nI can't figure it out what is it\n\n01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500\nHe's like I don't know there's nothing\n\n01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.500\nBut like it fucking worked\n\n01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500\nIt cut through\n\n01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500\nI want to hear about Matthew Modine\n\n01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500\nI was thinking like\n\n01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500\nIf I quantum leap into Matthew Modine\n\n01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500\nAnd I look in the mirror and I see Matthew Modine\n\n01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500\nAnd I go oh boy and that's the episode of\n\n01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500\nQuantum leap I would spend that episode\n\n01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500\nI'd be like how the fuck\n\n01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.500\nDo you break out of being Matthew Modine\n\n01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.500\nMan it's like it's kind of like\n\n01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.500\nAn invitation to just like take it as it lays\n\n01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.500\nMan\n\n01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500\nI want to think that he's like some kind of\n\n01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.500\nWeird\n\n01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.500\nHe's really interesting and then\n\n01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.500\nHe's got some cool metal Jaguar stories\n\n01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500\nBecause he was there for two years\n\n01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.500\nYou make a Kubrick movie you're like\n\n01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.500\nA lot of people associate that\n\n01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500\nThat was right when he was\n\n01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.500\nThe most desired Hollywood\n\n01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.500\nHe's gone for two years\n\n01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500\nYou sign a new Kubrick movie you're gone forever\n\n01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500\nYou sign your life away\n\n01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500\nThere's no end date\n\n01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.500\nI know the end of it Kubrick says\n\n01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.500\nNow put film in the camera\n\n01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.500\nDid you ever hear that story\n\n01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.500\nThe shining\n\n01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500\nShelly DeVall\n\n01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.500\nShelly DeVall\n\n01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500\nYeah by the way I meant\n\n01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500\nFrancis Ford Coppola's Dracula\n\n01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.500\nRight\n\n01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.500\nI like it from the trains riding over\n\n01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.500\nThe top of the book but yeah\n\n01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.500\nHe made her do a thousand tricks\n\n01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500\nSo she was going out of her mind\n\n01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.500\nHe talks to them he gets to what he needs out of them\n\n01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.500\nHe does it\n\n01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.500\nWell I cut you off like no\n\n01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.500\nI had something to say no I don't\n\n01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.500\nYou should have kept talking\n\n01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.500\nWhat do you guys think of garage doors\n\n01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.500\nSo wait did his character\n\n01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.500\nI can't even remember did he\n\n01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.500\nBecause I remember him being\n\n01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500\nNot as scared as he should be that his\n\n01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500\nNeck would get telekinetically snapped\n\n01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.500\nLike I remember him walking\n\n01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.500\nDown the hall and like and she's like\n\n01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.500\nSnap snap and they're like\n\n01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.500\nTheir necks are like snap snap and then he's like\n\n01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.500\nHey take it easy\n\n01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500\nI thought she was going to do that\n\n01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.500\nWait no telekinesis isn't real\n\n01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.500\nYou can't pretend\n\n01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.500\nYou're like doing like the thing they did\n\n01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.500\nOn behind the scenes on gremlins 2\n\n01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500\nAnd they're like oh Mogwai wants his coffee\n\n01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.500\nCome on don't insult us\n\n01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.500\nDon't try to\n\n01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.500\nConjure that part of the 80s\n\n01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.500\nWhere\n\n01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500\nSavvy people at Los Angeles\n\n01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500\nShe\n\n01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500\nShe\n\n01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.500\nWasn't supposed to have mental powers\n\n01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500\nIt's clearly a show about\n\n01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.500\nA monster from the upside down\n\n01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.500\nThat's enough it was\n\n01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.500\nAdding her was weird\n\n01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.500\nShe showed up she was bald she snapped\n\n01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.500\nPeople's necks and we put her in the moon\n\n01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500\nYou guys are kind of famously\n\n01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.500\nI mean so what was\n\n01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.500\nIt's an overnight thing\n\n01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.500\nI don't know if that offends you to say that\n\n01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.500\nThere's maybe a trail of like very hard work\n\n01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.500\nI'm sure you didn't come out of a dumpster\n\n01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.500\nAnd walk into Netflix but\n\n01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.500\nIt might be insulting to you guys\n\n01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.500\nWho are these guys where did they come from\n\n01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.500\nBut where did you come from\n\n01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500\nTake us from birth to the night\n\n01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.500\nBefore you sell this pitch\n\n01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500\nFrom birth\n\n01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500\nJust real quick\n\n01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.500\nWe already focused on the birth for a while\n\n01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500\nWell we've always\n\n01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.500\nSince I think we got\n\n01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500\nOur high eight camera\n\n01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500\nAnd it was third grade\n\n01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500\nAnd we started making movies then\n\n01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500\nAnd we always knew\n\n01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.500\nWe wanted to make movies\n\n01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.500\nAnd then we went to film\n\n01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500\nSo high eight was like\n\n01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.500\nThat's so analog\n\n01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.500\nYou're editing we had\n\n01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.500\nYou know we were playing Danny Elfman\n\n01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500\nOur first movie it was like a magic\n\n01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.500\nThe Gathering adaptation\n\n01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.500\nNow Hollywood read them\n\n01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500\nThey're like oh the fucking Duffers want to do\n\n01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.500\nThat was fourth grade\n\n01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.500\nOr third grade\n\n01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500\nI don't want to do it now\n\n01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.500\nBut yeah so yeah and then we did that\n\n01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.500\nWhen you guys edited with high eight\n\n01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.500\nNo we just cut in camera\n\n01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.500\nAnd then eventually we got\n\n01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500\nBecause there was like a dual\n\n01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500\nVHS editing thing\n\n01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.500\nAnd then we went to school\n\n01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.500\nI movie came out which was great\n\n01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500\nAnd you know we learned on I movie\n\n01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.500\nAnd then we went to film school\n\n01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.500\nAnd we made some bad stuff\n\n01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.500\nAnd then we wrote a first script\n\n01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500\nWhich got us an agent\n\n01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500\nWhere was film school?\n\n01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.500\nThat was at Chapman University\n\n01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.500\nOh by the way we have a lot of\n\n01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.500\nColumbia alum here\n\n01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500\nColumbia college\n\n01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.500\nWhere you and Andy went\n\n01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500\nYeah yeah I dropped out\n\n01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500\nWhat you just heard was called\n\n01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500\nThe Columbia\n\n01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.500\nThe Columbia Chair\n\n01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500\nThey're a stealth college\n\n01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.500\nAnyways sorry\n\n01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.500\nI don't even know how we\n\n01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.500\nI mean there's a series of rejection\n\n01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.500\nIt's series of rejection rejection rejection\n\n01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500\nI mean it's like even film school\n\n01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500\nIt's like USC didn't want us\n\n01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500\nYou didn't want us you couldn't get anywhere\n\n01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500\nSo we wound up at Chapman\n\n01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500\nAnd we just kept writing\n\n01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.500\nAnd we were like we need to write our way in\n\n01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500\nAnd get us anything\n\n01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500\nI think before we went to college\n\n01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.500\nThe sense of like we're going to make this\n\n01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.500\nAmazing short film\n\n01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500\nAnd they're going to give us this giant movie\n\n01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.500\nAnd then you swingers it\n\n01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.500\nYeah exactly\n\n01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.500\nYou know festival mindset\n\n01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.500\nYeah but then you realize how hard that is\n\n01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.500\nHow dead that game is\n\n01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.500\nEvery festival is rejected\n\n01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.500\nThe good thing is there's two of us\n\n01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500\nThat we like delusional together\n\n01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500\nAnd then we just keep going at it\n\n01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.500\nYeah okay just push each other up\n\n01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500\nBring each other down\n\n01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.500\nAnd pump each other up\n\n01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.500\nHow does that work\n\n01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500\nLike how does that\n\n01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.500\nLike if one of you is up\n\n01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.500\nThe other is it balances\n\n01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.500\nLet's not get cocky\n\n01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500\nYeah he's being obnoxious\n\n01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.500\nor you're being a douche\n\n01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.500\nOr you sounded like a douche\n\n01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500\nOr\n\n01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.500\nThat's not really nice Ross\n\n01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.500\nI mean whatever\n\n01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.940\nwe do and then but you guys have had moments you you you got a season two or\n\n01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.980\nthere was must have been some moment when you went out to your black Volkswagen\n\n01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:16.300\noh shit and close the doors and both of you neither of you was telling the other\n\n01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.020\none not to get cocky anymore like you guys do you make out when that happens\n\n01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:30.060\nI was gonna ask it did you guys ever jack off together okay it feels real\n\n01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:35.820\ncoming from us I guess this questions we don't have to wait for an answer the\n\n01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:42.580\nanswer is no I'm gonna wait I'm gonna be here all night but you get do you guys\n\n01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:48.260\ncollectively both go up way up and ever go away yeah I'd say so yeah I think we\n\n01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.300\ngo up and yeah yeah cuz it's toughs not going wrong is not going right we just\n\n01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.060\nyou know attack each other it's bad it's not I mean it's not I mean it\n\n01:12:54.060 --> 01:13:00.660\ndepends but this might be a I forgive you if you want to just lie about the\n\n01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.380\nanswer to this because it's like it's not a charismatic question to answer\n\n01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.940\nhonestly if depending on the answer because I was just having this\n\n01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:11.860\nconversation with somebody else where I was I don't like like do you guys think\n\n01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:18.340\ndid you think before you cross that threshold where it was like all right\n\n01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:23.580\nwe got it now we're taking care of regardless of what's supposed to be\n\n01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:29.740\nlike this you'll be working for a while now you're fine and but before that\n\n01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:34.500\nthere's a time of like as most people experience it's like am I supposed to\n\n01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:39.540\nwe're not supposed to be doing this are we supposed to wash dishes in that phase\n\n01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.060\nwhich is which most people experience for much longer of their lives than the\n\n01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.780\nother stuff me included like I have more memories from that that time during\n\n01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:55.020\nthat time reward my candor during that time I just kept assuming it was gonna\n\n01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:02.220\nwork out yeah I say like it's like I like make fun that where we were\n\n01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.500\ndelusional with very delusional like you just knew I just felt that it was gonna\n\n01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.980\nwork you have to get there reach that I think actually the weird thing is the\n\n01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.540\nsix it only we've only found any success at all when it was pure panic because we\n\n01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.700\ndidn't know what else we were gonna do and we were out of money and it was just\n\n01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:23.100\nlike we're fucked and like I don't even think you know I remember like walking\n\n01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.900\nmy Starbucks and being like I don't those priests the jobs are like hard to get\n\n01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:33.940\nman like I don't know yeah like that's everyone everyone's roomate Cody's\n\n01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:41.780\nroommates job is she she goes to Costco and she she doesn't even work for Costco\n\n01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:46.820\nthat job's hard to get she works for a lotion company because she goes so she\n\n01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:50.180\ngoes to Costco it says like is one of those people at Costco that's like hey\n\n01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.980\ndo you want to try some lotion for free she works on commission like I don't\n\n01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:57.700\neven know how it's legal like it's just sort of like like like she might make\n\n01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:03.580\nzero dollars in a day like it's like anyways bad economy okay so or best one\n\n01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.660\never but it's like fucking fragmented but okay why did I get too real of that\n\n01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:14.460\nbut I yes yes those fucking like like there's that I used to go like oh man\n\n01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:17.740\nI'm gonna have to move back to Milwaukee and then I remember saying that out loud\n\n01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:20.860\nto somebody and somebody's like is there someone in Milwaukee waiting for you to\n\n01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:26.900\ncome back and and I and for that time only I was like no what god no and I was\n\n01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:31.260\nlike but I just kind of kept it's delusional and I I can't figure out I\n\n01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.660\nwas I was in the shower this morning you're welcome and I was thinking about\n\n01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:41.540\nthat like I was like is that is that a good quality or a bad quality because\n\n01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:45.500\nit's kind of like reconciling that with the whole kind of cultural awareness now\n\n01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:49.180\nthat we're having it's like we just fucking douchey privileged people it's\n\n01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:54.500\nlike that's that's just a symptom of luxury of like well yeah like you wait\n\n01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:00.180\na couple years and another white dude helps you out yeah I don't think it\n\n01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.980\nhappens like that let me be real clear here I think it's hard work and nothing\n\n01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:11.540\nelse no no handouts for anybody if your skyscraper is the second tallest now\n\n01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:17.660\njust wait and one day it's gonna be the tallest and it's gonna be because you\n\n01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:21.580\nworked hard because you sacrificed\n\n01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.420\nknows what he's talking about I mean this guy he's like on two shows as an\n\n01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:36.460\nactor he's executive producing and he's your chauffeur yeah the okay so you guys\n\n01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:39.900\nare you guys are in the writers room right now working on season yeah so the\n\n01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.900\nthings that were allowed to know are because you would watch that I watch a\n\n01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:48.980\nshow called stranger things I watch it for 10 episodes it's serialized for all\n\n01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:53.220\nI know in keeping with a John Carpenter tradition or something like that that\n\n01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:57.060\nthe second season is gonna be like hey it's called stranger things you know it's\n\n01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:01.780\nlike true detective and it's like like like all of a sudden it's like 1973 in\n\n01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:08.940\nDetroit and they're like my name's my name's Roger McClintock and I've seen\n\n01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:13.660\nstranger things than the case I'm on you know she says she's a witch but I don't\n\n01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:19.660\nbelieve in the only thing I believe in is my revolver and everyone's either\n\n01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:23.300\nbooing or cheering but that's not the case I know that from talking to you\n\n01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:27.580\nguys and the public knows you guys are like it's these characters it's Winona\n\n01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:33.580\nand her kids and the and and now even stranger things will happen yeah we\n\n01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.980\nwanted that we wanted to see it as like it's like a year later and we're trying\n\n01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:40.500\nto treat as much as we can even though it's a scary word treat it like a\n\n01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.780\nsequel just because there aren't very many good ones but the good ones are\n\n01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.940\nreally good right and so the hope is that you got to have a million stranger\n\n01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:52.560\nthings come down and then have space marines be like lock and load there's\n\n01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.660\n20 upside-downs\n\n01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.380\nwhy did she put her in charge\n\n01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:08.820\nit's aliens\n\n01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:15.220\nyou guys know you watch Halloween and then you watch Halloween too when\n\n01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.100\nyou're a kid I mean you guys were kids when you saw it too I'm sure but when I\n\n01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.900\nwas a kid it was like it was happening kind of like watch Halloween it was like\n\n01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.100\nthe original it's like the birth of Michael Myers you watch Halloween too\n\n01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.500\noh it's the sequel it picks up where it left off but now it's killing people in\n\n01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.780\nthe hospital the scalpel and they watch Halloween 3 it's called season of the\n\n01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.580\nwitch and it's about like a microchip in the back of a mask and there's a mad\n\n01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.660\ntoy manufacturer that wants to enact a Celtic tradition and and you always\n\n01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:42.780\nthink when you're a consumer back then I was I was like how could they not\n\n01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.540\nunderstand but then you but now you've probably already experienced enough to\n\n01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.340\nunderstand like of course that happens because everything nothing happens like\n\n01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:53.780\nthe way it should like like the decisions that are made aren't happening\n\n01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:59.300\nthat John Carpenter did a an interview like he was like well we did Halloween\n\n01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.460\nit was like this amazing movie our plan the entire time was going to be to\n\n01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:07.660\nalways do a new movie every Halloween that's all we wanted to do it was going\n\n01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:13.220\nto be an anthology it was like he didn't he didn't even want Halloween to be so\n\n01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:18.020\nsuccessful that Halloween 2 was demanded to the point where I don't even think he\n\n01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.820\nworked on it I don't think he was allowed to I don't even know like I like\n\n01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:25.420\nthat it was like like like oh yeah someone else will take care of this\n\n01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.940\ncuz it's just fucking money is pouring out it's like when you hit oil and it's\n\n01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:33.060\njust in the movies and it's just gushing out like where's all that oil going and\n\n01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:39.340\nit's like yeah exactly motherfucker get some barrels over here that's what's\n\n01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.700\nhappening with you guys right I mean you can you could say yes to that without\n\n01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.700\nvilifying anybody it's just like that is the state of the union like you guys\n\n01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:51.660\ndidn't expect yeah but like Netflix was they didn't invest in it going this is\n\n01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:56.660\ngonna be a one-year like it was always gonna be planned to be you know keep\n\n01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:00.060\ngoing right we had we had to go in with that mindset that it would be that was\n\n01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.300\nthat that was the intention but do you think keep going do you think that\n\n01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.660\ntheir attitude changed at all about like like based on I don't even know well\n\n01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.020\nwho knows what numbers they look at but I don't know we don't know no we don't\n\n01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.420\nknow I mean they really honestly don't tell us and like so I mean we're just\n\n01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:17.180\ntrying to do I mean it's really scary I mean I don't know I mean now like a\n\n01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.260\nnever before have we been in a position where anyone cared about what we're\n\n01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:27.500\ndoing I realized though you know I mean like as it comes from much more pure\n\n01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.100\nplace and now there's like all this noise and I'm like you know I'm like\n\n01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.060\nneurotic and I'm thinking about what other people are gonna think about it I'm\n\n01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:37.540\nlike that's bad that's bad that's bad I gotta have each other to turn to you\n\n01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.300\nabout that and then you know and then you know and then and then we're just\n\n01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:44.900\ntrying as much as possible just write you know what we think is cool and what\n\n01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:49.300\nwe want to see and not worry about like longevity or franchise ability or any of\n\n01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:52.900\nthat shit and just like just write a cool second season and then and then and\n\n01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:56.220\nthen worry about the rest later which is not necessarily how everyone wants us\n\n01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.980\nto be doing it but I think it's the best thing I think it's gonna result you\n\n01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.740\nknow in the best in the best thing but I don't know because I see all these\n\n01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:07.100\nfilmmakers I admire and they mess up on sequels and and you know like Netflix\n\n01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:10.180\ndoesn't even like us talking about sequels because it makes them nervous\n\n01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.620\nbecause there's so many bad ones so but but it's just it's not a tradition but\n\n01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.500\nit's a TV show I mean no but it's not traditional though and that like it in\n\n01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:21.580\nlike it is built because it you know it built climax and it and it ends and the\n\n01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.220\nmain tension is resolved so so do you it's different do you think when you\n\n01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:28.140\nsay that they're nervous about the sequel thing do you think what what they\n\n01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:32.860\nwere more like the word it's the more like the word we like using it just\n\n01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:37.700\nbecause we like seeing it as yeah this it's you know a new tension that then\n\n01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:40.820\nalso gets resolved there's always important to us like not to do the\n\n01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:44.180\nkilling thing in season one where it's like we'll just got will but oh he's in\n\n01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:48.380\noh no he got snatched away by larger demo go again you know and we got to go\n\n01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.980\nget that it's like we saw that we want to do different we want to do new\n\n01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:55.700\ndifferent stuff you know and so I I don't know I don't know what's the word\n\n01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.260\nexcited about it as long as we're excited about it I feel like we're fine\n\n01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:07.020\nwe're good he described the worst version of the show the worst version of\n\n01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:13.500\nseason two as you see it in the eyes of the person that wants the worst thing\n\n01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:18.460\nfor sure like the thing that is your worst nightmare like it's sort of the\n\n01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:22.620\nis the like because I love I love home alone one of my favorite right so but\n\n01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:28.220\nwhen I was like a kid and home alone two came out I like I was like eight or\n\n01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:34.100\nwhatever I was like what the fuck is this like it's the exact same thing they've\n\n01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:43.380\njust slotted in the pigeon lady for the shovel guy do you think that's bullshit is\n\n01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:48.060\nthat your worst nightmare that's the worst night is communicating like 11's\n\n01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.100\nlost in the upside down they have to try to communicate with why not 12 you know\n\n01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:57.500\nand when no one starts to communicate with magnets like that's like that's my\n\n01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:01.140\nworst nightmare the show I'm not interested in that at all and do you think\n\n01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:05.700\nI bet you can't answer this question honestly because it's like the question\n\n01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:10.140\nI want to ask does it like do you actually think because I know Netflix is\n\n01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:16.300\njustifiably like deified right now I mean they're like kind of beyond HBO at\n\n01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:21.740\ntheir still going peak because at HBO you could kind of there was it was still\n\n01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:27.980\nborn from a non-silicon Valley model and so now like Netflix has combined the\n\n01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:35.780\nprestige of HBO and the success of 80s NBC with the like fuck you we're doing it\n\n01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.140\ndifferent and we're not sharing our thought process of Silicon Valley and\n\n01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:43.420\nit's kind of like terrifying and tiddling I love it like I love it it gets a\n\n01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:47.300\nlittle boring hearing pitches like having a little shitty studio in Burbank\n\n01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.100\nand every time you hear a picture kind of like so where should we take this out\n\n01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:57.140\nNetflix yeah well that's like saying I'd like to be on TV please it's kind of\n\n01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.220\nlike back you're all of a sudden you're back to being ten years old but I think\n\n01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:03.780\nit's a good thing and I anyway but but but I guess what I was gonna ask but you\n\n01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:08.980\ncan't answer this is do you really think that they do you think that they would\n\n01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:14.260\nwant to see that formulaic like plugged in thing or I don't I mean ultimately I\n\n01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:19.020\nmean I do honestly they that they're they're banking on us and then like if I\n\n01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:22.460\nmake if I make an you know they're not they're not writing the show so if I make\n\n01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:25.980\nI make you know compelling I make an argument I explain why we want to do\n\n01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:30.820\nwhat we want to do they back us and so like and it's so crazy it's crazy they\n\n01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:35.620\nback this in the first I don't know why I still don't know why so yeah I mean\n\n01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.580\nyeah it was not because we we not only like went in and pitched it and say we\n\n01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:43.140\nwanted to show run it we had no there's no reason anyone would let us should let\n\n01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.620\nus show run anything and never show run or and then we never movie was literally\n\n01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.940\ndumped like no one saw it like it's on I still don't understand I mean I think\n\n01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:57.660\nI think Andy Dick had something to do with it yes there is no so they might\n\n01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:00.980\nI love that I feel like they're route like I love the rebel spirit of it like\n\n01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.860\nthat they have I don't want them to lose it you know I so and I hope that they\n\n01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:08.020\ndon't I mean because that that's what I think it's given them so much success so\n\n01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:11.660\nI just hope they keep doing it I have to keep making crazy fucking decisions yeah\n\n01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:15.260\nlike our show yeah and I don't know if they're that crazy I think it's a the\n\n01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.500\nfunny thing about TV that I've watched happen is that the definition of crazy\n\n01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:25.220\nand like breaking the mold it it's practical it's it's it's basically\n\n01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:28.980\nalgorithmic because the algorithm of television until such times they make a\n\n01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:33.340\ncomputer that can write and direct television the algorithm suggests that\n\n01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:38.900\nthe smart thing to do as like FX would say like like like like the guy who's\n\n01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:44.700\nass I kissed the most John Landgraf like when he talks about TV he goes like we\n\n01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:49.980\ndon't know how to make good TV we what we know works is statistically if you\n\n01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:53.860\njust like make deals with people that you like and you kind of like it's like\n\n01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.220\nthere's no way you just have to like keep making it and then the good stuff\n\n01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.620\nlike works and the bad stuff doesn't it's like there's a it's the same as in\n\n01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:07.300\nphysics where it's like everybody worked from making weird shit up to justify\n\n01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:12.940\nNewtonian stuff we like call Newton's laws the Nielsen's maybe and it's just\n\n01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:17.020\nlike well why is if an apple falls and hits your head which makes perfect sense\n\n01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.420\nthen how come when you turn a flashlight on in a train car the light hits the\n\n01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:25.460\nthing of oh that's easy there's a boogeyman and then Einstein is like what\n\n01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:31.700\nif blah blah blah and everyone's like no the and that's me Einstein the no it's\n\n01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:39.380\nJohn Landgraf no it's I'm drunk where's Andy the anyways I like the\n\n01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:44.820\nalgorithmic I love the possibly apocryphal story of them going of how\n\n01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:50.220\nSikharj was like people keep you know they did a spreadsheet and it said\n\n01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:55.540\nKevin Spacey and and political thrillers equals blah blah blah that even if\n\n01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:59.660\nthat's not true I don't mind living in that one shit it I know I mean that's\n\n01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:04.420\nbefore they buy that like they they run whatever numbers they run I mean I mean I\n\n01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.900\ndon't know what it is they're plugging it into something but isn't that what we\n\n01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:12.740\nwant though because we're not Jackson Pollock we want approval we want to and\n\n01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:17.300\nwe yeah yeah yeah we're good people like we punch this in and said oh this\n\n01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:21.300\nwould be good to write we wrote we're into whatever it no it was a stupid\n\n01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:25.020\nthing to write really I mean you're writing a show about I mean no one\n\n01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.620\nwanted to do when we're pitching this around you it's like it's their kids\n\n01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.300\nand they're chasing a monster they're like so it's a kid's show I'm like no\n\n01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.820\nit's not a kid's show there's also this you know what I mean like people that it\n\n01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:38.980\nwas hard for people to comprehend so it's not for us who was not writing it\n\n01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:43.300\nfrom like let's sell this and make this hit show it's like let's just try to\n\n01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.820\nwrite something that we want to see and then hopefully and then we didn't even\n\n01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:49.620\nhave whatever that Netflix we should take it Netflix we didn't even like I\n\n01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:53.340\ndidn't even dare utter it because like there's no way it just it just didn't\n\n01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:57.540\neven occur to me that that could be a possibility which oh we should take\n\n01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:00.460\nthis and sell to net like I didn't want to be an asshole and say that it just\n\n01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.780\nfelt so unrealist we're in God's earth did you think it would I don't know\n\n01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:08.540\nthat's my point we didn't know God you guys instincts are terrible yeah do you\n\n01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:13.460\nthink there would be an ABC it's fucking goofy what did we I mean what did I\n\n01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:20.100\ndon't know really naive I don't know so how did you take it to Netflix what\n\n01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.020\nyou know well the weird thing is that we actually we because we were so not\n\n01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:27.820\nestablished and then you know we were working with a producer that we liked\n\n01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:32.140\nSean Levy but he's a he's a film guys not a TV guy so it was basic it was a\n\n01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.820\nterrible package who's a terrible television package and so we were like\n\n01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:41.900\nlet's go around to studios not actually to networks which you know they're you\n\n01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.060\nknow they're the like you know like for instance a company called MRC helps fund\n\n01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:50.820\nHouse of Cards but they don't you know and then and then Netflix airs it they'd\n\n01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.780\nhelp pay for it so we're like let's get one of these people and that'll make it\n\n01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:58.860\na sexier package and so we are going around doing that and then mostly we\n\n01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:03.300\nwere getting passes we're getting a few interests and then somehow Netflix heard\n\n01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:07.100\nabout it they're the only network or anything that we ever would that we\n\n01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:10.500\npitched in the whole time like it's just heard about it well no no no I have it\n\n01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:14.500\nwhenever I know cameras everywhere yeah what I mean it was specifically it was\n\n01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.860\nlike a TV agent like at a breakfast pitching other shit to in the Netflix\n\n01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.860\nexecutive and him going oh we're looking for stuff so lucky they're like for like\n\n01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:26.500\nyoung adults we're looking for supernat we like any of these films do really well\n\n01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:30.220\npersonally it was just yeah like talking about the shit in their algorithm I\n\n01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.940\nthink oh that they're looking for and he's like well I happen to have this\n\n01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.780\nthing we have two studios who want it he's like give it to me now over the\n\n01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:39.020\nweekend and then it happened really fast and I think it helped you know how\n\n01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:42.820\nthings work like you can't get that first bite but then once one person is\n\n01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:46.860\ninterested in suddenly like oh it's a thing right like oh people like this is\n\n01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.980\nlike it's legitimate like it's legitimate we hit because we had like 12\n\n01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.020\n15 passes and then one person bought it and then suddenly I was like oh my god\n\n01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.340\nthis is amazing I was like it didn't change in a week like it's like someone\n\n01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:01.460\njust liked one person so one person liked it and then it's a snowball yeah\n\n01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:05.300\nand then and during that while I was having that snowball effect someone in\n\n01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:11.100\nNetflix heard about it so what okay so the immediate audience here I don't know\n\n01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.700\nif it's still a thing but everybody's going like okay so what do I do like like\n\n01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.780\nand I never know how to answer that question well you you obviously you\n\n01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.380\nmake something that you love and hope it just gets out that's because for us at\n\n01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:26.300\nleast for us yeah for so long yeah we were no that's what you're saying we were\n\n01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:30.980\nwriting stuff that like we thought like we'd meet with these producers or what\n\n01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.500\nnot and they're like this is what we're looking for but the weird thing are no\n\n01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:37.620\nactivity you guys are directors and writers but you did come to a point\n\n01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:42.540\nwhich is a little yeah there's a there's a there's a way to look at this in a\n\n01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:46.620\ndisheartening way which is that because directors shoot stuff and writers write\n\n01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:52.020\nkind of documents suggesting you shoot stuff later and you and you guys made a\n\n01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:56.420\ndecision to pull out of the shooting of stuff which is that advice which is\n\n01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:00.940\nchannel 101 which is like hey man yeah do what you're gonna do if you're allowed\n\n01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:04.380\nto do anything and me and me and me and you guys were like yeah let's not make\n\n01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:09.420\nshort films anymore let's like let's write scripts and that'll be the path I\n\n01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:18.060\ndon't know like it are we gonna tell are we telling these kids to go in their\n\n01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.060\nbackyard and shoot shoot home movies are we telling them to run over their\n\n01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.940\nkeyboards I mean I know that the simple answer is if you want to be a writer\n\n01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:27.420\nrun over your keyboards but you guys are our tours what tell the our tours what\n\n01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:32.220\nto do I mean I know I think you do both I mean I think it's super I mean first\n\n01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.460\nof all though I never understood that vice of like oh go shoot maybe you can do\n\n01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.900\nit now but it was like oh you anyone can go make side when these filmmakers were\n\n01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:41.740\ntalking like anyone can go make stuff now so cheap it's like no it's not like\n\n01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:45.500\nit's fucking expensive that always made me mad like you just go make some it's\n\n01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.980\nlike just to get good audio unit is expensive like it's expensive you know\n\n01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:53.380\naudio and the lights and getting the people together and like it's it ends up\n\n01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:56.460\nbeing like a big endeavor so it like always made me mad that's so easy now\n\n01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.060\nwith technology that anyone can just go out and make something it's like it's\n\n01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:02.380\nnot true and if you're not in individual effects which we're not we don't\n\n01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.740\nknow shit about visual effects like it's not you're not gonna make there's no\n\n01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.420\nthere's zero chance of making something that's gonna get you in the door like\n\n01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:12.580\nthat's just my no there's like those Sunday it's movies and shot an iPhone or\n\n01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:17.100\nwhatever like you can I think that is a route I think for it's a hard route that\n\n01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:21.500\nmost it does not it's honestly one of the hardest routes I think which is to\n\n01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:25.140\nmake those films and hope it gets into those festivals and hopes that the\n\n01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:29.020\npercentage of that that is is so small so it was awesome doing a little bit of\n\n01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:34.060\nokay but even like tangerine is like over a hundred thousand dollars I mean\n\n01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:37.100\nit's not cheap it's not like that you know you don't have 20 you don't have\n\n01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:41.260\n$50 in your pocket but I think what and what we realized is that in a part of\n\n01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:44.060\nthis was because you know when we were we're at Chapman you're going around and\n\n01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:47.300\nwe're interning at these production companies and you're reading these\n\n01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:51.260\nscripts right and these are scripts that are from people that you know we saw\n\n01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:54.300\nhad representation a lot of this stuff was they were going to pay to write this\n\n01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:58.820\nstuff and it's not very a lot of it's not very good a lot of these script in\n\n01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:03.900\nHollywood and needs content everyone needs content so it was us going if we\n\n01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.900\ncan teach ourselves how to do this then you know I think there's at least like a\n\n01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:12.380\ncool be a crack in the door that we can get through I do really believe and\n\n01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.780\nmaybe it's super nice but I feel like if you because the minute we once we wrote\n\n01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:20.580\nsomething I actually deep down thought was actually okay like it kind of worked\n\n01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:25.420\nit's it ended up set ended up eventually selling which I could like please I knew\n\n01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:29.020\nthe other stuff that we had written like I knew I just knew I mean I just like\n\n01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.940\nif I was really really honest when I saw I knew it wasn't it wasn't good enough\n\n01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:35.100\nand then when we and we got to that place and I thought it was good enough it\n\n01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:39.020\nended up selling so I feel like I feel like if you if you fail enough and you\n\n01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:43.060\nyeah you try enough and I don't know that's at least that's what worked for\n\n01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:46.940\nus I mean we we we we fumbled around for so long so we're saying that the\n\n01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:53.460\ninternet is has become such a glut that actually truly and I'm I'm not gonna\n\n01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:59.180\nagree with this yet but but but what's on the table is the idea that whereas in\n\n01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:07.820\n19 or a little 2002 when I was spouting at the most like you know you want to\n\n01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:12.740\nmake a TV show you have a camera in your pocket grab it fuck the audio make the\n\n01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:17.700\nTV show put it online keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it talent will\n\n01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:22.460\nout that we've actually hit a point maybe the the theory would be we've had a\n\n01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:28.780\npoint where it's like there's too much shit and the internet is oxygen it is\n\n01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:35.380\njust the air around us and and it's no more shocking that anybody in this room\n\n01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:41.860\nis it knows how to make a video about two people farting and and flying in the\n\n01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:47.540\nflying saucer then it is to digit like it's it doesn't matter there's too much\n\n01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:52.380\nshit to click on and everyone's got too much shit going on and like you like so\n\n01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:56.620\nwe focus on script as a document because it's sort of like part of the old\n\n01:34:56.620 --> 01:35:02.020\nworld and we like write up our idea of like fade in on this and cut to that and\n\n01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:08.300\nthis is our idea is that because the agency mechanism is still in control like\n\n01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.140\nthat it's still I mean I think that can where I think what you're saying I mean\n\n01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.940\nI think people are doing that where they're making that stuff and it's\n\n01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:18.700\ncutting through I just think it's so percentage wise right it's got to be\n\n01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.940\npretty well I mean because there's like you said there's just so much I don't\n\n01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:25.780\nknow what's going on on YouTube like I don't understand some of the stuff no\n\n01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:28.340\nbecause you'll because I'm you know I'm not even on Twitter but on you know\n\n01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.140\nwe're sort of you know I was searching Twitter to see what people are saying\n\n01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.940\nabout the show and you know you click on these people and I got like okay 10\n\n01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:38.100\nmillion followers I don't know who this YouTube star yeah so I feel like there's\n\n01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.980\na I'm sorry we should not be talking about we shouldn't be talking about it\n\n01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:45.540\nyeah I don't know right yeah yeah maybe you yeah okay yeah we shouldn't be\n\n01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.220\ntalking about it I think the world agrees yeah let's all let's all stop\n\n01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:54.140\ntalking about let's talk about race I think that alright your eyes can really\n\n01:35:54.140 --> 01:36:00.780\npop up that was craziness oh how many well how many episodes you doing season\n\n01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:06.140\ntwo nine okay which is weird but it's great it's a little warning shot what\n\n01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:09.820\nwhat's a warning is it one less than the first season well no one more okay okay\n\n01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:17.580\nit's a little gummy bear yeah it's a little nightquail yeah I don't know\n\n01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:21.900\nwhere it's a weird time to be doing this because it's one of the first times\n\n01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:25.260\nthat I can think of that you can you can come up with an idea and you can go\n\n01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:30.860\nwell this is you know this is how long the story is it's five and hours and 30\n\n01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:34.540\nminutes and 20 seconds and that's just how it is and you can actually you can\n\n01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:38.420\nactually put that out and I don't know if I can't think of another instance I\n\n01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.660\nmean usually you're you're writing to commercials or you're writing to you\n\n01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:45.340\nknow you know why are movies two hours you know is it like because you have to\n\n01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:49.580\npee I'm still trying to adjust all this because I yeah I just can't yes it's\n\n01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:53.500\nyeah it's based on some kind of thing and that's the same with the 22 minutes\n\n01:36:53.500 --> 01:37:00.100\nthe 45 minutes I'm I I'm raised in front of cheers watching TV and so I come up\n\n01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:05.140\nin the 21st century and I'm like this craftsman and I'm gonna I'm like like\n\n01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:09.660\noh this other show is shittier than mine because it's doing serialized\n\n01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:15.340\nstorytelling and that's a cheap tactic and that and now I'm in this world\n\n01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:20.740\nwhere it's like hey old man like this isn't serialized hello and I'm like oh\n\n01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:27.620\nsorry I'll try to serialize it for you but and that's I try to like shake it\n\n01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:32.260\nlike as I'm like eight feet it's it's sad if it just reminds me of like the the\n\n01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:37.300\nSNL sketch where Dana Carvey was playing Johnny Carson in a post-Arcinio\n\n01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:41.980\nworld who had had his fingers elongated because Arcinio has long fingers so it\n\n01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:48.300\nwas called Carcinio and it was Dana Carvey doing Arcinio as Johnny Carson\n\n01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:53.140\nand going like wolf wolf wolf wolf wolf that's how I feel when I think about\n\n01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:57.220\nserializing something that I'm writing like oh this is gonna be binge worthy\n\n01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.140\nand all this stuff it's like wait you I feel like I'm purposely I can't tell\n\n01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:07.500\nwhen I'm stooping when I'm evolving and when I should just retire and like like\n\n01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:11.980\nlike it's like well if I that's serialization thing is like a big\n\n01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.740\nfucking weird mind fuck for me yeah yeah but that's cuz you're growing I mean\n\n01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:19.780\nbecause we just we're different because we grew up on and I didn't grow up on\n\n01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:24.300\nwatching much TV to be honest so we grew up on on movies and and movie\n\n01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:27.860\nstructures so that's kind of what I think that's what drew us to it and also\n\n01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:31.140\nbecause the movie industry is so sad like we try to get into the movies and it\n\n01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.460\nwas just it was you know it's depressed a little depressing right now and there\n\n01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:38.900\nwas so much then TV and whenever we went to TV meetings or even not just with\n\n01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.100\nproducers who didn't movies and TV they're like well what are your TV ideas\n\n01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:47.740\nbecause they need content so desperately breaking it up and yeah we're\n\n01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:51.860\njust like yeah yeah that's basically I mean is that why the guy goes the cop\n\n01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:55.060\nguy goes to the lab and then he's like oh man there's a lab here and then they\n\n01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:59.660\nlike knock him out and then he wakes up and he's like back to being a cop is it\n\n01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:03.700\nthat's more like us writing ourselves into a whole that's what I mean kind of\n\n01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:12.460\nit's like he's like forward with that or the movie yeah really it's almost like\n\n01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:17.100\nit's like for me I mean it's a learn of the rings like I was like learn the\n\n01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:23.180\nrings great one book one movie three awesome 11 years of our lives and then\n\n01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:29.100\nthey're like now let's do the hobbit I'm like what it's three movies like so one\n\n01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:33.860\nof your movies is gonna be about riding barrels like for sure and sure enough it\n\n01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:42.100\nif I was like I was like watch out that's the barrel wizard what I'm the\n\n01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:52.260\nbarrel wizard would you like to keep riding the barrels but yeah it's okay\n\n01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:58.620\nso well at the outset of season 2 do you guys do you guys did you because you're\n\n01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:03.500\nalready I did you do an hole like like okay here's what's gonna happen from\n\n01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:07.060\nbeginning middle end in the whole season and then you chopped it up like a\n\n01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:11.300\nlittle pie yeah yeah you're pretty essentially yeah I mean but obviously it\n\n01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.500\nof it just keeps evolving and changing as you're going because once you get in\n\n01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:18.540\nthere I mean what we found at least is I can't force these characters to do\n\n01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:22.060\nsomething so sometimes we're trying to force someone to go in a direction and\n\n01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:25.820\nit's like well they just don't want to do that that feels stupid and so then then\n\n01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.980\nit just keeps changing and evolving but if we know where the end it where we're\n\n01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:33.580\ngoing eventually that's that's the goal and the same thing with season 2 it's\n\n01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:38.140\njust keeps it keeps evolving but we know where we know what that destination is\n\n01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.580\ncan I pitch you guys something yes you probably you probably don't like when\n\n01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:53.740\nthis happens but it's not like I'm a waiter I made community and I know you\n\n01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:58.180\ndon't want to be pigeonholed as the 80s guys but you know encyclopedia brown\n\n01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:05.780\ncuz I just want to make encyclopedia brown but like Chinatown like like like\n\n01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:10.900\nhe's the smartest kid on the block which means he has ass burgers but he's and\n\n01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.860\nhe's like it's hard for him to deal with people but he can solve crimes and it's\n\n01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:17.620\nlike but it's hardcore like them so it's a it's like that he's like a kid\n\n01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.900\ndetective hey who stole your bike I found it out it's the mystery of the\n\n01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:25.940\nmissing bike and then like every good film noir movie he like some grown-up\n\n01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:30.020\ncomes

01:41:37.340\nDuffer brothers thing I'll just write it like you guys can like I don't want to be\n\n01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:41.780\nfamous anymore I want to retire so like like you guys like it's a
