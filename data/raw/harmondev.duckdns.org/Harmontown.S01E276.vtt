00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello, one and all. Thank you for tuning in for beautiful Uptown Burbank.

00:15.920 --> 00:34.760
Harmontown is now in session. Let's welcome the stage to Game Master Spencer

00:34.760 --> 00:44.240
Crittenden as he bounds to the stage nimbly like a mountain goat with his bag

00:44.240 --> 01:02.280
of holding things yeah yeah yeah rapid on the top of my head like butter top

01:02.280 --> 01:06.680
bread coming out at the top of the show it's gonna help your mind and your body

01:06.680 --> 01:12.000
and soul grow I'm a motherfucking rap master I saw your mama's ass and blasted

01:12.000 --> 01:16.200
with my penis but it was consensual oh shit it was more than that it was

01:16.200 --> 01:24.120
sensual I took her out to great America it's a theme park oh we had a good time

01:24.120 --> 01:31.200
we had a pretty good time excuse me what's going on up there oh it's

01:31.200 --> 01:34.680
Schrab all right cut the music Schrab is just hurrying you from the background I

01:34.680 --> 01:37.880
don't know I think he's he's hurrying someone else is so loudly that it

01:37.880 --> 01:41.280
sounded like he was hurrying the show well it sounded like that was more than

01:41.280 --> 01:45.240
consensual that it was actually achieved sensual yeah that's kind of cheating it

01:45.240 --> 01:52.880
rhyme-wise but not politically her name wasn't Swaila her name was conswaila I

01:52.880 --> 01:59.920
got I got into the Uber to come here tonight and you still taking those

01:59.920 --> 02:07.080
Ubers huh all right I gotta work on that I gotta take lifts I don't know what it

02:07.080 --> 02:11.440
is it's like a weird I don't know I don't know what I'm clinging to I think

02:11.440 --> 02:15.800
it's just that I think it's that the Ubers in Los Angeles they're like big

02:15.800 --> 02:22.520
vehicles with guys that are like yeah it's the it's the social thing it's the

02:22.520 --> 02:27.440
distance like though I took a I the last time I took a lift I told the story I

02:27.440 --> 02:32.200
think at least I know I told it on Twitter it like the guy didn't he was

02:32.200 --> 02:37.240
I yeah I sit with my foot tucked under my butt the guy was like he spent the first

02:37.240 --> 02:45.520
half of the ride complaining about how the area was being gentrified and then

02:45.520 --> 02:49.240
the second half of the ride was consumed by this weird moment where he asked me

02:49.240 --> 02:55.240
to not put my foot on his upholstery it was like a like a it was like a not a

02:55.240 --> 03:01.240
good car were you taking regular lifts yeah it wasn't like lift lift asshole or

03:01.240 --> 03:06.440
you should be taking lift hot shots it was I mean that this guy was you know

03:06.440 --> 03:09.640
what he may have accepted the fare from the regular lift maybe he's usually

03:09.640 --> 03:14.440
only available to lift hot shot but it was like I guess I shouldn't use that

03:14.440 --> 03:18.400
as an excuse like lots of lift drivers are but it was like Jesus Christ man like

03:18.400 --> 03:21.720
there's something there's some line you cross with lift and I think this is

03:21.720 --> 03:26.560
probably an LA thing it just seems like Uber continues to be basically Armenian

03:26.560 --> 03:31.680
limo limo drivers who are like making money and they're spare time and it's

03:31.680 --> 03:35.920
not that they're do you get black car or do you get like regular Uber I got I get

03:35.920 --> 03:41.000
I get I get I get the I get the like I get the fancy thing yeah because I just

03:41.000 --> 03:44.400
I just the distance it's the emotional distance I just wherever I'm going I

03:44.400 --> 03:48.720
just want to be left alone for the ride you know as I put my earphones in and

03:48.720 --> 03:56.240
there's a little small talk you know like tonight halfway halfway there how did

03:56.240 --> 04:08.360
he phrase it the guy said let's take a look here he said you go to the Starbucks

04:09.560 --> 04:13.560
but that wasn't making small talk like yeah do you like do you like to do

04:13.560 --> 04:17.400
things like yeah I think he was probably saying like why are you driving 15 miles

04:17.400 --> 04:22.160
to a Starbucks isn't aren't there nine of them around your house is like no it's

04:22.160 --> 04:28.400
the star burns I was like oh did he make did he make a five stars

04:28.400 --> 04:34.920
you make a five stars yeah I know well they always make five stars or whatever

04:34.920 --> 04:38.840
now I said I gotta be a yeah I don't know there's no better way to do that

04:38.840 --> 04:44.600
either right like it you the only time that you these like you pick up your

04:44.600 --> 04:48.520
phone and you're gonna you're gonna call a ride and then you have to go through

04:48.520 --> 04:54.120
this like deposition about your last ride which was probably two days ago did

04:54.120 --> 04:59.000
did did Armand do a good job like did you do and now there's like tipping and

04:59.000 --> 05:04.240
all this shit and I'm not complaining about anything that's the good news like

05:04.240 --> 05:11.000
I'm so I'm so I'm so low I know low is not the word I'm Schrab like I'm like you

05:11.000 --> 05:15.160
know remember how I was two weeks ago yeah yeah I'm kind of in that Schrab zone

05:15.160 --> 05:18.960
but you're a little bit of a funk it might be because Schrab came over today

05:18.960 --> 05:23.400
that's a good thing right maybe I got Schrab do you think he he he flunked some

05:23.400 --> 05:27.840
Schrabbins on you maybe I'm coming down from John Mayer whoa how about that show

05:27.840 --> 05:32.360
let's talk about let's talk about our show oh yeah I go away and all of a

05:32.360 --> 05:37.960
sudden you have John Mayer on your show that guy's body's a wonderland did you

05:37.960 --> 05:45.520
listen to the to the episode I listened to like probably half of it it has the

05:45.520 --> 05:49.040
Steve Levyme feel of approval yeah leave me leave me leave me leave me

05:49.040 --> 05:52.440
feels and I don't know who's supposed to be insulted by this but I can tell he

05:52.440 --> 05:57.760
thinks like now that John Mayer's been on like we're six months from what could

05:57.760 --> 06:04.200
be coming on yeah maybe we could get advice on on how to make a Wikipedia from

06:04.200 --> 06:10.200
them can I can I embarrass myself what's DMB Dave Matthews band but I but I

06:10.200 --> 06:14.720
don't want to insult Dave Matthews band I didn't embarrass myself I don't want

06:14.720 --> 06:18.520
to insult John Mayer that I don't have I don't care about music I really like

06:18.520 --> 06:24.960
John Mayer he was a Jew I wasn't I was making I was just leavey is leavey is a

06:24.960 --> 06:29.720
very big Dave Matthews fan so much so that he calls them the DMB and before

06:29.720 --> 06:33.640
you make fun of him for it everyone it's it's something he used to go to with his

06:33.640 --> 06:37.120
dad and his brother and now his dad's dead so fuck oh so there's sentimentality

06:37.120 --> 06:41.520
there yeah okay that's okay but you know if Dave Matthews is listening it's not

06:41.520 --> 06:46.360
prowess yeah I mean there's a they they rock that heart anyway I don't want Dave

06:46.360 --> 06:50.080
Matthews to be listening and he's like oh cool this guy's a fan and then it's

06:50.080 --> 06:53.520
like oh cuz his dad died and then Dave Matthews is like what's it's not my

06:53.520 --> 06:57.760
chords somebody's somebody hum me a Dave Matthews band song Steve yell out a

06:57.760 --> 07:27.720
Dave Matthews this is dead on just if you

07:27.720 --> 07:30.600
don't know somebody got to put that to a beat we got to get Rob Tanchum on that

07:30.600 --> 07:36.000
one did it was called Dave Matthews band yeah David sounds more like donkey

07:36.000 --> 07:40.920
Matthews band that's not like that sounded like an emotional donkey that's

07:40.920 --> 07:44.680
a way to speaking of emotions Dan you know people could connect themselves to

07:44.680 --> 07:48.320
bands because there's sentimental value to it because you went to the show with

07:48.320 --> 07:52.400
your father or you grew up listening to it and you know you're your stepmom's

07:52.400 --> 07:57.240
house or whatever and you have these emotional connections to things that

07:57.240 --> 08:02.880
maybe you wouldn't have otherwise like sports for instance like people can get

08:02.880 --> 08:06.360
patriotic about like I'm a dodger's fangs I'm from LA and they get their

08:06.360 --> 08:10.920
assholes about it or Yankees fans or whoever wherever you're from but some

08:10.920 --> 08:14.280
people can just love the San Francisco Giants because that's where their father

08:14.280 --> 08:20.520
took them when they were little before the father died so I don't know if you

08:20.520 --> 08:24.840
have any special emotional connections to any sports teams I just wish the

08:24.840 --> 08:28.840
Eagles would finally get a Superbowl win

08:43.720 --> 08:47.400
obviously the you know I'm not gonna pretend I didn't hear about it you

08:47.400 --> 08:52.880
can't you can't you can't avoid it the Eagles won it was their first win ever

08:52.880 --> 08:56.760
literally ever their first Superbowl win in the history of the franchise a

08:56.760 --> 09:03.200
franchise that has got to be whoo who knows how old yeah for 80,000 years what

09:03.200 --> 09:07.640
what stood out for you watching the game most like what was the most capital Y

09:07.640 --> 09:11.720
yardage like so much that's how they want if you if you go back play by play

09:11.720 --> 09:15.880
the Eagles had more yardage that's how they won the Patriots were short on

09:15.880 --> 09:22.480
yardage they didn't ice their knees and they came in over confident why oh they

09:22.480 --> 09:25.760
thought they have more yardage from previous games yardage only counts game

09:25.760 --> 09:30.560
for game yeah you you you you you you tabulated throughout the season you're

09:30.560 --> 09:33.680
trying to figure out like what teams have a better chance of winning but that

09:33.680 --> 09:38.600
can be a blessing or a curse in my opinion Jeff and I am I am I'm sorry this

09:38.600 --> 09:45.320
is just one man's opinion I think that the Patriots came in fucking thinking we

09:45.320 --> 09:51.520
got the yardage they but what they failed to understand is that every team starts

09:51.520 --> 09:58.560
every game with zero yardage that's a technical fact what do you think this

09:58.560 --> 10:03.440
loss this loss for the Patriots means for Tom Brady going forward well

10:03.440 --> 10:08.600
obviously Tom Brady's gonna have a lot of recovery to do his many injuries

10:08.600 --> 10:12.040
throughout the game like are just the beginning of it he's also now got

10:12.040 --> 10:15.640
injuries related to his leadership I don't know if he sides press conference

10:15.640 --> 10:23.640
after the game but he cited practice and coaching and teammanship and you know

10:23.640 --> 10:29.600
but what people wanted to hear from him really was leadership first which he did

10:29.600 --> 10:33.600
mention but he'd mentioned in the wrong order and so Brady's gonna have to

10:33.600 --> 10:36.400
circle back and he's gonna have to think am I the person that needs to lead

10:36.400 --> 10:39.360
these Patriots he's only five years younger than you are right now he might

10:39.360 --> 10:44.200
be the oldest quarterback in Super Bowl history like what are you asking if he's

10:44.200 --> 10:48.320
the quarterback what do you even know anything about sports of course Tom

10:48.320 --> 10:52.040
Brady's the quarterback of the Patriots I'm saying do you think that what does this

10:52.040 --> 10:56.800
mean for him he's famous for wearing one of a glove like a weird colored glove

10:56.800 --> 11:01.880
or that's a different player okay all right shit do you think do you think he

11:01.880 --> 11:04.960
ought to retire after this one should he hang up his hang up his weird color

11:04.960 --> 11:08.160
glove or should he should he bring it back next season I think I think you know

11:08.160 --> 11:12.640
look this is a dangerous sport you know no matter how many times you ice your

11:12.640 --> 11:17.360
knee you're still going out there and not only risking concussion but actually

11:17.360 --> 11:21.360
statistically just accumulating concussion and spine injury on behalf of

11:21.360 --> 11:24.520
a corporation that's gonna spend the off season deciding whether there should be

11:24.520 --> 11:27.360
a rule against you kneeling during the fucking national anthem which is kind

11:27.360 --> 11:35.560
of an insult so let's go into politics quarter yeah how was that I don't like

11:35.560 --> 11:39.160
really think of the irony of that imagine being a football player and knowing

11:39.160 --> 11:44.080
that the NFL commissioner is gonna is gonna spend this off season thinking

11:44.080 --> 11:51.920
about rules against protests on the field clever move always the the anti

11:51.920 --> 11:58.520
protest rule hadn't thought of that the these are these and then that concurrently

11:58.520 --> 12:03.760
like is all this good concussion information is coming out like like not

12:03.760 --> 12:07.880
that it's never been there but it's just it's right there and the zeitgeist right

12:07.880 --> 12:14.200
next to the fact that these are people who are not allowed to express in a

12:14.200 --> 12:18.960
completely peaceful way that arguably deferent still to the national anthem the

12:18.960 --> 12:24.520
fact that while they were lucky enough and talented enough to end up where they

12:24.520 --> 12:28.080
are with everyone paying attention to them they'd like to risk their entire

12:28.080 --> 12:32.400
career and reputation saying yeah but I'm not comfortable what's going on back

12:32.400 --> 12:36.840
in my hometown I don't like the policies I'm I'm so I'm gonna kneel during this

12:36.840 --> 12:42.160
national anthem as if in deference to my fallen brethren because I don't want to

12:42.160 --> 12:46.880
privilege to turn me into someone who turns their back on on their fellow man

12:46.880 --> 12:51.400
and and and that's caused such a stir because we love to show up and watch

12:51.400 --> 12:55.800
these guys injure themselves until they're like basically dead at 40

12:55.800 --> 13:00.880
physically because they've their brain has been concussed so many times their

13:00.880 --> 13:06.240
spine slowly mangled he's talking to you Tom Brady it's kind of fucking

13:06.240 --> 13:11.080
ironic isn't it especially when the two teams in the Super Bowl are the

13:11.080 --> 13:16.080
Patriots and the Eagles yeah they could have been the Des Moines Star Spangled

13:16.080 --> 13:23.360
Banners the Uncle Sam's yeah all right well look I don't have anything let's

13:23.360 --> 13:29.160
put the Trenton Apple pies I don't know

13:29.160 --> 13:33.640
shit Steve Levyme just came down hard on Tom Brady yeah I don't I don't I don't

13:33.640 --> 13:39.960
know who Tom Brady is in case that wasn't clear wasn't he in in Mad Max all

13:39.960 --> 13:47.200
right was yeah he was mad Max all right well let's bring up tonight's guest

13:47.200 --> 13:50.920
she's scared the life out of me I can't think of a better way to follow up our

13:50.920 --> 13:57.040
award-winning show just emerged like a specter then a visit from from the

13:57.040 --> 14:01.320
always surprising find your find your camera find your camera you know for

14:01.320 --> 14:06.960
five dollars a month subscribers you can you can see the creepiest entrance of

14:06.960 --> 14:14.680
all time it's certainly something I have I have a question rub Schrab everybody

14:14.680 --> 14:21.600
Schrabs in the house Schrabs in the house I've a question I've spent I have a

14:21.600 --> 14:27.000
speculation about like the kneeling during the sports you think they're

14:27.000 --> 14:31.280
okay oh you think they're tired what you think they're tired it's not what

14:31.280 --> 14:35.400
you're gonna say no no I have a question okay so Republicans don't like it when

14:35.400 --> 14:41.880
the black people kneel they can't stand it right they hate it okay what if they

14:41.880 --> 14:49.880
kneeled during something that we liked right like adoption welfare you know

14:49.880 --> 14:53.400
like you'll during welfare yeah they could like somebody's handing over a

14:53.400 --> 15:05.520
welfare check what if we go what if we go to their churches while they're

15:05.520 --> 15:09.760
praying and we all just kneel no no no we're already kneeling what do they

15:09.760 --> 15:14.840
what what I'm curious I would like to if I had one of them here I'm like okay

15:14.840 --> 15:18.720
we're gonna kneel during that what would you kneel I think it would be very

15:18.720 --> 15:23.360
telling yeah I mean oh yeah well you know their answer would be would be

15:23.360 --> 15:29.560
amazing but the but the general class warfare truth is that of course no one

15:29.560 --> 15:34.000
no one cares when an old white man kneels like the if he if he does it let's

15:34.000 --> 15:40.040
let's think about it this is this is like this is like seeds for a comedy

15:40.040 --> 15:44.240
well I'm not gonna think about I'm not gonna riff what they would think they

15:44.240 --> 15:48.520
should kneel during because it'll be a list of racist shit that because they'll

15:48.520 --> 15:51.760
be like what do black people like I don't want to do that I don't want to

15:51.760 --> 15:56.320
riff a list of what black people like no I don't I've had a hard enough year name

15:56.320 --> 16:01.400
just play it safe just name it like of the top 100 things you think black

16:01.400 --> 16:05.080
people would like a cast a widen that just put three things in there that you

16:05.080 --> 16:10.040
could have said during the Oscars you know like the Republicans don't like

16:10.040 --> 16:21.560
you're pretty confident that all black people would see he's off on that track so

16:21.560 --> 16:27.160
okay well I'm really the Republicans what do Republicans not like what do

16:27.160 --> 16:30.800
republicans not like that they would that they would kneel while you were

16:30.800 --> 16:40.760
doing they like that's what I mean gay marriage certificate right during a game

16:40.760 --> 16:50.160
that's great I don't think old white people again the reason why young

16:50.160 --> 16:57.720
athletic black men kneeling is is causing a hysteria is because they're

16:57.720 --> 17:01.280
doing it in front of everybody who might get bad ideas because everyone's

17:01.280 --> 17:05.800
watching them because they have the power to go out okay let's bring let's

17:05.800 --> 17:11.200
figure it out let's figure out what's another thing besides sports that

17:11.200 --> 17:17.160
everybody's watching another thing the news the Oscars the Oscar the Nancy

17:17.160 --> 17:22.520
great Oscars the Nancy Drew Mysteries pilot that's about to air Riverdale

17:22.520 --> 17:27.760
Riverdale if the Riverdale people were dealing the 2.0

17:27.760 --> 17:32.160
Cloverfield paradox on Netflix they could they could kneel during that there's

17:32.160 --> 17:36.680
probably an Iron Man movie coming Game of Thrones during Game of Thrones yeah

17:36.680 --> 17:41.960
everybody could kneel during that stuff the fuck this is hilarious Rob this is

17:41.960 --> 17:49.240
great so that'll jump junior like tweets like ah wow that crocodile Dundee reboot

17:49.240 --> 18:02.680
looks pretty good we should have we should have Danny McBride out here yeah

18:02.680 --> 18:07.120
he's working on the trailer as far as I couldn't tell if it was a Toyota

18:07.120 --> 18:12.960
commercial or a or a a tourism ad which it was for Australia but it also was a

18:12.960 --> 18:17.680
tie-in to the to promoting this film would they're making a Dundee movie I

18:17.680 --> 18:20.320
don't want to shock you I haven't I haven't I haven't seen this thing you

18:20.320 --> 18:24.120
talking about the Super Bowl they got Danny McBride and was it Hemmings was

18:24.120 --> 18:27.280
his name Chris Hemmings Chris Hemmings and they're doing a Paul Hogan they're

18:27.280 --> 18:31.280
doing they're doing a run did Paul Hogan isn't it they're doing a Dundee reboot

18:31.280 --> 18:37.880
yeah and I'll say what I'm going so is Donald Trump Jr. he's like enjoy your

18:37.880 --> 18:47.360
popcorn I can't wait he's putting bibs under his eyes now what you're gonna do

18:47.360 --> 18:53.560
what if he goes to the movie and there's Kenny Powers is not a hero what if he

18:53.560 --> 18:57.520
goes to the movie and he can and in the movie Danny McBride comes out of a river

18:57.520 --> 19:02.760
and he wrestles a crocodile and then while he's wrestling it he says like I'm

19:02.760 --> 19:05.960
trying to I'm trying to riff a joke that would be like in a comedy movie that was

19:05.960 --> 19:10.600
like like like the crocodile like bites him and runs away and then he goes like

19:10.600 --> 19:14.560
oh so you're you're you're gonna you're gonna take the electoral vote results

19:14.560 --> 19:19.560
huh and then like so then is Donald Trump Jr. gonna then get back on Twitter

19:19.560 --> 19:24.760
and go I'd like to recant like I was very disappointed he wouldn't express that

19:24.760 --> 19:27.160
right because it would be an admission of weakness because it would mean that

19:27.160 --> 19:30.880
he was capable of being wrong about I think he would say I was having a good

19:30.880 --> 19:41.240
time with my bros watching Danny McBride Dundee and then they had to typically do

19:41.240 --> 19:48.680
this below the belt stuff during my Danny McBride and just ruined my evening

19:48.680 --> 19:54.680
me and my wife and my bras we had to get out of there and just we just had to go

19:54.680 --> 19:59.240
home and I had to put an ice pack on Donald Trump Jr. and I just hated it

19:59.240 --> 20:04.640
Donald you're trying to enjoy yourself and the Hollywood elite DJ's gonna come

20:04.640 --> 20:12.000
on DJ's we are below the belt DJ get back to the DJ our car is here poop all over my Danny McBride

20:12.000 --> 20:17.920
Donnie you're embarrassing bullshit and it's stupid and it's entitlist and it's

20:17.920 --> 20:26.000
and it's it is fucking just inappropriate I hate it I hate it yes

20:26.000 --> 20:38.600
Eric donnie I'm just saying get back in the car you're embarrassing yourself there's

20:38.600 --> 20:41.920
an interesting point there which is that or the least interesting point of all

20:41.920 --> 20:45.320
because you notice that it's like all this whole like the liberal media and

20:45.320 --> 20:48.520
the liberal entertainers and the comedians like oh we will we don't like

20:48.520 --> 20:51.560
the thing and then the and then you notice all the I think I think there is

20:51.560 --> 20:55.480
like a theme there where it's like that is exactly how we'd react he'd react as

20:55.480 --> 21:00.600
if he was entitled big to this movie and the and that this horrible choice had

21:00.600 --> 21:06.000
been made that didn't have to be made you didn't have to go there what a shame

21:06.000 --> 21:08.840
which is exactly what kneeling before the anthem as well why do they have to

21:08.840 --> 21:14.320
this this game of football where my corporation owns these gladiators who

21:14.320 --> 21:19.720
go out and mangle their spines for me like it was it was perfect it's already

21:19.720 --> 21:25.240
fine who cares that everyone doing it has this opinion just get rid of that

21:25.240 --> 21:29.680
opinion I think that's so inconvenient so stupid of them like how why would they

21:29.680 --> 21:34.120
want to do that to a great game like football they are the game of football

21:34.120 --> 21:38.240
like what are you gonna do without them I guess you'll replace them with like

21:38.240 --> 21:42.760
worse football players that love the national anthem I didn't I don't want

21:42.760 --> 21:46.440
sports did they need did anybody I don't know I don't know what's going on I

21:46.440 --> 21:50.360
didn't see any kneeling there was some arm-linking a couple guys one guy was

21:50.360 --> 21:53.600
just like some people looked away some people didn't have their hands on their

21:53.600 --> 21:56.360
hearts which will probably be the next new illegal thing I'll tell you one

21:56.360 --> 22:02.480
thing that I found very impious NFL National Football League I found Justin

22:02.480 --> 22:07.280
Timberlake's outfits with his band a little a little hoboey little racy a

22:07.280 --> 22:10.720
little hoboey too much skin as Doug Benson or I think so I think was like

22:10.720 --> 22:16.200
Benson said he looked like a cowboy house painter and the church what was

22:16.200 --> 22:25.240
yours church a blood because he had a red one he had a red band on she goes is

22:25.240 --> 22:30.240
he a blood now or he just come back from the groom yeah I love that that's an

22:30.240 --> 22:34.040
actual like groomer thing like I did I thought that was one groomer thing of

22:34.040 --> 22:38.520
them like yeah I don't know if you're a laboratory you come back you come back

22:38.520 --> 22:44.040
with a red handkerchief on I'm sure you went on look here's the thing I'm not

22:44.040 --> 22:51.720
talking shit about J. Tim about T. Lakes T. Lakes I just T. Lakes is good

22:51.720 --> 23:00.000
J. Lakes J. Lakes J. Timberlake's he put on a good fucking program it went on for

23:00.000 --> 23:03.560
a thousand years and I feel like they recycled costumes from the last Super

23:03.560 --> 23:06.760
Bowl because there's a lot of people wearing primary colors but he did a

23:06.760 --> 23:12.000
good job was the last one Lady Gaga because that motherfucker as you can

23:12.000 --> 23:18.120
rewind to my podcast I I watched the Lady Gaga performance I mean he like

23:18.120 --> 23:22.640
that's some shit I wouldn't follow that shit yeah she stood up on the rim of the

23:22.640 --> 23:27.000
arena and then she again you know I don't love it if you're a fan of the

23:27.000 --> 23:32.880
podcast I don't want to bore you but she dove off now many many artists have been

23:32.880 --> 23:41.840
on wires Garth Brooks Beyonce Peter by your man no I've never seen anybody do

23:41.840 --> 23:48.000

23:48.000 --> 23:52.480
the air like she was like she was she was doing I was like that's what I do if I

23:52.480 --> 23:56.920
was on a wire I think I'd like to think she was like panicking well no she was

23:56.920 --> 24:00.840
like she was acting like she was falling you know is that the name of it was

24:00.840 --> 24:04.880
their song is their song has to do with falling they probably didn't have to do

24:04.880 --> 24:09.080
with football I don't know it doesn't matter what is it I don't I'm gonna get

27:24.240 --> 27:35.360

27:42.320 --> 27:48.400
everybody ate them all hey all of them I ate I ate a few Spencer I didn't look

27:48.400 --> 27:51.120
too closely because it's Instagram when you can't it's hard to zoom and see the

27:51.120 --> 27:54.480
thing but it looked like little little Statue of Liberty heads they had spikes

27:54.480 --> 27:59.440
on them they were hellions hellions yeah they're like big worms they have but

27:59.440 --> 28:06.680

28:34.280 --> 28:38.480
and and it's nice and you get like a little jolt of oh that feels good I'm

28:38.480 --> 28:41.840
being cared about I don't want to be addicted to that I don't be addicted to

28:41.840 --> 28:47.040
the bad city to the pep talk so I'm I'm gonna try to be a little bit more

28:47.040 --> 28:50.920
private about it hmm I wouldn't want to receive that I would I would taste that

28:50.920 --> 28:55.880
I don't like it poison not because of their intent that would be like I'm so

28:55.880 --> 28:59.960
embarrassed I accidentally I got so drunk I tweeted I want out you know all I

28:59.960 --> 29:05.720
want is out Courtney love yeah direct message right Cody I was so I mean

29:05.720 --> 29:10.320
that's the height of your responsibility she can she can take you out yeah that's

29:10.320 --> 29:16.760
why she said it I could be there in 20 minutes she yeah I've done for a nice

29:16.760 --> 29:24.000
meal or have you she or the other take is that she's been through enough and to

29:24.000 --> 29:30.400
raise her alarm bells is an incredibly irresponsible waste of her empathy in

29:30.400 --> 29:35.280
any case it was very embarrassing I have that hits me is like oh shit I fucked

29:35.280 --> 29:40.160
up at 45 years old don't don't don't ever make people think that they have to

29:40.160 --> 29:44.760
waste their energy on you that when when there it's already hard enough to give

29:44.760 --> 29:48.680
it to other people like I you know I like I like throwing pity parties for

29:48.680 --> 29:56.240
myself but it's more like you know it's like it's a pity party I was just

29:56.240 --> 30:01.160
honest about it but I don't want to get into a habit of it because it it becomes

30:01.160 --> 30:05.440
a snowball you become addicted to the pep talk and and you don't you move

30:05.440 --> 30:09.960
forward to me I just I have to live through this I have to find some way to

30:09.960 --> 30:19.600
get out of it and I know that and and I'll be fine I'm I'm you know I'm I'm

30:19.600 --> 30:24.240

33:17.120 --> 33:24.160
this memo what's the what the memo and I go well as far as I can tell the memo

33:24.160 --> 33:28.760
is and Cody comes in Cody's been sick for three days in my bed she emerges like

33:28.760 --> 33:32.920
with a banana and an aspirin or something and Rob's like what why didn't

33:32.920 --> 33:36.360

33:36.360 --> 33:40.640
not interrupting anything I want to hear about the memo too I don't get the

33:40.640 --> 33:44.840
fucking memo that was the funny part of my day is I accidentally found myself in

33:44.840 --> 33:50.640
the position of explaining the memo to people that were like the rest of us all

33:50.640 --> 33:55.040
seeking clarity on the fucking stupid ass memo and if you're listening to this

33:55.040 --> 33:58.280
three years in the future because you're catching up on 500 episodes of Harmon

33:58.280 --> 34:01.720
don't bother trying to parse it there was a there was this point during the

34:01.720 --> 34:06.960
fucking six-year remake of the Nixon administration where this fucking sub

34:06.960 --> 34:14.120
sub sub plot about some dude in the woods in the north of the wall called the

34:14.120 --> 34:20.120
Nunez memo is happening and and no and and it was it was dumb but yeah I can't

34:20.120 --> 34:23.240
I can't really explain that I mean if you're listening to this three years in

34:23.240 --> 34:29.200
the future this is 2018 this is back in a time when money was still frothy mm-hmm

34:29.200 --> 34:35.200
and yeah and Rob was still I was still a Cheapy Peepy I do recommend for that

34:35.200 --> 34:39.120
reason like listen again to slow burn it's the it takes you through the Nixon

34:39.120 --> 34:42.960
administration and it's not in a cheeky way it's just it's just it's it's a

34:42.960 --> 34:46.920
little bit comforting sometimes it's a little sometimes it kind of bums you out

34:46.920 --> 34:53.880
but it like it's like it's just it just walks you through the six-year

34:53.880 --> 35:04.560
administration of an administration kind of destined to impeach and it's

35:04.560 --> 35:09.440
interesting how long it takes and how many B stories are due to I was just

35:09.440 --> 35:14.720
reminded in like the second to last episode that Spiro Agnew was the vice

35:14.720 --> 35:23.040
president and he had to step down because of a completely unrelated scandal

35:23.040 --> 35:27.040
that he just had going on on the side he was just like he was like a money

35:27.040 --> 35:32.160
launderer and a bribe taker and stuff and he he got caught doing it and he

35:32.160 --> 35:36.440
just had to step down from the vice presidency amid the Watergate shit like

35:36.440 --> 35:41.160
it just happened as a side order of potatoes some rice balls that came to

35:41.160 --> 35:44.840
the to the table you think a guy with a name like Spiro Agnew would have a shit

35:44.840 --> 35:48.720
together yeah he would like he would have built a fortress around any mistake

35:48.720 --> 35:53.600
he might like he would be the most reliable person gotta have a cybernetic

35:53.600 --> 36:06.640
hand yeah I am spear new surrender to me Spiro Agnew all right Spiro Agnew is online I have

36:06.640 --> 36:11.960

36:11.960 --> 36:26.560
deposition to the compliance of my Spiros okay I will Agnew in 10 9 8 7 6 you

36:36.440 --> 36:47.320
Tablerosa I will now authorize to use lethal force it's a little less dramatic

36:47.320 --> 36:55.440
than the 209 knocked over my cup but more silent and less lethal I am the more

36:55.440 --> 37:00.240
superior version of my foot my foot sorry about that is it true that you're

37:00.240 --> 37:03.400
being asked to resign from the vice presidency I will now step down from the

37:03.400 --> 37:07.720
vice presidency to do a totally unrelated but parallel scandal involving the

37:07.720 --> 37:14.800
White House and I will be replaced with Gerald Ford and then and then after Dan

37:14.800 --> 37:19.520

40:41.480 --> 40:45.040
over what may or may not have been its boundaries he did at one point just for

40:45.040 --> 40:49.680
one moment in the entire podcast he as a as a placeholder within a joke he's like

40:49.680 --> 40:54.000
yeah and say for instance I did say like your body is a what and he like sang he

40:54.000 --> 40:59.040

40:59.040 --> 41:04.080
professional vocalist you ask him you should have asked him to can you do my

41:04.080 --> 41:09.080

41:39.840 --> 41:45.400
seconds to pull up the ability for someone to leave your outgoing message

41:45.400 --> 41:49.240

agree with you there pickles I thought that John mayor bursting into sobs during

falling from the sky suffering from some kind of mercury poisoning that they've

50:39.800 --> 50:48.520
absorbed in the clouds Roger Harmon's John has the story this is Roger Herman

50:48.520 --> 50:54.160
stuck the expression is birds of a feather fly together but these birds will

50:54.160 --> 50:59.680
only fall together as long as they keep inhaling mercury it seems droplets of

50:59.680 --> 51:07.240
the formerly celebrated substance known as quick silver have been poisoned by

51:07.240 --> 51:13.440
noxious fumes purportedly coming from this factory behind me that's absolutely

51:13.440 --> 51:19.000
ridiculous we've burned every thermometer in the building Bill Bill is the

51:19.000 --> 51:25.360
proprietor of bills mercury burners a factory that claims it is not responsible

51:25.360 --> 51:29.520
for the mercury in the clouds yes we take we make thermometers here and we

51:29.520 --> 51:33.320
realize that that's probably where the mercury comes from so we took all the

51:33.320 --> 51:37.120
thermometers that we have and we burned them we burned every thermometer and all

51:37.120 --> 51:42.080
the all the mercury got burned up and went went away went away went up went up

51:42.080 --> 51:46.000
the chimney what do you say to the American people when they say

51:46.000 --> 51:51.440
thermometers have mercury in them I think when you burn them the mercury

51:51.440 --> 52:00.520

54:03.080 --> 54:07.520
commercial for a big-ass movie like is he gonna be in Han Solo friend Lando

54:07.520 --> 54:16.600
Calrissian playing young Lando directed by Ron Howard now now because because our

54:16.600 --> 54:23.080
old friends got fired and replaced with my new friend Ron Howard hell yeah who

54:23.080 --> 54:29.240

54:34.640 --> 54:39.080
Calrissian you think he's gonna call him Han like he does in the movies and

54:39.080 --> 54:43.640
you'll play with Han everyone else close them on you must have heard about my

54:43.640 --> 54:51.040
little maneuver back at the battle of to Ned and solo you old pirate I'm just

54:51.040 --> 54:56.640
doing I'm doing my impression of your impression I like it Jeff Davis that

54:56.640 --> 55:02.520
impression of Billy Dee Williams is fantastic Dan Harmon your impression of

55:02.520 --> 55:09.480
me doing Lando Calrissian is a bad impression of Howard Cossel Jeff Davis

55:09.480 --> 55:15.040
your Howard Cossel sounds like Catherine Hepburn

55:16.920 --> 55:25.600
oh Rob could you do this is a tough ask you can say no this is not a UCB class

55:25.600 --> 55:31.320
do you think you could do Dave Matthews band but sung as Catherine Hepburn like

55:31.320 --> 55:48.320
could you combine those two things yeah okay yeah I mean it's not the question

55:48.320 --> 55:51.520
you should have asked us would it be entertaining I still don't know who Dave

55:51.520 --> 55:56.000
Matthews band I'm sure if I heard a song that it's an actual song oh I swear to

55:56.000 --> 55:59.160
God that's the closest I can come to evens there's not it's not like they don't

55:59.160 --> 56:02.800
have a hook they were the band that the bus took a poop off a bridge and people

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:30.560
know and it's about this this older man like falling in love with this young

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:41.640
boy oh 17 17 16 actually I think and and and and and I'm like okay all right

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.200
fine all right whatever it's I'm a little uncomfortable because the kids

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:57.600
underage and it's very romantic then when it gets to the child fucking 17 17 I'm

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.960
not defending child fucking keep going keep going just I I'm sitting there

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.920
watching it I turn her turn to Kate on the couch she's fast asleep so now I'm

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:18.000
just just me sitting alone in a bed in the living room watching this man I

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.920
romanticize this child this boy and it's all romantic and it's all like indie

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:31.320
film with good actors and like going it's like yeah it's all great and it's

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.000
fun but it's you had already told you told me that story of the funny thing

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.800
about it and I'm just saying because like when you were explaining it to me

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:44.560
you're like you were so you so wanted Kate to to to know that you were a

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:52.800
thoughtful right yeah Academy Award considering advocate of of progress in

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.480
the future and that you weren't I wanted you were afraid to like you were like

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.680
your eyes are glued on the screen and she's behind you on the couch and like

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.960
and so you're like you know you're afraid to like kind of like send any

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.240
overtures of like of like looking at your I had to go to the bathroom but I

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.000
held it in because I was like well if I get up now I'm homophobic or whatever

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.840
so I'm gonna watch this being uncomfortable and I'm just like you know

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.000
and I look she's fast asleep she's probably fast asleep throughout the whole

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.480
thing and she probably fell asleep at the pressure I it was a the funny thing

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.000
about the movie was that I I got Cody and I kept going like well I get this

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.720
part of this exercise might be the 17 that straight people are supposed to

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:43.520
like experience like getting frustrated that gay people haven't gotten down yet

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.760
because we were like we're like if this was you the broke back guys would be on

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:57.560
their third broke back by now it takes them two hours to break a back to do it

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.520
I don't want to spoil call me by your name I there's absolutely no question

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.600
once in a while a movie comes along where you're like Jesus Christ obviously

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.800
the director is very talented the actors are amazing that kid is giving like the

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:15.720
performance of a lifetime like and taking that's not funny it's not funny it's not

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.920
funny it's not funny no because that's just not funny that's just a straight up

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.680
funny that he's giving the performance of the lifetime and he's taking the

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.560
performance of a lifetime that's not funny I'm seeing that's a hack I we got to

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.040
be not happy you're smiling well because I'm smiling because you're yelling it

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:41.680
maybe it's not hack it's brilliant it's the funniest joke ever yeah I've never

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:48.920
been find your camera I've never I've never I've never wanted more gay sex to

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:55.120
happen more quickly in my in a movie in my life is bored that's what I'm saying

01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:00.280
I was I was just like boy they really this is a slow burn this movie have you

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:07.360
guys ever been on a nude beach just topless just topless just the men I

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.280
think I like me my family make a vacation one time kind of stumbled upon one in

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.680
Hawaii and we just kind of hung a u-turn hmm today I was in La Jolla you know

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:25.000
La Jolla idea it's it's Spanish for the Hoya yeah that's correct La Jolla Jack

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:34.320
they have Tory Pines State Park has this like big it's on the top of this big

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.840
cliff and they do gliders like people are paragliding and parachuting off this

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.760
cliff and we're at the top of the cliff watching these people jump off the

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.520
mountain it was pretty cool and we went wouldn't it be cooler if we went to the

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.600
bottom of this cliff to see the people jump off the hill and we were like sure

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:56.280
we we we hiked down this cliff to the beach as soon as we got on the beach

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:04.920
realized everyone was naked even the hand gliders I've been thinking about it

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.960
the important thing about the movie is that it is to the emotional aspect of

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.880
the fact that I'm straight and I'm going like hurry up and fuck each other

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.680
already my hands oh I want to define more foot rubbing it's a symbol for

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.520
want to define homosexuality by the act and that's what that's what we've done

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.960
throughout society because then we define it by the act and then we

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.040
criminalize the act all these things it's like people can be in love they are

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.480
every day without anybody admitting it or knowing it or all those things like

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:37.800
everybody's I love that movie now or whoo good save I love me no it was really

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.840
underage yeah I mean I'm not I'm not gonna say everybody goes yeah but it's

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.000
France I did find that kind of fascinating though because I like I'm

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.920
very happy to be done with have Milo Yiannopoulos be out of the picture but

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:57.000
isn't that kind of what he was gay-splaining on the Rogan show or

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.360
whatever like what he finally like we found his off switch and his off switch

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:05.280
was that he was technically in favor of whatever because wasn't wasn't his whole

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.000
like monologue just about the fact that when you're gay because you're already

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.240
taboo and you're not there is no prom night for you and there is no like

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.240
rigorously set up rails to your sexuality that the way that you often

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:23.280
encounter your your sexuality is through the indoctrination by the people

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.800
like I couldn't love the guy for I'm so happy that something brought him down I

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:36.120
just find it ironic is that how it happens Dan that's how it happens that's not funny

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.520
have you guys ever seen videos of people skydiving naked it's pretty funny

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.600
because everything's just flipping and flopping and so so you went mine wouldn't

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:53.320
walk down you're like hey I was checking out like all the hang gliders what

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:58.200
are you your giant your giant balls skydiving it would be a spectacle I

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.920
could use them as a parachute you think you can did you talk to anybody down

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.880
there like one of those flying squirrel like like Red Bull like like like

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.360
wingsuits you could stretch your balls like a V-wing and just and just land

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:18.840
yeah I could also stretch it over my whole body my privates it's a normal room

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:27.440
temperature look like a big but you yeah it's like a just a big pair of balls and

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.640
then at the top of them it's just like a there's just a little just a little

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.560
nipple coming out the fun time Harry I'm just like hey look I'm not gonna make a

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.520
fuss unless anybody wants me out here do you think your balls are doing your

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.000
dick at this service by putting that your dick into that high a contrast

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.280
because of that big yeah I can't tell if the yeah if it's an illusion that's

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.280
like wow those are big balls or but I've seen the photo that Cody took of you

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.320
with your balls hanging out that we that we keep torturing Steve Levy with yeah

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:02.960
they're big your balls are the size of like like like lemons like big huh yes

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.280
that's yes yeah I mean I would I mean yes bigger than mine and they're

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.800
certainly big for a guy who's dick is a nipple yeah that yeah it's like what is

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.200
the point of this what is being generated in those balls that's gonna like it

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.600
always feels weird it's like if the fire department came up and they had like a

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.680
giant water tank on their fire truck and then they took out a little Capri Sun

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.320
straw and they're like don't worry man we'll have your love your house safe in

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.800
a second like what I don't I appreciate the effort but it'd be like if the fire

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:37.080
truck pulled up and they're like all right let's get out the hose right

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.200
something like that I don't know what the metaphor I know it breaks down because

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.040
it's like it's not a dick's job to like pour a bunch of come into it all right

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:52.760
let's kind of literally let's put out this fire yeah he's miming like a

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.800
whore a hose that's not it's moments like this when I wonder why more than

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.160
ever we don't get a bunch of black women on our show this seems like the

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:11.960
perfect platform it was supposed to be a black woman for sure if not for Steve

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.040
no no it's scar scars yeah there's always a next week the week after I will

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.280
have a it's 9-11 great black always the week after it was just 9-11 I bet I

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:31.280
could wear this chair 9-11 9-12 now it's 9-12 I don't want this can't this

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.600
can't we're gonna have to call the fire department please do it don't ever stop

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.640
doing what you're doing where's church when we need it for Chris can you 3d

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:47.680
pray a saw yeah we're gonna need one all right Schrab has shoved his head to the

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.840
back of a folding chair and for real like I saw it go through and like you

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.280
can tell it won't come out gonna come off because his ears are like the that's

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.040
how arrows are designed like you keep you're not supposed to be able to pull

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.120
an arrow out the metal tubing that's used to form the structural frame of the

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.520
chair is not strong enough like it would be easy to cut but it wouldn't be

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.560
comfortable to do so but also what you can't see even in photographs is the

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.640
fact that you know everyone I had to photograph it because it was clearly an

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:31.960
act that was done for you know there was no reason for him to do it it just he's

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:39.760
drinking a cup that was placed on the chair like a cup holder oh that would

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.360
be crazy it would be just like this I think but that but that's great because

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.880
you can put your drink down right by your face it would make sense like in an

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:55.120
apocalyptic world because there would be no place for anyone to sit down right

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.400
before the apocalypse and then there would be like a bunch of empty chairs

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.240
because the apocalypse happened but there'd be no buddy making clothes and

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.480
then so everyone's walking around wearing chairs and couches and stuff you

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.160
guys all the rich people will be wearing barrels with suspenders but this is a

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.160
this is a very poor you guys you guys are laughing at me but I'm all ready for

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:19.360
for like Mad Max Road Warrior like yeah I like everybody's like you know like

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.200
I'm like the gyrocopter guy you I think I think your Mad Max character will be

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:33.640
called the chairman yeah the chairman all right stockholders grab your primary

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:40.600

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:21.200
midday oh what do we have going on over here oh shit the chair recognizes

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:33.700
stool stool stool stool head what he lacks an imagination for names he makes

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:40.060
up for in blood when you're born with a thought he stool on your head you don't

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.180
We didn't go, oh shit.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.740
I knew, we knew it, we knew it.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.860
His head wasn't coming out of there.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.100
For real, we got to know it fucking.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.260
What don't we table this meeting until tomorrow?

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:54.940
It's a safety issue.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.580
He's trying to hold his ear flat enough

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.300
against his head with his hand, which

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.820
makes his head twice as wide.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.740
He's going to rip his ears off.

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.820
Yeah, don't help him.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.540
Don't help him.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.060
Helping him is hurting him.

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.780
What if you tuck the chair?

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.380
OK.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.500
Can you tuck the chair?

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.380
Well, at least mic him, mic him for the free listeners.

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.740
They might be inspired to subscribe.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.980
He's passed the ear.

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.940
By the way, this is brought to you by Quip Toothbrushes,

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:22.500
the toothbrush that vibrates when you use it.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.740
Quip Toothbrushes come with a suction sticker thing.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.540
It goes in your mirror.

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.180
They stick right to the mirror.

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.980
There's no dirty charger.

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.780
They said it couldn't be done.

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.860
He's out.

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.820
And so are your teeth if you don't use Quip.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:41.900
I wore a chair as a shirt.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:45.460
That's what it would be like if people wore furniture as close

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.660
because they ran out of clothes.

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.860
Listen, man.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.740
I've been a listener of your podcast for a long time.

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:52.580
Yeah, I have.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.980
I would like a refund.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:00.780
Rob's got the mic.

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.420
Oh, shit.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.140
Oh, it's not.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.300
Rob, talk into it.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.140
Hello.

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:04.700
Hi.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.740
No, I think it might be Levy.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:06.240
Hi.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:06.740
Hello.

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.240
Hi.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:07.740
No.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:08.240
Hello.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:08.740
Hi.

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.240
Oh, no.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.700
What about that one?

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.500
Hello, hi.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.980
Hello, hi.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.700
Hello, hello, hi.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.380
Hello, hi.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.740
Hello, hi.

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.660
I just turned it all the way down,

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:29.020
and the result is Rob sounds like Paul Rudd.

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:29.620
Hello, hi.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.300
All right.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:34.980
That was good.

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.980
Work good with magic.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.660
I don't think work my mic.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.980
I don't think you're going to get John Mayer up here

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.180
and fucking put furniture on and fucking do a Mad Max sketch.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:49.260
I bet he would stop just short of putting it on and wearing

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.740
a chair as a shirt.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.300
I think it was Ancest like that that got him in that hot water

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.100
in the first place.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.140
And he's now, he doesn't have the courage

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.820
to start wearing furniture on podcasts.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.180
I'm touched by your envy.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.900
I wish you could express it in a more healthy way

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:04.180
than attacking him or me.

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:10.780
I think it's nice that I had a brief moment of friendship

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.660
with a guy that, you know, like, laugh all you want.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.740
I think we'll make more.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.300
You guys are still friends, I think.

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.940
Yeah, but I probably already smothered him

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.300
by mentioning him too much during my workout.

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.060
Yeah, he hated that.

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:25.940
I'm different in shit now.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.420
There's got to be dust all over me.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.500
Oh, boy.

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.900
Oh, you got lacquer all over your back.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.060
You all right?

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:34.660
Back lacquer?

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.460
Back lacquer.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:41.100
You got stool resin.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.180
I don't think you guys really gave my character

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.140
stool head the time to really flesh that character out.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.460
I think it was the highlight of the evening.

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.300
I think we did a lot of things wrong tonight.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.860
That was probably number 50 on the list.

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.380
I don't regret a goddamn bit of it.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:01.780
I think people at NASCAR, people go to NASCAR every week.

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.460
What's that?

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.700
Cars running in a circle.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.740
You're only really there in case there's a crash.

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:06.940
No one wants to admit it.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:07.980
Sometimes there's a crash.

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.180
Sometimes a crash is exciting.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.140
What are you going to watch?

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.340
A car go around in a circle faster?

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.260
Whatever.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.980
Like, I'm not being defensive.

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:20.180
I'm saying to our subscribers, I think this was worth it.

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.980
I think this trick, this has been a fucking Japanese jet

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.780
train to fucking Fun Town.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:25.900
Yeah.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.540
What time is it?

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.500
Usually I don't clock there.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.740
I wear these glasses just so I could read the clock.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.340
What?

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.700
Hit the B.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.420
What?

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.660
D&D?

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:34.540
No.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.180
It's 19.

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.300
It's 9.19 right now.

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.940
That seems like a good, solid time to play D&D for.

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.620
Let's do this.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.140
Let's do it for real.

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:43.780
Oh, shit.

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.500
Spencer, you got the folders.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.500
You got the goods?

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.060
I will.

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.980
You got the mats?

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.980
Mots?

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.100
Spencer got the mats.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.940
Matze?

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.460
Matze.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.260
How do you guys celebrate the Jewish festivals,

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.500
like in full Jewish fashion?

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:03.620
Do you guys really keep the shibas and the shabbas?

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:04.460
And whatever you call them?

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.060
The shibas.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.180
The shibas.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:06.940
I'm making things up.

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.940
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.540
Are you guys?

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.740
Are people die?

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.580
But you guys, did you mean the Jews?

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.300
Yeah, he did.

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.260
Levy, what's a Maccabee?

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:22.260
The Maccabees are the army.

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.700
They were like warriors, right?

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.780
Yeah, the warriors.

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.940
They kicked a bunch of ass.

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:26.780
Yeah, they did, yeah.

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.740
Are you keeping something from us?

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.620
No.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.500
What does he know that?

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.340
I don't know.

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:35.820
I don't know.

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:44.700
I don't think we ever learned about Dave Matthews' band,

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.820
which was the whole premise of bringing Steve up.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.740
Where did you get the name from?

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.740
They got the name because, so Dave

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:57.060
is a bartender at this bar in downtown.

01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.780
Oh, Matthews.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.940
Ball Charlottesville.

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.020
It's called Miller's Bar.

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.940
He's a bartender.

01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:04.940
Matthews' bar.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.020
Everyone knew Dave because he was a friendly guy.

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.500
And that was the local establishment.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.540
It's like the drawing room there.

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:14.900
And people would play live music there.

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.860
And he started playing and getting all these musicians

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.140
to play with them.

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.420
And they didn't have a name.

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.380
But people loved Dave and the band.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.380
And they were like, oh, you're going

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:29.020
to see Dave Matthews' band at the tracks?

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.940
And that just gets stuck.

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.420
It's after him.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.820
It's stuck because they didn't have a name.

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.500
It was like, yeah, Dave Matthews from Miller's.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.380
His band is playing.

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.420
Dave Matthews' band.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:41.620
You don't think that was his plan all along?

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.220
You don't think the bass player had ever said,

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.620
maybe we should call it laser eaters?

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.580
And he was like, oh, you know, it

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.140
doesn't seem that organic to me.

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.380
I like that people keep calling it my name.

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:58.780
The bass player was 16 and he dropped out of high school.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.140
You can't do that, man.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.500
Well, he's a millionaire.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:05.740
Well, does he know about geometry?

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:06.220
Probably.

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.780
Good luck.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.980
Good luck.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.580
Algorithm.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:12.460
Good luck.

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:15.260
Before I forget, in case D&D sweeps us away.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.820
Also, wait, wait, I want to say something.

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.320
Dan.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.220
Steve.

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:21.660
Licensed and Smarching, a Dave Matthews' band song,

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.500
for the finale of season five community.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.900
And it's probably the best use of Dave Matthews' band song

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.340
outside of maybe.

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:34.340
I think it's better than Crash Enemy and Lady Bird.

01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.980
But it was an incredibly effective, amazing moment

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.220
for Greendale Community College.

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:43.100
Everybody coming together is a perfect, perfect, perfect drop.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.420
Remember doing that episode, Dan?

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.780
Yeah.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.380
A little bit.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.860
I have some flashbacks.

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.660
Yeah.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:59.060
I remember whoever the rep was going, like, OK,

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.940
we watched the episode where you guys referenced us.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.620
The price has gone up, because number one, you need us.

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:10.140
Number two, you're making fun of us.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.620
So I think that will be $8 a song now.

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:14.540
Thank you very much.

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.860
And we were like, ooh.

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.180
Well, I always wanted the ass crack band

01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:25.380
to be Dave Matthews after you had Ben Foles in there.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.500
I think that's what it canonically

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:31.900
was, was Dave Matthews.

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:37.500
Do you think, if we title the episode Worst Episode Ever,

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.620
will it then become the best episode ever?

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.300
Because people go, well, then they

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:42.780
called it the worst episode ever.

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:46.380
We should title the episode, I feel like a bag of smashed

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.340
assholes.

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.780
How's it going?

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.460
I was going to go with Chippy Pippy, but.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:52.460
Chippy Pippy.

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:53.460
Ha, ha, ha.

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.940
Chippy Pippy.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.620
Chippy Pippy.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.700
Chippy Pippy, oh, your time has come.

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700
I write things down.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:03.980
I wrote next to it, I wrote, money is a river, it's frothy.

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.780
And then right next to it, I'm not a Chippy Pippy.

01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.260
I'm not.

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.980
I never called you.

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.860
Yeah, Jeff never called you a Chippy Pippy.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.380
No, it was all Dan.

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:15.540
Do you think when they were writing Sister Christian,

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.100
was that warrant?

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.380
Why do I think church knows that?

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:19.540
Do you know, you don't know?

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:23.140
No, that's a night ranger, night ranger, night ranger.

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.540
Sister Christian, oh, your time is coming.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.380
And they get to the refrain, and then somebody was like,

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:33.940
I don't know, your motor in.

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.100
Motor in?

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.020
What?

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.940
What's your price for a flight?

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.460
Yeah, someone was like, what do you mean motor in?

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.620
And he's like, well, what's your price for a flight?

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.300
I thought this was about nuns.

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.980
Motor in was a guy that they knew.

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.820
I can't believe that you thought warrant wrote that,

01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:52.940
because they're famous for, she's my cherie pie.

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.260
Yeah, they're the worst.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:54.940
They're the worst.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.140
I love them, but they're the worst.

01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:58.220
Well, how about the great thing about the past

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:01.420
is it all runs together like a big fucking sad pudding?

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.900
Hell yeah.

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.180
There's your title.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.660
Thank god.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.900
You never hear that like NPR thing about the people?

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:08.980
Let's call the episode sad pudding.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.980
You always wish you could remember everything,

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.620
and then those people that have like crazy memory,

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.780
like they can't avoid their memory,

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:19.180
like apparently Mary Lou Henner is one of them.

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.980
They're so fucking sad.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.180
They hate their lives, because they can never

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:28.300
forget how it felt to be a shitty boyfriend

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.820
or on that fifth relationship in.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.300
Like there's so much shit that you want to forget.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:36.380
With such a shitty boyfriend?

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:42.220
That's like, every day, she's like waking up.

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.340
That's what PTSD is, I think.

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.220
Well, the reason she doesn't have a podcast

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.820
is because two weeks from now, she'd still

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.100
be remembering this episode.

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.660
Whereas I'm going to be like, I don't know.

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.700
Maybe let's have Duncan Trussell back.

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:53.380
Fucking awful.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.540
Seems like a fun thing.

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.380
Oh, yeah.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:58.300
You piece of shit.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.580
But I'm just saying, we think that because only time

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.580
that we realize that we can't remember stuff, we feel weak.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.100
It's like not being able to lift something.

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.140
So we go, I wish I could lift everything,

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.380
but there are people who can lift everything memory-wise.

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:13.100
And it's kind of a bummer for them.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.580
I'm really looking through my spell list, Spencer.

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.980
And I didn't realize that I have reduced animal.

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:23.020
And it says, shrinks down one all caps willing animal.

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.020
Yeah.

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.980
How do I know that there's consent from an animal

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.500
to shrink that animal down?

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.180
Oh, if you have to ask.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.180
I mean, come on.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.620
Fair enough.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.580
Fair enough.

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.100
No, I mean, you're a druid.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.820
You can get a sense of animals.

01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.740
Well, yeah, because what if it's one of my nature's allies?

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.240
Yeah.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:41.740
That's an ally.

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.260
She'd probably love to be reduced.

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.980
Yeah.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.220
Let's do it.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:49.460
Well, there's no rush, really.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.100
I have another question as well.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.580
Wasn't I almost dead?

01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.020
That's all I remember.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:54.780
Yeah.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.500
I never really, I think I was down to two hit points.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.140
Do you need some halons?

01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:58.820
You were.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.860
As we crawled out the window of that pub.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.500
And then.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.620
Are we at my house?

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:09.420
And then we dragged, what was his name, the guy?

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:10.140
Shrove.

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.420
Shrove, too.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.020
There was a guy at Shambling.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.060
Shambling, Garry Shandling, Garry Shandling.

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:19.500
Back into us, it took us through a crack in the wall.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:19.980
Yeah.

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:21.020
Took us to a crack in the wall.

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:21.980
Took us to a place.

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:22.480
Yeah.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.900
Is that, I guess you could take it from there.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.300
That's what I remember.

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:27.260
Yep.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:30.140
All right, Spencer, do you want to let her rip?

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.300
Or do we already just do it?

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.900
Do you want to give us a proper caption?

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.660
I'll do it.

01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:35.900
Not caption, but recap, rather.

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:46.980
Last time on Harmon Time, our heroes went to Dornaster

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.260
on the quest for Patchen's gem.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.500
They were searching for information.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.220
And they went to the Church of the Body Temple

01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.300
and then another church to look for clues.

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.100
And acting upon those clues, they went to the theater,

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:07.140
where they heard the name of one person, Shrove.

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.940
So they went in search of that person.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:14.780
And they caught him out with his pants down, literally,

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.260
because he was in the bathroom.

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:19.540
They burst in in the bathroom, causing

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.580
a scene immediately.

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.460
And a near riot as enemy combatants

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:28.180
flooded into the magically darkened bathroom

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:32.740
until our heroes beat a hasty retreat with their quarry

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:37.660
in tow, trying to extricate themselves from the mob.

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.220
They didn't try hard enough.

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.660
And the mob was on their heels.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:46.100
But then Chad shot fire and started a fire.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:51.220
And then Carlos used his solar flare

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:54.820
to cover their escape, which was also

01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:00.780
aided by the random addition of a shambling mound.

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:05.140
Together, they traveled to a pig farm

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:11.460
and at hiding behind a broken collection of bits of wall,

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:18.300
they hunkered down with their still unruly, unwilling,

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:22.740
hostage, Shrove.

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.180
What would happen?

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:27.100
I don't know.

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.580
Find out today.

01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:34.980
Whoa.

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.620
So I'm making some green tea.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.900
If you guys want anything.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.060
Thanks, Garry Shandling.

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:47.180
OK, put the kettle on for four cups?

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:47.780
Four cups?

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.900
I would adore a cup of tea.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.400
Thank you.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.860
You got one cup, two, two?

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.980
Can we make it an even three?

01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.900
I'm kidding.

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:56.900
All right.

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.740
All right, here we go.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:02.300
Let's get back to interrogating this guy.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.140
Spencer, what state is Shrove in?

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.420
Like, what do we have?

01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:07.500
What happened?

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.060
Are we?

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.740
Is he locked up?

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.380
Is he?

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:12.740
I don't think he's locked up.

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:18.220
I think Dan has had him kind of grappled to some extent.

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.300
I want to, I feel like I remember,

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.180
and if it's only in my head, I want to secure him.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:28.580
I want to ligature him.

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.780
What?

01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.340
I want to tie him up.

01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.940
Do you own rope?

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.180
You could have mine.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.380
Thanks.

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.460
Are you good at tying with this?

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:41.300
As good as anybody else?

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.860
Well, probably better than me.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:45.020
I haven't spent 10 years in a library.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:49.540
So while Carlos is holding him, I tie him up with my rope.

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.980
All right, you do that.

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:53.900
Hell yeah.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:29:00.140
All right, Shrove, we are on the quest for Patchen's gem.

01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:02.580
I know you don't know it is Patchen's gem.

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.260
You probably just know it as a gem.

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.180
We've got to go over this one more time

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.860
and make no mistake about it.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.180
There's only one way you're living through this,

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:16.460
and that's if we get anything valuable from you at all.

01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:19.660
So you've got to make shit up.

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.220
If we've gone down the wrong road,

01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:23.740
you've got to just make shit up,

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.660
and you've got to convince all of us.

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:32.700
And believe me, that's a lot of sense motive sensing.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.980
Gary, I think your tea is on.

01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.900
Oh, thank you very much.

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:38.620
Ooh.

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:42.500
So here we go, from the top.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.860
Where'd you get that robe, that bloody robe?

01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.820
It was in the theater.

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:53.500
It was in the prop box, where new costumes and stuff are put.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.260
In your opinion, why would that make its way

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.820
into the prop box at a theater?

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:02.420
Hey, maybe someone didn't want it anymore.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.020
You want lemon?

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:03.700
You want lemon?

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.580
I'd love lemon.

01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:05.140
You're loving?

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:05.940
OK.

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:06.860
Oh, another?

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:08.740
OK, here you go.

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:09.940
I was raising my hand.

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.020
You passed it.

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.420
If you're having one, get five cups.

01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:14.260
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:15.740
OK, thanks.

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.100
Maybe someone didn't want it.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:20.260
They were like, I don't want this.

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.300
And then they didn't know what to do with it.

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.380
Who puts the new props in the prop box?

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.380
Well, just people.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.380
It's kind of like what people?

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:30.820
The inner people.

01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:33.940
Yeah, but there's not like distinguished positions?

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:35.260
No, it's like a donation.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.220
Take a prop, leave a prop.

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:36.980
Yeah.

01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.620
So let me just walk through this.

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.740
Like a chip sword.

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.980
A day in the life of a bloody robe.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.940
I have a bloody robe.

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.540
I drop it off on the stoop of the theater.

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:52.300
Margaret grabs it, drops it in a box full of a mixture

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:56.340
of clean, half clean, and blood encrusted clothes

01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.060
that people drop off on the stoop.

01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:00.460
And of that box, some of the actors

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:03.980
pull it out, use it as a scene in a theater performance.

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.500
Some others pull it out and wash it

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.980
so it can be used as a scene.

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:09.380
And then there's guys like you, prominent figures

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:11.420
of the theater, who decide to wear it

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.660
and then sell it to a homeless guy.

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:16.260
Yeah, no, I gave it to a homeless guy who's

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.580
notoriously naked in this town.

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.540
I wasn't wearing it.

01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:23.940
I'm going to make some bread if you guys hungry for bread.

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.460
Shrove, do you like bread?

01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.380
I know.

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:27.900
No bread?

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.060
It's OK.

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:31.060
OK, well, I'm putting it on.

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.820
Tumpernickel?

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.420
Yeah, it is.

01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:34.940
All right.

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:35.440
OK, cool.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.260
All right.

01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.180
This guy's excited.

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:43.540
I'm going to take a sidebar with my friends.

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:44.040
OK.

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.580
Guys, I don't know what I'm doing.

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.340
And I think I did it.

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.940
Do you want me to talk to him?

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.660
No, Gary, thank you.

01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.140
No, thank Gary.

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.420
Can you give us a moment?

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:04.140
Oh, you said we needed to talk.

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.340
My friends and I, I'm so appreciative of you.

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:13.220
Well, so I'm not a friend?

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:14.020
No, it's not that.

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.460
I gave you bread.

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.460
You already made it.

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.780
I gave him bread.

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:20.580
I gave you bread.

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:21.340
This is my home.

01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.940
Gary, he means more like work friends.

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:24.060
Like this is a work friend.

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.380
This is like a work.

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.260
This is my home.

01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.420
This is a work issue thing.

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.700
We have work conversations to talk about.

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:31.620
This is my home.

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:34.060
OK, Gary, Gary, you're in, you're in, you're in.

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:35.300
Come talk to us.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:35.780
OK, I love you.

01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:37.100
We love you, Garry Shandling.

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.620
Thank you.

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.540
But away from Shrove, I need to have a sidebar.

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.980
Should I pull the curtain?

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:43.820
Yes.

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:48.340
Hey, Gary, what do you know about these town's folk?

01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:49.180
What do I know?

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.620
Yeah.

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:58.740
You know, they're OK when they don't really like my kind,

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.660
like the bread that I make.

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.380
Carlos, what was the importance of the bloody row,

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.460
because that was the robe that maybe was being worn by one

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.740
of the butchered.

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.940
It was Patchen's robe.

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.060
You didn't think I remember.

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.820
I don't remember.

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.620
It was Patchen's robe, and they stripped it off.

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.300
Oh, when they fucked up Patchen's,

01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.300
and they took his robe, and then someone just took it back.

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:21.140
So yeah, that just might be a collection box for the theater.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:23.540
All right, well, it's an inconvenient time for us

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:24.540
to realize this.

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.540
What's up?

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.740
I got to get the bread.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.060
I thought you had a hot, like you had a hot lead.

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.860
I didn't know what's going on.

01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:36.660
I thought I did too, and at the time, not to be defensive,

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.340
but it seemed like everyone agreed.

01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:40.220
I walked back out to where Shrove is,

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.820
and then I sit down with my tea, and I say, Shrove,

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.260
look, we're sorry to put you through the ringer on this one.

01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.580
If somebody was collecting any valuable gems,

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.900
where might a gem be taken in this town?

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:54.460
Is there like a place where that might be fenced or taken to?

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:57.860
Like, sold in the black market or something like that?

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.580
If someone stole a gem, they would probably

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:02.580
stole it for some reason.

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.900
Like, they had some plan of what to do with it.

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:08.820
Have you heard any word in the street about stolen gems?

01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.140
No, I haven't.

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:13.020
I'm afraid I don't listen for that sort of stuff.

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.500
Do you know anybody that we might be able to talk to that

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.620
might know the scoop on that?

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.740
I don't know, man.

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.220
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:23.780
Shrove, who does the most donating of props?

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:26.300
Just the day players.

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:27.140
All right, strip them naked.

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:30.100
Strip them naked.

01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.620
We're going to let you go, but I'm

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.260
looking at every fucking hole.

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:37.820
I start taking off shroves like upper garments.

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.220
The bread is finished.

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.220
Thank you.

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:40.980
But right with you.

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.980
I don't feel good about this.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:43.420
Thank you, Gary.

01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:44.420
We're stripping your friend naked.

01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.380
You don't have to bunch up your clothes around your waist

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.820
because you're hog-tied or whatever.

01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:49.900
You know, like, I don't just.

01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.580
Oh!

01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.580
It's a search.

01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:53.580
It's a search.

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:54.660
It's a search?

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.540
You're a shambling mound.

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:57.540
All of a sudden, you're a hog.

01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.980
Well, I know what a dick looks like.

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.740
You're going to hi-hat us all of a sudden?

01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740
Hi-hat, the man.

01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:04.020
You're going to get the hi-hat.

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.660
What are you guys doing?

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.860
You didn't meet us at a polo match.

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.900
We were dragging a bloody naked man down the street.

01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.580
Let us finish our business.

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.620
Stop being a dick.

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.700
Stop high-roading us.

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.900
OK, well, fine.

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.340
At least use a coaster.

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.220
What is this?

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.220
God damn it.

01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.020
I start vigorously.

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:23.940
Water rings.

01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.340
Vigorously patting down shrove, looking for anything

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.700
on his body.

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:30.660
Look at his fucking butt, looking at it.

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.580
Let's start.

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:32.900
I'm going to start with the clothes.

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.780
Let's cross the bridge when we get to it.

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:40.140
You remove his clothes and his stuff.

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:43.140
You find he's under his clothes.

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.420
He's got a big tattoo on his back.

01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:51.260
It looks like a crazy intricate, kind of like a Celtic tattoo,

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:55.740
like with symbols and kind of like glyphs and stuff.

01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.460
But it kind of forms the crude shape of a dragon.

01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.060
Here we go, here we go.

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.060
And also, in his clothes, he has a bag of holding

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:10.660
full of beef jerky and a sack of some money and a harp.

01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:13.180
I take that bag of holding.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:13.700
All right.

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:15.580
Wait, are you a harpist?

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:18.060
Are you a bard?

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.500
No, I'm even a doctor.

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.660
I play music, but.

01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.540
You play the kind of music that raises the dead?

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.660
No, you don't raise the dead with music.

01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.100
I guess people could raise it.

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.660
I'm a druid, and I'm not trained in the bardic art so much,

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.380
but I appreciate a nice harp tune.

01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:32.860
Can you?

01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:38.100
First of all, what is the meaning of this dragon tattoo

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.260
on your back?

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.700
Oh, it's just a birthmark.

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:42.980
It's just a birthmark.

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:43.700
Yeah.

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.860
You just happen to have a birthmark of a dragon on your back.

01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:48.620
Some people do.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.500
I've seen that symbol before.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.380
Tell us more, Garry Shandling.

01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.500
I saw it in a book.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.620
Saw it in a book.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:58.260
Let's see.

01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.740
Here.

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:06.220
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, dictionary.

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.900
He finds a book labeled the 13 Dragon Marked Houses.

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.660
Here we go.

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.820
Here we go.

01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:15.700
A, B, C, D, right here.

01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.420
Take a look at that.

01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:19.500
Whoa.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:22.940
The relevant lore is that the members of the Dragon Marked

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:26.180
Houses sometimes manifest dragon marks or birthmarks

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:30.300
in the shape of dragons that they bestow magical affinity,

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.900
but they're like a bloodline sort of thing.

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.740
So they indicate a bloodline in these Dragon Marked Houses,

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:37.940
which run the guilds.

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.060
So is he druidic, too?

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.060
Maybe you could read our document.

01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.540
That's not what his birthmark says.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.380
You don't know if he's druidic.

01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.540
So you're dragon marked.

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.340
Nope.

01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.460
You're lying.

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.180
I mean, it's kind of.

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:56.140
Do you speak the language of the guilds?

01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:56.620
Yeah.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.860
Well, it's like a code, but yeah.

01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.700
Shall we show them?

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:03.420
Yeah, let's show them the letter that we found on the bandidos.

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:04.060
Oh, right?

01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:07.620
Look, if you could read this for us, we'll give you.

01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.620
Oh, my god.

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:10.900
It says that we got him tied up and he's naked.

01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:12.020
Read it for us.

01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:13.020
All right.

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.980
It says, the young one on the road outside of Roan

01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:17.940
holds the purse.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.500
Top priority is the purse.

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.580
The next top priority is kill them all.

01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.540
Drop point north, 4 AM, Olaroon 9.

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:29.820
Olaroon 9's a date.

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.300
Someone write that shit down post in real life.

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.780
Someone was wanting to write it down.

01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:36.420
You have a photographic memory.

01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:38.300
Say it back for us, shambles.

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.260
Just give me.

01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:40.060
No.

01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:40.900
I don't want to.

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.820
You said the young one outside the road on Roan

01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.140
is the top priority?

01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.740
The young one on the road outside Roan

01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:49.540
holds the purse.

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:53.140
Now, just for your memories, Roan's the starting village.

01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.300
Right.

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.220
This is the assignment.

01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.180
That's where they attacked us.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.580
The young one is Patchens.

01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:58.080
Right.

01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.900
So we have a document that told us

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.220
that the thing was going to happen that already happened?

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.220
Yeah.

01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:05.820
It's what you find in a hit man when they attack you.

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.500
You find the note that says go attack them.

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.620
All right, keep going.

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.060
Top priority is the purse.

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:12.100
Next top priority is kill them all.

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:12.900
Got it.

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.460
Drop point north, like a location.

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:18.980
Drop north.

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.540
And you just take.

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:24.220
4 AM, all the room night, which is like a date and time.

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:27.180
And has that date and time come yet?

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.420
It's that day and not that time.

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:33.180
How far away is it from now?

01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.740
It's soon.

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:37.420
Shrove, where's drop point north?

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.100
I'm not telling you guys.

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.860
Wait, Shrove said that?

01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.860
Yeah.

01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:49.260
What would it take for us to get you to tell us?

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.300
We've got some nice bread.

01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:52.620
I'm not telling you guys.

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.180
We'll invest in your theater.

01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.100
You'll invest?

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.220
Oh.

01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:56.720
Shrove.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:57.500
You guys don't have money.

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.980
By any chance, does your order have anything

01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.500
to do with integrity, honor, that kind of thing?

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.340
Yeah, secrecy.

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:12.060
Yeah, so in other words, if you were to betray your order,

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.620
you'd be a bad guy, right?

01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:14.900
Generally, yeah, yeah.

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.020
So you'd rather get your throat slit

01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:21.540
protecting your order, right?

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.020
No.

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:24.780
Are you lying?

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:25.300
No.

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.460
But you wouldn't lie, right?

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:27.900
Because you have integrity, right?

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.300
You're not a common bunch of thugs.

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:34.100
You're genetically born.

01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:41.740
Like, you're dragonborn, not to, I'm sorry.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:44.340
That's not, that's copyright.

01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.540
Your dragon, something.

01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.060
Marked.

01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.420
Marked.

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.540
Let me ask you this.

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:57.180
If it came to a choice between lying about flipping

01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:02.100
loyalties because some of your brethren had gone very bad

01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.300
and protecting your bad brethren and paying for them

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.580
with your life, what would be the more honorable dragon

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.140
marked thing to do?

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.860
Neither.

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.820
Well, what do you want?

01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:16.660
I just want to hang out, just live my life.

01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:19.580
You want to hang out and not tell us who these guys are,

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:20.020
like where they are?

01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.500
I don't know who these guys are, man.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.100
These guys are terrible killers who

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.540
attacked an innocent young man whose only job was

01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.980
to protect this gem.

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:31.300
You're not on the right side of history here.

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.340
I'm sorry, but that's why you've.

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.300
I have two gold pieces.

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.460
Whoa.

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.260
That changes everything.

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:41.900
No.

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:44.340
There's two gold pieces sweet in the pot, Shrove?

01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:47.900
Nah, I had three gold pieces before you robbed me.

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:48.860
Now you'll have five.

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:52.060
You've done nothing but pretend to be someone else.

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.700
Aren't you tired of living a lie?

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.580
I belong to the Church of the Silver Flame.

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:58.420
I'm just trying to redeem this countryside.

01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:01.620
I'm trying to do something right for the purifying flame

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:03.100
before I die.

01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.420
We ran across this lad.

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.580
He had a gem.

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:08.020
He was supposed to protect it.

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.460
We were assassinated.

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:12.620
We were waylaid by horrible, backstabbing, dishonest

01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.420
bandits.

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:17.980
Like, do you ally with them or the rest of the world?

01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:18.620
Yeah, kind of.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.540
That's our whole town.

01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:22.660
We're a bunch of ruffians and thieves and brigands and stuff.

01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.300
It's not great, but that's what we got, man.

01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:26.860
I use Intimidate.

01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.620
Where is it?

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.500
What's your Intimidate score?

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:31.980
It doesn't list one.

01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.540
Really?

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:35.220
Yeah, it has a check, but no thing.

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:38.060
All right, what's your charisma, then?

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.420
Oh, no.

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:44.420
7 minus 2.

01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.940
Oh, boy.

01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:48.940
You don't, you're not convincing.

01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:52.180
Well, I mean, I turn to the side.

01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.820
Is it well lit?

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.340
Is it dark?

01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.180
Where are we at?

01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:55.980
It's dark.

01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.300
It's dark and muddy.

01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.100
It's dark and muddy in a pig farm.

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:04.540
I start to go, rrr, rrr, rrr.

01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.780
And it opened my mouth, but he can't see.

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:09.380
I put my hand up to cast Firebolt.

01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.340
I make it look like it's coming out of my mouth like a dragon.

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:14.500
I go, dragon fire!

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.300
And I cast Firebolt to make it look

01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.300
like it's coming out of my mouth,

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:21.020
to impress him with his dragon mark guild thingy.

01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.780
It looks like it's coming out of your mouth.

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:23.700
Yeah.

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:28.900
And I go, hey, I'll dragon your shit through the mud.

01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:30.500
Magic exists.

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:31.460
Magic exists.

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.180
Yeah.

01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:36.860
I thought you'd like that because I'm dragonic as well.

01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:39.820
Draconic, whatever you're fucking, whatever you like.

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:40.980
I don't like that.

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:43.980
I take Garry Shandling aside.

01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.540
OK.

01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.100
Shrove, you've done enough.

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.260
We just had to make sure we knew everything you knew.

01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:51.300
We're just going to relax and have some tea.

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:51.820
OK.

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:52.700
Garry Shandling.

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:53.820
Yeah.

01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:54.900
You want me to talk to him?

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:58.140
Do you want to give our friend Shrove some tea?

01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:58.640
Yeah.

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.820
Do you have anything that'll help him?

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.260
To smooth the plow?

01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:07.620
Well, do you have anything that'll

01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.420
help him tell the truth?

01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:14.020
And or do you have anything that'll just kill him?

01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:18.420
I've got some vinegar and some solvents.

01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.060
All right.

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:21.060
And we can light some candles.

01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:21.420
OK.

01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:25.260
I thought maybe Shambling mounds were more blood dead.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.100
You thought what?

01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:26.940
I don't know.

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:27.660
It's fine.

01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.340
Do you think I have a gun?

01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.620
Diarrhea, hey, come here for a second.

01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:32.700
Yeah.

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:34.900
Do you have poison?

01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:37.340
Let me see.

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.820
I might have some laxatives.

01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:43.500
We could mix it with my vinegar.

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:43.780
All right.

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:45.140
Let's just kill this fucking guy.

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:47.420
Why you got none of my living room?

01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:48.100
Let's just kill him.

01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:48.580
And I'll kill him.

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.100
Why are we killing him?

01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:49.860
Why are we killing him?

01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.140
Just because he was ineffectual or?

01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.460
He can live with me.

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:56.180
Well, if he's left alive, he's going to go.

01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.340
He's countered to our mission.

01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:59.580
He's going to go warn the rest of his brethren.

01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.580
There's only one reason he has to not tell us

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.060
the drop point in this note.

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:04.900
And that's because he doesn't side with us.

01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.980
He sides with these people that we lay.

01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.180
Let me suggest something.

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.780
We can't leave him alive.

01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.540
Why don't you just leave him here tied up

01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.060
until after the drop point, time and date?

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:16.740
I don't want to offend you, Garry Shandling,

01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:20.060
but I question your ability to maintain a hostage situation.

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.780
I don't know if that's what you're cut out for.

01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:24.660
You're Shambling and you're a mound.

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:27.260
Racist.

01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.100
I have a rust monster.

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.060
I mean, we've got a lot of work to do in a short amount of time.

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.740
And I think we should just step on his head until he's dead.

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.500
He's been a terrible pain in the ass.

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.740
He's withheld information.

01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:39.500
You're a terrible pain in the ass.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:39.740
No.

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.540
I was just taking a shit.

01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:48.300
Listen, you had your chance to assess things and judge people.

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:49.460
You've been bettered.

01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.300
And now you're about to die.

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.300
That's how it is.

01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.060
You have to listen to us talk about it.

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.860
You know, you guys are nice.

01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.420
I think you're cool.

01:45:57.420 --> 01:45:59.780
You drank my tea and you had some bread.

01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:01.020
Made a little bit of a mess.

01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.140
I guess I'll clean it up.

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:06.180
But you can't kill him in my living room.

01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:07.740
You can't kill him in my living room.

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:08.780
I don't want to haunt it.

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:09.980
Where's your kitchen?

01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:15.340
I summon nature's ally, summon Squid.

01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:17.100
Thank you.

01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:17.600
Thank you.

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.100
Do I have any more spells after this one?

01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.660
I think you've summoned the nature's ally already.

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:23.860
You put the bear.

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.220
I don't think you have two, do you?

01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.260
Shit, I had such a good idea.

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.140
Maybe you do.

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:29.980
I was going to take a giant squid, shrink it down,

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:32.020
because I can shrink down animals.

01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.340
And I was going to put it in his mouth or his butt.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:37.220
And that was going to be like the worst, like Wrath of Khan.

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.460
They put the bug on the guys here.

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.140
Let me make a suggestion.

01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:46.540
Would you consider a shambling mound an animal?

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:50.900
A shambling mound is like an elemental or something.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:51.740
Exactly.

01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:52.820
Shrink me down.

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.020
No, no, it doesn't count as an animal in that sense.

01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.980
You said an elemental.

01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:58.980
All right.

01:46:58.980 --> 01:46:59.940
Let me try this.

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.900
Let me just try this.

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.140
Can I try something?

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.820
I thought the squid up the butt thing was pretty fucking gold.

01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.580
I don't want a dick.

01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:08.740
I take my morning star, and I just start hitting it in the head.

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.540
No, you can't kill him in my living room.

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.180
Take him outside with the pigs.

01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.580
Yeah, I don't want like a haunted theater

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:18.100
person in my living room.

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:21.300
I have to, I have people over.

01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.500
This is where I work.

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.740
I work out of my home.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.220
My roommate's about to come home.

01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:29.100
Who's your roommate?

01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.900
My rust monster.

01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:32.940
You have a rust monster?

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.900
I have a rust monster.

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.260
It's part of my character that I'm

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.220
unable to control myself at this point,

01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:42.540
because I've got a lot of toxic shame in me.

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.700
I feel undermined by my own church.

01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:48.100
Why don't you take some of your toxic energy

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:51.300
and clean up after yourself?

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.740
Plus one.

01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:55.300
All right, you hit him for three damage.

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:57.900
He leaps up and tries to dodge you out of the way.

01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.180
And as he does so, you realize that the ropes were tied

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:02.020
really loosely.

01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:05.380
And he was kind of, he wasn't entirely bound.

01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:08.180
So he kind of gets out of, he wriggles free of the rope,

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:11.340
but in doing so is wanged in the head by you for three damage.

01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.740
Aha, you passed the test.

01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:16.020
You passed the test.

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:21.700
I open the window, and I try to go get out like a bird trapped

01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:22.580
in the house.

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:23.780
Get out.

01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:24.940
Get out of here.

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:26.180
To him?

01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:26.680
Yeah.

01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.180
Carlos, what was the test that he passed?

01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:28.700
Getting hit?

01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:29.460
That was nothing.

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.420
I'm just trying to get him, get him.

01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:32.700
Get out, quick.

01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.460
I start whacking him in with my quarter staff.

01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.100
All right.

01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:41.940
Like non-lethally, but just trying to bruise him up some.

01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:44.340
All right, you hit him, but not substantially.

01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:47.340
It doesn't take any damage.

01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.780
Get out.

01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:49.300
Get out.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.780
You still don't want to tell us where the drop point north

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:52.500
is?

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.660
You guys are the worst.

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.820
We know that.

01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:56.860
We know that.

01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860
We know that.

01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:59.580
We're hanging around at a pig farm

01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.500
with a shambling mound with a guy that probably

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:02.780
has nothing to do with it.

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:03.900
Yeah, we are the worst.

01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:06.420
Watch us try to keep you alive.

01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.860
Go run out the window.

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:10.940
I feel really bad about what transpired in here.

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.580
Just to talk about it later.

01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:15.260
I have a really great play about horses.

01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:16.620
Will that intrigue you?

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.100
Will you please attack him?

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:23.460
I feel bad. I start whipping gold pieces at him.

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:24.740
What?

01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.940
How many?

01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:26.740
Three.

01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:29.100
But really hard, like at his head.

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.300
Because I feel bad, but I also don't want to disrespect

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:34.140
my elder.

01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.460
All right, you miss.

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.300
It breaks the window.

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:41.180
Oh, what the fuck?

01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:42.300
That's all of you guys, right?

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:45.620
All right, he climbs up the window.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:46.140
All right.

01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:46.820
Thank you.

01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:47.500
Thank you.

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:48.220
I'm sorry.

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.380
Broke the window, water rings, breadcrumbs.

01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.580
We have to go find drop point Norris, right?

01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.940
Isn't that the thing?

01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:58.340
Alternate pitch.

01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:00.700
We abandon the quest for Patchens gem.

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:01.180
Well, yeah.

01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.500
I mean, you guys do remember that crazy lady that burnt down

01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:05.540
the church originally?

01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:07.740
It was that whole other thing.

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:08.940
What happened to that lady?

01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:09.420
We were bad.

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.540
There's the gargoyle in the side.

01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.260
Patchens has been telling us from the beginning,

01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.100
don't help me.

01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:16.060
I don't want it.

01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:20.900
Wait a minute, I have an idea.

01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:21.580
What was that?

01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:26.900
One thing, I had no use for it, but maybe you guys could.

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.420
I found this map.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:30.740
I take the map.

01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:33.220
It's an old map.

01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:35.860
It has like ripped edges.

01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.020
No, not ripped edges.

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:39.100
Like burnt edges, like it's from the past.

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:39.740
Can I read it?

01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:41.380
Yes, it's written in English.

01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:43.780
I can only speak shambling.

01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:44.860
What language is it?

01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:46.420
It's in guild speak again.

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:50.140
Yeah, I don't know what your Romulan language is.

01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.540
Garry Shandling, can you read guild speak?

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.900
No.

01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.700
I only can read shambling.

01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.820
That's why I'm giving it to you.

01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:01.740
It's pretty clear to me that we have fucked up in this town.

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.380
We have never done anything right in any town.

01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:08.060
But shouldn't we what?

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.980
Shouldn't we just stake out the props box

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.140
and see who's dropping stuff?

01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:14.460
Are you out of your goddamn mind, child?

01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:17.420
I tell you, we have fucked up in this town.

01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.820
Everyone knows what we look like.

01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:20.620
We've attacked a popular man.

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:22.620
So dragged him to a shambling man's hut.

01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:23.420
Then what did we do?

01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.380
We failed to interrogate him.

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:26.620
Just walk me back through it.

01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:29.940
Where do we go back to to start getting back on track?

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:32.180
I think we just wander the fuck out of here.

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:33.100
We fucked up.

01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.020
We can't do anything in this town.

01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:35.540
Is anything here?

01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:37.540
Whatever happened to the music and the undead?

01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.540
Walking around.

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.140
Patches is long gone.

01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:41.100
Patches is sick of us.

01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:42.900
So we're going to go back to Roan with our tailbone

01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:44.940
and our legs, no gem, no nothing.

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:46.700
And we don't even know what we.

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:47.980
Alternate pitch.

01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:49.340
Alternate pitch.

01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:51.300
When the silver flame speaks to you,

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.820
it speaks through burning.

01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:57.180
Destruction is one man's construction.

01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:01.260
The silver flame burns from the center of the earth outward.

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:06.380
It creates infernos wherever you have constructed

01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.300
false realities.

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:11.380
Perhaps we have spent this campaign learning

01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.580
that we need to wander the realm.

01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:16.940
While he's talking, I close my eyes.

01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:19.580
But I, using my little eye mark on my forehead

01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:22.260
that I never use, I can still see him.

01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:24.780
This is a new opportunity for us.

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.260
We can't go back to work.

01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:27.420
We fucked up.

01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.060
We can't even freelance.

01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:30.380
We fucked up.

01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.900
We could wander.

01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:34.540
And we could do good for the church.

01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:36.620
Freelance.

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:40.300
Almost as if we'd have to walk into maybe new dungeons

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:44.300
that we didn't fuck up and forget where we were going.

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.220
Get on the road.

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:45.700
Get on the road.

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.980
We never look back.

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:47.740
Who's Patchen?

01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:48.300
Pedal to the mud.

01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.020
Where's his gem?

01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:49.580
Fuck Patchen.

01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:49.900
Who cares?

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:52.380
Hey, look, you know, maybe down the road,

01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:54.540
maybe we meet Patchen and find a gem.

01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:55.500
But that's not our fucking thing.

01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:58.700
For all we know, we're going to do something so cool.

01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.580
Give me one second.

01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:03.500
Patchen's is going to end up being wherever he is.

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.380
He's like, oh my god, I got my gem back.

01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:07.180
I have a feeling that's what we're destined for.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:07.940
Bigger things.

01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:09.140
Bigger things.

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:09.940
We fucked up.

01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:12.140
Well, I can cancel a couple of meetings

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:15.660
that I have this afternoon and pack a bag.

01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:16.300
You don't fuck it.

01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.220
Let's do it.

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:18.500
Let's do it.

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.020
Let's do it.

01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:20.140
You know, let's do it.

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.060
I got a broken window.

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.060
Winter's coming.

01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:22.420
All right.

01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:24.860
I'll be back in a second here.

01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:26.580
Pack up some of that Pumpernickel and then maybe

01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:27.860
a flask of that tea.

01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:28.340
You got it.

01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:28.980
I see.

01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:29.460
You know what?

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.060
I've never been more excited in my life.

01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:31.560
Yeah.

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:33.540
I've never felt more positive.

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:34.260
This is great.

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.660
You know, I've been tying back on today and go,

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:37.900
that was the beginning.

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:39.540
You're just doing this.

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:40.300
Yeah.

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:42.420
The adventure is not about someone else's gem.

01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:44.540
This is about our own adventure.

01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:45.140
Yes.

01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:45.740
It's not about us.

01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:46.780
Doing things right.

01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:47.260
Yes.

01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:49.180
It's not about knowing things and keeping track of things.

01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:55.700
The great, most adventurous, is what lies ahead.

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.500
All right.

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:57.300
Hats?

01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:58.180
Hats on.

01:53:58.180 --> 01:53:58.700
All right.

01:53:58.700 --> 01:53:59.180
Everybody.

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:00.580
Everybody gets a hat.

01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:02.460
Everybody gets one.

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:03.580
Everybody gets a hat.

01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:04.060
All right.

01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:05.020
Ooh, I like the better than my hat.

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:05.380
Yep.

01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:06.180
That's nice.

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:06.680
Ooh.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.180
Here we go.

01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:08.340
Is this felt?

01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:09.380
It is now.

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:12.020
Lines of velvet.

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:12.500
All right.

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.900
Well, we better get the fuck out of here.

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.220
Is there a shrove talking?

01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:15.980
No, a shrove left.

01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:17.060
Oh, a shrove left.

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:17.700
Oh, OK.

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:21.180
We need a name for our troop.

01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.660
The evacuators.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:23.260
Right.

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:24.420
The evacuators?

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:24.980
Yep.

01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:25.540
All right.

01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:28.780
How about the quitters?

01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:30.900
By any other name.

01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:34.740
How about hat squad?

01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:35.660
Bad pitch.

01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:40.540
How about the stool heads?

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:41.940
No.

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.500
You know, we've got our whole adventure

01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:45.300
to come up with a name.

01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:45.800
Yeah.

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.980
Let's talk about it at our first campfire.

01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:49.740
Let's not do what a lot of other groups do

01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:51.940
and they make a big mistake by trying to come up

01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:55.100
with their whole brand before they find out what the brand is.

01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:56.940
And we'll put in front of the other.

01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:58.460
We don't even know if we're going to get along.

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:01.460
We might even rejigger the whole hierarchy once we get out.

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:02.340
Let's get out of here.

01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:04.860
And see where the silver flame leads us.

01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:08.820
Let's see where it is.

01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:12.060
I go into a druidic trance and I try

01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:16.060
to talk and communicate with the god of the silver flame,

01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:16.860
Spencer.

01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:17.340
OK.

01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:23.660
And I ask, what's the spirit that we talk to the girl?

01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:26.260
It's kind of like the embodiment of the silver flame.

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.540
What?

01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:28.780
I forget.

01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:30.820
What are you talking about?

01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:32.980
Isn't there some sort of person that when you pray,

01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:36.300
you kind of like communicate with a certain voice?

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:37.500
Yeah, the silver flame.

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:38.000
OK.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.500
Yeah, there's that Joan of Arc figure

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:44.100
that there's that young woman that originally

01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.300
merged with the silver flame itself.

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:46.780
Yeah.

01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:48.860
OK, but I can just talk directly to the silver flame.

01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:50.140
I don't need any intermediaries.

01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:51.100
You don't need to know where.

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:52.300
She became part of it.

01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:54.500
Oh, the silver flame.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:55.500
It's Daphne.

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.060
I'm kidding.

01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:56.500
I'm kidding.

01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:57.060
I'm kidding.

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.020
I do that sometimes.

01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:02.340
We, our but humble servants, failed in our attempts

01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:06.100
to please you and to purify this land of evils.

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:11.260
We seek forgiveness, guidance.

01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:15.900
That was just it.

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.100
That's all they had to.

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.740
I said, let's just go.

01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:20.540
Well, I wait.

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.060
I wait to see if I hear any guidance.

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:26.140
Like, give us a point of departure, a destination,

01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:30.980
like a first stop on this new line of adventure

01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:35.820
and conquest of evil throughout your domain.

01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:38.180
You don't really get any sense.

01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:40.100
All right, let's get the fuck out of here.

01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:42.900
Let's just go away from the town where we're wanted by the.

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:46.140
What if his gem's just in the pawn shop?

01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:48.780
Let's just get out of here.

01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.860
Just because it's.

01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:52.700
OK, let's get our hats on.

01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:53.740
Hats on.

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.260
Shambles, we got the.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:56.020
Locking it up.

01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:56.700
We got the bread.

01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:57.580
We got some snacks.

01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:58.500
I got some snacks.

01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.180
And if you want to check the gem shops,

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:03.460
and then we'll we can meet you, we'll meet you up the road.

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:04.980
Yeah, let me just check them out.

01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:05.980
OK, well, we'll meet you.

01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:07.940
Sometimes thieves try to pawn off their stuff.

01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:12.220
All right, well, we'll meet you by the lesson in San Francisco.

01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.260
Just start heading.

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.660
We'll head north north.

01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.140
OK, and we'll meet you.

01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:18.700
We'll meet up with you.

01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:20.540
Go check those gem shops.

01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:21.780
All right, let's go.

01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:25.300
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:27.580
We're going to get the fuck out of here.

01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:28.580
We're in big trouble.

01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:31.540
So we just we just left diarrhea junior behind in a pawn shop.

01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.300
Spencer, I'm going to the pawn shops.

01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:33.860
All right.

01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:35.620
He kept.

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.780
He goes to the pawn shop.

01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:38.620
You go to the pawn shop.

01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:42.740
There's not a pawn shop so much as there is a guy with a guy.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.740
Excuse me.

01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:46.780
So much as there is a guy with a merchant

01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:49.660
stall full of garbage and shit.

01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:54.620
Hey, merchant guy, do you got any gems?

01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:58.060
Hmm.

01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:58.820
Nah, man.

01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:02.740
Gems are expensive and they're not very useful.

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:05.060
We don't really get that kind of stuff around here.

01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.980
Who does get that kind of stuff?

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:09.020
I don't know, man.

01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:13.100
Like investors, like rich people.

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:15.140
Where do I find the rich people?

01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:15.980
Not here, man.

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:17.620
This is Poresville.

01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:20.380
But where's the Richesville?

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:24.380
All over the universe, I'd imagine.

01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:26.420
DJ?

01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:27.700
Well, we're on the road.

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.700
I'm just yelling DJ.

01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:30.180
Maybe.

01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:34.580
Is there another place I could look for someone selling gems?

01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:37.060
Where do people go to sell their gems?

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:39.700
People can go wherever they want.

01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:44.740
Maybe they make agreements with people to buy and sell gems

01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:48.780
and then they go in accordance with those arrangements.

01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:50.580
It's very not specific.

01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:50.980
All right.

01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:53.460
Or is it very specific?

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:55.660
Well, I'm going to miss that kid.

01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:56.700
Yeah, me too.

01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.540
I hope we see him again.

01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:00.500
Do you have any cool things I could buy?

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:01.980
Yeah, man.

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:02.540
What you got?

01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:03.380
Put this out.

01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:04.620
What is it?

01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:06.220
It's a magical spray.

01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:07.980
Hell yeah, what does it do?

01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:08.900
It knocks you out.

01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:10.380
He sprays it in your eyes.

01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:11.100
Oh, jeez.

01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.100
Cliff Hanger!

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:13.940
Yes!

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:15.260
We did it.

01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:15.780
All right.

01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:20.580
Thank you, everybody.

01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.900
Thank you, everybody, so much.

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:25.340
Let's hear for Steve Levy, Diarrhea, Jr.

01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:29.900
who's clearly going to be waylaid by some garbage dealer.

01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:30.380
Yeah.

01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:33.660
Also, before I forget, I wanted to thank not just Rob

01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.660
Chanj, who makes a lot of our music, but also the music I'm

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:39.180
playing right now by a fellow named Nick Vandenberg, who's

01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:41.940
provided lots of music for our Harmontown throughout the

01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:42.780
months and years.

01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.380
I wanted to say thank you for him again.

01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:45.060
Give him a shout out.

01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:47.420
Rob Schrab, everybody!

01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:48.540
The one and only Rob Schrab.

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:51.620
Speaking of shout outs, how about a shout out

01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:55.180
to the Happy New Union of Kris Boruff and Sarah Hill,

01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:57.660
our newlywed, Kris Boruff and Sarah Hill,

01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:59.380
our very own newlyweds.

01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:01.580
Congratulations, Mazel Tov.

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:02.700
They got married on top of us.

02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:05.020
Almost the exact same Kiefer Church, of course.

02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:08.700
Chris, Kevin Day, Nolan, we got everybody here right, I think.

02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:09.740
We love you.

02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:11.100
Thank you so much.

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:11.700
Drive fast.

02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:12.340
Take chances.

02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:15.420
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller, your mayor.

02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:18.020
Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden, your Game Master.

02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:18.820
See you all next time.

02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.420
We love you.

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:22.220
Rob's going to dance us out.

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:24.900
Shamblin' Mound to Shamblin' Mound.

02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:27.180
Oh, he's a Shamblin' Mound.

02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:29.180
Got to get the Shamblin' Mound.

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:31.780
He's going to come back on Harmontown every week.

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.100
Well, there's a brand new dance called the Shamblin' Mound.

02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:36.180
It's going all the way across Shambletown.

02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:43.060
He made himself a character on the campaign trail.

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:48.020
And Steve Levy got abducted because he didn't want to leave

02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:48.520
town.

02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:51.460
Shamblin' Mound, Shamblin' Here, Shamblin' Mound.

02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:52.460
Oh.

02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:54.460
A little bit of a hand bone there.

02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:55.060
Oh, shit.

02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.660
We're going to do it.

02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:57.140
What's this?

02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.140
Oh, fuck off.

02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:05.140
All right, Jack, you got to leave.

02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:25.420
Did you get any of that?

02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:35.600
It's a good show.
