{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.920\nHello, one and all. Thank you for tuning in for beautiful Uptown Burbank.\n\n00:15.920 --> 00:34.760\nHarmontown is now in session. Let's welcome the stage to Game Master Spencer\n\n00:34.760 --> 00:44.240\nCrittenden as he bounds to the stage nimbly like a mountain goat with his bag\n\n00:44.240 --> 01:02.280\nof holding things yeah yeah yeah rapid on the top of my head like butter top\n\n01:02.280 --> 01:06.680\nbread coming out at the top of the show it's gonna help your mind and your body\n\n01:06.680 --> 01:12.000\nand soul grow I'm a motherfucking rap master I saw your mama's ass and blasted\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.200\nwith my penis but it was consensual oh shit it was more than that it was\n\n01:16.200 --> 01:24.120\nsensual I took her out to great America it's a theme park oh we had a good time\n\n01:24.120 --> 01:31.200\nwe had a pretty good time excuse me what's going on up there oh it's\n\n01:31.200 --> 01:34.680\nSchrab all right cut the music Schrab is just hurrying you from the background I\n\n01:34.680 --> 01:37.880\ndon't know I think he's he's hurrying someone else is so loudly that it\n\n01:37.880 --> 01:41.280\nsounded like he was hurrying the show well it sounded like that was more than\n\n01:41.280 --> 01:45.240\nconsensual that it was actually achieved sensual yeah that's kind of cheating it\n\n01:45.240 --> 01:52.880\nrhyme-wise but not politically her name wasn't Swaila her name was conswaila I\n\n01:52.880 --> 01:59.920\ngot I got into the Uber to come here tonight and you still taking those\n\n01:59.920 --> 02:07.080\nUbers huh all right I gotta work on that I gotta take lifts I don't know what it\n\n02:07.080 --> 02:11.440\nis it's like a weird I don't know I don't know what I'm clinging to I think\n\n02:11.440 --> 02:15.800\nit's just that I think it's that the Ubers in Los Angeles they're like big\n\n02:15.800 --> 02:22.520\nvehicles with guys that are like yeah it's the it's the social thing it's the\n\n02:22.520 --> 02:27.440\ndistance like though I took a I the last time I took a lift I told the story I\n\n02:27.440 --> 02:32.200\nthink at least I know I told it on Twitter it like the guy didn't he was\n\n02:32.200 --> 02:37.240\nI yeah I sit with my foot tucked under my butt the guy was like he spent the first\n\n02:37.240 --> 02:45.520\nhalf of the ride complaining about how the area was being gentrified and then\n\n02:45.520 --> 02:49.240\nthe second half of the ride was consumed by this weird moment where he asked me\n\n02:49.240 --> 02:55.240\nto not put my foot on his upholstery it was like a like a it was like a not a\n\n02:55.240 --> 03:01.240\ngood car were you taking regular lifts yeah it wasn't like lift lift asshole or\n\n03:01.240 --> 03:06.440\nyou should be taking lift hot shots it was I mean that this guy was you know\n\n03:06.440 --> 03:09.640\nwhat he may have accepted the fare from the regular lift maybe he's usually\n\n03:09.640 --> 03:14.440\nonly available to lift hot shot but it was like I guess I shouldn't use that\n\n03:14.440 --> 03:18.400\nas an excuse like lots of lift drivers are but it was like Jesus Christ man like\n\n03:18.400 --> 03:21.720\nthere's something there's some line you cross with lift and I think this is\n\n03:21.720 --> 03:26.560\nprobably an LA thing it just seems like Uber continues to be basically Armenian\n\n03:26.560 --> 03:31.680\nlimo limo drivers who are like making money and they're spare time and it's\n\n03:31.680 --> 03:35.920\nnot that they're do you get black car or do you get like regular Uber I got I get\n\n03:35.920 --> 03:41.000\nI get I get I get the I get the like I get the fancy thing yeah because I just\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.400\nI just the distance it's the emotional distance I just wherever I'm going I\n\n03:44.400 --> 03:48.720\njust want to be left alone for the ride you know as I put my earphones in and\n\n03:48.720 --> 03:56.240\nthere's a little small talk you know like tonight halfway halfway there how did\n\n03:56.240 --> 04:08.360\nhe phrase it the guy said let's take a look here he said you go to the Starbucks\n\n04:09.560 --> 04:13.560\nbut that wasn't making small talk like yeah do you like do you like to do\n\n04:13.560 --> 04:17.400\nthings like yeah I think he was probably saying like why are you driving 15 miles\n\n04:17.400 --> 04:22.160\nto a Starbucks isn't aren't there nine of them around your house is like no it's\n\n04:22.160 --> 04:28.400\nthe star burns I was like oh did he make did he make a five stars\n\n04:28.400 --> 04:34.920\nyou make a five stars yeah I know well they always make five stars or whatever\n\n04:34.920 --> 04:38.840\nnow I said I gotta be a yeah I don't know there's no better way to do that\n\n04:38.840 --> 04:44.600\neither right like it you the only time that you these like you pick up your\n\n04:44.600 --> 04:48.520\nphone and you're gonna you're gonna call a ride and then you have to go through\n\n04:48.520 --> 04:54.120\nthis like deposition about your last ride which was probably two days ago did\n\n04:54.120 --> 04:59.000\ndid did Armand do a good job like did you do and now there's like tipping and\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:04.240\nall this shit and I'm not complaining about anything that's the good news like\n\n05:04.240 --> 05:11.000\nI'm so I'm so I'm so low I know low is not the word I'm Schrab like I'm like you\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.160\nknow remember how I was two weeks ago yeah yeah I'm kind of in that Schrab zone\n\n05:15.160 --> 05:18.960\nbut you're a little bit of a funk it might be because Schrab came over today\n\n05:18.960 --> 05:23.400\nthat's a good thing right maybe I got Schrab do you think he he he flunked some\n\n05:23.400 --> 05:27.840\nSchrabbins on you maybe I'm coming down from John Mayer whoa how about that show\n\n05:27.840 --> 05:32.360\nlet's talk about let's talk about our show

listened to like probably half of it it has the\n\n05:45.520 --> 05:49.040\nSteve Levyme feel of approval yeah leave me leave me leave me leave me\n\n05:49.040 --> 05:52.440\nfeels and I don't know who's supposed to be insulted by this but I can tell he\n\n05:52.440 --> 05:57.760\nthinks like now that John Mayer's been on like we're six months from what could\n\n05:57.760 --> 06:04.200\nbe coming on yeah maybe we could get advice on on how to make a Wikipedia from\n\n06:04.200 --> 06:10.200\nthem can I can I embarrass myself what's DMB Dave Matthews band but I but I\n\n06:10.200 --> 06:14.720\ndon't want to insult Dave Matthews band I didn't embarrass myself I don't want\n\n06:14.720 --> 06:18.520\nto insult John Mayer that I don't have I don't care about music I really like\n\n06:18.520 --> 06:24.960\nJohn Mayer he was a Jew I wasn't I was making I was just leavey is leavey is a\n\n06:24.960 --> 06:29.720\nvery big Dave Matthews fan so much so that he calls them the DMB and before\n\n06:29.720 --> 06:33.640\nyou make fun of him for it everyone it's it's something he used to go to with his\n\n06:33.640 --> 06:37.120\ndad and his brother and now his dad's dead so fuck oh so there's sentimentality\n\n06:37.120 --> 06:41.520\nthere yeah okay that's okay but you know if Dave Matthews is listening it's not\n\n06:41.520 --> 06:46.360\nprowess yeah I mean there's a they they rock that heart anyway I don't want Dave\n\n06:46.360 --> 06:50.080\nMatthews to be listening and he's like oh cool this guy's a fan and then it's\n\n06:50.080 --> 06:53.520\nlike oh cuz his dad died and then Dave Matthews is like what's it's not my\n\n06:53.520 --> 06:57.760\nchords somebody's somebody hum me a Dave Matthews band song Steve yell out a\n\n06:57.760 --> 07:27.720\nDave Matthews this is dead on just if you\n\n07:27.720 --> 07:30.600\ndon't know somebody got to put that to a beat we got to get Rob Tanchum on that\n\n07:30.600 --> 07:36.000\none did it was called Dave Matthews band yeah David sounds more like donkey\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:40.920\nMatthews band that's not like that sounded like an emotional donkey that's\n\n07:40.920 --> 07:44.680\na way to speaking of emotions Dan you know people could connect themselves to\n\n07:44.680 --> 07:48.320\nbands because there's sentimental value to it because you went to the show with\n\n07:48.320 --> 07:52.400\nyour father or you grew up listening to it and you know you're your stepmom's\n\n07:52.400 --> 07:57.240\nhouse or whatever and you have these emotional connections to things that\n\n07:57.240 --> 08:02.880\nmaybe you wouldn't have otherwise like sports for instance like people can get\n\n08:02.880 --> 08:06.360\npatriotic about like I'm a dodger's fangs I'm from LA and they get their\n\n08:06.360 --> 08:10.920\nassholes about it or Yankees fans or whoever wherever you're from but some\n\n08:10.920 --> 08:14.280\npeople can just love the San Francisco Giants because that's where their father\n\n08:14.280 --> 08:20.520\ntook them when they were little before the father died so I don't know if you\n\n08:20.520 --> 08:24.840\nhave any special emotional connections to any sports teams I just wish the\n\n08:24.840 --> 08:28.840\nEagles would finally get a Superbowl win\n\n08:43.720 --> 08:47.400\nobviously the you know I'm not gonna pretend I didn't hear about it you\n\n08:47.400 --> 08:52.880\ncan't you can't you can't avoid it the Eagles won it was their first win ever\n\n08:52.880 --> 08:56.760\nliterally ever their first Superbowl win in the history of the franchise a\n\n08:56.760 --> 09:03.200\nfranchise that has got to be whoo who knows how old yeah for 80,000 years what\n\n09:03.200 --> 09:07.640\nwhat stood out for you watching the game most like what was the most capital Y\n\n09:07.640 --> 09:11.720\nyardage like so much that's how they want if you if you go back play by play\n\n09:11.720 --> 09:15.880\nthe Eagles had more yardage that's how they won the Patriots were short on\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:22.480\nyardage they didn't ice their knees and they came in over confident why oh they\n\n09:22.480 --> 09:25.760\nthought they have more yardage from previous games yardage only counts game\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:30.560\nfor game yeah you you you you you you tabulated throughout the season you're\n\n09:30.560 --> 09:33.680\ntrying to figure out like what teams have a better chance of winning but that\n\n09:33.680 --> 09:38.600\ncan be a blessing or a curse in my opinion Jeff and I am I am I'm sorry this\n\n09:38.600 --> 09:45.320\nis just one man's opinion I think that the Patriots came in fucking thinking we\n\n09:45.320 --> 09:51.520\ngot the yardage they but what they failed to understand is that every team starts\n\n09:51.520 --> 09:58.560\nevery game with zero yardage that's a technical fact what do you think this\n\n09:58.560 --> 10:03.440\nloss this loss for the Patriots means for Tom Brady going forward well\n\n10:03.440 --> 10:08.600\nobviously Tom Brady's gonna have a lot of recovery to do his many injuries\n\n10:08.600 --> 10:12.040\nthroughout the game like are just the beginning of it he's also now got\n\n10:12.040 --> 10:15.640\ninjuries related to his leadership I don't know if he sides press conference\n\n10:15.640 --> 10:23.640\nafter the game but he cited practice and coaching and teammanship and you know\n\n10:23.640 --> 10:29.600\nbut what people wanted to hear from him really was leadership first which he did\n\n10:29.600 --> 10:33.600\nmention but he'd mentioned in the wrong order and so Brady's gonna have to\n\n10:33.600 --> 10:36.400\ncircle back and he's gonna have to think am I the person that needs to lead\n\n10:36.400 --> 10:39.360\nthese Patriots he's only five years younger than you are right now he might\n\n10:39.360 --> 10:44.200\nbe the oldest quarterback in Super Bowl history like what are you asking if he's\n\n10:44.200 --> 10:48.320\nthe quarterback what do you even know anything about sports of course Tom\n\n10:48.320 --> 10:52.040\nBrady's the quarterback of the Patriots I'm saying do you think that what does this\n\n10:52.040 --> 10:56.800\nmean for him he's famous for wearing one of a glove like a weird colored glove\n\n10:56.800 --> 11:01.880\nor that's a different player okay all right shit do you think do you think he\n\n11:01.880 --> 11:04.960\nought to retire after this one should he hang up his hang up his weird color\n\n11:04.960 --> 11:08.160\nglove or should he should he bring it back next season I think I think you know\n\n11:08.160 --> 11:12.640\nlook this is a dangerous sport you know no matter how many times you ice your\n\n11:12.640 --> 11:17.360\nknee you're still going out there and not only risking concussion but actually\n\n11:17.360 --> 11:21.360\nstatistically just accumulating concussion and spine injury on behalf of\n\n11:21.360 --> 11:24.520\na corporation that's gonna spend the off season deciding whether there should be\n\n11:24.520 --> 11:27.360\na rule against you kneeling during the fucking national anthem which is kind\n\n11:27.360 --> 11:35.560\nof an insult so let's go into politics quarter yeah how was that I don't like\n\n11:35.560 --> 11:39.160\nreally think of the irony of that imagine being a football player and knowing\n\n11:39.160 --> 11:44.080\nthat the NFL commissioner is gonna is gonna spend this off season thinking\n\n11:44.080 --> 11:51.920\nabout rules against protests on the field clever move always the the anti\n\n11:51.920 --> 11:58.520\nprotest rule hadn't thought of that the these are these and then that concurrently\n\n11:58.520 --> 12:03.760\nlike is all this good concussion information is coming out like like not\n\n12:03.760 --> 12:07.880\nthat it's never been there but it's just it's right there and the zeitgeist right\n\n12:07.880 --> 12:14.200\nnext to the fact that these are people who are not allowed to express in a\n\n12:14.200 --> 12:18.960\ncompletely peaceful way that arguably deferent still to the national anthem the\n\n12:18.960 --> 12:24.520\nfact that while they were lucky enough and talented enough to end up where they\n\n12:24.520 --> 12:28.080\nare with everyone paying attention to them they'd like to risk their entire\n\n12:28.080 --> 12:32.400\ncareer and reputation saying yeah but I'm not comfortable what's going on back\n\n12:32.400 --> 12:36.840\nin my hometown I don't like the policies I'm I'm so I'm gonna kneel during this\n\n12:36.840 --> 12:42.160\nnational anthem as if in deference to my fallen brethren because I don't want to\n\n12:42.160 --> 12:46.880\nprivilege to turn me into someone who turns their back on on their fellow man\n\n12:46.880 --> 12:51.400\nand and and that's caused such a stir because we love to show up and watch\n\n12:51.400 --> 12:55.800\nthese guys injure themselves until they're like basically dead at 40\n\n12:55.800 --> 13:00.880\nphysically because they've their brain has been concussed so many times their\n\n13:00.880 --> 13:06.240\nspine slowly mangled he's talking to you Tom Brady it's kind of fucking\n\n13:06.240 --> 13:11.080\nironic isn't it especially when the two teams in the Super Bowl are the\n\n13:11.080 --> 13:16.080\nPatriots and the Eagles yeah they could have been the Des Moines Star Spangled\n\n13:16.080 --> 13:23.360\nBanners the Uncle Sam's yeah all right well look I don't have anything let's\n\n13:23.360 --> 13:29.160\nput the Trenton Apple pies I don't know\n\n13:29.160 --> 13:33.640\nshit Steve Levyme just came down hard on Tom Brady yeah I don't I don't I don't\n\n13:33.640 --> 13:39.960\nknow who Tom Brady is in case that wasn't clear wasn't he in in Mad Max all\n\n13:39.960 --> 13:47.200\nright was yeah he was mad Max all right well let's bring up tonight's guest\n\n13:47.200 --> 13:50.920\nshe's scared the life out of me I can't think of a better way to follow up our\n\n13:50.920 --> 13:57.040\naward-winning show just emerged like a specter then a visit from from the\n\n13:57.040 --> 14:01.320\nalways surprising find your find your camera find your camera you know for\n\n14:01.320 --> 14:06.960\nfive dollars a month subscribers you can you can see the creepiest entrance of\n\n14:06.960 --> 14:14.680\nall time it's certainly something I have I have a question rub Schrab everybody\n\n14:14.680 --> 14:21.600\nSchrabs in the house Schrabs in the house I've a question I've spent I have a\n\n14:21.600 --> 14:27.000\nspeculation about like the kneeling during the sports you think they're\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.280\nokay oh you think they're tired what you think they're tired it's not what\n\n14:31.280 --> 14:35.400\nyou're gonna say no no I have a question okay so Republicans don't like it when\n\n14:35.400 --> 14:41.880\nthe black people kneel they can't stand it right they hate it okay what if they\n\n14:41.880 --> 14:49.880\nkneeled during something that we liked right like adoption welfare you know\n\n14:49.880 --> 14:53.400\nlike you'll during welfare yeah they could like somebody's handing over a\n\n14:53.400 --> 15:05.520\nwelfare check what if we go what if we go to their churches while they're\n\n15:05.520 --> 15:09.760\npraying and we all just kneel no no no we're already kneeling what do they\n\n15:09.760 --> 15:14.840\nwhat what I'm curious I would like to if I had one of them here I'm like okay\n\n15:14.840 --> 15:18.720\nwe're gonna kneel during that what would you kneel I think it would be very\n\n15:18.720 --> 15:23.360\ntelling yeah I mean oh yeah well you know their answer would be would be\n\n15:23.360 --> 15:29.560\namazing but the but the general class warfare truth is that of course no one\n\n15:29.560 --> 15:34.000\nno one cares when an old white man kneels like the if he if he does it let's\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:40.040\nlet's think about it this is this is like this is like seeds for a comedy\n\n15:40.040 --> 15:44.240\nwell I'm not gonna think about I'm not gonna riff what they would think they\n\n15:44.240 --> 15:48.520\nshould kneel during because it'll be a list of racist shit that because they'll\n\n15:48.520 --> 15:51.760\nbe like what do black people like I don't want to do that I don't want to\n\n15:51.760 --> 15:56.320\nriff a list of what black people like no I don't I've had a hard enough year name\n\n15:56.320 --> 16:01.400\njust play it safe just name it like of the top 100 things you think black\n\n16:01.400 --> 16:05.080\npeople would like a cast a widen that just put three things in there that you\n\n16:05.080 --> 16:10.040\ncould have said during the Oscars you know like the Republicans don't like\n\n16:10.040 --> 16:21.560\nyou're pretty confident that all black people would see he's off on that track so\n\n16:21.560 --> 16:27.160\nokay well I'm really the Republicans what do Republicans not like what do\n\n16:27.160 -->

wow that crocodile Dundee reboot\n\n17:49.240 --> 18:02.680\nlooks pretty good we should have we should have Danny McBride out here yeah\n\n18:02.680 --> 18:07.120\nhe's working on the trailer as far as I couldn't tell if it was a Toyota\n\n18:07.120 --> 18:12.960\ncommercial or a or a a tourism ad which it was for Australia but it also was a\n\n18:12.960 --> 18:17.680\ntie-in to the to promoting this film would they're making a Dundee movie I\n\n18:17.680 --> 18:20.320\ndon't want to shock you I haven't I haven't I haven't seen this thing you\n\n18:20.320 --> 18:24.120\ntalking about the Super Bowl they got Danny McBride and was it Hemmings was\n\n18:24.120 --> 18:27.280\nhis name Chris Hemmings Chris Hemmings and they're doing a Paul Hogan they're\n\n18:27.280 --> 18:31.280\ndoing they're doing a run did Paul Hogan isn't it they're doing a Dundee reboot\n\n18:31.280 --> 18:37.880\nyeah and I'll say what I'm going so is Donald Trump Jr. he's like enjoy your\n\n18:37.880 --> 18:47.360\npopcorn I can't wait he's putting bibs under his eyes now what you're gonna do\n\n18:47.360 --> 18:53.560\nwhat if he goes to the movie and there's Kenny Powers is not a hero what if he\n\n18:53.560 --> 18:57.520\ngoes to the movie and he can and in the movie Danny McBride comes out of a river\n\n18:57.520 --> 19:02.760\nand he wrestles a crocodile and then while he's wrestling it he says like I'm\n\n19:02.760 --> 19:05.960\ntrying to I'm trying to riff a joke that would be like in a comedy movie that was\n\n19:05.960 --> 19:10.600\nlike like like the crocodile like bites him and runs away and then he goes like\n\n19:10.600 --> 19:14.560\noh so you're you're you're gonna you're gonna take the electoral vote results\n\n19:14.560 --> 19:19.560\nhuh and then like so then is Donald Trump Jr. gonna then get back on Twitter\n\n19:19.560 --> 19:24.760\nand go I'd like to recant like I was very disappointed he wouldn't express that\n\n19:24.760 --> 19:27.160\nright because it would be an admission of weakness because it would mean that\n\n19:27.160 --> 19:30.880\nhe was capable of being wrong about I think he would say I was having a good\n\n19:30.880 --> 19:41.240\ntime with my bros watching Danny McBride Dundee and then they had to typically do\n\n19:41.240 --> 19:48.680\nthis below the belt stuff during my Danny McBride and just ruined my evening\n\n19:48.680 --> 19:54.680\nme and my wife and my bras we had to get out of there and just we just had to go\n\n19:54.680 --> 19:59.240\nhome and I had to put an ice pack on Donald Trump Jr. and I just hated it\n\n19:59.240 --> 20:04.640\nDonald you're trying to enjoy yourself and the Hollywood elite DJ's gonna come\n\n20:04.640 --> 20:12.000\non DJ's we are below the belt DJ get back to the DJ our car is here poop all over my Danny McBride\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:17.920\nDonnie you're embarrassing bullshit and it's stupid and it's entitlist and it's\n\n20:17.920 --> 20:26.000\nand it's it is fucking just inappropriate I hate it I hate it yes\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:38.600\nEric donnie I'm just saying get back in the car you're embarrassing yourself there's\n\n20:38.600 --> 20:41.920\nan interesting point there which is that or the least interesting point of all\n\n20:41.920 --> 20:45.320\nbecause you notice that it's like all this whole like the liberal media and\n\n20:45.320 --> 20:48.520\nthe liberal entertainers and the comedians like oh we will we don't like\n\n20:48.520 --> 20:51.560\nthe thing and then the and then you notice all the I think I think there is\n\n20:51.560 --> 20:55.480\nlike a theme there where it's like that is exactly how we'd react he'd react as\n\n20:55.480 --> 21:00.600\nif he was entitled big to this movie and the and that this horrible choice had\n\n21:00.600 --> 21:06.000\nbeen made that didn't have to be made you didn't have to go there what a shame\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.840\nwhich is exactly what kneeling before the anthem as well why do they have to\n\n21:08.840 --> 21:14.320\nthis this game of football where my corporation owns these gladiators who\n\n21:14.320 --> 21:19.720\ngo out and mangle their spines for me like it was it was perfect it's already\n\n21:19.720 --> 21:25.240\nfine who cares that everyone doing it has this opinion just get rid of that\n\n21:25.240 --> 21:29.680\nopinion I think that's so inconvenient so stupid of them like how why would they\n\n21:29.680 --> 21:34.120\nwant to do that to a great game like football they are the game of football\n\n21:34.120 --> 21:38.240\nlike what are you gonna do without them I guess you'll replace them with like\n\n21:38.240 --> 21:42.760\nworse football players that love the national anthem I didn't I don't want\n\n21:42.760 --> 21:46.440\nsports did they need did anybody I don't know I don't know what's going on I\n\n21:46.440 --> 21:50.360\ndidn't see any kneeling there was some arm-linking a couple guys one guy was\n\n21:50.360 --> 21:53.600\njust like some people looked away some people didn't have their hands on their\n\n21:53.600 --> 21:56.360\nhearts which will probably be the next new illegal thing I'll tell you one\n\n21:56.360 --> 22:02.480\nthing that I found very impious NFL National Football League I found Justin\n\n22:02.480 --> 22:07.280\nTimberlake's outfits with his band a little a little hoboey little racy a\n\n22:07.280 --> 22:10.720\nlittle hoboey too much skin as Doug Benson or I think so I think was like\n\n22:10.720 --> 22:16.200\nBenson said he looked like a cowboy house painter and the church what was\n\n22:16.200 --> 22:25.240\nyours church a blood because he had a red one he had a red band on she goes is\n\n22:25.240 --> 22:30.240\nhe a blood now or he just come back from the groom yeah I love that that's an\n\n22:30.240 --> 22:34.040\nactual like groomer thing like I did I thought that was one groomer thing of\n\n22:34.040 --> 22:38.520\nthem like yeah I don't know if you're a laboratory you come back you come back\n\n22:38.520 --> 22:44.040\nwith a red handkerchief on I'm sure you went on look here's the thing I'm not\n\n22:44.040 --> 22:51.720\ntalking shit about J.

accidentally found myself in\n\n33:44.840 --> 33:50.640\nthe position of explaining the memo to people that were like the rest of us all\n\n33:50.640 --> 33:55.040\nseeking clarity on the fucking stupid ass memo and if you're listening to this\n\n33:55.040 --> 33:58.280\nthree years in the future because you're catching up on 500 episodes of Harmon\n\n33:58.280 --> 34:01.720\ndon't bother trying to parse it there was a there was this point during the\n\n34:01.720 --> 34:06.960\nfucking six-year remake of the Nixon administration where this fucking sub\n\n34:06.960 --> 34:14.120\nsub sub plot about some dude in the woods in the north of the wall called the\n\n34:14.120 --> 34:20.120\nNunez memo is happening and and no and and it was it was dumb but yeah I can't\n\n34:20.120 --> 34:23.240\nI can't really explain that I mean if you're listening to this three years in\n\n34:23.240 --> 34:29.200\nthe future this is 2018 this is back in a time when money was still frothy mm-hmm\n\n34:29.200 --> 34:35.200\nand yeah and Rob was still I was still a Cheapy Peepy I do recommend for that\n\n34:35.200 --> 34:39.120\nreason like listen again to slow burn it's the it takes you through the Nixon\n\n34:39.120 --> 34:42.960\nadministration and it's not in a cheeky way it's just it's just it's it's a\n\n34:42.960 --> 34:46.920\nlittle bit comforting sometimes it's a little sometimes it kind of bums you out\n\n34:46.920 --> 34:53.880\nbut it like it's like it's just it just walks you through the six-year\n\n34:53.880 --> 35:04.560\nadministration of an administration kind of destined to impeach and it's\n\n35:04.560 --> 35:09.440\ninteresting how long it takes and how many B stories are due to I was just\n\n35:09.440 --> 35:14.720\nreminded in like the second to last episode that Spiro Agnew was the vice\n\n35:14.720 --> 35:23.040\npresident and he had to step down because of a completely unrelated scandal\n\n35:23.040 --> 35:27.040\nthat he just had going on on the side he was just like he was like a money\n\n35:27.040 --> 35:32.160\nlaunderer and a bribe taker and stuff and he he got caught doing it and he\n\n35:32.160 --> 35:36.440\njust had to step down from the vice presidency amid the Watergate shit like\n\n35:36.440 --> 35:41.160\nit just happened as a side order of potatoes some rice balls that came to\n\n35:41.160 --> 35:44.840\nthe to the table you think a guy with a name like Spiro Agnew would have a shit\n\n35:44.840 --> 35:48.720\ntogether yeah he would like he would have built a fortress around any mistake\n\n35:48.720 --> 35:53.600\nhe might like he would be the most reliable person gotta have a cybernetic\n\n35:53.600 --> 36:06.640\nhand yeah I am spear new surrender to me Spiro Agnew all right Spiro Agnew is online I

dramatic\n\n36:47.320 --> 36:55.440\nthan the 209 knocked over my cup but more silent and less lethal I am the more\n\n36:55.440 --> 37:00.240\nsuperior version of my foot my foot sorry about that is it true that you're\n\n37:00.240 --> 37:03.400\nbeing asked to resign from the vice presidency I will now step down from the\n\n37:03.400 --> 37:07.720\nvice presidency to do a totally unrelated but parallel scandal involving the\n\n37:07.720 --> 37:14.800\nWhite House and I will be replaced with Gerald Ford and then and then after Dan\n\n37:14.800 --> 37:19.520\nexplaining me all this he goes

the act and then we\n\n01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.040\ncriminalize the act all these things it's like people can be in love they are\n\n01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.480\nevery day without anybody

01:06:42.840\nunderage yeah I mean I'm not I'm not gonna say everybody goes yeah but it's\n\n01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.000\nFrance I did find that kind of fascinating though because I like I'm\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.920\nvery happy to be done with have Milo Yiannopoulos be out of the picture but\n\n01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:57.000\nisn't that kind of what he was gay-splaining on the Rogan show or\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.360\nwhatever like what he finally like we found his off switch and his off switch\n\n01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:05.280\nwas that he was technically in favor of whatever because wasn't wasn't his whole\n\n01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.000\nlike monologue just about the fact that when you're gay because you're already\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.240\ntaboo and you're not there is no prom night for you and there is no like\n\n01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.240\nrigorously set up rails to your sexuality that the way that you often\n\n01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:23.280\nencounter your your sexuality is through the indoctrination by the people\n\n01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.800\nlike I couldn't love the guy for I'm so happy that something brought him down I\n\n01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:36.120\njust find it ironic is that how it happens Dan that's how it happens that's not funny\n\n01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.520\nhave you guys ever seen videos of people skydiving naked it's pretty funny\n\n01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.600\nbecause everything's just flipping and flopping and so so you went mine wouldn't\n\n01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:53.320\nwalk down you're like hey I was checking out like all the hang gliders what\n\n01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:58.200\nare you your giant your giant balls skydiving it would be a spectacle I\n\n01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.920\ncould use them as a parachute you think you can did you talk to anybody down\n\n01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.880\nthere like one of those flying squirrel like like Red Bull like like

privates it's a normal room\n\n01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:27.440\ntemperature look like a big but you yeah it's like a just a big pair of balls and\n\n01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.640\nthen at the top of them it's just like a there's just a little just a little\n\n01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.560\nnipple coming out the fun time Harry I'm just like hey look I'm not gonna make a\n\n01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.520\nfuss unless anybody wants me out here do you think your balls are doing your\n\n01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.000\ndick at this service by putting that your dick into that high a contrast\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.280\nbecause of that big yeah I can't tell if the yeah if it's an illusion that's\n\n01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.280\nlike wow those are big balls or but I've seen the photo that Cody took of you\n\n01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.320\nwith your balls hanging out that we that we keep torturing Steve Levy with yeah\n\n01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:02.960\nthey're big your balls are the size of like like like lemons like big huh yes\n\n01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.280\nthat's yes yeah I mean I would I mean yes bigger than mine and they're\n\n01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.800\ncertainly big for a guy who's dick is a nipple yeah that yeah it's like what is\n\n01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.200\nthe point of this what is being generated in those balls that's gonna like it\n\n01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.600\nalways feels weird it's like if the fire department came up and they had like a\n\n01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.680\ngiant water tank on their fire truck and then they took out a little Capri Sun\n\n01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.320\nstraw and they're like don't worry man we'll have your love your house safe in\n\n01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.800\na second like what I don't I appreciate the effort but it'd be like if the fire\n\n01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:37.080\ntruck pulled up and they're like all right let's get out the hose right\n\n01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.200\nsomething like that I don't know what the metaphor I know it breaks down because\n\n01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.040\nit's like it's not a dick's job to like pour a bunch of come into it all right\n\n01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:52.760\nlet's kind of literally let's put out this fire yeah he's miming like a\n\n01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.800\nwhore a hose that's not it's moments like this when I wonder why more than\n\n01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.160\never we don't get a bunch of black women on our show this seems like the\n\n01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:11.960\nperfect platform it was supposed to be a black woman for sure if not for Steve\n\n01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.040\nno no it's scar scars yeah there's always a next week the week after I will\n\n01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.280\nhave a it's 9-11 great black always the week after it was just 9-11 I bet I\n\n01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:31.280\ncould wear this chair 9-11 9-12 now it's 9-12 I don't want this can't this\n\n01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.600\ncan't we're gonna have to call the fire department please do it don't ever stop\n\n01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.640\ndoing what you're doing where's church when we need it for Chris can you 3d\n\n01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:47.680\npray a saw yeah we're gonna need one all right Schrab has shoved his head to the\n\n01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.840\nback of a folding chair and for real like I saw it go through and like you\n\n01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.280\ncan tell it won't come out gonna come off because his ears are like the that's\n\n01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.040\nhow arrows are designed like you keep you're not supposed to be able to pull\n\n01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.120\nan arrow out the metal tubing that's used to form the structural frame of the\n\n01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.520\nchair is not strong enough like it would be easy to cut but it wouldn't be\n\n01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.560\ncomfortable to do so but also what you can't see even in photographs is the\n\n01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.640\nfact that you know everyone I had to photograph it because it was clearly an\n\n01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:31.960\nact that was done for you know there was no reason for him to do it it just he's\n\n01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:39.760\ndrinking a cup that was placed on the chair like a cup holder oh that would\n\n01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.360\nbe crazy it would be just like this I think but that but that's great because\n\n01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.880\nyou can put your drink down right by your face it would make sense like in an\n\n01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:55.120\napocalyptic world because there would be no place for anyone to sit down right\n\n01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.400\nbefore the apocalypse and then there would be like a bunch of empty chairs\n\n01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.240\nbecause the apocalypse happened but there'd be no buddy making clothes and\n\n01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.480\nthen so everyone's walking around wearing chairs and couches and stuff you\n\n01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.160\nguys all the rich people will be wearing barrels with suspenders but this is a\n\n01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.160\nthis is a very poor you guys you guys are laughing at me but I'm all ready for\n\n01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:19.360\nfor like Mad Max Road Warrior like yeah I like everybody's like you know like\n\n01:12:19.360 -->

this meeting until tomorrow?\n\n01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:54.940\nIt's a safety issue.\n\n01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.580\nHe's trying to hold his ear flat enough\n\n01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.300\nagainst his head with his hand, which\n\n01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.820\nmakes his head twice as wide.\n\n01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.740\nHe's going to rip his ears off.\n\n01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.820\nYeah, don't help him.\n\n01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.540\nDon't help him.\n\n01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.060\nHelping him is hurting him.\n\n01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.780\nWhat if you tuck the chair?\n\n01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.380\nOK.\n\n01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.500\nCan you tuck the chair?\n\n01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.380\nWell, at least mic him, mic him for the free listeners.\n\n01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.740\nThey might be inspired to subscribe.\n\n01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.980\nHe's passed the ear.\n\n01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.940\nBy the way, this is brought to you by Quip Toothbrushes,\n\n01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:22.500\nthe toothbrush that vibrates when you use it.\n\n01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.740\nQuip Toothbrushes come with a suction sticker thing.\n\n01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.540\nIt goes in your mirror.\n\n01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.180\nThey stick right to the mirror.\n\n01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.980\nThere's no dirty charger.\n\n01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.780\nThey said it couldn't be done.\n\n01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.860\nHe's out.\n\n01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.820\nAnd so are your teeth if you don't use Quip.\n\n01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:41.900\nI wore a chair as a shirt.\n\n01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:45.460\nThat's what it would be like if people wore furniture as close\n\n01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.660\nbecause they ran out of clothes.\n\n01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.860\nListen, man.\n\n01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.740\nI've been a listener of your podcast for a long time.\n\n01:14:51.740

01:15:04.700\nHi.\n\n01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.740\nNo, I think it might be Levy.\n\n01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:06.240\nHi.\n\n01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:06.740\nHello.\n\n01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.240\nHi.\n\n01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:07.740\nNo.\n\n01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:08.240\nHello.\n\n01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:08.740\nHi.\n\n01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.240\nOh, no.\n\n01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.700\nWhat about that one?\n\n01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.500\nHello, hi.\n\n01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.980\nHello, hi.\n\n01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.700\nHello, hello, hi.\n\n01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.380\nHello, hi.\n\n01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.740\nHello, hi.\n\n01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.660\nI just turned it all the way down,\n\n01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:29.020\nand the result is Rob sounds like Paul Rudd.\n\n01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:29.620\nHello, hi.\n\n01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.300\nAll right.\n\n01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:34.980\nThat was good.\n\n01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.980\nWork good with magic.\n\n01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.660\nI don't think work my mic.\n\n01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.980\nI don't think you're going to get John Mayer up here\n\n01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.180\nand fucking put furniture on and fucking do a Mad Max sketch.\n\n01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:49.260\nI bet he would stop just short of putting it on and wearing\n\n01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.740\na chair as a shirt.\n\n01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.300\nI think it was Ancest like that that got him in that hot water\n\n01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.100\nin the first place.\n\n01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.140\nAnd he's now, he doesn't have the courage\n\n01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.820\nto start wearing furniture on podcasts.\n\n01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.180\nI'm touched by your envy.\n\n01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.900\nI wish you could express it in a more healthy way\n\n01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:04.180\nthan attacking him or me.\n\n01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:10.780\nI think it's nice that I had a brief moment of friendship\n\n01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.660\nwith a guy that, you know, like, laugh all you want.\n\n01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.740\nI think we'll make more.\n\n01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.300\nYou guys are still friends, I think.\n\n01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.940\nYeah, but I probably already smothered him\n\n01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.300\nby mentioning him too much during my workout.\n\n01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.060\nYeah, he hated that.\n\n01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:25.940\nI'm different in shit now.\n\n01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.420\nThere's got to be dust all over me.\n\n01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.500\nOh, boy.\n\n01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.900\nOh, you got lacquer all over your back.\n\n01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.060\nYou all right?\n\n01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:34.660\nBack lacquer?\n\n01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.460\nBack lacquer.\n\n01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:41.100\nYou got stool resin.\n\n01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.180\nI don't think you guys really gave my character\n\n01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.140\nstool head the time to really flesh that character out.\n\n01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.460\nI think it was the highlight of the evening.\n\n01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.300\nI think we did a lot of things wrong tonight.\n\n01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.860\nThat was probably number 50 on the list.\n\n01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.380\nI don't regret a goddamn bit of it.\n\n01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:01.780\nI think people at NASCAR, people go to NASCAR every week.\n\n01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.460\nWhat's that?\n\n01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.700\nCars running in a circle.\n\n01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.740\nYou're only really there in case there's a crash.\n\n01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:06.940\nNo one wants to admit it.\n\n01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:07.980\nSometimes there's a crash.\n\n01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.180\nSometimes a crash is exciting.\n\n01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.140\nWhat are you going to watch?\n\n01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.340\nA car go around in a circle faster?\n\n01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.260\nWhatever.\n\n01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.980\nLike, I'm not being defensive.\n\n01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:20.180\nI'm saying to our subscribers, I think this was worth it.\n\n01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.980\nI think this trick, this has been a fucking Japanese jet\n\n01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.780\ntrain to fucking Fun Town.\n\n01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:25.900\nYeah.\n\n01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.540\nWhat time is it?\n\n01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.500\nUsually I don't clock there.\n\n01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.740\nI wear these glasses just so I could read the clock.\n\n01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.340\nWhat?\n\n01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.700\nHit the B.\n\n01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.420\nWhat?\n\n01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.660\nD&D?\n\n01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:34.540\nNo.\n\n01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.180\nIt's 19.\n\n01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.300\nIt's 9.19 right now.\n\n01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.940\nThat seems like a good, solid time to play D&D for.\n\n01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.620\nLet's do this.\n\n01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.140\nLet's do it for real.\n\n01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:43.780\nOh, shit.\n\n01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.500\nSpencer, you got the folders.\n\n01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.500\nYou got the goods?\n\n01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.060\nI will.\n\n01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.980\nYou got the mats?\n\n01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.980\nMots?\n\n01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.100\nSpencer got the mats.\n\n01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.940\nMatze?\n\n01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.460\nMatze.\n\n01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.260\nHow do you guys celebrate the Jewish festivals,\n\n01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.500\nlike in full Jewish fashion?\n\n01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:03.620\nDo you guys really keep the shibas and the shabbas?\n\n01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:04.460\nAnd whatever you call them?\n\n01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.060\nThe shibas.\n\n01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.180\nThe shibas.\n\n01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:06.940\nI'm making things up.\n\n01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.940\nI don't know what I'm talking about.\n\n01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.540\nAre you guys?\n\n01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.740\nAre people die?\n\n01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.580\nBut you guys, did you mean the Jews?\n\n01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.300\nYeah, he did.\n\n01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.260\nLevy, what's a Maccabee?\n\n01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:22.260\nThe Maccabees are the army.\n\n01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.700\nThey were like warriors, right?\n\n01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.780\nYeah, the warriors.\n\n01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.940\nThey kicked a bunch of ass.\n\n01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:26.780\nYeah, they did, yeah.\n\n01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.740\nAre you keeping something from us?\n\n01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.620\nNo.\n\n01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.500\nWhat does he know that?\n\n01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.340\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:35.820\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:44.700\nI don't think we ever learned about Dave Matthews' band,\n\n01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.820\nwhich was the whole premise of bringing Steve up.\n\n01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.740\nWhere did you get the name from?\n\n01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.740\nThey got the name because, so Dave\n\n01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:57.060\nis a bartender at this bar in downtown.\n\n01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.780\nOh, Matthews.\n\n01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.940\nBall Charlottesville.\n\n01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.020\nIt's called Miller's Bar.\n\n01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.940\nHe's a bartender.\n\n01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:04.940\nMatthews' bar.\n\n01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.020\nEveryone knew Dave because he was a friendly guy.\n\n01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.500\nAnd that was the local establishment.\n\n01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.540\nIt's like the drawing room there.\n\n01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:14.900\nAnd people would play live music there.\n\n01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.860\nAnd he started playing and getting all these musicians\n\n01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.140\nto play with them.\n\n01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.420\nAnd they didn't have a name.\n\n01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.380\nBut people loved Dave and the band.\n\n01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.380\nAnd they were like, oh, you're going\n\n01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:29.020\nto see Dave Matthews' band at the tracks?\n\n01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.940\nAnd that just gets stuck.\n\n01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.420\nIt's after him.\n\n01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.820\nIt's stuck because they didn't have a name.\n\n01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.500\nIt was like, yeah, Dave Matthews from Miller's.\n\n01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.380\nHis band is playing.\n\n01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.420\nDave Matthews' band.\n\n01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:41.620\nYou don't think that was his plan all along?\n\n01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.220\nYou don't think the bass player had ever said,\n\n01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.620\nmaybe we should call it laser eaters?\n\n01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.580\nAnd he was like, oh, you know, it\n\n01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.140\ndoesn't seem that organic to me.\n\n01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.380\nI like that people keep calling it my name.\n\n01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:58.780\nThe bass player was 16 and he dropped out of high school.\n\n01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.140\nYou can't do that, man.\n\n01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.500\nWell, he's a millionaire.\n\n01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:05.740\nWell, does he know about geometry?\n\n01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:06.220\nProbably.\n\n01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.780\nGood luck.\n\n01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.980\nGood luck.\n\n01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.580\nAlgorithm.\n\n01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:12.460\nGood luck.\n\n01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:15.260\nBefore I forget, in case D&D sweeps us away.\n\n01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.820\nAlso, wait, wait, I want to say something.\n\n01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.320\nDan.\n\n01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.220\nSteve.\n\n01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:21.660\nLicensed and Smarching, a Dave Matthews' band song,\n\n01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.500\nfor the finale of season five community.\n\n01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.900\nAnd it's probably the best use of Dave Matthews' band song\n\n01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.340\noutside of maybe.\n\n01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:34.340\nI think it's better than Crash Enemy and Lady Bird.\n\n01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.980\nBut it was an incredibly effective, amazing moment\n\n01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.220\nfor Greendale Community College.\n\n01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:43.100\nEverybody coming together is a perfect, perfect, perfect drop.\n\n01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.420\nRemember doing that episode, Dan?\n\n01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.780\nYeah.\n\n01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.380\nA little bit.\n\n01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.860\nI have some flashbacks.\n\n01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.660\nYeah.\n\n01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:59.060\nI remember whoever the rep was going, like, OK,\n\n01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.940\nwe watched the episode where you guys referenced us.\n\n01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.620\nThe price has gone up, because number one, you need us.\n\n01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:10.140\nNumber two, you're making fun of us.\n\n01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.620\nSo I think that will be $8 a song now.\n\n01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:14.540\nThank you very much.\n\n01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.860\nAnd we were like, ooh.\n\n01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.180\nWell, I always wanted the ass crack band\n\n01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:25.380\nto be Dave Matthews after you had Ben Foles in there.\n\n01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.500\nI think that's what it canonically\n\n01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:31.900\nwas, was Dave Matthews.\n\n01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:37.500\nDo you think, if we title the episode Worst Episode Ever,\n\n01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.620\nwill it then become the best episode ever?\n\n01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.300\nBecause people go, well, then they\n\n01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:42.780\ncalled it the worst episode ever.\n\n01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:46.380\nWe should title the episode, I feel like a bag of smashed\n\n01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.340\nassholes.\n\n01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.780\nHow's it going?\n\n01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.460\nI was going to go with Chippy Pippy, but.\n\n01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:52.460\nChippy Pippy.\n\n01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:53.460\nHa, ha, ha.\n\n01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.940\nChippy Pippy.\n\n01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.620\nChippy Pippy.\n\n01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.700\nChippy Pippy, oh, your time has come.\n\n01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700\nI write things down.\n\n01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:03.980\nI wrote next to it, I wrote, money is a river, it's frothy.\n\n01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.780\nAnd then right next to it, I'm not a Chippy Pippy.\n\n01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.260\nI'm not.\n\n01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.980\nI never called you.\n\n01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.860\nYeah, Jeff never called you a Chippy Pippy.\n\n01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.380\nNo, it was all Dan.\n\n01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:15.540\nDo you think when they were writing Sister Christian,\n\n01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.100\nwas that warrant?\n\n01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.380\nWhy do I think church knows that?\n\n01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:19.540\nDo you know, you don't know?\n\n01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:23.140\nNo, that's a night ranger, night ranger, night ranger.\n\n01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.540\nSister Christian, oh, your time is coming.\n\n01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.380\nAnd they get to the refrain, and then somebody was like,\n\n01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:33.940\nI don't know, your motor in.\n\n01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.100\nMotor in?\n\n01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.020\nWhat?\n\n01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.940\nWhat's your price for a flight?\n\n01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.460\nYeah, someone was like, what do you mean motor in?\n\n01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.620\nAnd he's like, well, what's your price for a flight?\n\n01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.300\nI thought this was about nuns.\n\n01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.980\nMotor in was a guy that they knew.\n\n01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.820\nI can't believe that you thought warrant wrote that,\n\n01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:52.940\nbecause they're famous for, she's my cherie pie.\n\n01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.260\nYeah, they're the worst.\n\n01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:54.940\nThey're the worst.\n\n01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.140\nI love them, but they're the worst.\n\n01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:58.220\nWell, how about the great thing about the past\n\n01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:01.420\nis it all runs together like a big fucking sad pudding?\n\n01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.900\nHell yeah.\n\n01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.180\nThere's your title.\n\n01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.660\nThank god.\n\n01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.900\nYou never hear that like NPR thing about the people?\n\n01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:08.980\nLet's call the episode sad pudding.\n\n01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.980\nYou always wish you could remember everything,\n\n01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.620\nand then those people that have like crazy memory,\n\n01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.780\nlike they can't avoid their memory,\n\n01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:19.180\nlike apparently Mary Lou Henner is one of them.\n\n01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.980\nThey're so fucking sad.\n\n01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.180\nThey hate their lives, because they can never\n\n01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:28.300\nforget how it felt to be a shitty boyfriend\n\n01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.820\nor on that fifth relationship in.\n\n01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.300\nLike there's so much shit that you want to forget.\n\n01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:36.380\nWith such a shitty boyfriend?\n\n01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:42.220\nThat's like, every day, she's like waking up.\n\n01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.340\nThat's what PTSD is, I think.\n\n01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.220\nWell, the reason she doesn't have a podcast\n\n01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.820\nis because two weeks from now, she'd still\n\n01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.100\nbe remembering this episode.\n\n01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.660\nWhereas I'm going to be like, I don't know.\n\n01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.700\nMaybe let's have Duncan Trussell back.\n\n01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:53.380\nFucking awful.\n\n01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.540\nSeems like a fun thing.\n\n01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.380\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:58.300\nYou piece of shit.\n\n01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.580\nBut I'm just saying, we think that because only time\n\n01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.580\nthat we realize that we can't remember stuff, we feel weak.\n\n01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.100\nIt's like not being able to lift something.\n\n01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.140\nSo we go, I wish I could lift everything,\n\n01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.380\nbut there are people who can lift everything memory-wise.\n\n01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:13.100\nAnd it's kind of a bummer for them.\n\n01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.580\nI'm really looking through my spell list, Spencer.\n\n01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.980\nAnd I didn't realize that I have reduced animal.\n\n01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:23.020\nAnd it says, shrinks down one all caps willing animal.\n\n01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.020\nYeah.\n\n01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.980\nHow do I know that there's consent from an animal\n\n01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.500\nto shrink that animal down?\n\n01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.180\nOh, if you have to ask.\n\n01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.180\nI mean, come on.\n\n01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.620\nFair enough.\n\n01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.580\nFair enough.\n\n01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.100\nNo, I mean, you're a druid.\n\n01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.820\nYou can get a sense of animals.\n\n01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.740\nWell, yeah, because what if it's one of my nature's allies?\n\n01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.240\nYeah.\n\n01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:41.740\nThat's an ally.\n\n01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.260\nShe'd probably love to be reduced.\n\n01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.980\nYeah.\n\n01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.220\nLet's do it.\n\n01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:49.460\nWell, there's no rush, really.\n\n01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.100\nI have another question as well.\n\n01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.580\nWasn't I almost dead?\n\n01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.020\nThat's all I remember.\n\n01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:54.780\nYeah.\n\n01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.500\nI never really, I think I was down to two hit points.\n\n01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.140\nDo you need some halons?\n\n01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:58.820\nYou were.\n\n01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.860\nAs we crawled out the window of that pub.\n\n01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.500\nAnd then.\n\n01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.620\nAre we at my house?\n\n01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:09.420\nAnd then we dragged, what was his name, the guy?\n\n01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:10.140\nShrove.\n\n01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.420\nShrove, too.\n\n01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.020\nThere was a guy at Shambling.\n\n01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.060\nShambling, Garry Shandling, Garry Shandling.\n\n01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:19.500\nBack into us, it took us through a crack in the wall.\n\n01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:19.980\nYeah.\n\n01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:21.020\nTook us to a crack in the wall.\n\n01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:21.980\nTook us to a place.\n\n01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:22.480\nYeah.\n\n01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.900\nIs that, I guess you could take it from there.\n\n01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.300\nThat's what I remember.\n\n01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:27.260\nYep.\n\n01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:30.140\nAll right, Spencer, do you want to let her rip?\n\n01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.300\nOr do we already just do it?\n\n01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.900\nDo you want to give us a proper caption?\n\n01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.660\nI'll do it.\n\n01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:35.900\nNot caption, but recap, rather.\n\n01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:46.980\nLast time on Harmon Time, our heroes went to Dornaster\n\n01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.260\non the quest for Patchen's gem.\n\n01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.500\nThey were searching for information.\n\n01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.220\nAnd they went to the Church of the Body Temple\n\n01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.300\nand then another church to look for clues.\n\n01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.100\nAnd acting upon those clues, they went to the theater,\n\n01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:07.140\nwhere they heard the name of one person, Shrove.\n\n01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.940\nSo they went in search of that person.\n\n01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:14.780\nAnd they caught him out with his pants down, literally,\n\n01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.260\nbecause he was in the bathroom.\n\n01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:19.540\nThey burst in in the bathroom, causing\n\n01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.580\na scene immediately.\n\n01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.460\nAnd a near riot as enemy combatants\n\n01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:28.180\nflooded into the magically darkened bathroom\n\n01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:32.740\nuntil our heroes beat a hasty retreat with their quarry\n\n01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:37.660\nin tow, trying to extricate themselves from the mob.\n\n01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.220\nThey didn't try hard enough.\n\n01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.660\nAnd the mob was on their heels.\n\n01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:46.100\nBut then Chad shot fire and started a fire.\n\n01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:51.220\nAnd then Carlos used his solar flare\n\n01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:54.820\nto cover their escape, which was also\n\n01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:00.780\naided by the random addition of a shambling mound.\n\n01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:05.140\nTogether, they traveled to a pig farm\n\n01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:11.460\nand at hiding behind a broken collection of bits of wall,\n\n01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:18.300\nthey hunkered down with their still unruly, unwilling,\n\n01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:22.740\nhostage, Shrove.\n\n01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.180\nWhat would happen?\n\n01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:27.100\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.580\nFind out today.\n\n01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:34.980\nWhoa.\n\n01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.620\nSo I'm making some green tea.\n\n01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.900\nIf you guys want anything.\n\n01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.060\nThanks, Garry Shandling.\n\n01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:47.180\nOK, put the kettle on for four cups?\n\n01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:47.780\nFour cups?\n\n01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.900\nI would adore a cup of tea.\n\n01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.400\nThank you.\n\n01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.860\nYou got one cup, two, two?\n\n01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.980\nCan we make it an even three?\n\n01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.900\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:56.900\nAll right.\n\n01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.740\nAll right, here we go.\n\n01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:02.300\nLet's get back to interrogating this guy.\n\n01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.140\nSpencer, what state is Shrove in?\n\n01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.420\nLike, what do we have?\n\n01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:07.500\nWhat happened?\n\n01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.060\nAre we?\n\n01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.740\nIs he locked up?\n\n01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.380\nIs he?\n\n01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:12.740\nI don't think he's locked up.\n\n01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:18.220\nI think Dan has had him kind of grappled to some extent.\n\n01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.300\nI want to, I feel like I remember,\n\n01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.180\nand if it's only in my head, I want to secure him.\n\n01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:28.580\nI want to ligature him.\n\n01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.780\nWhat?\n\n01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.340\nI want to tie him up.\n\n01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.940\nDo you own rope?\n\n01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.180\nYou could have mine.\n\n01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.380\nThanks.\n\n01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.460\nAre you good at tying with this?\n\n01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:41.300\nAs good as anybody else?\n\n01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.860\nWell, probably better than me.\n\n01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:45.020\nI haven't spent 10 years in a library.\n\n01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:49.540\nSo while Carlos is holding him, I tie him up with my rope.\n\n01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.980\nAll right, you do that.\n\n01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:53.900\nHell yeah.\n\n01:28:53.900 --> 01:29:00.140\nAll right, Shrove, we are on the quest for Patchen's gem.\n\n01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:02.580\nI know you don't know it is Patchen's gem.\n\n01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.260\nYou probably just know it as a gem.\n\n01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.180\nWe've got to go over this one more time\n\n01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.860\nand make no mistake about it.\n\n01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.180\nThere's only one way you're living through this,\n\n01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:16.460\nand that's if we get anything valuable from you at all.\n\n01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:19.660\nSo you've got to make shit up.\n\n01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.220\nIf we've gone down the wrong road,\n\n01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:23.740\nyou've got to just make shit up,\n\n01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.660\nand you've got to convince all of us.\n\n01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:32.700\nAnd believe me, that's a lot of sense motive sensing.\n\n01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.980\nGary, I think your tea is on.\n\n01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.900\nOh, thank you very much.\n\n01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:38.620\nOoh.\n\n01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:42.500\nSo here we go, from the top.\n\n01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.860\nWhere'd you get that robe, that bloody robe?\n\n01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.820\nIt was in the theater.\n\n01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:53.500\nIt was in the prop box, where new costumes and stuff are put.\n\n01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.260\nIn your opinion, why would that make its way\n\n01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.820\ninto the prop box at a theater?\n\n01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:02.420\nHey, maybe someone didn't want it anymore.\n\n01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.020\nYou want lemon?\n\n01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:03.700\nYou want lemon?\n\n01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.580\nI'd love lemon.\n\n01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:05.140\nYou're loving?\n\n01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:05.940\nOK.\n\n01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:06.860\nOh, another?\n\n01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:08.740\nOK, here you go.\n\n01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:09.940\nI was raising my hand.\n\n01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.020\nYou passed it.\n\n01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.420\nIf you're having one, get five cups.\n\n01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:14.260\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:15.740\nOK, thanks.\n\n01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.100\nMaybe someone didn't want it.\n\n01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:20.260\nThey were like, I don't want this.\n\n01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.300\nAnd then they didn't know what to do with it.\n\n01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.380\nWho puts the new props in the prop box?\n\n01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.380\nWell, just people.\n\n01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.380\nIt's kind of like what people?\n\n01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:30.820\nThe inner people.\n\n01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:33.940\nYeah, but there's not like distinguished positions?\n\n01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:35.260\nNo, it's like a donation.\n\n01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.220\nTake a prop, leave a prop.\n\n01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:36.980\nYeah.\n\n01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.620\nSo let me just walk through this.\n\n01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.740\nLike a chip sword.\n\n01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.980\nA day in the life of a bloody robe.\n\n01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.940\nI have a bloody robe.\n\n01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.540\nI drop it off on the stoop of the theater.\n\n01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:52.300\nMargaret grabs it, drops it in a box full of a mixture\n\n01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:56.340\nof clean, half clean, and blood encrusted clothes\n\n01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.060\nthat people drop off on the stoop.\n\n01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:00.460\nAnd of that box, some of the actors\n\n01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:03.980\npull it out, use it as a scene in a theater performance.\n\n01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.500\nSome others pull it out and wash it\n\n01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.980\nso it can be used as a scene.\n\n01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:09.380\nAnd then there's guys like you, prominent figures\n\n01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:11.420\nof the theater, who decide to wear it\n\n01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.660\nand then sell it to a homeless guy.\n\n01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:16.260\nYeah, no, I gave it to a homeless guy who's\n\n01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.580\nnotoriously naked in this town.\n\n01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.540\nI wasn't wearing it.\n\n01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:23.940\nI'm going to make some bread if you guys hungry for bread.\n\n01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.460\nShrove, do you like bread?\n\n01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.380\nI know.\n\n01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:27.900\nNo bread?\n\n01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.060\nIt's OK.\n\n01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:31.060\nOK, well, I'm putting it on.\n\n01:31:31.060 -->

01:31:36.260\nAll right.\n\n01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.180\nThis guy's excited.\n\n01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:43.540\nI'm going to take a sidebar with my friends.\n\n01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:44.040\nOK.\n\n01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.580\nGuys, I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.340\nAnd I think I did it.\n\n01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.940\nDo you want me to talk to him?\n\n01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.660\nNo, Gary, thank you.\n\n01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.140\nNo, thank Gary.\n\n01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.420\nCan you give us a moment?\n\n01:32:01.420 -->

friend?\n\n01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:14.020\nNo, it's not that.\n\n01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.460\nI gave you bread.\n\n01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.460\nYou already made it.\n\n01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.780\nI gave him bread.\n\n01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:20.580\nI gave you bread.\n\n01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:21.340\nThis is my home.\n\n01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.940\nGary, he means more like work friends.\n\n01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:24.060\nLike this is a work friend.\n\n01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.380\nThis is like a work.\n\n01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.260\nThis is my home.\n\n01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.420\nThis is a work issue thing.\n\n01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.700\nWe have work conversations to talk about.\n\n01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:31.620\nThis is my home.\n\n01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:34.060\nOK, Gary, Gary, you're in, you're in, you're in.\n\n01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:35.300\nCome talk to us.\n\n01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:35.780\nOK, I love you.\n\n01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:37.100\nWe love you, Garry Shandling.\n\n01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.620\nThank you.\n\n01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.540\nBut away from Shrove, I need to have a sidebar.\n\n01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.980\nShould I pull the curtain?\n\n01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:43.820\nYes.\n\n01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:48.340\nHey, Gary, what do you know about these town's folk?\n\n01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:49.180\nWhat do I know?\n\n01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.620\nYeah.\n\n01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:58.740\nYou know, they're OK when they don't really like my kind,\n\n01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.660\nlike the bread that I make.\n\n01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.380\nCarlos, what was the importance of the bloody row,\n\n01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.460\nbecause that was the robe that maybe was being worn by one\n\n01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.740\nof the butchered.\n\n01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.940\nIt was Patchen's robe.\n\n01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.060\nYou didn't think I remember.\n\n01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.820\nI don't remember.\n\n01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.620\nIt was Patchen's robe, and they stripped it off.\n\n01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.300\nOh, when they fucked up Patchen's,\n\n01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.300\nand they took his robe, and then someone just took it back.\n\n01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:21.140\nSo yeah, that just might be a collection box for the theater.\n\n01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:23.540\nAll right, well, it's an inconvenient time for us\n\n01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:24.540\nto realize this.\n\n01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.540\nWhat's up?\n\n01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.740\nI got to get the bread.\n\n01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.060\nI thought you had a hot, like you had a hot lead.\n\n01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.860\nI didn't know what's going on.\n\n01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:36.660\nI thought I did too, and at the time, not to be defensive,\n\n01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.340\nbut it seemed like everyone agreed.\n\n01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:40.220\nI walked back out to where Shrove is,\n\n01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.820\nand then I sit down with my tea, and I say, Shrove,\n\n01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.260\nlook, we're sorry to put you through the ringer on this one.\n\n01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.580\nIf somebody was collecting any valuable gems,\n\n01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.900\nwhere might a gem be taken in this town?\n\n01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:54.460\nIs there like a place where that might be fenced or taken to?\n\n01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:57.860\nLike, sold in the black market or something like that?\n\n01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.580\nIf someone stole a gem, they would probably\n\n01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:02.580\nstole it for some reason.\n\n01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.900\nLike, they had some plan of what to do with it.\n\n01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:08.820\nHave you heard any word in the street about stolen gems?\n\n01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.140\nNo, I haven't.\n\n01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:13.020\nI'm afraid I don't listen for that sort of stuff.\n\n01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.500\nDo you know anybody that we might be able to talk to that\n\n01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.620\nmight know the scoop on that?\n\n01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.740\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.220\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:23.780\nShrove, who does the most donating of props?\n\n01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:26.300\nJust the day players.\n\n01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:27.140\nAll right, strip them naked.\n\n01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:30.100\nStrip them naked.\n\n01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.620\nWe're going to let you go, but I'm\n\n01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.260\nlooking at every fucking hole.\n\n01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:37.820\nI start taking off shroves like upper garments.\n\n01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.220\nThe bread is finished.\n\n01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.220\nThank you.\n\n01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:40.980\nBut right with you.\n\n01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.980\nI don't feel good about this.\n\n01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:43.420\nThank you, Gary.\n\n01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:44.420\nWe're stripping your friend naked.\n\n01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.380\nYou don't have to bunch up your clothes around your waist\n\n01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.820\nbecause you're hog-tied or whatever.\n\n01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:49.900\nYou know, like, I don't just.\n\n01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.580\nOh!\n\n01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.580\nIt's a search.\n\n01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:53.580\nIt's a search.\n\n01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:54.660\nIt's a search?\n\n01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.540\nYou're a shambling mound.\n\n01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:57.540\nAll of a sudden, you're a hog.\n\n01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.980\nWell, I know what a dick looks like.\n\n01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.740\nYou're going to hi-hat us all of a sudden?\n\n01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740\nHi-hat, the man.\n\n01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:04.020\nYou're going to get the hi-hat.\n\n01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.660\nWhat are you guys doing?\n\n01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.860\nYou didn't meet us at a polo match.\n\n01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.900\nWe were dragging a bloody naked man down the street.\n\n01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.580\nLet us finish our business.\n\n01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.620\nStop being a dick.\n\n01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.700\nStop high-roading us.\n\n01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.900\nOK, well, fine.\n\n01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.340\nAt least use a coaster.\n\n01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.220\nWhat is this?\n\n01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.220\nGod damn it.\n\n01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.020\nI start vigorously.\n\n01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:23.940\nWater rings.\n\n01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.340\nVigorously patting down shrove, looking for anything\n\n01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.700\non his body.\n\n01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:30.660\nLook at his fucking butt, looking at it.\n\n01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.580\nLet's start.\n\n01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:32.900\nI'm going to start with the clothes.\n\n01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.780\nLet's cross the bridge when we get to it.\n\n01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:40.140\nYou remove his clothes and his stuff.\n\n01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:43.140\nYou find he's under his clothes.\n\n01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.420\nHe's got a big tattoo on his back.\n\n01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:51.260\nIt looks like a crazy intricate, kind of like a Celtic tattoo,\n\n01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:55.740\nlike with symbols and kind of like glyphs and stuff.\n\n01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.460\nBut it kind of forms the crude shape of a dragon.\n\n01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.060\nHere we go, here we go.\n\n01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.060\nAnd also, in his clothes, he has a bag of holding\n\n01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:10.660\nfull of beef jerky and a sack of some money and a harp.\n\n01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:13.180\nI take that bag of holding.\n\n01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:13.700\nAll right.\n\n01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:15.580\nWait, are you a harpist?\n\n01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:18.060\nAre you a bard?\n\n01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.500\nNo, I'm even a doctor.\n\n01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.660\nI play music, but.\n\n01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.540\nYou play the kind of music that raises the dead?\n\n01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.660\nNo, you don't raise the dead with music.\n\n01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.100\nI guess people could raise it.\n\n01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:30.660\nI'm a druid, and I'm not trained in the bardic art so much,\n\n01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.380\nbut I appreciate a nice harp tune.\n\n01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:32.860\nCan you?\n\n01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:38.100\nFirst of all, what is the meaning of this dragon tattoo\n\n01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.260\non your back?\n\n01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.700\nOh, it's just a birthmark.\n\n01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:42.980\nIt's just a birthmark.\n\n01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:43.700\nYeah.\n\n01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.860\nYou just happen to have a birthmark of a dragon on your back.\n\n01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:48.620\nSome people do.\n\n01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.500\nI've seen that symbol before.\n\n01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.380\nTell us more, Garry Shandling.\n\n01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.500\nI saw it in a book.\n\n01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.620\nSaw it in a book.\n\n01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:58.260\nLet's see.\n\n01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.740\nHere.\n\n01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:06.220\nAh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, dictionary.\n\n01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.900\nHe finds a book labeled the 13 Dragon Marked Houses.\n\n01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.660\nHere we go.\n\n01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.820\nHere we go.\n\n01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:15.700\nA, B, C, D, right here.\n\n01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.420\nTake a look at that.\n\n01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:19.500\nWhoa.\n\n01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:22.940\nThe relevant lore is that the members of the Dragon Marked\n\n01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:26.180\nHouses sometimes manifest dragon marks or birthmarks\n\n01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:30.300\nin the shape of dragons that they bestow magical affinity,\n\n01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.900\nbut they're like a bloodline sort of thing.\n\n01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.740\nSo they indicate a bloodline in these Dragon Marked Houses,\n\n01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:37.940\nwhich run the guilds.\n\n01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.060\nSo is he druidic, too?\n\n01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.060\nMaybe you could read our document.\n\n01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.540\nThat's not what his birthmark says.\n\n01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.380\nYou don't know if he's druidic.\n\n01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.540\nSo you're dragon marked.\n\n01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.340\nNope.\n\n01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.460\nYou're lying.\n\n01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.180\nI mean, it's kind of.\n\n01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:56.140\nDo you speak the language of the guilds?\n\n01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:56.620\nYeah.\n\n01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.860\nWell, it's like a code, but yeah.\n\n01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.700\nShall we show them?\n\n01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:03.420\nYeah, let's show them the letter that we found on the bandidos.\n\n01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:04.060\nOh, right?\n\n01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:07.620\nLook, if you could read this for us, we'll give you.\n\n01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.620\nOh, my god.\n\n01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:10.900\nIt says that we got him tied up and he's naked.\n\n01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:12.020\nRead it for us.\n\n01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:13.020\nAll right.\n\n01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.980\nIt says, the young one on the road outside of Roan\n\n01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:17.940\nholds the purse.\n\n01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.500\nTop priority is the purse.\n\n01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.580\nThe next top priority is kill them all.\n\n01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.540\nDrop point north, 4 AM, Olaroon 9.\n\n01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:29.820\nOlaroon 9's a date.\n\n01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.300\nSomeone write that shit down post in real life.\n\n01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.780\nSomeone was wanting to write it down.\n\n01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:36.420\nYou have a photographic memory.\n\n01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:38.300\nSay it back for us, shambles.\n\n01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.260\nJust give me.\n\n01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:40.060\nNo.\n\n01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:40.900\nI don't want to.\n\n01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.820\nYou said the young one outside the road on Roan\n\n01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.140\nis the top priority?\n\n01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.740\nThe young one on the road outside Roan\n\n01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:49.540\nholds the purse.\n\n01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:53.140\nNow, just for your memories, Roan's the starting village.\n\n01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.300\nRight.\n\n01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.220\nThis is the assignment.\n\n01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.180\nThat's where they attacked us.\n\n01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.580\nThe young one is Patchens.\n\n01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:58.080\nRight.\n\n01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.900\nSo we have a document that told us\n\n01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.220\nthat the thing was going to happen that already happened?\n\n01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.220\nYeah.\n\n01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:05.820\nIt's what you find in a hit man when they attack you.\n\n01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.500\nYou find the note that says go attack them.\n\n01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.620\nAll right, keep going.\n\n01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.060\nTop priority is the purse.\n\n01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:12.100\nNext top priority is kill them all.\n\n01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:12.900\nGot it.\n\n01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.460\nDrop point north, like a location.\n\n01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:18.980\nDrop north.\n\n01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.540\nAnd you just take.\n\n01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:24.220\n4 AM, all the room night, which is like a date and time.\n\n01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:27.180\nAnd has that date and time come yet?\n\n01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.420\nIt's that day and not that time.\n\n01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:33.180\nHow far away is it from now?\n\n01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.740\nIt's soon.\n\n01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:37.420\nShrove, where's drop point north?\n\n01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.100\nI'm not telling you guys.\n\n01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.860\nWait, Shrove said that?\n\n01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.860\nYeah.\n\n01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:49.260\nWhat would it take for us to get you to tell us?\n\n01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.300\nWe've got some nice bread.\n\n01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:52.620\nI'm not telling you guys.\n\n01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.180\nWe'll invest in your theater.\n\n01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.100\nYou'll invest?\n\n01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.220\nOh.\n\n01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:56.720\nShrove.\n\n01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:57.500\nYou guys don't have money.\n\n01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.980\nBy any chance, does your order have anything\n\n01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.500\nto do with integrity, honor, that kind of thing?\n\n01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.340\nYeah, secrecy.\n\n01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:12.060\nYeah, so in other words, if you were to betray your order,\n\n01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.620\nyou'd be a bad guy, right?\n\n01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:14.900\nGenerally, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.020\nSo you'd rather get your throat slit\n\n01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:21.540\nprotecting your order, right?\n\n01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.020\nNo.\n\n01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:24.780\nAre you lying?\n\n01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:25.300\nNo.\n\n01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.460\nBut you wouldn't lie, right?\n\n01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:27.900\nBecause you have integrity, right?\n\n01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.300\nYou're not a common bunch of thugs.\n\n01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:34.100\nYou're genetically born.\n\n01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:41.740\nLike, you're dragonborn, not to, I'm sorry.\n\n01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:44.340\nThat's not, that's copyright.\n\n01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.540\nYour dragon, something.\n\n01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.060\nMarked.\n\n01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.420\nMarked.\n\n01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.540\nLet me ask you this.\n\n01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:57.180\nIf it came to a choice between lying about flipping\n\n01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:02.100\nloyalties because some of your brethren had gone very bad\n\n01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.300\nand protecting your bad brethren and paying for them\n\n01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.580\nwith your life, what would be the more honorable dragon\n\n01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.140\nmarked thing to do?\n\n01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.860\nNeither.\n\n01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.820\nWell, what do you want?\n\n01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:16.660\nI just want to hang out, just live my life.\n\n01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:19.580\nYou want to hang out and not tell us who these guys are,\n\n01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:20.020\nlike where they are?\n\n01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.500\nI don't know who these guys are, man.\n\n01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.100\nThese guys are terrible killers who\n\n01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.540\nattacked an innocent young man whose only job was\n\n01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.980\nto protect this gem.\n\n01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:31.300\nYou're not on the right side of history here.\n\n01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.340\nI'm sorry, but that's why you've.\n\n01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.300\nI have two gold pieces.\n\n01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.460\nWhoa.\n\n01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.260\nThat changes everything.\n\n01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:41.900\nNo.\n\n01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:44.340\nThere's two gold pieces sweet in the pot, Shrove?\n\n01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:47.900\nNah, I had three gold pieces before you robbed me.\n\n01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:48.860\nNow you'll have five.\n\n01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:52.060\nYou've done nothing but pretend to be someone else.\n\n01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.700\nAren't you tired of living a lie?\n\n01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.580\nI belong to the Church of the Silver Flame.\n\n01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:58.420\nI'm just trying to redeem this countryside.\n\n01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:01.620\nI'm trying to do something right for the purifying flame\n\n01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:03.100\nbefore I die.\n\n01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.420\nWe ran across this lad.\n\n01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.580\nHe had a gem.\n\n01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:08.020\nHe was supposed to protect it.\n\n01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.460\nWe were assassinated.\n\n01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:12.620\nWe were waylaid by horrible, backstabbing, dishonest\n\n01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.420\nbandits.\n\n01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:17.980\nLike, do you ally with them or the rest of the world?\n\n01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:18.620\nYeah, kind of.\n\n01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.540\nThat's our whole town.\n\n01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:22.660\nWe're a bunch of ruffians and thieves and brigands and stuff.\n\n01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.300\nIt's not great, but that's what we got, man.\n\n01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:26.860\nI use Intimidate.\n\n01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.620\nWhere is it?\n\n01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.500\nWhat's your Intimidate score?\n\n01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:31.980\nIt doesn't list one.\n\n01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.540\nReally?\n\n01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:35.220\nYeah, it has a check, but no thing.\n\n01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:38.060\nAll right, what's your charisma, then?\n\n01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.420\nOh, no.\n\n01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:44.420\n7 minus 2.\n\n01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.940\nOh, boy.\n\n01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:48.940\nYou don't, you're not convincing.\n\n01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:52.180\nWell, I mean, I turn to the side.\n\n01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.820\nIs it well lit?\n\n01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.340\nIs it dark?\n\n01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.180\nWhere are we at?\n\n01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:55.980\nIt's dark.\n\n01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.300\nIt's dark and muddy.\n\n01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.100\nIt's dark and muddy in a pig farm.\n\n01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:04.540\nI start to go, rrr, rrr, rrr.\n\n01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.780\nAnd it opened my mouth, but he can't see.\n\n01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:09.380\nI put my hand up to cast Firebolt.\n\n01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.340\nI make it look like it's coming out of my mouth like a dragon.\n\n01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:14.500\nI go, dragon fire!\n\n01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.300\nAnd I cast Firebolt to make it look\n\n01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.300\nlike it's coming out of my mouth,\n\n01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:21.020\nto impress him with his dragon mark guild thingy.\n\n01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.780\nIt looks like it's coming out of your mouth.\n\n01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:23.700\nYeah.\n\n01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:28.900\nAnd I go, hey, I'll dragon your shit through the mud.\n\n01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:30.500\nMagic exists.\n\n01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:31.460\nMagic exists.\n\n01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.180\nYeah.\n\n01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:36.860\nI thought you'd like that because I'm dragonic as well.\n\n01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:39.820\nDraconic, whatever you're fucking, whatever you like.\n\n01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:40.980\nI don't like that.\n\n01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:43.980\nI take Garry Shandling aside.\n\n01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.540\nOK.\n\n01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.100\nShrove, you've done enough.\n\n01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.260\nWe just had to make sure we knew everything you knew.\n\n01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:51.300\nWe're just going to relax and have some tea.\n\n01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:51.820\nOK.\n\n01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:52.700\nGarry Shandling.\n\n01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:53.820\nYeah.\n\n01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:54.900\nYou want me to talk to him?\n\n01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:58.140\nDo you want to give our friend Shrove some tea?\n\n01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:58.640\nYeah.\n\n01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.820\nDo you have anything that'll help him?\n\n01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.260\nTo smooth the plow?\n\n01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:07.620\nWell, do you have anything that'll\n\n01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.420\nhelp him tell the truth?\n\n01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:14.020\nAnd or do you have anything that'll just kill him?\n\n01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:18.420\nI've got some vinegar and some solvents.\n\n01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.060\nAll right.\n\n01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:21.060\nAnd we can light some candles.\n\n01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:21.420\nOK.\n\n01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:25.260\nI thought maybe Shambling mounds were more blood dead.\n\n01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.100\nYou thought what?\n\n01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:26.940\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:27.660\nIt's fine.\n\n01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.340\nDo you think I have a gun?\n\n01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.620\nDiarrhea, hey, come here for a second.\n\n01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:32.700\nYeah.\n\n01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:34.900\nDo you have poison?\n\n01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:37.340\nLet me see.\n\n01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.820\nI might have some laxatives.\n\n01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:43.500\nWe could mix it with my vinegar.\n\n01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:43.780\nAll right.\n\n01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:45.140\nLet's just kill this fucking guy.\n\n01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:47.420\nWhy you got none of my living room?\n\n01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:48.100\nLet's just kill him.\n\n01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:48.580\nAnd I'll kill him.\n\n01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.100\nWhy are we killing him?\n\n01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:49.860\nWhy are we killing him?\n\n01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.140\nJust because he was ineffectual or?\n\n01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.460\nHe can live with me.\n\n01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:56.180\nWell, if he's left alive, he's going to go.\n\n01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.340\nHe's countered to our mission.\n\n01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:59.580\nHe's going to go warn the rest of his brethren.\n\n01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.580\nThere's only one reason he has to not tell us\n\n01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.060\nthe drop point in this note.\n\n01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:04.900\nAnd that's because he doesn't side with us.\n\n01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.980\nHe sides with these people that we lay.\n\n01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.180\nLet me suggest something.\n\n01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.780\nWe can't leave him alive.\n\n01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.540\nWhy don't you just leave him here tied up\n\n01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.060\nuntil after the drop point, time and date?\n\n01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:16.740\nI don't want to offend you, Garry Shandling,\n\n01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:20.060\nbut I question your ability to maintain a hostage situation.\n\n01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.780\nI don't know if that's what you're cut out for.\n\n01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:24.660\nYou're Shambling and you're a mound.\n\n01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:27.260\nRacist.\n\n01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.100\nI have a rust monster.\n\n01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.060\nI mean, we've got a lot of work to do in a short amount of time.\n\n01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.740\nAnd I think we should just step on his head until he's dead.\n\n01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.500\nHe's been a terrible pain in the ass.\n\n01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.740\nHe's withheld information.\n\n01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:39.500\nYou're a terrible pain in the ass.\n\n01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:39.740\nNo.\n\n01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.540\nI was just taking a shit.\n\n01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:48.300\nListen, you had your chance to assess things and judge people.\n\n01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:49.460\nYou've been bettered.\n\n01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.300\nAnd now you're about to die.\n\n01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.300\nThat's how it is.\n\n01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.060\nYou have to listen to us talk about it.\n\n01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.860\nYou know, you guys are nice.\n\n01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.420\nI think you're cool.\n\n01:45:57.420 --> 01:45:59.780\nYou drank my tea and you had some bread.\n\n01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:01.020\nMade a little bit of a mess.\n\n01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.140\nI guess I'll clean it up.\n\n01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:06.180\nBut you can't kill him in my living room.\n\n01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:07.740\nYou can't kill him in my living room.\n\n01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:08.780\nI don't want to haunt it.\n\n01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:09.980\nWhere's your kitchen?\n\n01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:15.340\nI summon nature's ally, summon Squid.\n\n01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:17.100\nThank you.\n\n01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:17.600\nThank you.\n\n01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.100\nDo I have any more spells after this one?\n\n01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.660\nI think you've summoned the nature's ally already.\n\n01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:23.860\nYou put the bear.\n\n01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.220\nI don't think you have two, do you?\n\n01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.260\nShit, I had such a good idea.\n\n01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.140\nMaybe you do.\n\n01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:29.980\nI was going to take a giant squid, shrink it down,\n\n01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:32.020\nbecause I can shrink down animals.\n\n01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.340\nAnd I was going to put it in his mouth or his butt.\n\n01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:37.220\nAnd that was going to be like the worst, like Wrath of Khan.\n\n01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.460\nThey put the bug on the guys here.\n\n01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.140\nLet me make a suggestion.\n\n01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:46.540\nWould you consider a shambling mound an animal?\n\n01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:50.900\nA shambling mound is like an elemental or something.\n\n01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:51.740\nExactly.\n\n01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:52.820\nShrink me down.\n\n01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.020\nNo, no, it doesn't count as an animal in that sense.\n\n01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.980\nYou said an elemental.\n\n01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:58.980\nAll right.\n\n01:46:58.980 --> 01:46:59.940\nLet me try this.\n\n01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.900\nLet me just try this.\n\n01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.140\nCan I try something?\n\n01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.820\nI thought the squid up the butt thing was pretty fucking gold.\n\n01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.580\nI don't want a dick.\n\n01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:08.740\nI take my morning star, and I just start hitting it in the head.\n\n01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.540\nNo, you can't kill him in my living room.\n\n01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.180\nTake him outside with the pigs.\n\n01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.580\nYeah, I don't want like a haunted theater\n\n01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:18.100\nperson in my living room.\n\n01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:21.300\nI have to, I have people over.\n\n01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.500\nThis is where I work.\n\n01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.740\nI work out of my home.\n\n01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.220\nMy roommate's about to come home.\n\n01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:29.100\nWho's your roommate?\n\n01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.900\nMy rust monster.\n\n01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:32.940\nYou have a rust monster?\n\n01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.900\nI have a rust monster.\n\n01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.260\nIt's part of my character that I'm\n\n01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.220\nunable to control myself at this point,\n\n01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:42.540\nbecause I've got a lot of toxic shame in me.\n\n01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.700\nI feel undermined by my own church.\n\n01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:48.100\nWhy don't you take some of your toxic energy\n\n01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:51.300\nand clean up after yourself?\n\n01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.740\nPlus one.\n\n01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:55.300\nAll right, you hit him for three damage.\n\n01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:57.900\nHe leaps up and tries to dodge you out of the way.\n\n01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.180\nAnd as he does so, you realize that the ropes were tied\n\n01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:02.020\nreally loosely.\n\n01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:05.380\nAnd he was kind of, he wasn't entirely bound.\n\n01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:08.180\nSo he kind of gets out of, he wriggles free of the rope,\n\n01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:11.340\nbut in doing so is wanged in the head by you for three damage.\n\n01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.740\nAha, you passed the test.\n\n01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:16.020\nYou passed the test.\n\n01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:21.700\nI open the window, and I try to go get out like a bird trapped\n\n01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:22.580\nin the house.\n\n01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:23.780\nGet out.\n\n01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:24.940\nGet out of here.\n\n01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:26.180\nTo him?\n\n01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:26.680\nYeah.\n\n01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.180\nCarlos, what was the test that he passed?\n\n01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:28.700\nGetting hit?\n\n01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:29.460\nThat was nothing.\n\n01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.420\nI'm just trying to get him, get him.\n\n01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:32.700\nGet out, quick.\n\n01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.460\nI start whacking him in with my quarter staff.\n\n01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.100\nAll right.\n\n01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:41.940\nLike non-lethally, but just trying to bruise him up some.\n\n01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:44.340\nAll right, you hit him, but not substantially.\n\n01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:47.340\nIt doesn't take any damage.\n\n01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.780\nGet out.\n\n01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:49.300\nGet out.\n\n01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.780\nYou still don't want to tell us where the drop point north\n\n01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:52.500\nis?\n\n01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.660\nYou guys are the worst.\n\n01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.820\nWe know that.\n\n01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:56.860\nWe know that.\n\n01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860\nWe know that.\n\n01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:59.580\nWe're hanging around at a pig farm\n\n01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.500\nwith a shambling mound with a guy that probably\n\n01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:02.780\nhas nothing to do with it.\n\n01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:03.900\nYeah, we are the worst.\n\n01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:06.420\nWatch us try to keep you alive.\n\n01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.860\nGo run out the window.\n\n01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:10.940\nI feel really bad about what transpired in here.\n\n01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.580\nJust to talk about it later.\n\n01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:15.260\nI have a really great play about horses.\n\n01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:16.620\nWill that intrigue you?\n\n01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.100\nWill you please attack him?\n\n01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:23.460\nI feel bad. I start whipping gold pieces at him.\n\n01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:24.740\nWhat?\n\n01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.940\nHow many?\n\n01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:26.740\nThree.\n\n01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:29.100\nBut really hard, like at his head.\n\n01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.300\nBecause I feel bad, but I also don't want to disrespect\n\n01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:34.140\nmy elder.\n\n01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.460\nAll right, you miss.\n\n01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.300\nIt breaks the window.\n\n01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:41.180\nOh, what the fuck?\n\n01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:42.300\nThat's all of you guys, right?\n\n01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:45.620\nAll right, he climbs up the window.\n\n01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:46.140\nAll right.\n\n01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:46.820\nThank you.\n\n01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:47.500\nThank you.\n\n01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:48.220\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.380\nBroke the window, water rings, breadcrumbs.\n\n01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.580\nWe have to go find drop point Norris, right?\n\n01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.940\nIsn't that the thing?\n\n01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:58.340\nAlternate pitch.\n\n01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:00.700\nWe abandon the quest for Patchens gem.\n\n01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:01.180\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.500\nI mean, you guys do remember that crazy lady that burnt down\n\n01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:05.540\nthe church originally?\n\n01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:07.740\nIt was that whole other thing.\n\n01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:08.940\nWhat happened to that lady?\n\n01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:09.420\nWe were bad.\n\n01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.540\nThere's the gargoyle in the side.\n\n01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.260\nPatchens has been telling us from the beginning,\n\n01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.100\ndon't help me.\n\n01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:16.060\nI don't want it.\n\n01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:20.900\nWait a minute, I have an idea.\n\n01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:21.580\nWhat was that?\n\n01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:26.900\nOne thing, I had no use for it, but maybe you guys could.\n\n01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.420\nI found this map.\n\n01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:30.740\nI take the map.\n\n01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:33.220\nIt's an old map.\n\n01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:35.860\nIt has like ripped edges.\n\n01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.020\nNo, not ripped edges.\n\n01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:39.100\nLike burnt edges, like it's from the past.\n\n01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:39.740\nCan I read it?\n\n01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:41.380\nYes, it's written in English.\n\n01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:43.780\nI can only speak shambling.\n\n01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:44.860\nWhat language is it?\n\n01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:46.420\nIt's in guild speak again.\n\n01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:50.140\nYeah, I don't know what your Romulan language is.\n\n01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.540\nGarry Shandling, can you read guild speak?\n\n01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.900\nNo.\n\n01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.700\nI only can read shambling.\n\n01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.820\nThat's why I'm giving it to you.\n\n01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:01.740\nIt's pretty clear to me that we have fucked up in this town.\n\n01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.380\nWe have never done anything right in any town.\n\n01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:08.060\nBut shouldn't we what?\n\n01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.980\nShouldn't we just stake out the props box\n\n01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.140\nand see who's dropping stuff?\n\n01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:14.460\nAre you out of your goddamn mind, child?\n\n01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:17.420\nI tell you, we have fucked up in this town.\n\n01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.820\nEveryone knows what we look like.\n\n01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:20.620\nWe've attacked a popular man.\n\n01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:22.620\nSo dragged him to a shambling man's hut.\n\n01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:23.420\nThen what did we do?\n\n01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.380\nWe failed to interrogate him.\n\n01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:26.620\nJust walk me back through it.\n\n01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:29.940\nWhere do we go back to to start getting back on track?\n\n01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:32.180\nI think we just wander the fuck out of here.\n\n01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:33.100\nWe fucked up.\n\n01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.020\nWe can't do anything in this town.\n\n01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:35.540\nIs anything here?\n\n01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:37.540\nWhatever happened to the music and the undead?\n\n01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.540\nWalking around.\n\n01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.140\nPatches is long gone.\n\n01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:41.100\nPatches is sick of us.\n\n01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:42.900\nSo we're going to go back to Roan with our tailbone\n\n01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:44.940\nand our legs, no gem, no nothing.\n\n01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:46.700\nAnd we don't even know what we.\n\n01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:47.980\nAlternate pitch.\n\n01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:49.340\nAlternate pitch.\n\n01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:51.300\nWhen the silver flame speaks to you,\n\n01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.820\nit speaks through burning.\n\n01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:57.180\nDestruction is one man's construction.\n\n01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:01.260\nThe silver flame burns from the center of the earth outward.\n\n01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:06.380\nIt creates infernos wherever you have constructed\n\n01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.300\nfalse realities.\n\n01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:11.380\nPerhaps we have spent this campaign learning\n\n01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.580\nthat we need to wander the realm.\n\n01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:16.940\nWhile he's talking, I close my eyes.\n\n01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:19.580\nBut I, using my little eye mark on my forehead\n\n01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:22.260\nthat I never use, I can still see him.\n\n01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:24.780\nThis is a new opportunity for us.\n\n01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.260\nWe can't go back to work.\n\n01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:27.420\nWe fucked up.\n\n01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.060\nWe can't even freelance.\n\n01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:30.380\nWe fucked up.\n\n01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.900\nWe could wander.\n\n01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:34.540\nAnd we could do good for the church.\n\n01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:36.620\nFreelance.\n\n01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:40.300\nAlmost as if we'd have to walk into maybe new dungeons\n\n01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:44.300\nthat we didn't fuck up and forget where we were going.\n\n01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.220\nGet on the road.\n\n01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:45.700\nGet on the road.\n\n01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.980\nWe never look back.\n\n01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:47.740\nWho's Patchen?\n\n01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:48.300\nPedal to the mud.\n\n01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.020\nWhere's his gem?\n\n01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:49.580\nFuck Patchen.\n\n01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:49.900\nWho cares?\n\n01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:52.380\nHey, look, you know, maybe down the road,\n\n01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:54.540\nmaybe we meet Patchen and find a gem.\n\n01:52:54.540 -->
