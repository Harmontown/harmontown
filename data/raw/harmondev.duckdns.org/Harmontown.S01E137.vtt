{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.000\nHello, hello, hello from Meltdown Convicts in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:10.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:20.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown,\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:36.000\nand Harmontown.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:39.000\nThank you.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:42.000\nI've been kind of haunted by when Dino was on the show\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:44.000\nand he kind of watched the show through his eyes\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:45.000\nand at one point he's like,\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nwhy are these people here?\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:49.000\nWhy do they come here?\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:51.000\nIt was a valid question.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:53.000\nSo now I'm kind of like,\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:55.000\nI'm back to my old nervous self,\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:57.000\nlike I want to put on a good show.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:59.000\nSo that's probably a good energy to be in, right?\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nThat's good. Always be prepared to give people what they want.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:04.000\nIt was just not to say that I don't have anything to talk about.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:10.000\nSo we adopted a, Aaron and I adopted a new dog.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:17.000\nOur therapist then told us we had adopted a grief dog,\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:22.000\nbecause we had adopted it moments after our friend OD.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:26.000\nAnd I didn't do the math until that moment.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nI was like, I guess we have a grief dog.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nI guess this wasn't a responsible decision.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:35.000\nBut we got this little tiny dog through some rescue service\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nfrom some guy that found it in a box on the street or whatever.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:42.000\nAnd it's like this little mix of terrier\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nand a bunch of other things that make it not breathe properly\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.000\nbut snore adorably.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:50.000\nIt's smaller than my cat,\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nbut it won't stop humping Harvey.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nAnd it loves Harvey,\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nand it's like Harvey loves it and they're very happy together.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nAnd then it's just like, there's nothing,\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nwhy are dogs humping things so funny to us?\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nAs primates, we're the most awkward humpers\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:09.000\nyou would think in the animal kingdom.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nOther animals are kind of designed to do that.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:16.000\nBut then when you look at a little dog humping a big dog's elbow\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:19.000\nand they're like the expression on their face\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:24.000\nwhen they're looking at anything other than...\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:30.000\nI think it's because we're kind of Heisenberg-ing that experiment.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nThey're looking at you generally.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:34.000\nYou're in the room and they kind of make weird eye contact with you\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nwhile they're humping you.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nAnd that's no fun for anybody.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:41.000\nSo anyways, he's a little guy and he's not...\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nWere you motivated?\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nDid you say we should go rescue a dog in your grief\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nor did that dog come to you somehow?\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nNo, I feel like I, a long time ago,\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nwas like Harvey should have a companion\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nbecause I think that he's a livable guy\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nand we get a lot out of him,\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nbut I also feel like every time he encounters another dog,\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.000\nhe's so happy.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:03.000\nIt's just the thought of when we left the house,\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nif there was another dog there that you could hang out with,\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nit was just very cartoonish thinking.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nAnd then there was also that karmic thinking of,\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nwe got Harvey from a breeder.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nHe's our little buttermilk, silver spoon,\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:16.000\nlittle biological child that we bred\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nwith our little white penis parts.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nAnd I always, I was always like,\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nwe gotta go get ourselves a fucking, you know,\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:31.000\na little scrapper to make up for it.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nIt's a grief and a guilt dog at the same time.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nYeah, it's a guilt dog on behalf of the animal lovers of the world,\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nlike the people that would otherwise say,\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nyou killed a dog when you brought Harvey home.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nSo is anybody currently at home with those dogs right now,\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nor is it just a giant dog fuckfest going on?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nWell, we're crate training Nigel,\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:52.000\nwhich is the name of our little Nigel.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nWe're crate training him.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nIs there an origin story for the name of Nigel?\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nNo, I just, we were trying to,\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nwe were gonna go with Willem because he looks like Willem Dafoe,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.000\nbut I don't know, I just, we were getting in the car\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nand then I just instinctively kind of called him Nigel\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nas I was like, come here Nigel and whatever.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nIt's become a morning show.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nOur show's a morning show now.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nSoon we'll have equipment, I'll bring up photos,\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nI'll show you my dog photos,\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nand then maybe I'll have a baby by then\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nand I'll bring up that.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nI'm not saying no one's pregnant.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:33.000\nI think it's famous New England clam chatter.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nMr. Nibbles is coming out,\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nbut I'm very excited about our guest.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nI was just, I was talking to him in the green room\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nand it just turned into the show.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nI skipped through the green room because I was a little bit late\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nand didn't have time, but just managed to see our guest\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nand I'm very excited.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nI always have a rule, like I try not to talk to the guest,\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nlike I just stare at them and fold my arms.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nI don't talk to them, like if they're coming in,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nbecause I'm a bad interviewer and a bad,\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nso I want whatever energy I have,\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nlike whatever I want to talk to them about,\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nI don't want to have to like,\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nbut I just started talking to them about all the stuff.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nSo no show tonight and it's bad.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nIf you see us talking about anything interesting,\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nit's the second time through.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nAll the answers are prepared.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:22.000\nMy enthusiasm for this guy is like many, many, many layers.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nBut I think we should just bring him out right away.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nI don't think I have anything to talk about.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nI'm miserable at work. I'm trying very hard to make season 6 good.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nWhy don't we talk about that for a little moment?\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nWhy don't you unburden yourself of that just to get things...\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nI'm just very behind schedule. It's all my fault.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nI just, from the very get-go,\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nthey finally gave me enough rope to hang myself.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nI don't have anybody to complain about.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nI have this giant corporation in Yahoo that just loves the show.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nThey're going to advertise the fuck out of it.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nEverything is beautiful and wonderful.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nEveryone's on my side and so, of course, I'm going to self-destruct.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:01.000\nIs it as simple as you don't have an enemy above you\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nthat you dislike and hate and fear?\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nI believe that's the case.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nI think that I need to feel like I'm supposed to clean my room\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nso that me not cleaning my room is entertainment.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nBut now this is just going to be a show about a dirty room.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nIt's not going to make any sense.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nWhy did you clean up your room?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nNo, it's not that bad.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nI'm just worried about it all the time.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nI don't have anything to gauge it by.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nAren't you always behind schedule and worried at the same time?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nI think it's unprecedented this time.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nJust the first episode, I was like,\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nI put us way behind schedule the first episode.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nIt wasn't like I knew how to do the first episode.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:41.000\nIt was like I didn't and then I just kept delaying that.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:46.000\nSo everything is just delayed all the time.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nIs it like Tootsie where people are getting pages?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nYeah, it's exactly like Tootsie.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nBefore you finish your question,\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nin any way that you could mean that, it's exactly like Tootsie.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nI've never seen Tootsie. I don't know.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nTootsie is based on a soap opera.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:08.000\nAnd we do shoot community right now is being shot like a soap opera.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nYes, there are these actors who have these characters that they understand\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nthat come in and they do not know what they're doing\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nand they're handed pages for the next scene\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nand they look at them and they learn them during rehearsal.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:23.000\nAnd I mean, they should all get Emmys relative to that.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nSo should the prop master who then goes,\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\noh, so a giant phone then?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nAsshole!\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nAnd I'm like, yeah, sorry, I just typed it.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nAnd I was like, I'll start with the big phones\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nand see how I can make them bigger.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd she goes in back and she comes out with a giant phone an hour later\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nand everyone's great and they all hate me\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nbecause if I gave them more time with material,\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nthey would be able to do their jobs as good as they are.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nThe prop masters are unbelievable in their ability too.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nYou at the last second to rewrite something and it just appear on set.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nIt's unreal how they do that.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nAnd the people that make the pants and the people that make the hats,\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\ntwo departments that you didn't know were different,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nconstantly feuding with each other.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nWithin the wardrobe department, there's the pants department, the hat department,\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:13.000\nand pages will come in and I'll purposely antagonize them by saying something like,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:17.000\nhe has a large, trouser-shaped hat.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:22.000\nBecause I just like to watch him.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nNo, that's not true.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:30.000\nBut everybody that works on that show should get a medal of honor\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nand I should be shot in the face\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:38.000\nand my blood should be scraped into a vial and sent to a lab\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:43.000\nso we can figure out a way to block my DNA from ever reoccurring in television\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nbecause all I do is hurt people.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nThank you.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nIt was the one time when I was fishing for something.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nAnd it only kind of trickled in.\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:01.000\nThey were like, here, if this is going to...\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nThey were like, we agree, go on.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nAnd they're like, well, if you're not going to go on, oh.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nAll right, got it.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nOkay, well, anyways, let's...\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nBut yeah, so I just like, you know, I'm trying to...\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:18.000\nSo you got directors coming in because I had dinner with Bobcat the night before he...\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nfor a table read and he knew that the next day there was no script.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nI was just starting to cut his episodes, great.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nYeah, but he was saying like, so like, I've never really done this before.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nThe table reads tomorrow, there's no script.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nI said, there might not be a table.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nLike, you might walk in and they're building a table for you.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd he goes, for me, that's kind of how I make my movies.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nLike, I don't like to know everything in advance.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nHe goes, this seems like perfect for me.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nI said, I think it will be then.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nIt's a great episode. He did a great episode.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nThey're all great episodes. It's a great show.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nIt's the best show on TV. It's not even on TV.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nI just have to go through this.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nIt's just, there's nobody telling me what to do.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nSo you look at it and you're like, well, that's how you're going to end it?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nWith Leonard just taking a shit?\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nOh, all right.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nSoilers.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nWhat would you rather have?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nYou haven't seen what he ate.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:10.000\nWhat would you rather have next time if you had to do another season or another show?\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nWould you rather have a Robertson Mech is breathing down your neck\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:17.000\nor a nice cable network not breathing down your neck?\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:21.000\nNo, I think, I continue to enjoy TV.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nI just think, I think that, I think what I definitely need is like,\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nbecause Chris McKenna is like my right hand man\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:31.000\nand like the guy who makes everything really funny, like has a lot of passion.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:36.000\nHe's not like, it's not like I'm Picasso and he's like a guy that makes Picasso possible.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nThat's not like he's a frame fetcher.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nI don't know who did what for Picasso.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nBut he's like, he's like unequal and a partner creatively.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nHe just cares about the show in different ways,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nbut he's like very funny, funnier than me and like always come up with these ideas.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nIt's just he and I like making the show together as partners\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:58.000\nand what there isn't is like a liaison between us and the suits and the production.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:03.000\nWhat we need is like kind of a third guy that's just like, hey, it's me, Eugene.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:08.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, Eugene, it's like, need help with that funny script?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\nI'm like, sure, Eugene, you're a hilarious writer.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:17.000\nBut first, could you check in with the line producer about those giant phones?\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nThat's what we need.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:23.000\nAnd also, oh, Sony's calling, hey, Eugene, you take that one.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nGive your comedy a break for a second.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nGo take the Sony call.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nWe need Eugene.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nSo what was that person's name on the last version?\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:35.000\nUh, nice try.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:41.000\nEveryone takes a little bit of the Eugene role here and there.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nSo it's all too much paradise there?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nEveryone's Picasso and there's nobody yelling at you and it's just too easy?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:52.000\nAnd coupled with the fact that any actual grown-up work that has to be done,\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nit's either me or Chris doing it, neither of us.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:58.000\nThat's not our wheelhouse, that's not where we're best used.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:03.000\nWe don't want to talk on the phone to anybody about marketing or keeping the trains running.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nBut we have to.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nWe're happy to do so, but then we are behind schedule.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nSo that's my lesson.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nI would like to do more TV, but I need to find a fall guy.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nI need to find a guy that's like...\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:19.000\nLike more of the type A person that likes the minutiae, likes the detail work?\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:24.000\nYeah, one of these guys that's kind of happy to not be funny or something, I don't know,\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nthat's sort of like, I just like being around the magic.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nYou guys are crazy.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nWhat were you smoking?\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:38.000\nWait, what are you smoking?\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:41.000\nIf you call Human Resources, I'll fucking kill you.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:45.000\nGo back in your office, Eugene, and talk to Sony.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:48.000\nWe just need somebody.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:53.000\nThat seems like a dream job for a lot of people that aren't that talented but would love to be around them.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nYeah, I think there's a lot of those guys out there.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nI think we have a few in the crowd, they just tapped.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nAnd I wouldn't mind being that guy pretty soon.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:06.000\nI'm kind of that guy on Rick and Morty a little bit, just Justin's so insane.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:11.000\nI just stay in the writer's room and work on scripts, but Justin's a maniac.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:17.000\nSo I'm just kind of like, hey, you heard the man making about turds.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nAnyways, actually, that's not true at all.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:24.000\nJustin does everything related to production, so that's not even a good analogy at all.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nI'm just kind of like the head writer on Rick and Morty.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nWho cares?\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nWe came to the show called Harmontown, we care.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nShut up.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nYou should care more about our guests tonight.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nLet's bring them up and start.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nOh, what is this?\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.000\nWere you in the hospital recently?\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:53.000\nOh, that's right, I'm dying.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nWhat is this from?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nOh, this is from Harris' memorial.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nHumblebrag.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nThat's worth noting in the diary of our lives.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nThey had a really wonderful memorial at the Upright Citizens Brigade New Space,\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:14.000\nwhich on paper I would just have thought, I don't want to go to this, but Aaron,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:19.000\nI knew Aaron would want to be there, and I was like, I'm going to go.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:25.000\nAlso, I should be there, but I wouldn't have gone, do you know what I mean?\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:31.000\nBut I'm glad I did, because it really hit you with the importance of a memorial service.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:37.000\nIt was just a flood of stories about a person that is gone now.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nIt was like, you're just laughing the whole time.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:45.000\nIt was just like, what an amazing guy, and it really helped a tone somehow.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nI don't know, just squeezed you out a little bit.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nThere's a lot of people walking around kind of shell-shocked,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:56.000\nand then you listen to these stories, and it just works.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nI don't get it.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:02.000\nI guess the Neanderthals invented it, the idea of a funeral, so why are we questioning?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nWhy did I think it wasn't a good idea to go?\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nBut it was nice, and I have a bracelet on from it.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nWere you afraid that because it was a comedy thing, that it might not be sincere?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:17.000\nI was afraid of social anxieties being around people, first of all.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nI don't understand death, and I'm afraid of it and coping with it.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nI don't know how to talk to people under normal circumstances.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nI don't know how to small talk.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nThere is no such thing as small talk at a memorial.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:31.000\nMy usual path through conversation to avoidance of small talk\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:34.000\nis to talk about whatever is really going on.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:38.000\nWhatever is really going on is not a fucking safe area at a memorial\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nbecause you don't know, if you're talking to a Parks and Rec guy,\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nyou can't be presumptuous about how grief-stricken someone must be.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nYou're trying to calculate how hard did this person get hit,\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nand what right do I have to say anything.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nI don't want to think about stuff like that.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nI have to think about stuff like that too much, just normally.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nThe therapist said, don't think about that stuff.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nJust speak in truths that cannot be, just bring some Kleenex.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:07.000\nBe the Kleenex guy and say, no matter how ridiculous it sounds,\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:11.000\nand no matter how repetitive it sounds, this is terrible.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nReally? This is terrible?\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nYou're supposed to say that at a function?\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nBut I tried doing it.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nIt worked on Adam Scott.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nThat's when I really leaned into it.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nI remember it was Adam Scott, and I said, this is terrible.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:29.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, it is. This is hair.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nI felt like he did appreciate it.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nAnd I was like, okay, this is awful. This is terrible.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:39.000\nAnd Adam Scott was like, okay, you can stop now.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nBut yeah, it was great. It was a great celebration.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nDid he have to speak?\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nNo, of course not. No, no.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:49.000\nI was just there to, like, Aaron was close to him.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nRob was very close to him.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nI knew Harris.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:57.000\nI didn't realize how close, my close friends were to him.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nI just met him a handful of times.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:01.000\nI didn't realize how tight he and Rob were,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nand other friends of mine.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nYeah.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:10.000\nIt was a pretty, I would, no exaggeration.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nLike, if you named a person that we knew,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:18.000\nI would, without knowing, I would bet that they knew him.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nHe was just kind of everywhere.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:23.000\nI forgot that he's saying at Rob's wedding with Sarah and Paul.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nYeah.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nYeah.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:30.000\nI thought your little, I guess if it was a eulogy that you did the last show,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nit was very...\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nWell, that was my anger phase.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:36.000\nThere are other people that are bargaining that was me being angry\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nat, like, anti-drug people.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nAnd now I'm getting towards acceptance,\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nwhich is, like, the scariest thing in the world\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nbecause you don't want somebody to be dead.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nSo, all right, let's, now that we've warmed up the stage for,\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nfor Booger.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:55.000\nMy affection for this guy is unparalleled.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nI've been so excited about having him on the show for so long.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:04.000\nEven if only it was because he had been such an indelible presence\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.000\nin so many formative movies when we were growing up,\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:10.000\nso many reasons that I'm out here in this city.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nBut also, just now, in the modern world,\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:16.000\nhe's also doing some work I admire because he's the executive producer\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:19.000\nand he's executive producing, like, one of the only kind of\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nsemi-honest reality shows that's on TV\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nthat we can talk about a little bit.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nSo, let's bring him out. Curtis Armstrong is here.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:48.000\nTake any of those, yeah, wherever you're comfortable.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nHello.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nThanks for playing me in.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nYeah, well, we had to kind of brighten the mood\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nafter that last 10 minutes.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nYeah, I know. I was really getting sad back there.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nYou were supposed to listen.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nNo, it's okay.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nWell, it's just, you know, oh, my.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nYou didn't happen to know Harris Wittels, did you?\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nI did not. I never worked with him. I never met him even.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nUh, yeah, it was, it was, it was, yeah, whatever.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:12.000\nMan, I, well, it's, it's like, uh,\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\njust stories from him in the writer's room being said\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:18.000\nat a memorial. That's like when it hits home because it's like,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nyou're in an audience of workaholics,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.000\nlike, so everyone spends 16 hours a day in a certain environment\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nand then you're hearing about this guy who kind of shot through that environment\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:30.000\nand like, it just raises all these questions about what the fuck are we doing,\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nwhich is, which was a common theme.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:36.000\nAnd I think Matt Besser, who went up early on who like,\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:40.000\nwho's a renowned curmudgeon and, you know, um, uh,\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nbut he really like, it was the perfect eulogy for anybody,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.000\nlet alone somebody that he, you could have, you could have taken it\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:52.000\nand put it in, in any, uh, wake and it would have been very inspiring,\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:56.000\nbut it was really apropos to, to this guy that, that passed.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:00.000\nBut it was all about that concept of what was this thing that made them special\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nthat we didn't notice when they were around and now that they're gone,\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:07.000\nwhat, what, you know, just how can this person live within us and can we,\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:10.000\nand it really, like it was really taken with all these stories about him\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:13.000\nbecause the constant theme was how little a shit he gave,\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nhow he gave zero fucks.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd like maybe that, maybe that, that, that hurt him in the end,\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:23.000\nbut it also like, clearly it was like, what the fuck was I doing?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:28.000\nThe entire time that he was around, why was I over here doing something different,\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:33.000\nlike, like, like, like playing this game of like, how am I driving with the audience?\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:37.000\nWhen this guy was like, suffering under the yoke of mainstream perceptions,\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:41.000\nand just spent every job that he went to and kept getting promoted,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:45.000\nhe's one of those superstars that, you know, would come to work and then show up late\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:49.000\nand like no one gave a fuck because if they fired him, their show would get unfunny.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:54.000\nAnd, and he just like spent his career, you know, bursting at the seams,\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nwhatever seams were around him.\n\n20:56.000 --> 21:00.000\nAnd what, what, what, I was that guy at one point, at some point,\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:05.000\nand then I started tweeting and then I turned into a fucking weird half-Mr. Rogers,\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:10.000\nhalf-asshole, like constantly, by the way, how are you? What's your name?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:15.000\nSorry, Curtis, that's all the time we have. Curtis, I'm strong.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nThank you.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nAnyways, I want to start with King of the Nerds instead of starting,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:29.000\nI think we'll get into like, like your, your blessings upon my, my, my adolescence,\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:34.000\nbut the, you're, you're, you're currently right now, TBS Friday nights at nine?\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nFriday nights at nine, yeah, we're for the first time.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:41.000\nIt's called King of the Nerds, whereas most reality shows are kind of like,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:46.000\nthey're called like, you know, who wants to fuck the, the, the Smiling Joe?\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:52.000\nAnd it's all about, it's all about, you know, it's a very, it's a, it's a, it's a templated reality show.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nI mean, it looks and feels like a reality show, except because it's,\n\n21:55.000 --> 22:00.000\nIt does, because we've got, I mean, the, you know, the people who actually know what they're doing,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:05.000\nyou know, Robert Carradine and I, who were in Revenge of the Nerds,\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:10.000\nwe came up with the Nerd Show idea, but we needed people who actually had a clue,\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:16.000\nbecause we didn't, we've never done reality shows, we've never known people who've been in reality shows.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:23.000\nSo when, once this thing was actually going somewhere, we needed people who could actually run it,\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:31.000\nand those are the people who are making those kinds of, of, you know, the, the actual template of,\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nof, you know, survivor type shows or whatever.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nBut those people.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:42.000\nBut we have, we have certain things that we want to make sure they stick with,\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:48.000\nwhich has to do, has to do with nerd culture and have it be a little different.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:53.000\nFor instance, the fact that every time somebody gets eliminated, like there's, I mean, it's, it's,\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nIt breaks everyone's heart.\n\n22:55.000 --> 23:02.000\nAnd, and you, and you always, like when, when the person gets eliminated is when they are raised to the height of their,\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:06.000\ntheir individuality, and you give a little kind of Springer's final thoughts about who they are.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nRight, right.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:13.000\nYou, you say, you know, Jackson, although you're, there is no cosplay and the great beyond,\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nyou, you have, you have dressed as a hero this way.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nYeah, whatever.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nYou do that really well.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:24.000\nYou give them a very personalized, and it's not, it's not just based on superficial stuff.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nIt's like, they always cut them because I write them too long.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:31.000\nI mean, I, because what we do is, I write those because I want,\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:35.000\nI can't give them a basic, well, thanks for playing.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nYou know, it just, it's not in me to do it.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:45.000\nThey mean, it's strange, but they actually, I, I'm an executive producer of this show,\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:51.000\nand a host of the show, but I am a fan of nerds, and I've always been a fan of nerds.\n\n23:51.000 --> 24:01.000\nAnd so, when I'm in a room like you've got there, and I'm watching them for, you know, 15 hours a day,\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:08.000\nand I become so enraptured with them, and it's, when they leave, it really bothers me.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:14.000\nAnd that separation you're supposed to have as a host of a reality show, I'm not capable.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nI cannot do that.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nI just get too emotionally involved.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:22.000\nAnd I don't think you have to because you're kind of a den leader to these Cub Scouts,\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:26.000\nwhich is somebody who does need to have a kind of cosmic detachment from them because you're...\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nOh, it's kept very separate when we're shooting.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:31.000\nBut what's going on inside of me is different.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nOh, I see.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:37.000\nAnd then what happens, yeah, when we're shooting, there's no funny business, there's no talking,\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nthere's no, you know, they are the hosts.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nYou don't talk to the hosts, just like any other show.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nBut I'm dying inside.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:48.000\nIs there any room in your show for that to be revealed?\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nI think people take it for granted.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:54.000\nI think they just assume that that's the case, that you don't actually have relationships with them.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:59.000\nNo, I'm saying, but is there room to include that your, like, pathos, pathetic pathos?\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nWell, you can do those little...\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:08.000\nI take that, I use the farewells, you know, which are usually made up on the spot\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:12.000\nbecause we don't know completely who's going to go home and who's not.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nSo they were made up at last minute.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:19.000\nAnd I use that as my way of expressing my love for them.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nAnd then they cut that down to a tiny...\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nAnd they cut that down to this much.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:29.000\nBut it's very, I mean, you know, obviously from the top down, there's a mandate to preserve the humanity\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nand not punish aberration.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:37.000\nLike, the things that make you different are the things that make you good,\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:44.000\nnot necessarily the things that make you bad, and the way that you win is not necessarily blending in with everyone else.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:48.000\nAnd there's a crucial difference to the show, because it's...\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nI mean, you know, because it's called King of the Nerds.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nSo it's like, they're actual nerds.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:56.000\nIt's not like it's, you know, depending on how you define that, some people might go,\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:59.000\nwhy is a guy that only reads comic books a nerd?\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nBecause I work for NASA.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:06.000\nBut it's like, everyone who you could authentically call a nerd, which I think is defined by kind of obsession.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nI think like...\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\nI think that's as good a description as anything.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:19.000\nAnd they come in and they do cry, and they do have mental breakdowns, and they do reveal pettiness and greed and ambition and embarrassing things.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nBecause they're human beings.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nIt's part of it.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:28.000\nIt feels like, you know, well, this would happen to you too, and it happened to them for a read.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:33.000\nNo one ever feels like they're walking out and you're going like, oh, fuck that psychopath.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:36.000\nLike, I'm glad they're, I hope they get hit by a bus as they leave the show.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:40.000\nThey're like all like decent people.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nYeah, so thank you for making that show.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nLet me just give you one quick thing.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:49.000\nJust to tell you, to give you an idea of how this all works for them.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:59.000\nWhen we did our premiere in January for this season, we wanted to have a party, you know, to do some press and all that.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:13.000\nAnd we sent the word out through Genevieve, who was one of your guests before, to the nerds who had been on the previous seasons saying, you know, in addition to the new nerds, if you want to come, come.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:16.000\nAnd, you know, join us for the party.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nWe're not paying for it.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nWe can't give you any money.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nWe can't fly you here.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:22.000\nBut if you're here, come to the party.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:33.000\nAll of season three, this group, all of them showed up, all but one of season two and half of season one.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:36.000\nAnd they all came here on their own dime.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nThey all paid for their own tickets.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nThey found housing.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:43.000\nThey did all of that stuff because they wanted to be there for that premiere party.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.000\nThat's great.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:49.000\nBecause when people are on contestants on reality shows, they feel pretty flushed down the toilet and thrown away.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nBecause like the editing can be so cruel.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nYeah, but we don't...\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nIt's true.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nBut we don't let go of them, you see.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:58.000\nYou said earlier that you've always loved nerd culture.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:03.000\nWhen you did Revenge of the Nerds, were you guys aware of nerd culture?\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:06.000\nNo, because I don't think there was a lot of nerd culture anyway.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:07.000\nI mean, not really.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.000\nThere were Star Trek conventions and so on.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:14.000\nAnd Comic-Cons, but they were like in basements in those days.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:18.000\nThey weren't, you know, corporate behemoths.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nYeah, they weren't in the light of day.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nExactly.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:24.000\nI mean, they were all people in their garages with cardboard boxes.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nWell, that movie, Revenge of the Nerds, we were talking about in the green room.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:33.000\nFor me, by my perception, it was the very slow beginning to what we have today,\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:36.000\nwhich is just nerd domination of the word nerd.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nAlmost means nothing.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:45.000\nBecause what is a nerd when nerds are captains of industry and running the government and we own everything.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nThat's really true.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nAnd we are the sought after demographic.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nAnd I start to worry, should I say we?\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nBecause I'm worried I'll get called out on not being an authentic nerd,\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nand yet everyone's a fucking nerd.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:03.000\nBut it goes back to that pivot point.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nI always associate it with that movie.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:09.000\nBecause it put a label on it and said absolutely from here on out,\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:14.000\nif you see somebody who's weird in a movie, all those people that we make fun of in the movies,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:18.000\nand they come through and they go, oh look, it's Purple Durper.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:23.000\nFrom now on, you have to understand that that person is the hero of their own story.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:27.000\nYou're not allowed to just give them a wedgie and call it a joke anymore.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nYou could do that in meatballs.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:33.000\nYou could do that in, leading up to that, the preppies could be the heroes.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:37.000\nIn my memory, every movie before that, that was the joke.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nEvery movie after that, you weren't allowed to do that.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:42.000\nThe jocks were the good guys until that movie.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nYou're right, yes.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:46.000\nBut you were saying in the green room, this fascinates me,\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:50.000\nthat that movie was incredibly unsuccessful, critically.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nOh, critically it was a disaster.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:55.000\nThey hated us. They just hated us.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:59.000\nAnd I think, at the time, we were sort of consoling ourselves by saying things like,\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:04.000\nwell, all critics are self-loathing nerds, and that's the reason.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nThey see too much of themselves in the movie.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:09.000\nBut the director you said, I'm going to watch Revenge of the Nerds again,\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:13.000\nsee if it holds up. I do know, well, I want to talk about Better Off Dead in a second.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nI have watched Better Off Dead since Bobcat was on here.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:20.000\nWe talked about Savage Steve Holland, and I ran home and watched Better Off Dead again.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nAnd fuck, it holds the hell up.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nAnd it's such an important film.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.000\nAnd also Savage Steve, then he just kind of trickled away.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:31.000\nAnd I want to have him as a guest on here and talk about that.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:36.000\nThe perceptions of people who are in the Midwest watching this stuff on HBO,\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:41.000\nselect TV, VHS tapes that they run into disintegration,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nwhich Revenge of the Nerds is one of them.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nOur perception is cultural efficacy.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:49.000\nIt's just that, oh, this must be an amazingly influential, successful film.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:55.000\nAnd it is for us, but in some strange emerald city from which it's coming,\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:58.000\npeople are being rewarded and punished on different scales.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:04.000\nAnd Jeff Canoe, who directed Revenge of the Nerds, went on to direct Gotcha, you said.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nI'm acting like I'm an expert.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nI pumped you for this information.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:13.000\nHe went on to direct Gotcha, which is the paintball exploitation movie.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nI remember everything about that movie.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nI saw it in the theater with my mom.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nI was like, it's the best.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:26.000\nAnd there were those little tracer disc guns that shot little plastic discs that flew pretty well.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nAnd I just played Gotcha all the time.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:33.000\nSo I was going around and playing like a fake assassin and being a spy with my Gotcha gun.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nYes, I am a spy.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:39.000\nSorry, that's from the commercial.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nAnd then he sort of...\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:46.000\nWell, this is a good question to ask of him as well.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:50.000\nBut he was somebody who, if it had not been for Jeff Canoe,\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nwe wouldn't have had the freedom to...\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:57.000\nThat movie wouldn't have had the freedom to develop the way it did and come out the way it did.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:06.000\nHe was incredibly brilliant at creating an environment in which writers and actors and even producers were involved.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:15.000\nHe was casting the producers in tiny roles in Revenge of the Nerds and sort of keeping them in the group.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nAnd he had this collaborative writing process.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nVery, very collaborative.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:22.000\nAnd he brought all of us out a week early before shooting,\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:26.000\nputting us all up in a hotel with the writers and the producers and so on.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nAnd we would just sit in the hotel all day.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:34.000\nWe'd be hanging out at the pool and then they would call you in and you would go in and you would talk about who Booger was.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:37.000\nAnd you had to write everything down.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:43.000\nI went back to my room and I did my old acting school job of writing down my biography of Booger.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:44.000\nI did this.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:45.000\nWhat is Booger's biography?\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:52.000\nThat was really funny because what wound up happening was like last year I was going through a trunk of stuff\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:58.000\nand I found this amazing notebook which I still have that I, because I was serious,\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:03.000\nyou know, this was an acting thing that you did when you were trained the way I was trained.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:12.000\nAnd I had this booklet and it's got the bios of all of the characters I played in those early movies up to about 87.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:20.000\nAnd so I'm looking at it, this ur text, and I go into it and I find Booger's biography.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:26.000\nAnd I'm reading what I wrote in 1984 as to who I thought Booger was.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nGod damn it, I would have told you to bring that.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:32.000\nI can tell you right now, it was me.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nIt was totally me.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:39.000\nI was going to ask you, how much of Booger was on the page on the script before?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nThere was very little.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nThere was almost none.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:44.000\nLike was there a breakdown for the character that said Booger comes in and he looks like?\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nNo, I didn't audition for Booger.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nI auditioned for Gilbert or Anthony's part.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nWhich is what I thought I was reading for.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:57.000\nI said, oh, that's great, I'm working with Bobby Carradine, that's fabulous.\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:06.000\nAnd then it turned out that I was actually auditioning for a part that was too small and too disgusting to audition people.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nYou know, you couldn't use Booger.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nWhat is it going to be?\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:15.000\nIt's like, I think the douchebag line, my mother's old douchebag, but that's back in Ohio.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:20.000\nThat was like the only line that had a beginning and an end, you know, for Booger.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:23.000\nIt was mainly nose picking and belching.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nBecause your character was only nerdy in the sense that you were just completely...\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nHe wasn't nerdy at all.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\nYou were a sociopath.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:29.000\nYou were just a...\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nExactly.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:37.000\nBooger's only reason for existence is to show how Saint like these other nerds are.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:41.000\nYou just believed in them so much, like, this guy is the best.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:45.000\nWhat they do is he gets thrown out, I mean, it's sort of a traditional thing.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:49.000\nHe gets thrown into the outer darkness with them.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:50.000\nRight.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nAnd they don't even think about it.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nThey just say, oh, you come with us.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nThat's okay.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nSo this is an important thing because you mentioned something.\n\n34:56.000 --> 35:00.000\nYou and I are a similar age, which is the same generation, like, and then there's a new generation.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:07.000\nIf you look at Revenge of the Nerds through current eyes, I mean, without rewatching it,\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:11.000\nI will tell you the fucking unacceptable red flags that are going to come up.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:17.000\nThere is absolutely non-consensual sex that converts a woman from being a bad guy to a good guy\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nbecause she lets the nerd like disguise himself.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:23.000\nAnd then she's like, oh, you're so good at kind of language.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nIt's just horrible.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nIt's just horrible.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nIs it Darth Vader too?\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nYeah.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:32.000\nBy our modern definitions, there's racism, there's homophobia.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:37.000\nThere's, I mean, there's a million crimes that we've come as we've progressed.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:40.000\nLike, now you look back 30 years and it's like, oh, yeah.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nIt's really true.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:47.000\nThe important kind of, like, socio-political, like, subversive element, though,\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:52.000\nand that's where Booger comes in is the idea that that was the first time in my consciousness\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:57.000\nthat we put a word on nerd, but the whole idea of the movie that was demonstrated,\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:00.000\nnot just in that final monologue, oh, we're all nerds,\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\neven the beautiful people are saying, I'm a nerd too.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.000\nBut more importantly, throughout the first and second act,\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:11.000\nthis creeping realization that the word nerd has no boundary except that you are the other,\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:15.000\nwhich means that if you smoke weed, you're a nerd, which means that if you're a grote,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:18.000\nwhich means that, and what is the common hub,\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:26.000\nit is being divested of your right to prejudice because there is a gay man within the nerds.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:27.000\nA gay black man.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:31.000\nHe is not immediately sussed out for his aberration.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nHe is ignored.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nHe is welcomed.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nIt's never questioned.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:41.000\nAnd when we go to you and Jefferson, because we want the lambda, lambda, lambda to support us,\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:47.000\nwe say that there will be no prejudice which we think will get us in with him, Bernie Casey.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:50.000\nThere won't be any prejudice according to race or creed,\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:56.000\nand Larry B, who plays Lamar, says, or sexual orientation,\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:59.000\nwhich is like a joke that would work now.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:06.000\nIf you were doing that kind of a parody on that sort of thing.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:12.000\nThey meant it as a parable for antisemitism.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nThat's what the writers meant.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nI just found out about Superman.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:20.000\nI remember hating that and then learning that two Jewish kids created it.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nIt was the same thing.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:26.000\nAnd they did that, the burning nerds on the lawn and all of that.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:31.000\nThey were going into these, which were at the time, for people our age,\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:41.000\nthey were these strong cultural flags of something that had been going on in the 60s and the 70s\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:48.000\nthat we were supposedly coming out of now, which of course we haven't, but that was the idea.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nRevenge of the nerds.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nAnd now...\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:56.000\nI was making a drink and I didn't notice.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nI could keep talking while you're doing that.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:02.000\nI want to hear, now it's time to talk about Better Off Dead.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nWhich is what you really want to talk about anyway.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nWell, kind of, but I don't want you to talk out of school.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nThat's a movie.\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:12.000\nI did a quote, I did a reference to that movie, not knowing you were going to be here,\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:15.000\nI think last week or the week before, and that's a movie that I think...\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:19.000\nI know I quote a couple of times a week, ever since I've seen it.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:24.000\nIt's also like, it's a thing that when something happens, everybody in the room of a certain age\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:28.000\nall says the same line, I've never seen snow without quoting you from that movie.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:31.000\nBecause that's a great fucking line.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nWhich one?\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nThe street value of mountain living?\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:43.000\nMy favorite moment in Better Off Dead is when the bad guy, like, you know, he skis to a stop\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:48.000\nand then there's John Cusack and there's his cute girlfriend who's going to get stolen by the bad guy.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:53.000\nAnd then there's Curtis' character standing next to him.\n\n38:53.000 --> 39:01.000\nAnd the bad guy, the preppy bad guy, looking at Cusack's girlfriend goes like,\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:04.000\noh, you're a cute little thing, what's your name?\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:10.000\nAnd with incredible sincerity, you step over and go, Charles Dumar?\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:18.000\nAnd it's not, you're not being the guy who's like, you're not the animal house subversion.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:22.000\nYour character in that movie is like an interesting tweak on the nerd character\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:26.000\nbecause he's absolutely, like, he doesn't ever seem to really take any sides\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:30.000\nand he's sort of like, he's very happy to be called a cute little thing\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:34.000\nand help that guy with his skiing if that's what he wanted in that moment.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nI'll hold your clipboard.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:41.000\nNo, it was such an odd movie because it, hello.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:51.000\nIt was a story that was pretty typical, that was being filtered through his sensibility\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nwhich no one was aware of at the time.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:57.000\nHe was very new, he was 24, I think, and he was making this, you know,\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:00.000\nwhat was basically, you know, this was a real movie.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:06.000\nHow many of you guys, how many of you see better up, Jed?\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:12.000\nMore accurately, by applause, honestly, who has not seen the movie?\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nWow, it's creeping in.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nI mean, this is, we're getting old.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:22.000\nThis is the thing, now it's like me talking to somebody, like, your age,\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:27.000\nabout movies that when I was your age, I thought would never go away\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nand they've already gone.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nI mean, Better Off Dead, it didn't occur to me until...\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nYou mean like Birth of a Nation?\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nYeah, those kinds of movies.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:38.000\nI was growing up, we were all growing up on John Hughes movies\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:42.000\nand it did, when I rewatched Better Off Dead, what I finally realized\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:45.000\nhaving become in my old age a kind of John Hughes expert\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:52.000\nwas that, the thing about Better Off Dead was its departure from the John Hughes, like, mainline\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:55.000\nand I didn't, there was no other way to express it when you were back then\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:58.000\nexcept that it's a weird movie, it's a crazy movie, it's weird,\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:02.000\nbut what's that? Is that a weird movie would be, you know, an easy writer?\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nI mean, it would just be about something weird.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:09.000\nThis is about sex and teenage life and going to prom and winning ski competitions.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:19.000\nThe tone of it, the reality is like, it's not grounded in the John Hughes, like, reality\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:23.000\nwhere you can live and die by what someone feels.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\nAnd there's comedy sketches that keep recurring throughout this.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nIt just breaks genre all the time.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nWell, the universe is absurd.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:34.000\nThere are so many things about the universe that make absolutely no sense\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:39.000\nthat I would imagine a normal producer would immediately say, with all the best intentions,\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:42.000\nyou can't do that. I know you think that's fun.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:47.000\nThe reason you think that's fun is because you're bored and you're a director\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:52.000\nor you're a writer and you want to have fun, but the audience doesn't want to have that much fun.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:57.000\nI say this all the time when I'm making my TV show.\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:01.000\nI'm constantly going like, let's not freak them out.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:06.000\nThey want to believe these people are real so that we can continue to have fun for a thousand years.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:15.000\nBut then if you really, the thing that I've learned in doing community is that as long as when people,\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:21.000\nif somebody is betrayed, if they feel betrayed and you believe they're betrayed,\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:25.000\nit doesn't matter if the moon is a dick.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:28.000\nThe universe can just be anything.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:32.000\nYou can be in outer space, you can just cut to anything.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:38.000\nWe're all pickles now, but as long as you have to pick that one channel to be consistent with,\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:42.000\nthe physics of emotional consistency.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:45.000\nWhy wouldn't that guy say that that guy was an asshole?\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:48.000\nHe just was an asshole to him.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nI don't care if they're pickles. I'm not going to ask why they're pickles.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:55.000\nWe didn't ask why Snoopy didn't run out of room in his doghouse.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nWe were held to the ground, but you did.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nI wondered that.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\nRemember those letters that you ever read about?\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:10.000\nWho was the actor that played Father Brady on the Brady Bunch?\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nI can't think of the name.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nWell, he'd be happy right now.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nWhat the hell's his name?\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nGreg Brady?\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nNo, that can't be true.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:23.000\nHe would get these big fights with Sherwood Schwartz.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nRobert...\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nIs that it?\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nIs it Robert Reed?\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nDid I get half of it right?\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nI almost said Robert Shaw.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:39.000\nHe would get these big arguments with letters back and forth with Sherwood Schwartz\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.000\nand say, there cannot be a pie fight.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:47.000\nYou cannot have a family in a house and all of a sudden go into slapstick\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nand Sherwood Schwartz says, we're making a TV show.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nWe're having a good time.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nThere's rules that have to be adhered to.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:57.000\nHe was determined to keep there to be logic within the world of the Brady Bunch.\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:01.000\nThe audience, I love the pie fights on the Brady Bunch.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:07.000\nI think it's also, in the case of the movies, it was an interesting time\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:11.000\nbecause I think that period around the 80s, the beginning of the 80s, mid-80s,\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:17.000\nwas the last time you could really do a movie like Better Off Dead\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:21.000\nand have it be produced by a major film company\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:26.000\nand released in theaters with these actors in it who, you know,\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:31.000\nI mean, John Cusack was not anybody who anyone really knew at the time\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nand it's certainly none of the rest of it.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nKim Darby was probably the biggest star among us, you know.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nWho's that?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:38.000\nKim Darby.\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:39.000\nYou don't know who Kim Darby is?\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nNo, who's Kim Darby?\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nI love that you don't know.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nKim Darby was in the original, she played Cusack's mother.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:46.000\nOh, okay.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nIn Lane's mother in Better Off Dead\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:54.000\nand she was the original girl in True Grit, the John Wayne True Grit.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nWas it right?\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nYeah.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nShe's French dressing and French fries?\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nFrench fries.\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nThat's her?\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nYeah, that's her.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:01.000\nI quoted that a couple days ago.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:02.000\nYeah.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nWe just saw her.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:04.000\nI mean, we just did a reading.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.000\nWell, she's the little girl in True Grit with John Wayne.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.000\nIn True Grit.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nI did not know that.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nWell, see, there you are.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nYou learned something tonight.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:10.000\nReally cool.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nYeah.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\nI don't know what I would have done.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:15.000\nI don't know who I'd be if I didn't have that movie in my life.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:20.000\nJohn Cusack's character in that movie lived in a house that was roughly the size of mine.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:23.000\nIt looked like a real house, too.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:29.000\nHe didn't have the problems I had, but he lived in a world that I did in that I felt completely\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nalienated.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:37.000\nIt was better expressed by that director than God bless him for all of his incredibly important\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nwork, John Hughes.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:44.500\nBut I mean, it was more poignantly expressed through an absurdist lens by this more punk\n\n45:44.500 --> 45:48.000\nrock director saying, let's go more extreme with this.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:51.720\nLet's just say I want to kill myself.\n\n45:51.720 --> 45:55.000\nLet's have me try to kill myself.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:58.500\nLet's express how I feel through animation.\n\n45:58.500 --> 46:03.680\nLet's express how I feel through characters that could not exist in real life, like coming\n\n46:03.680 --> 46:08.680\nat me, that the net result will be that I feel beleaguered, that I feel like I'm okay.\n\n46:08.680 --> 46:09.680\nIt is just so awkward.\n\n46:09.680 --> 46:14.680\nIt is awesome to go into voiceover narration when the two Asian guys come up.\n\n46:14.680 --> 46:15.680\nRight.\n\n46:15.680 --> 46:16.680\nAre you asking, who did that?\n\n46:16.680 --> 46:22.680\nNo, I'm saying, just to do that is hilarious.\n\n46:22.680 --> 46:25.360\nYou know it's coming back for the third time.\n\n46:25.360 --> 46:28.200\nThe second time it happens, it's going to happen a third time, and it's going to be\n\n46:28.200 --> 46:30.320\nat a great point in the movie.\n\n46:30.320 --> 46:34.800\nI want my two dollars, that has to pay off, and all these little things have to keep recurring.\n\n46:34.800 --> 46:35.800\nIt's wonderful.\n\n46:35.800 --> 46:36.800\nYeah.\n\n46:36.800 --> 46:37.800\nBetter off dead.\n\n46:37.800 --> 46:38.800\nNow, okay.\n\n46:38.800 --> 46:43.960\nNow, not to be a jerk, because I get to work with very frequently, and I love them to pieces,\n\n46:43.960 --> 46:47.040\nand we've talked about it quite a bit, and he has wonderful stories, as Joel Murray.\n\n46:47.040 --> 46:48.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n46:48.040 --> 46:52.720\nAnd he said, the shooting of One Crazy Summer, that you guys were in Nantucket or Martha's\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:54.000\nVineyard, or where were you guys?\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:55.000\nWe were in Vogue.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:59.720\nAnd he's got awesome, like, ribbled, sexy stories about what you guys got to do.\n\n46:59.720 --> 47:02.120\nNo, I was not in that.\n\n47:02.120 --> 47:03.120\nI'm not in that.\n\n47:03.120 --> 47:04.600\nI'm noticeably not in any of those stories.\n\n47:04.600 --> 47:05.600\nAren't you in that one?\n\n47:05.600 --> 47:06.600\nNo, no, I'm in the movie.\n\n47:06.600 --> 47:07.600\nYeah.\n\n47:07.600 --> 47:10.440\nBut I wasn't in any of the sexy ribblings.\n\n47:10.440 --> 47:12.320\nI missed all of those.\n\n47:12.320 --> 47:13.320\nI was, you know...\n\n47:13.320 --> 47:14.760\nNo kidding, I was too bad, because he has some really...\n\n47:14.760 --> 47:15.760\nI know.\n\n47:15.760 --> 47:16.760\nI know.\n\n47:16.760 --> 47:17.760\nHe has some juzzies.\n\n47:17.760 --> 47:18.760\nYeah.\n\n47:18.760 --> 47:21.440\nJoel did great, you know.\n\n47:21.440 --> 47:23.760\nBill's younger brother, you know?\n\n47:23.760 --> 47:25.480\nHe's the youngest of the Murray brothers.\n\n47:25.480 --> 47:27.440\nHe's number nine out of nine.\n\n47:27.440 --> 47:28.440\nYeah.\n\n47:28.440 --> 47:31.920\nNow, because it happened on Twitter, so you could tell the story, right, that you were\n\n47:31.920 --> 47:34.000\njust telling me about the Kuzak...\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.360\nOh, just an interesting story, yeah.\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:37.360\nThat, you know, this...\n\n47:37.360 --> 47:42.160\nI mean, of course, many of you here have not actually seen Better Off Dead, but...\n\n47:42.160 --> 47:43.600\nThe legend is the Kuzak...\n\n47:43.600 --> 47:44.600\nHe did the movie.\n\n47:44.600 --> 47:45.680\n...not a fan of the movie.\n\n47:45.680 --> 47:46.680\nAnd I will...\n\n47:46.680 --> 47:47.680\nI will...\n\n47:47.680 --> 47:49.480\nLet me lend this, because you're not talking at school.\n\n47:49.480 --> 47:50.480\nI am.\n\n47:50.480 --> 47:53.200\nRob Schrab was up to direct Hot Tub Time Machine long ago.\n\n47:53.200 --> 47:55.640\nHe had a meeting with Kuzak where he...\n\n47:55.640 --> 47:58.760\nRob's going to be very angry at me about something.\n\n47:58.760 --> 48:01.480\nLike, he came back from that meeting.\n\n48:01.480 --> 48:07.080\nI won't go into specifics, but he had a conversation where he came away from saying, oh my God,\n\n48:07.080 --> 48:09.160\nJohn Kuzak doesn't like Better Off Dead.\n\n48:09.160 --> 48:10.160\nOkay.\n\n48:10.160 --> 48:12.480\nSo, it's out there...\n\n48:12.480 --> 48:15.000\nIt's out there that he was not happy with the movie.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:18.200\nAnd then we had to make a second movie.\n\n48:18.200 --> 48:21.240\nThe following year, we made a second movie with almost the same cast.\n\n48:21.240 --> 48:23.200\nBecause it was like a two-picture deal, or...\n\n48:23.200 --> 48:24.200\nYeah.\n\n48:24.200 --> 48:26.240\nSo, it was supposedly the first two of three movies.\n\n48:26.240 --> 48:29.800\nAnd the legend that I've heard is that Kuzak had not seen Better Off Dead...\n\n48:29.800 --> 48:30.800\nNo, that's not true.\n\n48:30.800 --> 48:31.800\nThat's not true.\n\n48:31.800 --> 48:32.800\nHe had seen it.\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:33.800\nOkay.\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:34.800\nThat there was a...\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:39.520\nBefore they started shooting one crazy summer, there was a screening of Better Off Dead.\n\n48:39.520 --> 48:43.880\nThat might have happened because I wasn't in Nantucket when they started filming, so\n\n48:43.880 --> 48:46.040\nthey may have screened it there.\n\n48:46.040 --> 48:47.040\nAnd that made...\n\n48:47.040 --> 48:48.920\nSo that there was like this new director, it was like this...\n\n48:48.920 --> 48:50.120\nI knew that he was...\n\n48:50.120 --> 48:53.560\nHe had not been happy with the movie, that movie.\n\n48:53.560 --> 48:55.720\nSo they're starting one crazy summer and it is like...\n\n48:55.720 --> 49:00.640\nSo they're starting a second movie with the same director and an actor who is not happy\n\n49:00.640 --> 49:04.760\nwith the first movie is what appeared to be the case.\n\n49:04.760 --> 49:07.320\nAnd over the years, the legends have...\n\n49:07.320 --> 49:11.560\nYeah, I mean, it's just gotten ridiculous where everybody says, well, not only does\n\n49:11.560 --> 49:18.320\nhe hate it, but he abuses people who refer to it.\n\n49:18.320 --> 49:24.520\nAnd he actually, if he's handed something to sign and it has something to do with Better\n\n49:24.520 --> 49:28.200\nOff Dead, he will tear it up and throw it away.\n\n49:28.200 --> 49:30.720\nI mean, the stories became legend.\n\n49:30.720 --> 49:31.720\nAre those verifiable?\n\n49:31.720 --> 49:32.720\nIs that all legend?\n\n49:32.720 --> 49:34.720\nNo, no.\n\n49:34.720 --> 49:35.720\nIt's just...\n\n49:35.720 --> 49:37.480\nI heard he stabbed a child one time.\n\n49:37.480 --> 49:38.480\nIs that true?\n\n49:38.480 --> 49:39.480\nBecause his name was...\n\n49:39.480 --> 49:40.480\nThat's right.\n\n49:40.480 --> 49:41.480\nIt was a little kid.\n\n49:41.480 --> 49:42.480\nThat's what women said.\n\n49:42.480 --> 49:48.480\nMy two dollars is a joke.\n\n49:48.480 --> 49:49.480\nNo.\n\n49:49.480 --> 49:50.480\nThese are the kinds of things...\n\n49:50.480 --> 49:51.480\nWell, okay.\n\n49:51.480 --> 49:58.160\nThe end of the story, as you're asking for, is that we did this reading three weeks ago\n\n49:58.160 --> 50:01.360\nin San Francisco for SketchFest.\n\n50:01.360 --> 50:02.360\nAnd it was...\n\n50:02.360 --> 50:06.920\nSavage was there and a bunch of us from the movie, Kim Darby, Diane Franklin, Amanda Weiss,\n\n50:06.920 --> 50:09.080\nwe were all there and we were reading the script.\n\n50:09.080 --> 50:10.080\nReading Better Off Dead?\n\n50:10.080 --> 50:11.080\nBetter Off Dead.\n\n50:11.080 --> 50:12.640\nBecause Qzack is not there.\n\n50:12.640 --> 50:17.400\nSo the next day, I'm getting all of these Twitter questions from people saying, where's\n\n50:17.400 --> 50:18.400\nQzack?\n\n50:18.400 --> 50:19.400\nWhy wasn't Qzack there?\n\n50:19.400 --> 50:20.640\nWhy didn't you invite Qzack?\n\n50:20.640 --> 50:22.040\nThat's bullshit, man.\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:23.360\nYou should have had Qzack there.\n\n50:23.360 --> 50:26.040\nIt was his movie and all this stuff and going on and on.\n\n50:26.040 --> 50:30.440\nAnd I usually don't respond to that kind of thing, but I finally wrote a Twitter tweet\n\n50:30.440 --> 50:34.640\nand said, you know, John's not a fan of the film.\n\n50:34.640 --> 50:35.680\nAnd that's the truth.\n\n50:35.680 --> 50:37.120\nSo that's why he wasn't there.\n\n50:37.120 --> 50:38.560\nIt's not like we didn't want him there.\n\n50:38.560 --> 50:39.760\nWe would have loved to have had him.\n\n50:39.760 --> 50:42.080\nIt doesn't like the movie.\n\n50:42.080 --> 50:54.120\nTen minutes later, John Qzack tweets, not true.\n\n50:54.120 --> 50:56.240\nI love Twitter so fucking much.\n\n50:56.240 --> 51:00.000\nI mean, you wouldn't be here without Twitter.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:01.320\nSo I know.\n\n51:01.320 --> 51:09.640\nAnd so it winds up, John and I, I have not spoken to John in 25 years, probably.\n\n51:09.640 --> 51:13.080\nAnd we never followed each other on Twitter.\n\n51:13.080 --> 51:20.240\nHe loved the movie so much to talk to his co-stars or to be too tamper with that memory.\n\n51:20.240 --> 51:25.120\nNo, it's just, you know, you don't, I mean, you move on in your life and you just don't,\n\n51:25.120 --> 51:27.560\nyou know, you don't live in each other's pants.\n\n51:27.560 --> 51:28.560\nExactly.\n\n51:28.560 --> 51:30.200\nIt's just, you move on.\n\n51:30.200 --> 51:34.480\nSo, so it's been a long time.\n\n51:34.480 --> 51:39.360\nBut it's, it's been a long time and we don't follow each other on Twitter.\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:42.880\nSo suddenly he's following me on Twitter.\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:43.880\nSo I follow him on Twitter.\n\n51:43.880 --> 51:46.560\nBecause he must have got zoomed by a thousand tweets, like right now, yeah.\n\n51:46.560 --> 51:47.560\nOf course.\n\n51:47.560 --> 51:48.560\nOf course.\n\n51:48.560 --> 51:52.760\nAnd then we start direct messaging about it.\n\n51:52.760 --> 51:59.040\nAnd it was so wonderful to hear, you know, I mean, whatever his feelings had been, you\n\n51:59.040 --> 52:04.960\nknow, he was, it was really great to, to get some nice feedback from him.\n\n52:04.960 --> 52:08.880\nWhat was the, what was the kind of threat, the, the takeaway from that conversation was,\n\n52:08.880 --> 52:12.160\nhe just, I mean, he says, you know, I hated the music.\n\n52:12.160 --> 52:13.880\nI remember he said that he hated the music.\n\n52:13.880 --> 52:15.720\nI thought, well, that's 80s music.\n\n52:15.720 --> 52:18.640\nI hate, everybody hates 80s music.\n\n52:18.640 --> 52:22.200\nBut was he sort of like, was the, when you, who sent the first direct message?\n\n52:22.200 --> 52:27.560\nI'm like a 14 year old girl right now.\n\n52:27.560 --> 52:28.560\nOr boy.\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:33.920\nHe sent, he sent the first one because what, what happened was he sent this out a regular\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:36.600\ntweet, but he tagged me.\n\n52:36.600 --> 52:39.360\nSo when I followed him, he saw me.\n\n52:39.360 --> 52:40.440\nSo he followed me.\n\n52:40.440 --> 52:46.960\nAnd then he followed up on his initial tweet, in which he said more about what, you know,\n\n52:46.960 --> 52:47.960\nwhat his feelings were.\n\n52:47.960 --> 52:54.240\nSo who sent the first direct message to, to you following up, that's what he had already\n\n52:54.240 --> 52:55.240\nsaid.\n\n52:55.240 --> 52:58.880\nHey, hey, Curtis, just so you know, like I really, I really love that movie.\n\n52:58.880 --> 53:00.720\nHe didn't say that.\n\n53:00.720 --> 53:02.560\nIt was, it was subtler than that.\n\n53:02.560 --> 53:07.720\nIt was more like, just so you know, you know, it's a big mistake to spread rumors about\n\n53:07.720 --> 53:08.720\nthe Coos.\n\n53:08.720 --> 53:09.720\nWell, no, no, no.\n\n53:09.720 --> 53:15.880\nThose are the two ends of the spectrum.\n\n53:15.880 --> 53:25.800\nIf you mess with the Coos, you know, Joel Murray did what you did five years ago and\n\n53:25.800 --> 53:30.120\nnow he's doing improv with Jeff Davis.\n\n53:30.120 --> 53:34.240\nI will bury you.\n\n53:34.240 --> 53:37.760\nSo he didn't come out and say, retract that he, at one point, had.\n\n53:37.760 --> 53:38.760\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n53:38.760 --> 53:41.760\nLook, you know what, there's, it's all, you know, what, what winds up happening is, and\n\n53:41.760 --> 53:48.080\nI said this when I, when I messaged him back, I said, this is what happens when you, when\n\n53:48.080 --> 53:53.760\nyou communicate through, you know, playing telephone, right, you know, to use a really\n\n53:53.760 --> 53:54.760\nold thing.\n\n53:54.760 --> 53:57.280\nYou know, it's older than that Chinese telephone.\n\n53:57.280 --> 54:00.720\nThat was an expression.\n\n54:00.720 --> 54:05.800\nI said, you know, you say one thing, somebody then comes to me and says, did you hear what\n\n54:05.800 --> 54:06.800\nhe said?\n\n54:06.800 --> 54:08.640\nAnd I go, oh, geez, he said that.\n\n54:08.640 --> 54:10.720\nAnd then it goes back and forth and back and forth.\n\n54:10.720 --> 54:11.720\nAnd that was the way.\n\n54:11.720 --> 54:12.720\nThat was the way.\n\n54:12.720 --> 54:14.720\nSo how were things left with you and he?\n\n54:14.720 --> 54:15.720\nFine.\n\n54:15.720 --> 54:16.720\nFine?\n\n54:16.720 --> 54:17.720\nYeah.\n\n54:17.720 --> 54:18.720\nI mean.\n\n54:18.720 --> 54:19.720\nYou guys going to hang out?\n\n54:19.720 --> 54:20.720\nNo.\n\n54:20.720 --> 54:25.800\nYou're going to, are you going to help him ski the 4K, or the 5K, 12K, 12K.\n\n54:25.800 --> 54:33.320\nNow, the 12K dude, when I hear, and this is just me projecting onto him, he even does\n\n54:33.320 --> 54:34.320\nmy voice.\n\n54:34.320 --> 54:35.320\nIt's a little scary.\n\n54:35.320 --> 54:36.320\nWell, no, it's unintentional.\n\n54:36.320 --> 54:46.560\nNo, no, no, I kind of sound like you, regardless.\n\n54:46.560 --> 54:51.320\nThe 12K dude, that's not bad.\n\n54:51.320 --> 54:53.880\nBelieve me, it's funnier in context.\n\n54:53.880 --> 54:59.600\nThere's that scene when he's making the burgers and Van Halen starts singing that terrible,\n\n54:59.600 --> 55:03.000\nit's not a good Van Halen song, by the way, for my money, and he starts doing animation\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:04.280\nwith the burgers and the thing.\n\n55:04.280 --> 55:05.280\nRight.\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:09.000\nIf there was a scene, if I were John Cusack and I looked back at the screening of that,\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:13.040\nI would not be proud of that scene because it's pretty, pretty ham bone.\n\n55:13.040 --> 55:16.960\nAnd so when I hear him say he doesn't like the music, I think he's embarrassed about\n\n55:16.960 --> 55:19.120\nthat one scene more specifically.\n\n55:19.120 --> 55:24.040\nWell, that could be, but that takes me into a whole area that I can't even comment on.\n\n55:24.040 --> 55:28.120\nAnd that also makes me wonder, well, how does he feel about Tapeheads?\n\n55:28.120 --> 55:29.440\nHe must be like a hipster.\n\n55:29.440 --> 55:31.280\nHe must love Tapeheads.\n\n55:31.280 --> 55:33.280\nI have no idea what he likes or doesn't like.\n\n55:33.280 --> 55:37.680\nBecause I just remember Tapeheads, which was an equally cult, and I bet that had a lot\n\n55:37.680 --> 55:39.760\nmore street cred with music.\n\n55:39.760 --> 55:41.920\nWell, it was an independent movie.\n\n55:41.920 --> 55:44.920\nI was working for that company when it was made, actually.\n\n55:44.920 --> 55:49.560\nAnd that was a sort of low-budget, independent, edgy movie of the time.\n\n55:49.560 --> 55:50.560\nAnd Tim Robbins.\n\n55:50.560 --> 55:55.800\nHow is it that you, so you're this guy in Better Off Dead, which by the way, what order\n\n55:55.800 --> 55:56.800\nis that in?\n\n55:56.800 --> 55:58.520\nWhen are you booger in relation to Better Off Dead?\n\n55:58.520 --> 55:59.520\nI don't even know.\n\n55:59.520 --> 56:06.960\nIt goes, it goes, it goes Revenge of the Nerds and Better Off Dead the same year.\n\n56:06.960 --> 56:08.400\nBut Better Off Dead second.\n\n56:08.400 --> 56:09.920\nSo my confusion is forgivable.\n\n56:09.920 --> 56:10.920\nYes.\n\n56:10.920 --> 56:17.360\nBut, and then there's, so were you, how does that, I want to hear the kind of story about\n\n56:17.360 --> 56:24.760\nyou going from, I think every actor has that fork on the road career story, or your one\n\n56:24.760 --> 56:28.160\nbedroom apartment and you're thinking of moving back to, where are you from by the\n\n56:28.160 --> 56:29.160\nway?\n\n56:29.160 --> 56:30.160\nI'm from Detroit.\n\n56:30.160 --> 56:31.160\nOkay.\n\n56:31.160 --> 56:32.680\nSo you're in L.A., I'm assuming, you're?\n\n56:32.680 --> 56:35.600\nNo, I was in New York then, actually.\n\n56:35.600 --> 56:36.600\nOkay.\n\n56:36.600 --> 56:37.600\nBut what's the threshold?\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:39.400\nWhat's the red light that you don't hit?\n\n56:39.400 --> 56:42.560\nI think it was, it was moonlighting, actually, it was none of those.\n\n56:42.560 --> 56:43.560\nWait, what do you mean?\n\n56:43.560 --> 56:44.560\nOh, it's right, you're on moonlighting.\n\n56:44.560 --> 56:48.520\nWell, I mean, but that was, God damn, I forgot about it.\n\n56:48.520 --> 56:50.640\nThat was, I fucking loved that show.\n\n56:50.640 --> 56:52.640\nThat's not fair though, I knew that, I was going to talk about it.\n\n56:52.640 --> 56:54.040\nI didn't know, I forgot about it.\n\n56:54.040 --> 56:57.920\nBut that's, that's way after, that's after all that.\n\n56:57.920 --> 57:03.120\nAnd I know, but I was still living in New York the whole time, and I would do the movies.\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:09.080\nYou don't have to realize, you're telling me that in your, in my head, this is how,\n\n57:09.080 --> 57:10.520\nthis is what I was thinking.\n\n57:10.520 --> 57:13.320\nThis will give you a great idea, because I started in the theater, okay?\n\n57:13.320 --> 57:19.800\nSo I was working, like, from mid-seventies to my first movie, which was Risky Business,\n\n57:19.800 --> 57:21.800\nwhich was the year before.\n\n57:21.800 --> 57:24.360\nRisky Business, I forgot, I knew that one.\n\n57:24.360 --> 57:25.360\nHow can I forget that?\n\n57:25.360 --> 57:28.520\nYou had the, the line that defines Risky Business.\n\n57:28.520 --> 57:29.520\nRight.\n\n57:29.520 --> 57:32.200\nThis is Risky Business, man!\n\n57:32.200 --> 57:34.080\nThat's kind of like that.\n\n57:34.080 --> 57:36.680\nJesus Christ, this business is risky.\n\n57:36.680 --> 57:46.320\nDo you have an idea of how risky this business is?\n\n57:46.320 --> 57:49.600\nI forgot you right, I was, I was, I was in it.\n\n57:49.600 --> 57:51.160\nI was in that, and, but.\n\n57:51.160 --> 57:54.160\nThis business is pure risk.\n\n57:54.160 --> 58:00.680\nThey put me in that movie, and I thought it was the only movie I would ever make, because\n\n58:00.680 --> 58:04.120\nI was not thinking in terms of movies, I was thinking in terms of stage.\n\n58:04.120 --> 58:10.840\nSo when I did Risky Business, I kept a journal every day that I was on the movie for 11 weeks\n\n58:10.840 --> 58:17.440\nor 10 weeks, only because I wanted to remember what making a movie was like.\n\n58:17.440 --> 58:21.240\nI really thought I would then just go back to doing, you know, regional theater, and\n\n58:21.240 --> 58:24.120\ndoing, you know, stuff in New York and that, and that was going to be it.\n\n58:24.120 --> 58:28.240\nAre you a song and dance man, or are you just a dramatic, you want to play Willie Lohman,\n\n58:28.240 --> 58:29.240\nyou want to.\n\n58:29.240 --> 58:30.240\nNo.\n\n58:30.240 --> 58:35.560\nNo, I, I just do the same rubbish on stage that I do on film.\n\n58:35.560 --> 58:41.600\nThe, so, okay, so was, where was Risky Business in this, Better Off Dead, slash.\n\n58:41.600 --> 58:46.040\n83 was Risky Business, 84 was Revenge of the Nerds, Better Off Dead.\n\n58:46.040 --> 58:49.680\nOh, okay, god damn it, I kept Risky Business out of nowhere.\n\n58:49.680 --> 58:55.120\nAnyway, my point is that all of the, what all of that was going on in the, the movies,\n\n58:55.120 --> 59:01.280\nthe movie things, it was only when I got moonlighting that I actually was out here and working\n\n59:01.280 --> 59:06.840\nhere and realizing I couldn't go anywhere because we were working, you know, 10 months\n\n59:06.840 --> 59:07.840\nout of the year.\n\n59:07.840 --> 59:13.880\nSo you've always been sort of like on, on surely from the stage, and your, your mind.\n\n59:13.880 --> 59:15.720\nI mean, it's hard for me to even think about it now.\n\n59:15.720 --> 59:22.760\nThat's so funny because I mean, you were, you were Booger slash Charles Dumar, and, and\n\n59:22.760 --> 59:27.600\nthen I, yeah, at some point I bothered to see Risky Business, but it was about like\n\n59:27.600 --> 59:35.520\nsexy people, and I, it wasn't, I forgot that you were in that, and like, and I, moonlighting\n\n59:35.520 --> 59:40.600\nwas my favorite show, and I was watching it every night, and, and I remember when you\n\n59:40.600 --> 59:46.000\narrived as Miss De Pesto's lover, and, and I remember thinking like, ah, fuck him, he\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.000\nsold out.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:48.000\nRight.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:54.440\nWell, but you were thinking, and so it begins, I guess I'm not going back to the stage.\n\n59:54.440 --> 59:57.440\nI was thinking, I now have more than $200.\n\n59:57.440 --> 59:58.440\nRight.\n\n59:58.440 --> 01:00:03.000\nBecause you were just doing these movies that were, yeah, that's despite their cultural\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nefficacy.\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.800\nYeah, I mean, now it seems like I must have been just making a fortune.\n\n01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800\nAnd I wasn't.\n\n01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.440\nThat's everyone's perception of everyone they, they see on screen, yeah.\n\n01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440\nWow.\n\n01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440\nAll right.\n\n01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.320\nThat's why it was so, I mean, because, you know, you do those movies, and I did maybe\n\n01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.200\nsix movies in the whole decade, six or seven movies, and that was it.\n\n01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.440\nEverything else I was doing was stage, you know, there was no money at all.\n\n01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.000\nDo you have anywhere to be?\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nWhen?\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nNow?\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nTonight.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nNo, I was going to be here with you.\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nRight.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nI sort of, I sort of cleared my mind.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nYou don't have a heart out, do you?\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nNo, I don't have a heart out.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.160\nThis is the point where Dan's afraid to, to keep his guests as much as he wants you\n\n01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.160\nto stay.\n\n01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.160\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.520\nI'm, I'm still good if you're, if you're good.\n\n01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520\nOkay.\n\n01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.120\nYou're allowed to fuck straight off if you want to go, but we would love to have you\n\n01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.120\nstay if you, if you could.\n\n01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.160\nNo, I'm going to bring out my, some of my other, thank you.\n\n01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.880\nUh, I, uh, let's, uh, is Spencer back there?\n\n01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880\nSpencer?\n\n01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880\nAre you in the house?\n\n01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880\nYeah.\n\n01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880\nAll right.\n\n01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.880\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880\nSpencer, Chris.\n\n01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880\nSpencer.\n\n01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:12.360\nOh, oh, my goodness.\n\n01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:22.800\nOh, oh, it's great to be here.\n\n01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.800\nSpencer, Spencer, did you willfully ignore the most important high five of my life?\n\n01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.120\nWait, what are you talking about?\n\n01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.600\nI just hung a high five out there and you walked right by.\n\n01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.000\nOh, I thought you were like, yay, Spencer, yay.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.840\nYes, but I wanted to make physical contact.\n\n01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.720\nI always want to make physical contact with you, Jeff.\n\n01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.360\nI'm going to, I'm going to fuck the shit out of you after the show.\n\n01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360\nYeah.\n\n01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:52.520\nSpencer, were you affected in your, uh, upbringing by any of Curtis Armstrong's, uh, oof, oof.\n\n01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520\nYeah.\n\n01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520\nYeah.\n\n01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520\nOh, totally.\n\n01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.960\nLike when I was in a middle school, I remember there's these kids talking about this movie\n\n01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.080\nand I was like, that sounds like the best movie I've ever heard.\n\n01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.520\nAnd, uh, it was Revenge of the Nerds and it influenced my life.\n\n01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.840\nAll right.\n\n01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.760\nIt almost sounds like the answer he'd have if he was just trying to stay out of trouble.\n\n01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.760\nRight.\n\n01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.760\nExactly.\n\n01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.560\nI definitely remember now that you guys bring it up that kids in middle school were talking\n\n01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560\nabout it.\n\n01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.720\nAnd I was like, that sounds crazy.\n\n01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.160\nI don't really watch movies.\n\n01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.480\nUh, I hate to admit it, but yeah, it's a, it's a huge problem in my life because everyone's\n\n01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.080\nall like, oh, it's like a risky business and I'm like, I don't know what you mean.\n\n01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.680\nWhy is, why is this guy wearing underwear?\n\n01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.720\nI don't, you miss all these, all these reference points.\n\n01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.840\nWhat are you guys up to?\n\n01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.600\nThere was at least an entire episode of Moonlighting where it was you and Mr. Pesto, uh, uh, because\n\n01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600\nit was like,\n\n01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.840\nYeah, that would happen a lot in broadcast TV back then.\n\n01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.080\nI remember an episode of Miami Vice when Crockett and Tubbs know where to be found and there\n\n01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.080\nwere just two guys.\n\n01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.080\nYeah.\n\n01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.220\nThose were always, those were always the episodes at Christmas when the stars got to leave\n\n01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.960\nlike on December 1st and they had no one to film.\n\n01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.600\nSo they would film us and that was, that was what that was.\n\n01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.960\nHow was Sybil Shepard to work with, if I may ask?\n\n01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.720\nWell, uh, I never had a problem with Sybil Shepard actually.\n\n01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.120\nShe was a bit notorious later on.\n\n01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120\nI don't know about that.\n\n01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:28.560\nThey were both notorious actually, um, at different points, but, uh, but I never had\n\n01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.600\na problem, you know, as far as acting.\n\n01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600\nI never had a problem.\n\n01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600\nI love that show.\n\n01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.840\nMy favorite memory of that is my family all watched that.\n\n01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.560\nWe didn't watch a lot of shows all as a family, but we watched it together.\n\n01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.760\nBut every time Sybil Shepard was on screen, it was so gauzed out like she had this incredible\n\n01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.760\nfilter.\n\n01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.760\nWell, they would joke about that on the show.\n\n01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.760\nYeah.\n\n01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.760\nThey did.\n\n01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.560\nThey made a joke about her fill, the filters.\n\n01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560\nYeah.\n\n01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.560\nShe came, she came out into the office.\n\n01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.560\nWell, you know what?\n\n01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.560\nI saw the camera.\n\n01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.520\nAnd Jerry Fenerman was the DP on Moonlighting.\n\n01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.860\nHe was the DP on the original Star Trek.\n\n01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:02.880\nAnd if you watch the original Star Trek, every time there's a beautiful alien woman,\n\n01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.720\nit, you know, there'll be Kirk and it's just Kirk.\n\n01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.000\nAnd then it goes to her close up and it's like she's, uh, you can barely see her.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.040\nSomebody's rubbed Vaseline on the lens.\n\n01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.120\nThe Vaseline that they've got on the lens.\n\n01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.400\nAnd it was, it was, uh, it was Jerry Fenerman's sort of his signature.\n\n01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:27.000\nAnd so he was still doing it in the 80s when it was actually now probably not such a good\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nidea.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nSome walk by nerd.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nSome walk by nerd.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nVery good.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nThank you.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nThank you.\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nVery good.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nSee, I got that.\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.120\nWe've mentioned, uh, Nerddom, Star Trek, and, uh, and a bunch of things.\n\n01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.400\nWe haven't even talked about Leonard Nimoy, man.\n\n01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.400\nI know.\n\n01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.400\nOh, Leonard Nimoy passed.\n\n01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.400\nYeah.\n\n01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.400\nThat's a pretty.\n\n01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.360\nHe, he all, all life well lived.\n\n01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.360\nThat's one of those mission accomplished deaths that's like, oh, great to live for\n\n01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360\nyou forever.\n\n01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.360\nBut we were, you know, 15 years ago, we had made our peace.\n\n01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.360\nUm, well, I expected you to laugh.\n\n01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.360\nIt sounds like, I don't know.\n\n01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360\nThat one landed on the foul line.\n\n01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360\nIt was supposed to land so far out that it was funny.\n\n01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.360\nLike I was supposed to, like I was supposed to, I was making fun of myself.\n\n01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.360\nInstead of sounding like you wished him dead 15 years ago.\n\n01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360\nYeah.\n\n01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.360\nIt may be too soon, man, for that joke.\n\n01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:25.360\nI, uh, no, I mean, it's, uh, it's what a, what a, yeah, it's, I, the end of an era\n\n01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360\nfor sure.\n\n01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.360\nSpencer, did, did, uh, original Sirius Star Trek ever cross your path?\n\n01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.360\nUh, no, but I did enjoy that ballad of, uh, Bilbo Baggins there.\n\n01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360\nYeah.\n\n01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.360\nYeah.\n\n01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.360\nI remember that from his second album.\n\n01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360\nHis best.\n\n01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.360\nTwo sides of Leonard Nimoy.\n\n01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:46.360\nIs, uh, I consider it, I consider it kind of his Sergeant Pepper.\n\n01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.360\nYeah.\n\n01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360\nNo, definitely.\n\n01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.360\nSo Leonard Nimoy was depicted graphically.\n\n01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.360\nLike, was it like, like, you know Leonard Nimoy is this like Vulcan-esque guy.\n\n01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:00.360\nIt was exactly the album was called Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy and two pictures in profile,\n\n01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.360\none of Leonard as a, as Leonard and the other as Spock.\n\n01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.360\nYeah.\n\n01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.360\nThere's a great photo that Proup sent me today.\n\n01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.360\nIt's a, it's him and a turtleneck hanging out with Jimmy Hendricks.\n\n01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.360\nAnd it's like, yeah.\n\n01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360\nYeah.\n\n01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.360\nBecause you like, you see, when that, that, that's weird, isn't it?\n\n01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.360\nThat there was a time when those things, Jimmy looks more excited to be with Leonard\n\n01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360\nNimoy than vice versa.\n\n01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.360\nI, well, can you imagine being, like, like, and being alive at a time, like, working\n\n01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.360\nat a time when Star Trek was on the air.\n\n01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.360\nYeah.\n\n01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.360\nAnd then Spock walking into a party.\n\n01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.360\nLike, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360\nYeah.\n\n01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360\nLike, we get excited about Jeff Goldblum.\n\n01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.360\nLike, oh, he's kind of the Spock of Jurassic Park.\n\n01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:45.360\nLike, like, it's not, there's nothing like, like, I mean, Spock walked in the door.\n\n01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360\nThat's a different thing.\n\n01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360\nYeah.\n\n01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360\nLike, specifically Leonard Nimoy.\n\n01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.360\nLike, such a crazy, like, like, striking looking guy.\n\n01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360\nOh, I, it's 9-Eleven.\n\n01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.360\nAnd don't we have a, are we, are we going to do a new tradition at 9-Eleven?\n\n01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.360\nWhat was it?\n\n01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.360\nI forget.\n\n01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.360\nIt was Make-A-Wish.\n\n01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.360\nIt's your 9-Eleven wish.\n\n01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.360\nI wish, I wish for no more 9-Elevens, but, all right, let's forget that.\n\n01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.360\nI wish, I wish Leonard Nimoy dropped dead 15 years ago.\n\n01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:17.360\nCurtis, do you want to make a wish?\n\n01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.360\nIt's still 9-Eleven.\n\n01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.360\nMake your 9-Eleven wish before it's over.\n\n01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.360\nNo, I can't, I can't.\n\n01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.360\nThat's too much pressure for me.\n\n01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360\nSpencer, you get a 9-Eleven wish?\n\n01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.360\nI just want to be, we didn't actually settle, that was one of the pitches was to make a\n\n01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.360\nwish, but that was not where we settled.\n\n01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.360\nI thought there was one that I jazzed to more than a wish.\n\n01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.360\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.360\nThere was, I don't know what it is.\n\n01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.360\nDid anybody recall from last week?\n\n01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.360\nI just love killing momentum.\n\n01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.360\nWhoa.\n\n01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.360\nWow.\n\n01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.360\nWow.\n\n01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.360\nIt's more of an opportunity.\n\n01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.360\nLike a 9-Eleven during 9-Eleven.\n\n01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:55.360\nI just made a new wish, motherfucker.\n\n01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.360\nDid my wife ever make it here?\n\n01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360\nYeah.\n\n01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360\nIs Erin here?\n\n01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.360\nErin McGathy.\n\n01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:14.360\nGood day to the stage.\n\n01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360\nHello.\n\n01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.360\nHello.\n\n01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360\nHi.\n\n01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.360\nErin is the reason why we watch your show in bed with our dogs, our many dogs.\n\n01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.360\nWe have a very specific fetish.\n\n01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360\nIt was just outlined.\n\n01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360\nThat's a really specific one.\n\n01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.360\nCurtis, I heard that not all of your summers have been sane.\n\n01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.360\nCurtis was in one crazy summer.\n\n01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360\nDid you guys bring that up already?\n\n01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360\nYeah, we did, actually.\n\n01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.360\nOh, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360\nYou talked about that, but that's all right.\n\n01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360\nThe pikey takes a long time with the burger.\n\n01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.360\nIt's nice to know that you were listening to the show.\n\n01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.360\nMe and my best friend, Kimber, is backstage.\n\n01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.360\nWe got some burgers.\n\n01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360\nWe ordered them with some boogers.\n\n01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.360\nWhere'd you get the burgers from?\n\n01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.360\nThat's what I want to know.\n\n01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.360\nI don't know why in that moment I thought you were.\n\n01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.360\nI can't see him, so when that voice comes out, I get confused.\n\n01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360\nIt's a real layout issue.\n\n01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360\nNo.\n\n01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360\nWhere'd the burgers come from?\n\n01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.360\nI'm sorry I brought it up.\n\n01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.360\nIt's very boring.\n\n01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.360\nWe ordered burgers from the pikey thinking that we would get them before eight o'clock,\n\n01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.360\nand we didn't.\n\n01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.360\nThat's not boring at all.\n\n01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.360\nThat story is a rich tapestry.\n\n01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.360\nThat's a Navajo quilt.\n\n01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.360\nI'm very embarrassed about my one crazy summer joke,\n\n01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360\nbecause I was about to come out and I'm like,\n\n01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.360\nthey haven't even mentioned one crazy summer.\n\n01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360\nWe're going to be real cool.\n\n01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360\nCovered that first, actually.\n\n01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.360\nWell, this is One Boring Spring.\n\n01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.360\nThere's a segment I'd like to do.\n\n01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.360\nI'd like to add a segment that comes after 9-11\n\n01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.360\ncalled Dan's Getting Tipsy.\n\n01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.360\nPlay the theme music.\n\n01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.360\nBecause this now is my favorite song of all time.\n\n01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:06.360\nFrom the morning to the night, you're going to drink, drink, drink, drink and drink.\n\n01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.360\nFamily, family.\n\n01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.360\nThere's always going to come a point, obviously, of the show,\n\n01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.360\nbecause I drink throughout the show,\n\n01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:20.360\nI start to lose control and start to regret.\n\n01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.360\nThe reason I don't listen to the show the next night.\n\n01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.360\nWere you drinking before the show?\n\n01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.360\nWhat I wanted to say is, no, I wasn't drinking.\n\n01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360\nWhat are you, Dr. Drew?\n\n01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.360\nI'm just saying.\n\n01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.360\nWere you easing as a kid?\n\n01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.360\nNo, I was in the edit bay, but I just sit here.\n\n01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.360\nYou sit down and you start to earn this drinking during the show.\n\n01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.360\nI started to get a little buzz, and then I started to think,\n\n01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.360\nI just wanted to say, Curtis, you look so great on the show,\n\n01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.360\non the King of the Nerd show.\n\n01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.360\nYou look so activated and glowing and happy and handsome and delivering so much.\n\n01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.360\nThat's why I want people to watch the show.\n\n01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.360\nBecause I look much better than I do here.\n\n01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.360\nSpencer, Molly just kicked in, so I want to tell you this.\n\n01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.360\nThere's a segment for that, too.\n\n01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.360\nEveryone's drugs are kicking in.\n\n01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:17.360\nThis is very dumb, but I think maybe, I'll call it 10 years ago,\n\n01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.360\ngive or take.\n\n01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.360\nI was at a Chipotle on Sunset Boulevard, and you were in front of me,\n\n01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.360\nand I wanted to hug you, because there's Curtis.\n\n01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.360\nI was so happy, and I was too shy to say hello,\n\n01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.360\nbut I was very happy to be standing behind Curtis,\n\n01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.360\nand I'm strong at the Chipotle.\n\n01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.360\nI think it was a different word.\n\n01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.360\nBaja fresh.\n\n01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360\nNow do you remember?\n\n01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360\nOh, the Baja fresh.\n\n01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.360\nI was the guy right behind you.\n\n01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.360\nYou were the guy behind me that time.\n\n01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360\nI was the guy.\n\n01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360\nYou know why I remember?\n\n01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.360\nIt was the only time I ever went into that place.\n\n01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.360\nBecause it's such a risky business.\n\n01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.360\nThat was the right response.\n\n01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360\nThat was pretty crazy.\n\n01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.360\nWhen your business doesn't have insurance,\n\n01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:13.360\nit is taking certain gambles on the lawn,\n\n01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.360\nbeat, beat, financial risk.\n\n01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.360\nEverybody's going to do it.\n\n01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.360\nRisky business.\n\n01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.360\nCurtis, you're so joyful on that show,\n\n01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.360\nand you clearly are super into it.\n\n01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.360\nHas anybody brought up your rap, your TBS rap?\n\n01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360\nMy rap?\n\n01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.360\nNo, no one brought it up.\n\n01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360\nYou have a rap?\n\n01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.360\nYeah, I think it's called On Fridays.\n\n01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.360\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360\nI'm not sure what it was called.\n\n01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360\nIs anybody familiar with Curtis's rap?\n\n01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.360\nI'm going to try to do it.\n\n01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.360\nOh, it's, no, you know what?\n\n01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360\nKing of the Nerds.\n\n01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.360\nKing of the Nerds.\n\n01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.360\nKing of the Nerds on Friday.\n\n01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.360\nTBS on Friday.\n\n01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360\nNine o'clock.\n\n01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360\nThe King of the Nerds.\n\n01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.360\nThe King of the Nerds.\n\n01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.360\nThe King of the Nerds.\n\n01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.360\nThe King of the Nerds.\n\n01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360\nThe Nerds is back.\n\n01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.360\nBack in the nerdiest nerd town.\n\n01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.360\nNo, Nerds, New Night, New Nerds, in fact.\n\n01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.360\nThe Ultimate Nerds in the Ultimate Showdown.\n\n01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.360\nBattlehead.\n\n01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.360\nComes out for the Ultimate Nerd Crown.\n\n01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.360\nKing of the Nerds.\n\n01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360\nSomething like that.\n\n01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360\nHashtag something.\n\n01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.360\nHashtag nerds rule.\n\n01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.360\nWish you would have known back in high school.\n\n01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360\nYeah.\n\n01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360\nWow.\n\n01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.360\nI kind of feel bad that MC John didn't sit on that one.\n\n01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360\nYeah.\n\n01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360\nNo.\n\n01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.360\nDan has a new rap character.\n\n01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.360\nAnd I'm expecting, you know, Kanye to come out here any second.\n\n01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:47.360\nAlso, Curtis, you've been, you've exposed a lot of skin this season.\n\n01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.360\nHow do you feel about that?\n\n01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360\nI got naked.\n\n01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.360\nWas that your pitch or was that, what was the...\n\n01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:58.360\nYeah, it was the only time I've ever actually appeared in front of people without any clothes on.\n\n01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360\nSo we had a theory about that.\n\n01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360\nWhat was it?\n\n01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.360\nBecause you're, so you're EPing the show with Karenine.\n\n01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.360\nYeah.\n\n01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.360\nHe seems a little, like, can we talk about Bobby?\n\n01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360\nHe, like, does he...\n\n01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.360\nCan we talk about Bobby?\n\n01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.360\nHe seems less invested than the show than you.\n\n01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360\nOh, no, no, no.\n\n01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360\nNot at all.\n\n01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.360\nNo, he's absolutely, it's just, I mean, you know, you have two people.\n\n01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.360\nIf we were both doing exactly the same thing, that would be...\n\n01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360\nRight.\n\n01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.360\nOh, so he...\n\n01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.360\nHe does what he does.\n\n01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360\nSo he said, you're gonna get naked and you're like, yeah, I'll get naked.\n\n01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.360\nYeah, no, no, I'll be, you know, we just, we had to get naked because, I had to get naked\n\n01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.360\nbecause I will do anything.\n\n01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:39.360\nAnd they were trying to figure out, it was, well, I mean, the limits.\n\n01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:47.360\nBut they were, they, we needed to explain why, this is so stupid, but we, it was actually\n\n01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.360\njust because we needed to explain why the nerds were not gonna pick their teams this year.\n\n01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.360\nI mean, you didn't have to do what you did.\n\n01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360\nIt's great, but it's good.\n\n01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.360\nSomebody said, one of the show runners said, what about if we do Terminator and you show\n\n01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.360\nup naked from the future to explain why the nerds can't do this?\n\n01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.360\nSo I said, great, because it was like...\n\n01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360\nIt was fantastic.\n\n01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.360\nYeah.\n\n01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.360\nIt was a great idea.\n\n01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.360\nI was worried it was not gonna pay off until the end of the season that you guys were trying\n\n01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360\nto do like a seasonal thing.\n\n01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.360\nLike this was the season when...\n\n01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360\nWell, we've done it now.\n\n01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.360\nI mean, we did it, you know, after the first season, we came back with an explanation.\n\n01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.360\nWe have to figure out why the king is dead.\n\n01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360\nNo, no, you don't.\n\n01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360\nYou don't.\n\n01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.360\nNo, we do.\n\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360\nBut it's very nerdy of you to do it.\n\n01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360\nWe do that.\n\n01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360\nYou don't have to do it.\n\n01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.360\nIt's true.\n\n01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360\nNo one, the bachelor never says like...\n\n01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.360\nWe ran out of roses on the first season.\n\n01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360\nWe gave them all away.\n\n01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.360\nYeah, we had to put them down.\n\n01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.360\nThat's why we're different.\n\n01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.360\nBut I guess they're not saying it's the king of married people on that show.\n\n01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360\nLike they're just saying, you two are married, fuck off.\n\n01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.360\nAnd you're saying it's the king of the nerds.\n\n01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.360\nNo, I love that.\n\n01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.360\nEach season begins with the reason why the king of the nerds is now gone.\n\n01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.360\nSo we have to get a new king and it has to...\n\n01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.360\nYou know, it's a science fiction thing.\n\n01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.360\nWith those bits, like this is the third season.\n\n01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.360\nHave there been any that you've regretted?\n\n01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.360\nOh, what?\n\n01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360\nYou mean nerds?\n\n01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.360\nOh, well, sure.\n\n01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.360\nNo, no, your bits like the Terminator...\n\n01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.360\nOh, no, no, no, I don't regret anything.\n\n01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.360\nOh, that's good.\n\n01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360\nBut you've regretted some of the nerds?\n\n01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.360\nNo, no, I don't regret them either.\n\n01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.360\nI thought if that's what you were going to ask, I was going to say,\n\n01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.360\nno, I don't have any regrets about the nerds.\n\n01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.360\nAnd I have no regrets about anything I've ever done.\n\n01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.360\nDo you have any regrets in life?\n\n01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.360\nHe just said, no, you fucking asshole.\n\n01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.360\nWell, no.\n\n01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.360\nYou're talking about the shot, guys.\n\n01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.360\nWait a minute.\n\n01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.360\nHe was asking about life.\n\n01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.360\nI was saying that I don't have any regrets about my career.\n\n01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360\nI mean, you know.\n\n01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360\nI just thought you should regret that question.\n\n01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360\nWell, I mean, he...\n\n01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.360\nYeah.\n\n01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.360\nI like you regret nothing.\n\n01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.360\nNo, I regret nothing.\n\n01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.360\nI don't regret asking that question.\n\n01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360\nFuck you.\n\n01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360\nYeah.\n\n01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360\nAll right.\n\n01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.360\nNow, do you regret saying bullshit?\n\n01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.360\nNo.\n\n01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:01.360\nLet's not acknowledge this asshole that keeps on talking to the audience.\n\n01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360\nWho got away?\n\n01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.360\nDid you ever have any romances with any co-stars?\n\n01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360\nWhat?\n\n01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360\nOn the...\n\n01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360\nYou have to be more specific.\n\n01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360\nOh!\n\n01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360\nYou mean...\n\n01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360\nI mean, on the nerds?\n\n01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360\nI mean, on the nerds?\n\n01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360\nLike when you were wearing that Dickensian cap,\n\n01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.360\nyou had a better off dad or...\n\n01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360\nOh, my little top hat.\n\n01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360\nOh, that was a big top hat, Curtis.\n\n01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.360\nHave I ever had romances on jobs, you mean?\n\n01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360\nYes.\n\n01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360\nOf course.\n\n01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.360\nOr what...\n\n01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.360\nWas that cool?\n\n01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360\nAt the time.\n\n01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.360\nYou don't have to say whom, but is there anyone that's like a very...\n\n01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.360\nlike a Diane Keaton where you're like,\n\n01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.360\nI know what it looks like.\n\n01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.360\nIs there any...?\n\n01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360\nNo.\n\n01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360\nNo, there's nothing like that.\n\n01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360\nNothing like that.\n\n01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.360\nIt could be anything.\n\n01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.360\nCurtis, do you know what Diane Keaton's badge looks like?\n\n01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:05.360\nIt has a very tasteful vest.\n\n01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.360\nYou're saying Diane Keaton's vagina dresses up like Annie Hall?\n\n01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.360\nI'm saying Diane Keaton's vagina dresses up like Diane Keaton, who dresses up like Annie Hall.\n\n01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360\nShe's not always in a vest.\n\n01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360\nNo, she's not, but that...\n\n01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360\nKing of the Nerds!\n\n01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360\nKing of the Nerds!\n\n01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.360\nKing of the Nerds on Fridays!\n\n01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.360\nAll right.\n\n01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360\nAll right.\n\n01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.360\nSo thanks for doing that, because it gives me a chance to say it's on Fridays.\n\n01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.360\nAnd, you know, we're still running at this point.\n\n01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.360\nAnd it's doing well in the ratings now.\n\n01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360\nIt's doing well in the ratings.\n\n01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.360\nYeah.\n\n01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.360\nWhich is a relief.\n\n01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360\nIt is for me.\n\n01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.360\nI'm a TVist and you can't tell.\n\n01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.360\nI don't know when I'm watching the show.\n\n01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.360\nUsually in the old days in TV, you'd go like, well, obviously,\n\n01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.360\nManimal is killing.\n\n01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.360\nBecause now the peacock has a fin on it.\n\n01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.360\nBecause it turns into a shark and...\n\n01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.360\nWait, are you joking about that?\n\n01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.360\nDid Manimal morph the peacock into other animals?\n\n01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360\nNo.\n\n01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.360\nGoddamn, that would be great.\n\n01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360\nNo, because Manimal never killed.\n\n01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.360\nI used to...\n\n01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360\nYou ever pretended to be Manimal?\n\n01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.360\nI would do a thing where I'd put my hand on my desk and make my finger pulse.\n\n01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.360\nRemember when Manimal was like, is this going to hand or puff out?\n\n01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.360\nI had a Manimal trick when I was a kid.\n\n01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.360\nJack Black, I think I've told this on the show.\n\n01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.360\nJack Black was, when we were doing Heat Vision and Jack,\n\n01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.360\nwe were swapping stories about the influence of Six Million Dollar Man.\n\n01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.360\nAnd he said that he would go to school.\n\n01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.360\nI just talked about this, didn't I, on this podcast?\n\n01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.360\nWhen he was in sixth grade, because he loved Six Million Dollar Man so much,\n\n01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.360\nhe would sometimes tuck wires, electrical wires into his sleeve,\n\n01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.360\nand go to class and wait for, in his peripheral vision,\n\n01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.360\nfor another kid to possibly see the wires,\n\n01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.360\nbut not look at the kid and just hide the wires.\n\n01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.360\nBecause he was that into...\n\n01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360\nThat's great.\n\n01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360\nHe wanted to be a secret robot.\n\n01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360\nWow.\n\n01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.360\nThat's such a little...\n\n01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.360\nI did something like that.\n\n01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360\nDo you want to hear what mine was?\n\n01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.360\nBecause I wasn't into Six Million Dollar Man,\n\n01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.360\nbut I just wasn't okay.\n\n01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.360\nWas that that same guy who keeps asking questions?\n\n01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.360\nOkay, I didn't like it, okay?\n\n01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.360\nBut what I did, I loved Sherlock Holmes, though.\n\n01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.360\nI was really into Sherlock Holmes.\n\n01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.360\nLike, in what incarnation? Just the books.\n\n01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360\nWow.\n\n01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.360\nA real nerd.\n\n01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.360\nYeah.\n\n01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:31.360\nAnd my bedroom overlooked the street outside my parents' house.\n\n01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360\nAnd so what I would do,\n\n01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.360\nbecause I couldn't get dates and I had no friends,\n\n01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.360\nso I would lower my shade and light myself from behind.\n\n01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.360\nAnd then this friend of mine had given me...\n\n01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360\nNo.\n\n01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.360\nStop. Let me finish.\n\n01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360\nSo this friend of mine...\n\n01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360\nI know where you're headed, Curtis.\n\n01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.360\nHad given me a violin, which had no strings.\n\n01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:03.360\nAnd I would stand in front of the shade and pretend to play the violin.\n\n01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.360\nThat's called homologing.\n\n01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.360\nHoping somebody would walk by and go,\n\n01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.360\nboy, he's really more interesting than I thought.\n\n01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.360\nThat is...\n\n01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360\nThat's great.\n\n01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360\nI actually did that.\n\n01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.360\nWas that based on an image that was described by Conan Doyle?\n\n01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.360\nYeah, so he's walking, you know, that acolyne figure walking past the shade.\n\n01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.360\nI would do that only if it was my figure was not really...\n\n01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360\nCurtis, you know how you would...\n\n01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360\nFrom the side, I have no nose at all.\n\n01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.360\nI mean, you can see it when I'm facing you.\n\n01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360\nBut when you go to the side, I have no profile.\n\n01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360\nNow, when you picture Sherlock Holmes,\n\n01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.360\ndo you picture one of the actors from the films?\n\n01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.360\nNo, I picture what I saw in my head when I first read the books.\n\n01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360\nWho would that look like?\n\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360\nIt doesn't look like anybody that is in any of the movies.\n\n01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360\nYeah.\n\n01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.360\nJohn Cusack.\n\n01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.360\nJohn Cusack, right.\n\n01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.360\nJohn Cusack?\n\n01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.360\nYeah.\n\n01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.360\nYeah.\n\n01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:00.360\nWhen that Sherlock Holmes movie came out with Robert Downey Jr.,\n\n01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:04.360\nI was amazed to see a sequence in that movie\n\n01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.360\nthat I had written into a script for the Heat Vision and Jack movie as a joke,\n\n01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.360\nwhich is the idea that if you can get so intelligent\n\n01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.360\nthat you can know how to beat somebody up.\n\n01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.360\nAnd I was like, that was the joke in the Heat Vision and Jack movie\n\n01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.360\nis that he would get super intelligent\n\n01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.360\nand then he'd be like, you know, describing with diagrams\n\n01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360\nthe way that he would punch people.\n\n01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.360\nAnd it's like, and then they did it for real\n\n01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.360\nand they made a lot of money.\n\n01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360\nYeah.\n\n01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360\nNobody cared.\n\n01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.360\nNobody laughed.\n\n01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360\nEveryone just went, here's my money.\n\n01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.360\nI love that he's so smart, he can beat you up.\n\n01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360\nOh, man.\n\n01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360\nYeah.\n\n01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.360\nI was introduced to Revenge of the Nerds as a camp counselor.\n\n01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.360\nI had to chaperone a bus of a bunch of kids\n\n01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.360\ngoing to compete in a soccer game,\n\n01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360\nthe sports competition,\n\n01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.360\neven though I wasn't a sports counselor.\n\n01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.360\nAnd the most jockey, most handsome counselor was like,\n\n01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360\nI got to show you guys this movie\n\n01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.360\nbecause we got to watch movies on the buses.\n\n01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.360\nSo this other counselor played Revenge of the Nerds\n\n01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.360\nand it was such a crisis of self\n\n01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360\nas an uncomfortable teenager,\n\n01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360\nall these jocks laughing at it.\n\n01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360\nAnd the entire time I was like, what did you explain to me?\n\n01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360\nIs it funny?\n\n01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360\nIs it funny because you're laughing at them?\n\n01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.360\nOr you would feel nerdy inside?\n\n01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360\nOr what's happening?\n\n01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.360\nIt was just a strange...\n\n01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360\nI remember that too.\n\n01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360\nAll the kids were kind of laughing.\n\n01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.360\nThey weren't nerds, but they loved that movie.\n\n01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.360\nThe funny thing is, over the years,\n\n01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360\nI get approached by people all the time.\n\n01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.360\nGuys on the street will come up to me\n\n01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.360\nand they are clearly jocks.\n\n01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.360\nI mean, they've got no neck.\n\n01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.360\nThey've got buzz cuts and all this\n\n01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.360\nand the muscles and everything.\n\n01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.360\nI mean, they're ridiculous.\n\n01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.360\nThey look so jocky.\n\n01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:50.360\nAnd they will come up to me and say,\n\n01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.360\nRevenge of the Nerds, right?\n\n01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.360\nAnd I go, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.360\nThat movie meant a lot to me.\n\n01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.360\nThat was what my life was.\n\n01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360\nAnd I'm saying thank you.\n\n01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360\nThank you.\n\n01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360\nIt's very nice of you.\n\n01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.360\nAnd inside I'm going, fuck you.\n\n01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.360\nYou beat up people like me.\n\n01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.360\nBut then I started thinking over time,\n\n01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.360\nI was going, you know what?\n\n01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.360\nEven within the jock world, there's a pecking order.\n\n01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.360\nAnd it's possible that the guy that I'm talking to\n\n01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.360\nwas the guy who they called Tiny.\n\n01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:27.360\nI remember doing stand-up in Michigan\n\n01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360\nand I was talking to these motorcycle guys.\n\n01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360\nThey were all super intimidating\n\n01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.360\nand I was trying to intimidate me.\n\n01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360\nAnd then there was this one guy\n\n01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.360\nand they kept calling him Cage.\n\n01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360\nThey're like, there's Cage.\n\n01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.360\nHey, Cage, you get the drinks.\n\n01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.360\nAnd Cage is like, all right.\n\n01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.360\nAnd then throughout the night,\n\n01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.360\nI was like, Cage was more available to me.\n\n01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.360\nSo I was like, so Cage, what's it like\n\n01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360\nwith this motorcycle group?\n\n01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360\nAnd he's like, well, they do this.\n\n01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360\nAnd they're like, hey, Cage, come on.\n\n01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360\nAnd he's like, fine.\n\n01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360\nAnd then they started laughing.\n\n01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.360\nAnd they're like, you don't like being called Cage, do you?\n\n01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360\nAnd he's like, no, I don't.\n\n01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.360\nAnd I was like, why don't you like being called Cage?\n\n01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360\nIt's like badass.\n\n01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.360\nAnd he's like, Cage is what you call a car.\n\n01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360\nI can't drive a motorcycle anymore.\n\n01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.360\nI drive a car.\n\n01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:20.360\nThey call cars Cage's because they're free.\n\n01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.360\nHe thought that because they called him Cage,\n\n01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.360\nhe wasn't allowed to drive a motorcycle.\n\n01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.360\nNo, no, they were teasing him.\n\n01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.360\nHis name wasn't even Cage.\n\n01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.360\nHad he lost a motorcycle license?\n\n01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360\nYeah, something had happened.\n\n01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360\nAnd he couldn't drive the motorcycle.\n\n01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.360\nAnd so they were calling him the equivalent\n\n01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.360\nof calling him lefty because he lost his right hand.\n\n01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360\nHe should have taken himself so seriously.\n\n01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360\nThe point being that they're...\n\n01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360\nNo, you're right.\n\n01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360\nThat's the same thing.\n\n01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.360\nIt's very rare for a cool jock to actually feel cool,\n\n01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360\nall the people that we think feel cool.\n\n01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360\nOr it's all a continuum in that the point is\n\n01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.360\nthat everywhere you go, there is no such thing.\n\n01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360\nThat's why the nerd movement, eventually,\n\n01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.360\nthe nerd movement, once we started,\n\n01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.360\ngave a name to feeling like the other.\n\n01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.360\nIt was only a matter of time before that would be mainstream\n\n01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360\nbecause everyone feels like the other.\n\n01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360\nThere's no one that you've talked to.\n\n01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.360\nYou go to your 20-year high school reunion.\n\n01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.360\nNobody is self-identifies as normal.\n\n01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.360\nNobody...\n\n01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:19.360\nNo.\n\n01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.360\nThat's true.\n\n01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360\nThere's a bunch of people that you thought picked on you\n\n01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360\nand that were all represented the normal people.\n\n01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.360\nAnd within them, they were chewing each other to pieces,\n\n01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.360\nwhich is what we learned from Molly Ringwald\n\n01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360\nand Breakfast Club.\n\n01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360\nIt's hard to be...\n\n01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.360\nThere's also a pride in what...\n\n01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.360\nI guess in the nerd community is that it does worship intelligence.\n\n01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.360\nIt worships knowledge, information.\n\n01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.360\nIt worships efficacy, yeah.\n\n01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360\nAnd it's obsession.\n\n01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.360\nIt's obsession.\n\n01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.360\nYou acquire...\n\n01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.360\nEven if you're not a PhD,\n\n01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.360\nyou've acquired vast amounts of knowledge\n\n01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.360\nabout whatever you are interested in.\n\n01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360\nAbout at least one specific thing.\n\n01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360\nWhen you were saying something about the...\n\n01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.360\nWhat's the comic book guy doing when you've got PhDs?\n\n01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.360\nWell, the comic book guy, if you get him into a room with a PhD,\n\n01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.360\nis going to be able to whoop the PhD on comic book information.\n\n01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.360\nSo that makes that person intelligent in that way.\n\n01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.360\nAnd that's...\n\n01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.360\nEverybody's got their thing,\n\n01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.360\nand when nerds become obsessive about something,\n\n01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.360\nthey become brilliant.\n\n01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360\nHave you ever played any...\n\n01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360\nShould I stop talking a while?\n\n01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.360\nAm I still talking?\n\n01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.360\nCurtis, have you ever played any role-playing games?\n\n01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.360\nIt is.\n\n01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.360\nYou ask such interesting questions.\n\n01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360\nShe doesn't mean sexually.\n\n01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360\nShe means like D&D.\n\n01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360\nI'm not sure now.\n\n01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.360\nHave you ever broken in as a sexy burglar?\n\n01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360\nEvery question she's asked me,\n\n01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360\nI've had to have a follow-up,\n\n01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360\nbecause I'm not sure how to answer them.\n\n01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360\nRole-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons?\n\n01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.360\nNo.\n\n01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.360\nWell, you're gonna...\n\n01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.360\nYou're about to right now.\n\n01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.360\nYou're about to play a game called Shadow Run.\n\n01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360\nOkay.\n\n01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.360\nAlright, so Spencer is our Game Master.\n\n01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.360\nCan I just ask, so earlier when you said,\n\n01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360\ndo I have a heart out?\n\n01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360\nYou said no.\n\n01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.360\nAnd I said no.\n\n01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.360\nI remember that.\n\n01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360\nIf I had said yes,\n\n01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360\nthen I wouldn't have had this heart out.\n\n01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360\nYou were answering this question, yeah.\n\n01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360\nOkay.\n\n01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360\nYou would be gone right now.\n\n01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360\nI'd be home by now.\n\n01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.360\nI like that you thought I just asked you if you role-play.\n\n01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.360\nCurtis, do you role-play?\n\n01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.360\nYou said, do you play role-playing games?\n\n01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.360\nAlso, you asked him if he had sex with women.\n\n01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.360\nYeah, that's right.\n\n01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.360\nI have put myself into this.\n\n01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.360\nSo you have asked a couple of questionable questions.\n\n01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360\nThat's true.\n\n01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360\nBut you've been talking.\n\n01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.360\nWait a minute.\n\n01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.360\nYou know what?\n\n01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.360\nIf this means I have to read something,\n\n01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360\nyou may be out of luck, pal.\n\n01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:49.360\nOh, well, yeah.\n\n01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.360\nOh, no, I can probably read this.\n\n01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360\nWell, you need like glasses or...\n\n01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.360\nI mean, I never know what's going on in these pages.\n\n01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.360\nAlright.\n\n01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360\nYou can fake it.\n\n01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.360\nI don't know if I can fake it.\n\n01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.360\nI may have to have somebody get my glasses from the other room.\n\n01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.360\nOh, that's easy.\n\n01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.360\nCan you do that?\n\n01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360\nCan you have somebody do that?\n\n01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.360\nI'll find them.\n\n01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.360\nThey're in my coat.\n\n01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.360\nThey're in my coat.\n\n01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.360\nThey're in his coat.\n\n01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.360\nIs there anything else in your coat I should know about\n\n01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:13.360\nbefore I go through your coat?\n\n01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360\nNo, and there better not be anything in my coat\n\n01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.360\nwhen I put it on later.\n\n01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.360\nI'm not gross.\n\n01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:31.360\nI'm not gross.\n\n01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.360\nSee, this coat is called children's porn, so...\n\n01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.360\nWait a minute.\n\n01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:41.360\nNot porn of children, but porn that's owned by children.\n\n01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360\nPorn that children would make if they...\n\n01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360\nIf you said, hey, make a porn movie.\n\n01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.360\nIt's like a crayon and a donut.\n\n01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:55.360\nAnd they just go on a donut slide together.\n\n01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.360\nNew zine idea.\n\n01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360\nThank you.\n\n01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.360\nOkay, so...\n\n01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360\nIt's just...\n\n01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360\nThis is...\n\n01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.360\nYour character has been handed to you.\n\n01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360\nIt's a lot of...\n\n01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.360\nIt's a lot of little scrawly writing,\n\n01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.360\nlittle statistics and things.\n\n01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.360\nThey won't come into play unless you're asked.\n\n01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.360\nEssentially what it is, is it's improvised storytelling\n\n01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.360\nwith Spencer is the one that's in control\n\n01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.360\nof anything that happens,\n\n01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.360\nbecause he's the game master.\n\n01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.360\nSo he's telling us what's happening,\n\n01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.360\nbut each of us is a character.\n\n01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.360\nThere's no high pressure to it,\n\n01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360\nbecause it's kind of turn-based.\n\n01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.360\nYou're not like...\n\n01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.360\nThat's taped.\n\n01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.360\nSo he's letting us know what's going on,\n\n01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:43.360\nand then there's a point where we can do something.\n\n01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.360\nYou can say, oh, I walk up the street,\n\n01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.360\nor I go over to the vending machine,\n\n01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.360\nand I punch it, or whatever you want to do.\n\n01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.360\nAnd then Spencer, who's the referee\n\n01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.360\nand who understands the rules to the game,\n\n01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.360\nhe might say to you, what's your agility?\n\n01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360\nAnd it's okay that it takes a half hour for you to go.\n\n01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.360\nIt's three, because you find it somewhere on the sheet,\n\n01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.360\nand you go, it's three.\n\n01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360\nAnd that's basically how it goes.\n\n01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.360\nYour agility.\n\n01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.360\nThat's an example, yeah.\n\n01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.360\nThat's the question that's often asked me\n\n01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.360\nthat I never have the answer to immediately.\n\n01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:16.360\nSo in brief, like broad strokes, you're playing...\n\n01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360\nYou mean attribute.\n\n01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.360\nYour attribute.\n\n01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.360\nYou said agility, but you meant attribute.\n\n01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360\nWell, I was using...\n\n01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.360\nI was riffing an example, yes, of an attribute.\n\n01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.360\nAgility, for instance.\n\n01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.360\nYes, I was...\n\n01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.360\nI'm not stupid.\n\n01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360\nI was looking for...\n\n01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.360\nI'm sorry, but I was looking for agility,\n\n01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.360\nthe list of possible things for agility,\n\n01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.360\nand there's no agility.\n\n01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.360\nThere's attributes.\n\n01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360\nThere's attributes, and then one of the attributes is agility.\n\n01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360\nI was just...\n\n01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.360\nAs an example.\n\n01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360\nThe second attribute down is agility.\n\n01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360\nOh, agility, yeah.\n\n01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.360\nI've never thought of...\n\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360\nAgility as an attribute?\n\n01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360\nAgility as an attribute.\n\n01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360\nNever mind.\n\n01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.360\nOkay.\n\n01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.360\nAll right, so Spencer, do you want to briefly fill Curtis in\n\n01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.360\non what his character is for the evening?\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360\nYour character is a doctor.\n\n01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.360\nHe has a gun.\n\n01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.360\nHe could heal people.\n\n01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360\nDid you say he has a gun?\n\n01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360\nYeah, like...\n\n01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.360\nOkay.\n\n01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.360\nLike a doctor.\n\n01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360\nStupid me.\n\n01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.360\nI'm just...\n\n01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.360\nYou guys are criminals.\n\n01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.360\nHe has a gun.\n\n01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.360\nThou might do some harm.\n\n01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.360\nRight, exactly.\n\n01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360\nOkay.\n\n01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360\nYeah, you guys are criminals.\n\n01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:28.360\nYou do missions for, you know, criminal employers.\n\n01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.360\nOh, so not a medical doctor.\n\n01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:31.360\nHe's...\n\n01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.360\nHe's like a doctor...\n\n01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.360\nLike doctor...\n\n01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360\nDoctor...\n\n01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.360\nEvil.\n\n01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.360\nIt's like bull.\n\n01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.360\nYou're like a street doctor.\n\n01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.360\nYou work with criminals, and when criminals need medical help,\n\n01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360\nyou're the one that comes and passes them.\n\n01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.360\nOh, I'm the guy.\n\n01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.360\nOh, I'm that guy.\n\n01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.360\nYou're like a mob doctor.\n\n01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360\nOkay, I'm the mob doctor.\n\n01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.360\nAnd it's the future.\n\n01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.360\nWe're kind of like the A-team.\n\n01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.360\nIt's the future.\n\n01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.360\nThis is like 70 years in the future or so,\n\n01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.360\nand we're kind of like the A-team.\n\n01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.360\nWe're a bunch of like...\n\n01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.360\nOkay.\n\n01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.360\nYou know, we're specialists in certain ways.\n\n01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.360\nDan's very strong.\n\n01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360\nAaron's very charming and charismatic\n\n01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:02.360\nand can talk away in and out of situations.\n\n01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.360\nI'm a magic user, so I can cast spells and shit like that.\n\n01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:10.360\nSo right now, we're looking for a guy named Baldwin Brown,\n\n01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.360\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360\nYeah.\n\n01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.360\nAnd we're trying to capture this guy\n\n01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.360\nand bring him back to our contact.\n\n01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.360\nSo, Spencer, if you would, why don't you give us the brief...\n\n01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360\nHow do you do this?\n\n01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.360\nAnd catch us up to date, please.\n\n01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.360\nAll right.\n\n01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.360\nLast time on Shadowrun.\n\n01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.360\nOur heroes were in the warehouse looking for Baldwin Brown,\n\n01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.360\nbut he was nowhere to be found.\n\n01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:42.360\nSo together, our heroes tased a bunch of junkies\n\n01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.360\nand then slapped them away and then asked them questions\n\n01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.360\nand then shoved RFID tags into their stomachs.\n\n01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:55.360\nEve sent off a, you know, hawk spirit to find Baldwin,\n\n01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:58.360\nbut he would not return in some time.\n\n01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.360\nTogether, the heroes gathered up the illicit merchandise\n\n01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:08.360\nand headed off towards the neutral drop zone.\n\n01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.360\nThat's all.\n\n01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360\nAll clear.\n\n01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.360\nPretty...\n\n01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.360\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.360\nYep.\n\n01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360\nSo pretty cut and dry there.\n\n01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360\nYep.\n\n01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.360\nDid we...\n\n01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.360\nI can't remember, did we...\n\n01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.360\nDid we...\n\n01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360\nWe took a truck, right?\n\n01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360\nThe ladies are driving.\n\n01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.360\nYou're in a truck.\n\n01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nThe fellas are in the back.\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.360\nThe quarter guards are driving.\n\n01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.360\nYeah.\n\n01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360\nAnd we're meeting up with our Johnson.\n\n01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.360\nOkay.\n\n01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.360\nAnd Curtis's character, the doctor,\n\n01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360\nwe haven't encountered him yet, right?\n\n01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360\nOh, he's been there.\n\n01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.360\nOh, so you happen to have him.\n\n01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.360\nSo we don't have horticard.\n\n01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.360\nAnd so I'm in the back of the truck with you,\n\n01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360\nJim Nightblade, who is Dan.\n\n01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360\nAnd Dr...\n\n01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.360\nDr. Friend.\n\n01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.360\nDr. Friend.\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.360\nDr. Friend.\n\n01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:52.360\nDr. Friend, up in the front maybe with Mercy, right?\n\n01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.360\nWherever he wants to be, man.\n\n01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.360\nWell, which is it?\n\n01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.360\nWhat part of the truck do you want to be in the back of the semi?\n\n01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.360\nLike...\n\n01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360\nNo, I want to be shotgun.\n\n01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360\nOkay.\n\n01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360\nYou're shotgun.\n\n01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.360\nI mean, it seems appropriate.\n\n01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.360\nWhat's your agility?\n\n01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:08.360\nMy agility is four.\n\n01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.360\nAll right.\n\n01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.360\nJust checking.\n\n01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360\nJust checking.\n\n01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360\nThat's good.\n\n01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.360\nThat's good time.\n\n01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.360\nAll right.\n\n01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.360\nSo we're...\n\n01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.360\nAnd that's four out of ten?\n\n01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.360\nI think it maxed out like 15 or something.\n\n01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360\nOh, 15.\n\n01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.360\nYeah.\n\n01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.360\nWe're new at...\n\n01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.360\nI should be more than four then.\n\n01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.360\nBut anyway.\n\n01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.360\nWe're just starting out.\n\n01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.360\nIt's your game.\n\n01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.360\nNo, you're a troll also.\n\n01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.360\nYou're not like a human.\n\n01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.360\nYou're a troll.\n\n01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:37.360\nOf course.\n\n01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360\nI should have mentioned that.\n\n01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.360\nA Dr. Gangster troll.\n\n01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.360\nYeah.\n\n01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.360\nOkay.\n\n01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:47.360\nIt sounds like a Curtis Armstrong part, actually.\n\n01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.360\nAll right.\n\n01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:52.360\nThrough my comm link, we all have a little...\n\n01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.360\nWe can all communicate to each other through comm links.\n\n01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.360\nI say to Mercy.\n\n01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.360\nMercy, where are we headed?\n\n01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.360\nWe're heading to...\n\n01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.360\nWe're going to the Johnson, right?\n\n01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360\nYeah.\n\n01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.360\nSweet.\n\n01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.360\nWe're going to the Johnson.\n\n01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:07.360\nI still have this photograph of Brian.\n\n01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.360\nBaldwin.\n\n01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360\nBaldwin.\n\n01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.360\nOf Baldwin standing in front of a bathroom.\n\n01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.360\nSo I'm looking at that.\n\n01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.360\nWe're headed to the Johnson.\n\n01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.360\nI don't like any of it.\n\n01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.360\nYou've been a problem this whole time, friend.\n\n01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.360\nI can't go against my training.\n\n01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.360\nOkay, friend.\n\n01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:33.360\nI've been trying to help as much as I can, but I have to remember I am a doctor.\n\n01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.360\nAll right.\n\n01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.360\nRespect your integrity.\n\n01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:41.360\nHow long does it take?\n\n01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.360\nIt's not integrity.\n\n01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360\nI've sold myself.\n\n01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:51.360\nI've sold myself to you people.\n\n01:36:51.360 --> 01:37:02.360\nAnd if it wasn't for him knowing what he knows, I'd walk away from all of this.\n\n01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.360\nHey, Nightblade.\n\n01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360\nYeah, what the fuck's going on, Nightblade?\n\n01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.360\nWhat do you got in this guy?\n\n01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.360\nWhat are you holding over his head?\n\n01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.360\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360\nWe're a crew, Nightblade.\n\n01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.360\nI don't want any blackmail happening behind our backs.\n\n01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.360\nThis has got to be about trust.\n\n01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.360\nIt's not about blackmail.\n\n01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.360\nIt's about friendship and trust.\n\n01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.360\nSomething you guys wouldn't know about.\n\n01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.360\nWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\n\n01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.360\nAsk a friend.\n\n01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.360\nAll right, doctor.\n\n01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.360\nWhy don't you patch up your relationship while we get to the Johnson?\n\n01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360\nListen, doctor, I'll tell you one thing right now.\n\n01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360\nLife on the sprawl is all about secrets.\n\n01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.360\nIt's all about selling yourself.\n\n01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.360\nIf we had our way, we wouldn't be committing crimes for a living, believe me.\n\n01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:47.360\nYou know, I could always tell, you're different from them.\n\n01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:50.360\nYou are.\n\n01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.360\nYou don't have to be here.\n\n01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.360\nI don't want...\n\n01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360\nYou could do better than this.\n\n01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.360\nI'm a magic elf that is trained to use magic by Native Americans.\n\n01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.360\nOh, come on, man.\n\n01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360\nI'm a girl.\n\n01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.360\nI'm a girl.\n\n01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360\nI'm a girl.\n\n01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.360\nMagic female elf.\n\n01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.360\nWoman, for God's sake.\n\n01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.360\nYou're more than that.\n\n01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\n01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.360\nJust go back and hide in the woods and do what?\n\n01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.360\nI got to make a living somehow.\n\n01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:22.360\nShh, they're coming.\n\n01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:24.360\nDoctor, doctor, who's coming?\n\n01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.360\nWho's coming?\n\n01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.360\nDoctor, who's coming?\n\n01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.360\nPull over the car!\n\n01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360\nPull over the car!\n\n01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360\nCan we pull over the car?\n\n01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.360\nYeah, horticard.\n\n01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.360\nI'm not driving.\n\n01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.360\nYou're going to have to pull over the car.\n\n01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.360\nStop.\n\n01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.360\nHorticard does that.\n\n01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.360\nHorticard's driving.\n\n01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.360\nSorry.\n\n01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.360\nHey, doctor, real quick.\n\n01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.360\nYeah.\n\n01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360\nI'm not going to forget what you said.\n\n01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360\nWe'll have to talk later.\n\n01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.360\nOkay.\n\n01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.360\nWe can all hear you.\n\n01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:52.360\nI pulled over the car so you could talk privately, but I guess it doesn't matter.\n\n01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.360\nSkip back on the road.\n\n01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.360\nOkay, let's put it.\n\n01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.360\nYou just had us pull over.\n\n01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:56.360\nI know.\n\n01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.360\nI know.\n\n01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360\nI know.\n\n01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360\nI'm flustered.\n\n01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.360\nWe'd get there faster if we didn't keep pulling over.\n\n01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360\nI'll just say that.\n\n01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360\nWell, he said they're coming.\n\n01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360\nWho's coming?\n\n01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.360\nI guess it doesn't make sense that I pulled over if someone's coming.\n\n01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360\nThey're coming.\n\n01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.360\nLet's meet them.\n\n01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.360\nThey seem nice.\n\n01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360\nOkay, let's put a pin in this.\n\n01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360\nI don't want to invalidate your feelings.\n\n01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.360\nI will tell you the thing that I know about this guy that I have over him.\n\n01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.360\nHe thinks they're coming a lot, even when they're not.\n\n01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360\nAll right.\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.360\nThat's right.\n\n01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.360\nWhat's our ETA to the Johnson hookup?\n\n01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360\nYeah, what's our ETA to the Johnson hookup?\n\n01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.360\nOh, once we get back on the road, it'll just be a couple minutes.\n\n01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.360\nOkay.\n\n01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360\nLet's drive again.\n\n01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360\nHorticard?\n\n01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360\nOkay.\n\n01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.360\nNo, we were driving.\n\n01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360\nYou just had us pull out.\n\n01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360\nI know.\n\n01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.360\nAre they coming again?\n\n01:39:45.360 --> 01:40:01.360\nNo, it's the problem is that my thing about them coming, I lost a patient because I was\n\n01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.360\nthinking about them coming.\n\n01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360\nAll right, let's pull over.\n\n01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.360\nCan we just get to the thing?\n\n01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.360\nCan we just have one?\n\n01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:19.360\nDr. Frenn has said nothing for hours, and he waits until a crucial moment to bring up\n\n01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.360\npast issues, and I feel like we should deal with this.\n\n01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.360\nOkay, here we are.\n\n01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.360\nWe're pulling up in front of the Johnson.\n\n01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.360\nSo you enter the parking lot, which is the location of the neutral drop zone.\n\n01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:37.360\nIt's a fenced off affair squished between a number of low buildings.\n\n01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.360\nThe fence is covered in chains, but it stands wide open.\n\n01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:46.360\nCars and trucks lined the street outside the parking lot and broken damaged buildings\n\n01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.360\nlined the sky.\n\n01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.360\nSome of the buildings are lit up by orange light.\n\n01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.360\nNo one is in the lot that you can see, but it's where you're supposed to meet.\n\n01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:05.360\nI've got a bad feeling about this.\n\n01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.360\nWait, are you doing your moonlighting impression?\n\n01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.360\nWhat is that?\n\n01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.360\nI've got a bad feeling about this.\n\n01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360\nCome out to the coast and have a few laughs.\n\n01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:21.360\nCurtis, just so you know, Dan's character is strongly influenced by Bruce

now, I've been in the back of a truck like garbage.\n\n01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:30.360\nAlright, you hop out of the trailer in the parking lot, the location of the neutral drop zone.\n\n01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:36.360\nYou don't see anything around other than tons of cars and trucks that are just in the lot parked.\n\n01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.360\nThey lie still.\n\n01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.360\nIs

I'm going to cast a spell on him.\n\n01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.360\nAlright, what do you want to cast?\n\n01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:16.360\nHe's now unable to do anything and we can take our time to figure out what our next move is.\n\n01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:27.360\nI can do that because I have a level 5 spell casting.\n\n01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.360\nAnd then these are your spells.\n\n01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.360\nOh, yeah. Oh, these are the spells.\n\n01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.360\nYou don't have spell making up.\n\n01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.360\nHe has level 3 UCB spell.\n\n01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.360\nOh, these are my things.\n\n01:43:41.360 --> 01:44:05.360\nAlright, there I've created a dome or wall of magical energy.\n\n01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:11.360\nWe have to think fast. I don't know how long I can hold it.\n\n01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.360\nDoctor, what is the wall between us and what?\n\n01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.360\nIt's between us and him, whatever he is.\n\n01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.360\nAlright, I run up to the hotel, the hotel.\n\n01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:30.360\nI run up to the wall and I use my perception to see if the person with their motives are.\n\n01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:37.360\nWho is he? What is he? What are his motives?\n\n01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.360\nThis guy's a really good doctor.\n\n01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.360\nHe's a very good doctor.\n\n01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:49.360\nYou don't see anything beyond the wall other than a truck, like a semi-truck.\n\n01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:54.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:44:54.360 --> 01:45:00.360\nI'm so happy.\n\n01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.360\nWhere's the truck that the guy's in? I'll go check it out.\n\n01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.360\nHorticard points at it.\n\n01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360\nI walk in that direction.\n\n01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:15.360\nAs you walk, you see lights from the trucks flick on, flanking your path,\n\n01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360\nlighting up the entire lot.\n\n01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:23.360\nThe truck you're walking towards, the door clicks open and you see a dapper figure emerge.\n\n01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:29.360\nIt's a khaki suit wearing orc with a data jack in the side of his head and a monocle.\n\n01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.360\nHe's holding a metal briefcase.\n\n01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:36.360\nOh, no.\n\n01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.360\nMercy, go up there and do your thing.\n\n01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.360\nCan I sprint up to where Jim is?\n\n01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.360\nAlright, I'm going to use negotiation.\n\n01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.360\nAlright.\n\n01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:49.360\nHey, handsome.\n\n01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:52.360\nIt's good to finally meet you in person.\n\n01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.360\nIt is great to meet you too.\n\n01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:57.360\nI assume that you are this Johnson we're all talking about.\n\n01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.360\nOh, yeah.

That dome?\n\n01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.360\nI got to say, it's a bit alarming.\n\n01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:16.360\nWell, the thing that our crew does, some crews just go around and they just talk to people,\n\n01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360\nbut we show what we can do.\n\n01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.360\nHe's a doctor with a rich past.\n\n01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.360\nYeah, and he may also be going through a very messy divorce.\n\n01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.360\nWe're not sure.\n\n01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:34.360\nBut so, we do not have...\n\n01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.360\nBaldwin Brown.\n\n01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.360\nYeah, we do not have old BB.\n\n01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.360\nAnd I was wondering if maybe we could have a little more time.\n\n01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:48.360\nI do have a very good lead.\n\n01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360\nWell, what's the lead?\n\n01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:57.360\nWell, I produce the picture.\n\n01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.360\nLooks like it was just taken from his Instagram account.\n\n01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:04.360\nYes, here's the thing.\n\n01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.360\nA lot of people wouldn't look at this.\n\n01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:11.360\nAnd as we all know, there are only so many bathrooms in the city.\n\n01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.360\nI think that we should have a little bit more time.\n\n01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.360\nAnd if you need some more convincing,\n\n01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.360\nwhy don't I show you what my old friend, Dr. Friend, can do spell-wise?\n\n01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.360\nTake it away, Dr. Friend!\n\n01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:28.360\nAgony!

later.\n\n01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.360\nAll right.\n\n01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.360\nHe hands you the cred stick.\n\n01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:41.360\n250, thank you.\n\n01:51:41.360 -->

01:52:06.360\nIt shouldn't be, in the future, we shouldn't be advancing to bigger.\n\n01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:08.360\nWe should be shrinking.\n\n01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.360\nThank you for

a giant stick.\n\n01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360\nNo, I know.\n\n01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.360\nA memory stick.\n\n01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.360\nNo, I got it.\n\n01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.360\nI can't, Curtis, this is Aaron talking.\n\n01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:35.360\nI have a hard time remembering the name for the cell phone and the money ying ying.\n\n01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.360\nYeah.\n\n01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.360\nOkay.\n\n01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.360\nNew yin.\n\n01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:39.360\nNew yin.\n\n01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.360\nNew yin.\n\n01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.360\nYeah.\n\n01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.360\nSee.\n\n01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.360\nAll right.\n\n01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360\nYou hear the cry of sirens.\n\n01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:45.360\nThey're close.\n\n01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.360\nToo close.\n\n01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:47.360\nIt's the cops.\n\n01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.360\nJackson's like, what the hell?\n\n01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360\nThey must have bugged the merchandise.\n\n01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.360\nOh, shit.\n\n01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.360\nToo late.\n\n01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.360\nWe got to take the credit sticks and run everybody.\n\n01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.360\nYeah.\n\n01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.360\nWe'll be back.\n\n01:52:58.360 --> 01:52:59.360\nSon of bitches.\n\n01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.360\nThey run.\n\n01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:01.360\nSorry.\n\n01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.360\nHe's just used sons of bitches.\n\n01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.360\nGo ahead.\n\n01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:05.360\nWait, what?\n\n01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.360\nAre you not satisfied?\n\n01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.360\nOh, it sounded like you guys were running away.\n\n01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:11.360\nWell, we are running away, but you can run too.\n\n01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.360\nWe're not doing anything wrong to you, right?\n\n01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:18.360\nI got a whole truckload of goods to move immediately.\n\n01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:20.360\nIt's a situation on my hands.\n\n01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.360\nYou want to pay us to help you with that situation?\n\n01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.360\nUh-huh.\n\n01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360\nNo.\n\n01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.360\nNightblade, are you high?\n\n01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.360\nHe's not part of our group.\n\n01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:31.360\nHe's a customer.\n\n01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:35.360\nHe's the guy that we're going to go off and do the job, and he's dissatisfied.\n\n01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.360\nWe're walking away, and he's calling us assholes.\n\n01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:38.360\nWhat?\n\n01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.360\nYou worked at Radio Shack, and the manager had a problem.\n\n01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.360\nWould you leave your family to burn?\n\n01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.360\nI made a lot of sense.\n\n01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.360\nHortegaard.\n\n01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.360\nHortegaard, is there a dark area nearby where we can hide where the cops don't find us?\n\n01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.360\nProbably, just statistically.\n\n01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.360\nEve, can you ask for an eagle?\n\n01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.360\nCan I cast invisibility over all of us and make us and the truck disappear?\n\n01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.360\nNot the truck.\n\n01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:06.360\nYou could do it on people, but it's going to take some drains.\n\n01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:10.360\nI could also use phantasm and create some other thing to distract the cops.\n\n01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.360\nI could make some other thing happen far away that makes the cops go somewhere else to buy us some time.\n\n01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.360\nYou could?\n\n01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:17.360\nOh.\n\n01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.360\nAll right.\n\n01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.360\nSo how close are the cops?\n\n01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:21.360\nOh, they're going to be here in a couple minutes.\n\n01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.360\nA couple minutes.\n\n01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:24.360\nJonathan, do you want out of this problem?\n\n01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.360\nMaybe, but only for very cheap.\n\n01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.360\nName a price?\n\n01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.360\n700.\n\n01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:34.360\n700 for each person that risks their life?\n\n01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:35.360\nNo.\n\n01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.360\nJust to solve the situation.\n\n01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.360\nAll right, see you.\n\n01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.360\nWhat kind of race?\n\n01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.360\nLet's go.\n\n01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.360\nThe guy's like, you sons of bitches.\n\n01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.360\nYeah, but you got no right to say that anymore.\n\n01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.360\nYou had an opportunity.\n\n01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:53.360\nLike, tell your accountant, you know, see you.\n\n01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.360\nI go towards the street where the cops are coming.\n\n01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.360\nI can hear where the street where they're going to be coming from, right?\n\n01:54:58.360 --> 01:54:59.360\nRight.\n\n01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.360\nAnd I say, everybody, get in the truck, get ready to get the hell out of here.\n\n01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.360\nI'm going to create a phantasm to scare the hell out of these cops.\n\n01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:07.360\nWhen it starts, we have to get the hell out of here and go the other direction.\n\n01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.360\nJonathan, you want to come with us or do you want out?\n\n01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:10.360\nWell, I need that truck.\n\n01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.360\nI mean.\n\n01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.360\nYes, we'll all get in the truck together with the merchandise and we'll go somewhere else and get away from these cops.\n\n01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.360\nI'll drive the truck.\n\n01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360\nSounds good.\n\n01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.360\nAll right.\n\n01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.360\nJonathan likes it.\n\n01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.360\nI can just say that they're medical supplies if the police stop me.\n\n01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.360\nAll right.\n\n01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.360\nYou guys, everybody in the truck, I'm going to try this.\n\n01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360\nWe only got one shot at this, you guys.\n\n01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:29.360\nAnd also our show is about to be over, so this has to count.\n\n01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.360\nAll right.\n\n01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:31.360\nAll right, let's go.\n\n01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:32.360\nAll right.\n\n01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.360\nThe truck rolls out of the parking lot.\n\n01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:35.360\nOkay.\n\n01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:45.360\nI go out into the streets and I touch my red feather earring and I summon all the magic of my training,\n\n01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.360\nmy elven upbringing, and my Native American tribes.\n\n01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.360\nAnd I summon a spirit.\n\n01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:58.360\nI summon a 20-foot-tall flaming gorilla to stand in the middle of the streets.\n\n01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.360\nAnd just start freaking out in front of the cop cars.\n\n01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.360\nNot only is it a giant gorilla, it's also angry.\n\n01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.360\nNo.\n\n01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.360\nThis is a flaming gorilla that means business.\n\n01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.360\nBut it's only a phantasm.\n\n01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.360\nIt can't really hurt him.\n\n01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.360\nIt's just going to scare these cops.\n\n01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.360\nAnd I cast it as a level five.\n\n01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360\nAll right, that's a little fun.\n\n01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:21.360\nLevel five flaming gorilla, middle of the road, freaking out.\n\n01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.360\nAll right.\n\n01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:29.360\nIt appears to me I could have done the barrier here.\n\n01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:32.360\nBut I feel like I've already done it and now it's not going to work.\n\n01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:33.360\nYou kind of shot your what?\n\n01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.360\nYou shot your what?\n\n01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:35.360\nI shot it.\n\n01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:36.360\nThis would be the perfect time for it.\n\n01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:40.360\nIf I'd known this is where we were going, I would have waited on the barrier for now.\n\n01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.360\nWe should have given you the script.\n\n01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:43.360\nWe're right at it.\n\n01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.360\nThis is the problem.\n\n01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:45.360\nHey, don't get the script.\n\n01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.360\nYou don't know what to do.\n\n01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.360\nDoctor, remember before when you told me that I'm bigger than this and there's more to me than this?\n\n01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:50.360\nYes.\n\n01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.360\nI think that we're all learning something today and that you're going to use to harness this ability\n\n01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:56.360\nand know when to time it better next time.\n\n01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.360\nAnd to use it for good.\n\n01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.360\nYes.\n\n01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.360\nLevel five gorilla.\n\n01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.360\nA gorilla sprouts up.\n\n01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:04.360\nHe's 20 feet tall.\n\n01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:09.360\nHe's beating his chest, which is on fire.\n\n01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.360\nHe's mean in business.\n\n01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:13.360\nAnd you guys scoot off into the night.\n\n01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:16.360\nScoot.\n\n01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.360\nIf there's any cops following you, they make no indication.\n\n01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.360\n20 minutes later, your, your eagle friend goes, hey, I found Baldwin.\n\n01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.360\nYou're not going to like it though.\n\n01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:27.360\nWhy not?\n\n01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.360\nHe's in a business building.\n\n01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.360\nI mean, he's in a building.\n\n01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.360\nGod damn it.\n\n01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:36.360\nThat's our kryptonite.\n\n01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:42.360\nAre you saying there's a roof and walls and there's some sort of organization inside that makes money?\n\n01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.360\nYeah.\n\n01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.360\nIt's a telepathic link.\n\n01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.360\nYou guys, it looks like we're going to have to get Baldwin.\n\n01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.360\nWhich, which business?\n\n01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.360\nEagle.\n\n01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.360\nOh, I don't, I don't know.\n\n01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:02.360\nSo you, you truly thought we weren't going to like that he was in a business?\n\n01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.360\nOh, wait, no, I, you're not going to like the defense mechanisms around the business.\n\n01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:12.360\nOh, what are they?\n\n01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.360\nOh, they got magical barriers.\n\n01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.360\nSounds like me.\n\n01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:22.360\nThat sounds like a case for the magical barrier doctor to come in.\n\n01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.360\nCliff Hanger.\n\n01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.360\nWait a minute.\n\n01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:32.360\nCurtis Armstrong will be back next week to reprise his role as the, as the astraly projecting doctor.\n\n01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.360\nThank you all for coming.\n\n01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:35.360\nErin Mcgathy.\n\n01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.360\nThank you.\n\n01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.360\nThank you.\n\n01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.360\nThank you.\n\n01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.360\nThank you.\n\n01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:43.360\nErin Mcgathy Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:44.360\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:46.360\nThank you everyone here at Meltdown Comics.\n\n01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.360\nYour mayor everybody, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:58:48.360 --> 01:59:00.360\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:18.360\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[186276]}
