00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, hello, hello from Meltdown Convicts in Hollywood, California.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown,

00:20.000 --> 00:36.000
and Harmontown.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Thank you.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
I've been kind of haunted by when Dino was on the show

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
and he kind of watched the show through his eyes

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
and at one point he's like,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
why are these people here?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Why do they come here?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
It was a valid question.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
So now I'm kind of like,

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm back to my old nervous self,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
like I want to put on a good show.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So that's probably a good energy to be in, right?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
That's good. Always be prepared to give people what they want.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
It was just not to say that I don't have anything to talk about.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
So we adopted a, Aaron and I adopted a new dog.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Our therapist then told us we had adopted a grief dog,

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
because we had adopted it moments after our friend OD.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And I didn't do the math until that moment.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I was like, I guess we have a grief dog.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I guess this wasn't a responsible decision.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
But we got this little tiny dog through some rescue service

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
from some guy that found it in a box on the street or whatever.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
And it's like this little mix of terrier

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
and a bunch of other things that make it not breathe properly

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
but snore adorably.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
It's smaller than my cat,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
but it won't stop humping Harvey.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
And it loves Harvey,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
and it's like Harvey loves it and they're very happy together.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And then it's just like, there's nothing,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
why are dogs humping things so funny to us?

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
As primates, we're the most awkward humpers

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
you would think in the animal kingdom.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Other animals are kind of designed to do that.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
But then when you look at a little dog humping a big dog's elbow

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
and they're like the expression on their face

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
when they're looking at anything other than...

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
I think it's because we're kind of Heisenberg-ing that experiment.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
They're looking at you generally.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
You're in the room and they kind of make weird eye contact with you

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
while they're humping you.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And that's no fun for anybody.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
So anyways, he's a little guy and he's not...

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Were you motivated?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Did you say we should go rescue a dog in your grief

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
or did that dog come to you somehow?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
No, I feel like I, a long time ago,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
was like Harvey should have a companion

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
because I think that he's a livable guy

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
and we get a lot out of him,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
but I also feel like every time he encounters another dog,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
he's so happy.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
It's just the thought of when we left the house,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
if there was another dog there that you could hang out with,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
it was just very cartoonish thinking.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
And then there was also that karmic thinking of,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
we got Harvey from a breeder.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
He's our little buttermilk, silver spoon,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
little biological child that we bred

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
with our little white penis parts.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
And I always, I was always like,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
we gotta go get ourselves a fucking, you know,

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
a little scrapper to make up for it.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
It's a grief and a guilt dog at the same time.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, it's a guilt dog on behalf of the animal lovers of the world,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
like the people that would otherwise say,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
you killed a dog when you brought Harvey home.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So is anybody currently at home with those dogs right now,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
or is it just a giant dog fuckfest going on?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Well, we're crate training Nigel,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
which is the name of our little Nigel.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
We're crate training him.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Is there an origin story for the name of Nigel?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
No, I just, we were trying to,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
we were gonna go with Willem because he looks like Willem Dafoe,

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
but I don't know, I just, we were getting in the car

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and then I just instinctively kind of called him Nigel

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
as I was like, come here Nigel and whatever.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It's become a morning show.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Our show's a morning show now.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Soon we'll have equipment, I'll bring up photos,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I'll show you my dog photos,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
and then maybe I'll have a baby by then

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
and I'll bring up that.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm not saying no one's pregnant.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I think it's famous New England clam chatter.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Mr. Nibbles is coming out,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
but I'm very excited about our guest.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I was just, I was talking to him in the green room

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
and it just turned into the show.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I skipped through the green room because I was a little bit late

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
and didn't have time, but just managed to see our guest

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
and I'm very excited.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I always have a rule, like I try not to talk to the guest,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
like I just stare at them and fold my arms.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I don't talk to them, like if they're coming in,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
because I'm a bad interviewer and a bad,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
so I want whatever energy I have,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
like whatever I want to talk to them about,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't want to have to like,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
but I just started talking to them about all the stuff.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So no show tonight and it's bad.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
If you see us talking about anything interesting,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
it's the second time through.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
All the answers are prepared.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
My enthusiasm for this guy is like many, many, many layers.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But I think we should just bring him out right away.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I don't think I have anything to talk about.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm miserable at work. I'm trying very hard to make season 6 good.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Why don't we talk about that for a little moment?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Why don't you unburden yourself of that just to get things...

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm just very behind schedule. It's all my fault.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I just, from the very get-go,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
they finally gave me enough rope to hang myself.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I don't have anybody to complain about.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I have this giant corporation in Yahoo that just loves the show.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
They're going to advertise the fuck out of it.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Everything is beautiful and wonderful.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Everyone's on my side and so, of course, I'm going to self-destruct.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Is it as simple as you don't have an enemy above you

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
that you dislike and hate and fear?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I believe that's the case.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I think that I need to feel like I'm supposed to clean my room

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
so that me not cleaning my room is entertainment.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
But now this is just going to be a show about a dirty room.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
It's not going to make any sense.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Why did you clean up your room?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I don't know.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
No, it's not that bad.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm just worried about it all the time.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I don't have anything to gauge it by.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Aren't you always behind schedule and worried at the same time?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I think it's unprecedented this time.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Just the first episode, I was like,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I put us way behind schedule the first episode.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
It wasn't like I knew how to do the first episode.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
It was like I didn't and then I just kept delaying that.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
So everything is just delayed all the time.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Is it like Tootsie where people are getting pages?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, it's exactly like Tootsie.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Before you finish your question,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
in any way that you could mean that, it's exactly like Tootsie.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I've never seen Tootsie. I don't know.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Tootsie is based on a soap opera.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
And we do shoot community right now is being shot like a soap opera.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes, there are these actors who have these characters that they understand

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
that come in and they do not know what they're doing

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
and they're handed pages for the next scene

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
and they look at them and they learn them during rehearsal.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
And I mean, they should all get Emmys relative to that.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So should the prop master who then goes,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
oh, so a giant phone then?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Asshole!

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
And I'm like, yeah, sorry, I just typed it.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
And I was like, I'll start with the big phones

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
and see how I can make them bigger.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And she goes in back and she comes out with a giant phone an hour later

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and everyone's great and they all hate me

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
because if I gave them more time with material,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
they would be able to do their jobs as good as they are.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
The prop masters are unbelievable in their ability too.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
You at the last second to rewrite something and it just appear on set.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
It's unreal how they do that.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And the people that make the pants and the people that make the hats,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
two departments that you didn't know were different,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
constantly feuding with each other.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Within the wardrobe department, there's the pants department, the hat department,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
and pages will come in and I'll purposely antagonize them by saying something like,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
he has a large, trouser-shaped hat.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
Because I just like to watch him.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
No, that's not true.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
But everybody that works on that show should get a medal of honor

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
and I should be shot in the face

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
and my blood should be scraped into a vial and sent to a lab

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
so we can figure out a way to block my DNA from ever reoccurring in television

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
because all I do is hurt people.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Thank you.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
It was the one time when I was fishing for something.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And it only kind of trickled in.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
They were like, here, if this is going to...

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
They were like, we agree, go on.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And they're like, well, if you're not going to go on, oh.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
All right, got it.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Okay, well, anyways, let's...

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
But yeah, so I just like, you know, I'm trying to...

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
So you got directors coming in because I had dinner with Bobcat the night before he...

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
for a table read and he knew that the next day there was no script.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I was just starting to cut his episodes, great.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, but he was saying like, so like, I've never really done this before.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
The table reads tomorrow, there's no script.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I said, there might not be a table.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Like, you might walk in and they're building a table for you.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And he goes, for me, that's kind of how I make my movies.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Like, I don't like to know everything in advance.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
He goes, this seems like perfect for me.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I said, I think it will be then.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It's a great episode. He did a great episode.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
They're all great episodes. It's a great show.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
It's the best show on TV. It's not even on TV.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I just have to go through this.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
It's just, there's nobody telling me what to do.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
So you look at it and you're like, well, that's how you're going to end it?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
With Leonard just taking a shit?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh, all right.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Soilers.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
What would you rather have?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
You haven't seen what he ate.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
What would you rather have next time if you had to do another season or another show?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Would you rather have a Robertson Mech is breathing down your neck

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
or a nice cable network not breathing down your neck?

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
No, I think, I continue to enjoy TV.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I just think, I think that, I think what I definitely need is like,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
because Chris McKenna is like my right hand man

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
and like the guy who makes everything really funny, like has a lot of passion.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
He's not like, it's not like I'm Picasso and he's like a guy that makes Picasso possible.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
That's not like he's a frame fetcher.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't know who did what for Picasso.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
But he's like, he's like unequal and a partner creatively.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
He just cares about the show in different ways,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
but he's like very funny, funnier than me and like always come up with these ideas.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
It's just he and I like making the show together as partners

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
and what there isn't is like a liaison between us and the suits and the production.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
What we need is like kind of a third guy that's just like, hey, it's me, Eugene.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
And I'm like, oh, Eugene, it's like, need help with that funny script?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm like, sure, Eugene, you're a hilarious writer.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
But first, could you check in with the line producer about those giant phones?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
That's what we need.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
And also, oh, Sony's calling, hey, Eugene, you take that one.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Give your comedy a break for a second.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Go take the Sony call.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
We need Eugene.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
So what was that person's name on the last version?

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Uh, nice try.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
Everyone takes a little bit of the Eugene role here and there.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
So it's all too much paradise there?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Everyone's Picasso and there's nobody yelling at you and it's just too easy?

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
And coupled with the fact that any actual grown-up work that has to be done,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
it's either me or Chris doing it, neither of us.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
That's not our wheelhouse, that's not where we're best used.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
We don't want to talk on the phone to anybody about marketing or keeping the trains running.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
But we have to.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
We're happy to do so, but then we are behind schedule.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
So that's my lesson.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I would like to do more TV, but I need to find a fall guy.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I need to find a guy that's like...

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Like more of the type A person that likes the minutiae, likes the detail work?

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Yeah, one of these guys that's kind of happy to not be funny or something, I don't know,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
that's sort of like, I just like being around the magic.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
You guys are crazy.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
What were you smoking?

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Wait, what are you smoking?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
If you call Human Resources, I'll fucking kill you.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Go back in your office, Eugene, and talk to Sony.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
We just need somebody.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
That seems like a dream job for a lot of people that aren't that talented but would love to be around them.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of those guys out there.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I think we have a few in the crowd, they just tapped.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
And I wouldn't mind being that guy pretty soon.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
I'm kind of that guy on Rick and Morty a little bit, just Justin's so insane.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
I just stay in the writer's room and work on scripts, but Justin's a maniac.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
So I'm just kind of like, hey, you heard the man making about turds.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Anyways, actually, that's not true at all.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
Justin does everything related to production, so that's not even a good analogy at all.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm just kind of like the head writer on Rick and Morty.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Who cares?

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
We came to the show called Harmontown, we care.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Shut up.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
You should care more about our guests tonight.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Let's bring them up and start.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh, what is this?

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Were you in the hospital recently?

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Oh, that's right, I'm dying.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
What is this from?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh, this is from Harris' memorial.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Humblebrag.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
That's worth noting in the diary of our lives.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
They had a really wonderful memorial at the Upright Citizens Brigade New Space,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
which on paper I would just have thought, I don't want to go to this, but Aaron,

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
I knew Aaron would want to be there, and I was like, I'm going to go.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
Also, I should be there, but I wouldn't have gone, do you know what I mean?

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
But I'm glad I did, because it really hit you with the importance of a memorial service.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
It was just a flood of stories about a person that is gone now.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
It was like, you're just laughing the whole time.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
It was just like, what an amazing guy, and it really helped a tone somehow.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I don't know, just squeezed you out a little bit.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
There's a lot of people walking around kind of shell-shocked,

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
and then you listen to these stories, and it just works.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I don't get it.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
I guess the Neanderthals invented it, the idea of a funeral, so why are we questioning?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Why did I think it wasn't a good idea to go?

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
But it was nice, and I have a bracelet on from it.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Were you afraid that because it was a comedy thing, that it might not be sincere?

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
I was afraid of social anxieties being around people, first of all.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I don't understand death, and I'm afraid of it and coping with it.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I don't know how to talk to people under normal circumstances.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I don't know how to small talk.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
There is no such thing as small talk at a memorial.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
My usual path through conversation to avoidance of small talk

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
is to talk about whatever is really going on.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Whatever is really going on is not a fucking safe area at a memorial

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
because you don't know, if you're talking to a Parks and Rec guy,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
you can't be presumptuous about how grief-stricken someone must be.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
You're trying to calculate how hard did this person get hit,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
and what right do I have to say anything.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I don't want to think about stuff like that.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I have to think about stuff like that too much, just normally.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
The therapist said, don't think about that stuff.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Just speak in truths that cannot be, just bring some Kleenex.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Be the Kleenex guy and say, no matter how ridiculous it sounds,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
and no matter how repetitive it sounds, this is terrible.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Really? This is terrible?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
You're supposed to say that at a function?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
But I tried doing it.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
It worked on Adam Scott.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
That's when I really leaned into it.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I remember it was Adam Scott, and I said, this is terrible.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
And he's like, yeah, it is. This is hair.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I felt like he did appreciate it.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And I was like, okay, this is awful. This is terrible.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
And Adam Scott was like, okay, you can stop now.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
But yeah, it was great. It was a great celebration.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Did he have to speak?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
No, of course not. No, no.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
I was just there to, like, Aaron was close to him.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Rob was very close to him.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I knew Harris.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
I didn't realize how close, my close friends were to him.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I just met him a handful of times.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
I didn't realize how tight he and Rob were,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
and other friends of mine.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
It was a pretty, I would, no exaggeration.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Like, if you named a person that we knew,

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
I would, without knowing, I would bet that they knew him.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
He was just kind of everywhere.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I forgot that he's saying at Rob's wedding with Sarah and Paul.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I thought your little, I guess if it was a eulogy that you did the last show,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
it was very...

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, that was my anger phase.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
There are other people that are bargaining that was me being angry

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
at, like, anti-drug people.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
And now I'm getting towards acceptance,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
which is, like, the scariest thing in the world

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
because you don't want somebody to be dead.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
So, all right, let's, now that we've warmed up the stage for,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
for Booger.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
My affection for this guy is unparalleled.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
I've been so excited about having him on the show for so long.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Even if only it was because he had been such an indelible presence

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
in so many formative movies when we were growing up,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
so many reasons that I'm out here in this city.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
But also, just now, in the modern world,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
he's also doing some work I admire because he's the executive producer

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
and he's executive producing, like, one of the only kind of

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
semi-honest reality shows that's on TV

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
that we can talk about a little bit.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
So, let's bring him out. Curtis Armstrong is here.

18:27.000 --> 18:48.000
Take any of those, yeah, wherever you're comfortable.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Hello.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Thanks for playing me in.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, well, we had to kind of brighten the mood

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
after that last 10 minutes.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah, I know. I was really getting sad back there.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
You were supposed to listen.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
No, it's okay.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Well, it's just, you know, oh, my.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
You didn't happen to know Harris Wittels, did you?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I did not. I never worked with him. I never met him even.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Uh, yeah, it was, it was, it was, yeah, whatever.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Man, I, well, it's, it's like, uh,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
just stories from him in the writer's room being said

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
at a memorial. That's like when it hits home because it's like,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
you're in an audience of workaholics,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
like, so everyone spends 16 hours a day in a certain environment

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
and then you're hearing about this guy who kind of shot through that environment

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
and like, it just raises all these questions about what the fuck are we doing,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
which is, which was a common theme.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
And I think Matt Besser, who went up early on who like,

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
who's a renowned curmudgeon and, you know, um, uh,

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
but he really like, it was the perfect eulogy for anybody,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
let alone somebody that he, you could have, you could have taken it

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
and put it in, in any, uh, wake and it would have been very inspiring,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
but it was really apropos to, to this guy that, that passed.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
But it was all about that concept of what was this thing that made them special

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
that we didn't notice when they were around and now that they're gone,

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
what, what, you know, just how can this person live within us and can we,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
and it really, like it was really taken with all these stories about him

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
because the constant theme was how little a shit he gave,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
how he gave zero fucks.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And like maybe that, maybe that, that, that hurt him in the end,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
but it also like, clearly it was like, what the fuck was I doing?

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
The entire time that he was around, why was I over here doing something different,

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
like, like, like, like playing this game of like, how am I driving with the audience?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
When this guy was like, suffering under the yoke of mainstream perceptions,

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
and just spent every job that he went to and kept getting promoted,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
he's one of those superstars that, you know, would come to work and then show up late

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
and like no one gave a fuck because if they fired him, their show would get unfunny.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
And, and he just like spent his career, you know, bursting at the seams,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
whatever seams were around him.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
And what, what, what, I was that guy at one point, at some point,

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
and then I started tweeting and then I turned into a fucking weird half-Mr. Rogers,

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
half-asshole, like constantly, by the way, how are you? What's your name?

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
Sorry, Curtis, that's all the time we have. Curtis, I'm strong.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Thank you.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Anyways, I want to start with King of the Nerds instead of starting,

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
I think we'll get into like, like your, your blessings upon my, my, my adolescence,

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
but the, you're, you're, you're currently right now, TBS Friday nights at nine?

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Friday nights at nine, yeah, we're for the first time.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
It's called King of the Nerds, whereas most reality shows are kind of like,

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
they're called like, you know, who wants to fuck the, the, the Smiling Joe?

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
And it's all about, it's all about, you know, it's a very, it's a, it's a, it's a templated reality show.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
I mean, it looks and feels like a reality show, except because it's,

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
It does, because we've got, I mean, the, you know, the people who actually know what they're doing,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
you know, Robert Carradine and I, who were in Revenge of the Nerds,

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
we came up with the Nerd Show idea, but we needed people who actually had a clue,

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
because we didn't, we've never done reality shows, we've never known people who've been in reality shows.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
So when, once this thing was actually going somewhere, we needed people who could actually run it,

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
and those are the people who are making those kinds of, of, you know, the, the actual template of,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
of, you know, survivor type shows or whatever.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
But those people.

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
But we have, we have certain things that we want to make sure they stick with,

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
which has to do, has to do with nerd culture and have it be a little different.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
For instance, the fact that every time somebody gets eliminated, like there's, I mean, it's, it's,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
It breaks everyone's heart.

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
And, and you, and you always, like when, when the person gets eliminated is when they are raised to the height of their,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
their individuality, and you give a little kind of Springer's final thoughts about who they are.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Right, right.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
You, you say, you know, Jackson, although you're, there is no cosplay and the great beyond,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
you, you have, you have dressed as a hero this way.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah, whatever.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
You do that really well.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
You give them a very personalized, and it's not, it's not just based on superficial stuff.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
It's like, they always cut them because I write them too long.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
I mean, I, because what we do is, I write those because I want,

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
I can't give them a basic, well, thanks for playing.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
You know, it just, it's not in me to do it.

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
They mean, it's strange, but they actually, I, I'm an executive producer of this show,

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
and a host of the show, but I am a fan of nerds, and I've always been a fan of nerds.

23:51.000 --> 24:01.000
And so, when I'm in a room like you've got there, and I'm watching them for, you know, 15 hours a day,

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
and I become so enraptured with them, and it's, when they leave, it really bothers me.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
And that separation you're supposed to have as a host of a reality show, I'm not capable.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I cannot do that.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I just get too emotionally involved.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
And I don't think you have to because you're kind of a den leader to these Cub Scouts,

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
which is somebody who does need to have a kind of cosmic detachment from them because you're...

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Oh, it's kept very separate when we're shooting.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
But what's going on inside of me is different.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh, I see.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
And then what happens, yeah, when we're shooting, there's no funny business, there's no talking,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
there's no, you know, they are the hosts.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
You don't talk to the hosts, just like any other show.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
But I'm dying inside.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
Is there any room in your show for that to be revealed?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I think people take it for granted.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
I think they just assume that that's the case, that you don't actually have relationships with them.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
No, I'm saying, but is there room to include that your, like, pathos, pathetic pathos?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Well, you can do those little...

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
I take that, I use the farewells, you know, which are usually made up on the spot

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
because we don't know completely who's going to go home and who's not.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So they were made up at last minute.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
And I use that as my way of expressing my love for them.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And then they cut that down to a tiny...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And they cut that down to this much.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
But it's very, I mean, you know, obviously from the top down, there's a mandate to preserve the humanity

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and not punish aberration.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
Like, the things that make you different are the things that make you good,

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
not necessarily the things that make you bad, and the way that you win is not necessarily blending in with everyone else.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
And there's a crucial difference to the show, because it's...

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I mean, you know, because it's called King of the Nerds.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So it's like, they're actual nerds.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
It's not like it's, you know, depending on how you define that, some people might go,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
why is a guy that only reads comic books a nerd?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Because I work for NASA.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
But it's like, everyone who you could authentically call a nerd, which I think is defined by kind of obsession.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
I think like...

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
I think that's as good a description as anything.

26:11.000 --> 26:19.000
And they come in and they do cry, and they do have mental breakdowns, and they do reveal pettiness and greed and ambition and embarrassing things.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Because they're human beings.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
It's part of it.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
It feels like, you know, well, this would happen to you too, and it happened to them for a read.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
No one ever feels like they're walking out and you're going like, oh, fuck that psychopath.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Like, I'm glad they're, I hope they get hit by a bus as they leave the show.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
They're like all like decent people.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah, so thank you for making that show.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Let me just give you one quick thing.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Just to tell you, to give you an idea of how this all works for them.

26:49.000 --> 26:59.000
When we did our premiere in January for this season, we wanted to have a party, you know, to do some press and all that.

26:59.000 --> 27:13.000
And we sent the word out through Genevieve, who was one of your guests before, to the nerds who had been on the previous seasons saying, you know, in addition to the new nerds, if you want to come, come.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
And, you know, join us for the party.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
We're not paying for it.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
We can't give you any money.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
We can't fly you here.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
But if you're here, come to the party.

27:22.000 --> 27:33.000
All of season three, this group, all of them showed up, all but one of season two and half of season one.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
And they all came here on their own dime.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
They all paid for their own tickets.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
They found housing.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
They did all of that stuff because they wanted to be there for that premiere party.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
That's great.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
Because when people are on contestants on reality shows, they feel pretty flushed down the toilet and thrown away.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Because like the editing can be so cruel.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Yeah, but we don't...

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
It's true.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
But we don't let go of them, you see.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
You said earlier that you've always loved nerd culture.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
When you did Revenge of the Nerds, were you guys aware of nerd culture?

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
No, because I don't think there was a lot of nerd culture anyway.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I mean, not really.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
There were Star Trek conventions and so on.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
And Comic-Cons, but they were like in basements in those days.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
They weren't, you know, corporate behemoths.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Yeah, they weren't in the light of day.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Exactly.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
I mean, they were all people in their garages with cardboard boxes.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Well, that movie, Revenge of the Nerds, we were talking about in the green room.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
For me, by my perception, it was the very slow beginning to what we have today,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
which is just nerd domination of the word nerd.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Almost means nothing.

28:38.000 --> 28:45.000
Because what is a nerd when nerds are captains of industry and running the government and we own everything.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
That's really true.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
And we are the sought after demographic.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And I start to worry, should I say we?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Because I'm worried I'll get called out on not being an authentic nerd,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and yet everyone's a fucking nerd.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
But it goes back to that pivot point.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I always associate it with that movie.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
Because it put a label on it and said absolutely from here on out,

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
if you see somebody who's weird in a movie, all those people that we make fun of in the movies,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
and they come through and they go, oh look, it's Purple Durper.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
From now on, you have to understand that that person is the hero of their own story.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
You're not allowed to just give them a wedgie and call it a joke anymore.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
You could do that in meatballs.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
You could do that in, leading up to that, the preppies could be the heroes.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
In my memory, every movie before that, that was the joke.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Every movie after that, you weren't allowed to do that.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
The jocks were the good guys until that movie.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
You're right, yes.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
But you were saying in the green room, this fascinates me,

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
that that movie was incredibly unsuccessful, critically.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Oh, critically it was a disaster.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
They hated us. They just hated us.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
And I think, at the time, we were sort of consoling ourselves by saying things like,

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
well, all critics are self-loathing nerds, and that's the reason.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
They see too much of themselves in the movie.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
But the director you said, I'm going to watch Revenge of the Nerds again,

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
see if it holds up. I do know, well, I want to talk about Better Off Dead in a second.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
I have watched Better Off Dead since Bobcat was on here.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
We talked about Savage Steve Holland, and I ran home and watched Better Off Dead again.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And fuck, it holds the hell up.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
And it's such an important film.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
And also Savage Steve, then he just kind of trickled away.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And I want to have him as a guest on here and talk about that.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
The perceptions of people who are in the Midwest watching this stuff on HBO,

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
select TV, VHS tapes that they run into disintegration,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
which Revenge of the Nerds is one of them.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Our perception is cultural efficacy.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
It's just that, oh, this must be an amazingly influential, successful film.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
And it is for us, but in some strange emerald city from which it's coming,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
people are being rewarded and punished on different scales.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
And Jeff Canoe, who directed Revenge of the Nerds, went on to direct Gotcha, you said.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm acting like I'm an expert.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I pumped you for this information.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
He went on to direct Gotcha, which is the paintball exploitation movie.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I remember everything about that movie.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I saw it in the theater with my mom.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I was like, it's the best.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
And there were those little tracer disc guns that shot little plastic discs that flew pretty well.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And I just played Gotcha all the time.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
So I was going around and playing like a fake assassin and being a spy with my Gotcha gun.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Yes, I am a spy.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
Sorry, that's from the commercial.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And then he sort of...

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
Well, this is a good question to ask of him as well.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
But he was somebody who, if it had not been for Jeff Canoe,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
we wouldn't have had the freedom to...

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
That movie wouldn't have had the freedom to develop the way it did and come out the way it did.

31:57.000 --> 32:06.000
He was incredibly brilliant at creating an environment in which writers and actors and even producers were involved.

32:06.000 --> 32:15.000
He was casting the producers in tiny roles in Revenge of the Nerds and sort of keeping them in the group.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And he had this collaborative writing process.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Very, very collaborative.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
And he brought all of us out a week early before shooting,

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
putting us all up in a hotel with the writers and the producers and so on.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And we would just sit in the hotel all day.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
We'd be hanging out at the pool and then they would call you in and you would go in and you would talk about who Booger was.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
And you had to write everything down.

32:37.000 --> 32:43.000
I went back to my room and I did my old acting school job of writing down my biography of Booger.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I did this.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
What is Booger's biography?

32:45.000 --> 32:52.000
That was really funny because what wound up happening was like last year I was going through a trunk of stuff

32:52.000 --> 32:58.000
and I found this amazing notebook which I still have that I, because I was serious,

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
you know, this was an acting thing that you did when you were trained the way I was trained.

33:03.000 --> 33:12.000
And I had this booklet and it's got the bios of all of the characters I played in those early movies up to about 87.

33:12.000 --> 33:20.000
And so I'm looking at it, this ur text, and I go into it and I find Booger's biography.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
And I'm reading what I wrote in 1984 as to who I thought Booger was.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
God damn it, I would have told you to bring that.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
I can tell you right now, it was me.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It was totally me.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
I was going to ask you, how much of Booger was on the page on the script before?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
There was very little.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
There was almost none.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Like was there a breakdown for the character that said Booger comes in and he looks like?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
No, I didn't audition for Booger.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
I auditioned for Gilbert or Anthony's part.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Which is what I thought I was reading for.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
I said, oh, that's great, I'm working with Bobby Carradine, that's fabulous.

33:57.000 --> 34:06.000
And then it turned out that I was actually auditioning for a part that was too small and too disgusting to audition people.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You know, you couldn't use Booger.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
What is it going to be?

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
It's like, I think the douchebag line, my mother's old douchebag, but that's back in Ohio.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
That was like the only line that had a beginning and an end, you know, for Booger.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
It was mainly nose picking and belching.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Because your character was only nerdy in the sense that you were just completely...

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
He wasn't nerdy at all.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
You were a sociopath.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
You were just a...

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Exactly.

34:30.000 --> 34:37.000
Booger's only reason for existence is to show how Saint like these other nerds are.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
You just believed in them so much, like, this guy is the best.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
What they do is he gets thrown out, I mean, it's sort of a traditional thing.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
He gets thrown into the outer darkness with them.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Right.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And they don't even think about it.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
They just say, oh, you come with us.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
That's okay.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So this is an important thing because you mentioned something.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
You and I are a similar age, which is the same generation, like, and then there's a new generation.

35:00.000 --> 35:07.000
If you look at Revenge of the Nerds through current eyes, I mean, without rewatching it,

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
I will tell you the fucking unacceptable red flags that are going to come up.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
There is absolutely non-consensual sex that converts a woman from being a bad guy to a good guy

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
because she lets the nerd like disguise himself.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
And then she's like, oh, you're so good at kind of language.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
It's just horrible.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
It's just horrible.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Is it Darth Vader too?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
By our modern definitions, there's racism, there's homophobia.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
There's, I mean, there's a million crimes that we've come as we've progressed.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Like, now you look back 30 years and it's like, oh, yeah.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
It's really true.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
The important kind of, like, socio-political, like, subversive element, though,

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
and that's where Booger comes in is the idea that that was the first time in my consciousness

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
that we put a word on nerd, but the whole idea of the movie that was demonstrated,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
not just in that final monologue, oh, we're all nerds,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
even the beautiful people are saying, I'm a nerd too.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
But more importantly, throughout the first and second act,

36:05.000 --> 36:11.000
this creeping realization that the word nerd has no boundary except that you are the other,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
which means that if you smoke weed, you're a nerd, which means that if you're a grote,

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
which means that, and what is the common hub,

36:18.000 --> 36:26.000
it is being divested of your right to prejudice because there is a gay man within the nerds.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
A gay black man.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
He is not immediately sussed out for his aberration.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
He is ignored.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
He is welcomed.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
It's never questioned.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
And when we go to you and Jefferson, because we want the lambda, lambda, lambda to support us,

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
we say that there will be no prejudice which we think will get us in with him, Bernie Casey.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
There won't be any prejudice according to race or creed,

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
and Larry B, who plays Lamar, says, or sexual orientation,

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
which is like a joke that would work now.

36:59.000 --> 37:06.000
If you were doing that kind of a parody on that sort of thing.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
They meant it as a parable for antisemitism.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
That's what the writers meant.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I just found out about Superman.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
I remember hating that and then learning that two Jewish kids created it.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
It was the same thing.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
And they did that, the burning nerds on the lawn and all of that.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
They were going into these, which were at the time, for people our age,

37:31.000 --> 37:41.000
they were these strong cultural flags of something that had been going on in the 60s and the 70s

37:41.000 --> 37:48.000
that we were supposedly coming out of now, which of course we haven't, but that was the idea.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Revenge of the nerds.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
And now...

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
I was making a drink and I didn't notice.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I could keep talking while you're doing that.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
I want to hear, now it's time to talk about Better Off Dead.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Which is what you really want to talk about anyway.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Well, kind of, but I don't want you to talk out of school.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
That's a movie.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
I did a quote, I did a reference to that movie, not knowing you were going to be here,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
I think last week or the week before, and that's a movie that I think...

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
I know I quote a couple of times a week, ever since I've seen it.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
It's also like, it's a thing that when something happens, everybody in the room of a certain age

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
all says the same line, I've never seen snow without quoting you from that movie.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
Because that's a great fucking line.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Which one?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
The street value of mountain living?

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
My favorite moment in Better Off Dead is when the bad guy, like, you know, he skis to a stop

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
and then there's John Cusack and there's his cute girlfriend who's going to get stolen by the bad guy.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
And then there's Curtis' character standing next to him.

38:53.000 --> 39:01.000
And the bad guy, the preppy bad guy, looking at Cusack's girlfriend goes like,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
oh, you're a cute little thing, what's your name?

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
And with incredible sincerity, you step over and go, Charles Dumar?

39:10.000 --> 39:18.000
And it's not, you're not being the guy who's like, you're not the animal house subversion.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Your character in that movie is like an interesting tweak on the nerd character

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
because he's absolutely, like, he doesn't ever seem to really take any sides

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
and he's sort of like, he's very happy to be called a cute little thing

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
and help that guy with his skiing if that's what he wanted in that moment.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I'll hold your clipboard.

39:36.000 --> 39:41.000
No, it was such an odd movie because it, hello.

39:41.000 --> 39:51.000
It was a story that was pretty typical, that was being filtered through his sensibility

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
which no one was aware of at the time.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
He was very new, he was 24, I think, and he was making this, you know,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
what was basically, you know, this was a real movie.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
How many of you guys, how many of you see better up, Jed?

40:06.000 --> 40:12.000
More accurately, by applause, honestly, who has not seen the movie?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Wow, it's creeping in.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I mean, this is, we're getting old.

40:16.000 --> 40:22.000
This is the thing, now it's like me talking to somebody, like, your age,

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
about movies that when I was your age, I thought would never go away

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
and they've already gone.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I mean, Better Off Dead, it didn't occur to me until...

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
You mean like Birth of a Nation?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Yeah, those kinds of movies.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
I was growing up, we were all growing up on John Hughes movies

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
and it did, when I rewatched Better Off Dead, what I finally realized

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
having become in my old age a kind of John Hughes expert

40:45.000 --> 40:52.000
was that, the thing about Better Off Dead was its departure from the John Hughes, like, mainline

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
and I didn't, there was no other way to express it when you were back then

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
except that it's a weird movie, it's a crazy movie, it's weird,

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
but what's that? Is that a weird movie would be, you know, an easy writer?

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I mean, it would just be about something weird.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
This is about sex and teenage life and going to prom and winning ski competitions.

41:09.000 --> 41:19.000
The tone of it, the reality is like, it's not grounded in the John Hughes, like, reality

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
where you can live and die by what someone feels.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
And there's comedy sketches that keep recurring throughout this.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It just breaks genre all the time.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Well, the universe is absurd.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
There are so many things about the universe that make absolutely no sense

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
that I would imagine a normal producer would immediately say, with all the best intentions,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
you can't do that. I know you think that's fun.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
The reason you think that's fun is because you're bored and you're a director

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
or you're a writer and you want to have fun, but the audience doesn't want to have that much fun.

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
I say this all the time when I'm making my TV show.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
I'm constantly going like, let's not freak them out.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
They want to believe these people are real so that we can continue to have fun for a thousand years.

42:06.000 --> 42:15.000
But then if you really, the thing that I've learned in doing community is that as long as when people,

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
if somebody is betrayed, if they feel betrayed and you believe they're betrayed,

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
it doesn't matter if the moon is a dick.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
The universe can just be anything.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
You can be in outer space, you can just cut to anything.

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
We're all pickles now, but as long as you have to pick that one channel to be consistent with,

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
the physics of emotional consistency.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Why wouldn't that guy say that that guy was an asshole?

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
He just was an asshole to him.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I don't care if they're pickles. I'm not going to ask why they're pickles.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
We didn't ask why Snoopy didn't run out of room in his doghouse.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
We were held to the ground, but you did.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I wondered that.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Remember those letters that you ever read about?

43:02.000 --> 43:10.000
Who was the actor that played Father Brady on the Brady Bunch?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I can't think of the name.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Well, he'd be happy right now.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
What the hell's his name?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Greg Brady?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
No, that can't be true.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
He would get these big fights with Sherwood Schwartz.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Robert...

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
Is that it?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Is it Robert Reed?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Did I get half of it right?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
I'm sorry.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I almost said Robert Shaw.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
He would get these big arguments with letters back and forth with Sherwood Schwartz

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
and say, there cannot be a pie fight.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
You cannot have a family in a house and all of a sudden go into slapstick

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
and Sherwood Schwartz says, we're making a TV show.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
We're having a good time.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
There's rules that have to be adhered to.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
He was determined to keep there to be logic within the world of the Brady Bunch.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
The audience, I love the pie fights on the Brady Bunch.

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
I think it's also, in the case of the movies, it was an interesting time

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
because I think that period around the 80s, the beginning of the 80s, mid-80s,

44:11.000 --> 44:17.000
was the last time you could really do a movie like Better Off Dead

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
and have it be produced by a major film company

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
and released in theaters with these actors in it who, you know,

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
I mean, John Cusack was not anybody who anyone really knew at the time

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and it's certainly none of the rest of it.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Kim Darby was probably the biggest star among us, you know.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Who's that?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Kim Darby.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
You don't know who Kim Darby is?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
No, who's Kim Darby?

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I love that you don't know.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Kim Darby was in the original, she played Cusack's mother.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Oh, okay.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
In Lane's mother in Better Off Dead

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
and she was the original girl in True Grit, the John Wayne True Grit.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Was it right?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
She's French dressing and French fries?

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
French fries.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
That's her?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Yeah, that's her.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
I quoted that a couple days ago.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Yeah.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
We just saw her.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
I mean, we just did a reading.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Well, she's the little girl in True Grit with John Wayne.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
In True Grit.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
I did not know that.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Well, see, there you are.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
You learned something tonight.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Really cool.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Yeah.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
I don't know what I would have done.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't have that movie in my life.

45:15.000 --> 45:20.000
John Cusack's character in that movie lived in a house that was roughly the size of mine.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
It looked like a real house, too.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
He didn't have the problems I had, but he lived in a world that I did in that I felt completely

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
alienated.

45:30.000 --> 45:37.000
It was better expressed by that director than God bless him for all of his incredibly important

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
work, John Hughes.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.500
But I mean, it was more poignantly expressed through an absurdist lens by this more punk

45:44.500 --> 45:48.000
rock director saying, let's go more extreme with this.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.720
Let's just say I want to kill myself.

45:51.720 --> 45:55.000
Let's have me try to kill myself.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.500
Let's express how I feel through animation.

45:58.500 --> 46:03.680
Let's express how I feel through characters that could not exist in real life, like coming

46:03.680 --> 46:08.680
at me, that the net result will be that I feel beleaguered, that I feel like I'm okay.

46:08.680 --> 46:09.680
It is just so awkward.

46:09.680 --> 46:14.680
It is awesome to go into voiceover narration when the two Asian guys come up.

46:14.680 --> 46:15.680
Right.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.680
Are you asking, who did that?

46:16.680 --> 46:22.680
No, I'm saying, just to do that is hilarious.

46:22.680 --> 46:25.360
You know it's coming back for the third time.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.200
The second time it happens, it's going to happen a third time, and it's going to be

46:28.200 --> 46:30.320
at a great point in the movie.

46:30.320 --> 46:34.800
I want my two dollars, that has to pay off, and all these little things have to keep recurring.

46:34.800 --> 46:35.800
It's wonderful.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
Yeah.

46:36.800 --> 46:37.800
Better off dead.

46:37.800 --> 46:38.800
Now, okay.

46:38.800 --> 46:43.960
Now, not to be a jerk, because I get to work with very frequently, and I love them to pieces,

46:43.960 --> 46:47.040
and we've talked about it quite a bit, and he has wonderful stories, as Joel Murray.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.040
Oh, yeah.

46:48.040 --> 46:52.720
And he said, the shooting of One Crazy Summer, that you guys were in Nantucket or Martha's

46:52.720 --> 46:54.000
Vineyard, or where were you guys?

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
We were in Vogue.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.720
And he's got awesome, like, ribbled, sexy stories about what you guys got to do.

46:59.720 --> 47:02.120
No, I was not in that.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.120
I'm not in that.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.600
I'm noticeably not in any of those stories.

47:04.600 --> 47:05.600
Aren't you in that one?

47:05.600 --> 47:06.600
No, no, I'm in the movie.

47:06.600 --> 47:07.600
Yeah.

47:07.600 --> 47:10.440
But I wasn't in any of the sexy ribblings.

47:10.440 --> 47:12.320
I missed all of those.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
I was, you know...

47:13.320 --> 47:14.760
No kidding, I was too bad, because he has some really...

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
I know.

47:15.760 --> 47:16.760
I know.

47:16.760 --> 47:17.760
He has some juzzies.

47:17.760 --> 47:18.760
Yeah.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.440
Joel did great, you know.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.760
Bill's younger brother, you know?

47:23.760 --> 47:25.480
He's the youngest of the Murray brothers.

47:25.480 --> 47:27.440
He's number nine out of nine.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.440
Yeah.

47:28.440 --> 47:31.920
Now, because it happened on Twitter, so you could tell the story, right, that you were

47:31.920 --> 47:34.000
just telling me about the Kuzak...

47:34.000 --> 47:36.360
Oh, just an interesting story, yeah.

47:36.360 --> 47:37.360
That, you know, this...

47:37.360 --> 47:42.160
I mean, of course, many of you here have not actually seen Better Off Dead, but...

47:42.160 --> 47:43.600
The legend is the Kuzak...

47:43.600 --> 47:44.600
He did the movie.

47:44.600 --> 47:45.680
...not a fan of the movie.

47:45.680 --> 47:46.680
And I will...

47:46.680 --> 47:47.680
I will...

47:47.680 --> 47:49.480
Let me lend this, because you're not talking at school.

47:49.480 --> 47:50.480
I am.

47:50.480 --> 47:53.200
Rob Schrab was up to direct Hot Tub Time Machine long ago.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.640
He had a meeting with Kuzak where he...

47:55.640 --> 47:58.760
Rob's going to be very angry at me about something.

47:58.760 --> 48:01.480
Like, he came back from that meeting.

48:01.480 --> 48:07.080
I won't go into specifics, but he had a conversation where he came away from saying, oh my God,

48:07.080 --> 48:09.160
John Kuzak doesn't like Better Off Dead.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.160
Okay.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.480
So, it's out there...

48:12.480 --> 48:15.000
It's out there that he was not happy with the movie.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.200
And then we had to make a second movie.

48:18.200 --> 48:21.240
The following year, we made a second movie with almost the same cast.

48:21.240 --> 48:23.200
Because it was like a two-picture deal, or...

48:23.200 --> 48:24.200
Yeah.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.240
So, it was supposedly the first two of three movies.

48:26.240 --> 48:29.800
And the legend that I've heard is that Kuzak had not seen Better Off Dead...

48:29.800 --> 48:30.800
No, that's not true.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.800
That's not true.

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
He had seen it.

48:32.800 --> 48:33.800
Okay.

48:33.800 --> 48:34.800
That there was a...

48:34.800 --> 48:39.520
Before they started shooting one crazy summer, there was a screening of Better Off Dead.

48:39.520 --> 48:43.880
That might have happened because I wasn't in Nantucket when they started filming, so

48:43.880 --> 48:46.040
they may have screened it there.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.040
And that made...

48:47.040 --> 48:48.920
So that there was like this new director, it was like this...

48:48.920 --> 48:50.120
I knew that he was...

48:50.120 --> 48:53.560
He had not been happy with the movie, that movie.

48:53.560 --> 48:55.720
So they're starting one crazy summer and it is like...

48:55.720 --> 49:00.640
So they're starting a second movie with the same director and an actor who is not happy

49:00.640 --> 49:04.760
with the first movie is what appeared to be the case.

49:04.760 --> 49:07.320
And over the years, the legends have...

49:07.320 --> 49:11.560
Yeah, I mean, it's just gotten ridiculous where everybody says, well, not only does

49:11.560 --> 49:18.320
he hate it, but he abuses people who refer to it.

49:18.320 --> 49:24.520
And he actually, if he's handed something to sign and it has something to do with Better

49:24.520 --> 49:28.200
Off Dead, he will tear it up and throw it away.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.720
I mean, the stories became legend.

49:30.720 --> 49:31.720
Are those verifiable?

49:31.720 --> 49:32.720
Is that all legend?

49:32.720 --> 49:34.720
No, no.

49:34.720 --> 49:35.720
It's just...

49:35.720 --> 49:37.480
I heard he stabbed a child one time.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
Is that true?

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
Because his name was...

49:39.480 --> 49:40.480
That's right.

49:40.480 --> 49:41.480
It was a little kid.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.480
That's what women said.

49:42.480 --> 49:48.480
My two dollars is a joke.

49:48.480 --> 49:49.480
No.

49:49.480 --> 49:50.480
These are the kinds of things...

49:50.480 --> 49:51.480
Well, okay.

49:51.480 --> 49:58.160
The end of the story, as you're asking for, is that we did this reading three weeks ago

49:58.160 --> 50:01.360
in San Francisco for SketchFest.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.360
And it was...

50:02.360 --> 50:06.920
Savage was there and a bunch of us from the movie, Kim Darby, Diane Franklin, Amanda Weiss,

50:06.920 --> 50:09.080
we were all there and we were reading the script.

50:09.080 --> 50:10.080
Reading Better Off Dead?

50:10.080 --> 50:11.080
Better Off Dead.

50:11.080 --> 50:12.640
Because Qzack is not there.

50:12.640 --> 50:17.400
So the next day, I'm getting all of these Twitter questions from people saying, where's

50:17.400 --> 50:18.400
Qzack?

50:18.400 --> 50:19.400
Why wasn't Qzack there?

50:19.400 --> 50:20.640
Why didn't you invite Qzack?

50:20.640 --> 50:22.040
That's bullshit, man.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.360
You should have had Qzack there.

50:23.360 --> 50:26.040
It was his movie and all this stuff and going on and on.

50:26.040 --> 50:30.440
And I usually don't respond to that kind of thing, but I finally wrote a Twitter tweet

50:30.440 --> 50:34.640
and said, you know, John's not a fan of the film.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.680
And that's the truth.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.120
So that's why he wasn't there.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.560
It's not like we didn't want him there.

50:38.560 --> 50:39.760
We would have loved to have had him.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.080
It doesn't like the movie.

50:42.080 --> 50:54.120
Ten minutes later, John Qzack tweets, not true.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.240
I love Twitter so fucking much.

50:56.240 --> 51:00.000
I mean, you wouldn't be here without Twitter.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.320
So I know.

51:01.320 --> 51:09.640
And so it winds up, John and I, I have not spoken to John in 25 years, probably.

51:09.640 --> 51:13.080
And we never followed each other on Twitter.

51:13.080 --> 51:20.240
He loved the movie so much to talk to his co-stars or to be too tamper with that memory.

51:20.240 --> 51:25.120
No, it's just, you know, you don't, I mean, you move on in your life and you just don't,

51:25.120 --> 51:27.560
you know, you don't live in each other's pants.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.560
Exactly.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.200
It's just, you move on.

51:30.200 --> 51:34.480
So, so it's been a long time.

51:34.480 --> 51:39.360
But it's, it's been a long time and we don't follow each other on Twitter.

51:39.360 --> 51:42.880
So suddenly he's following me on Twitter.

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
So I follow him on Twitter.

51:43.880 --> 51:46.560
Because he must have got zoomed by a thousand tweets, like right now, yeah.

51:46.560 --> 51:47.560
Of course.

51:47.560 --> 51:48.560
Of course.

51:48.560 --> 51:52.760
And then we start direct messaging about it.

51:52.760 --> 51:59.040
And it was so wonderful to hear, you know, I mean, whatever his feelings had been, you

51:59.040 --> 52:04.960
know, he was, it was really great to, to get some nice feedback from him.

52:04.960 --> 52:08.880
What was the, what was the kind of threat, the, the takeaway from that conversation was,

52:08.880 --> 52:12.160
he just, I mean, he says, you know, I hated the music.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.880
I remember he said that he hated the music.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.720
I thought, well, that's 80s music.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.640
I hate, everybody hates 80s music.

52:18.640 --> 52:22.200
But was he sort of like, was the, when you, who sent the first direct message?

52:22.200 --> 52:27.560
I'm like a 14 year old girl right now.

52:27.560 --> 52:28.560
Or boy.

52:28.560 --> 52:33.920
He sent, he sent the first one because what, what happened was he sent this out a regular

52:33.920 --> 52:36.600
tweet, but he tagged me.

52:36.600 --> 52:39.360
So when I followed him, he saw me.

52:39.360 --> 52:40.440
So he followed me.

52:40.440 --> 52:46.960
And then he followed up on his initial tweet, in which he said more about what, you know,

52:46.960 --> 52:47.960
what his feelings were.

52:47.960 --> 52:54.240
So who sent the first direct message to, to you following up, that's what he had already

52:54.240 --> 52:55.240
said.

52:55.240 --> 52:58.880
Hey, hey, Curtis, just so you know, like I really, I really love that movie.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.720
He didn't say that.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.560
It was, it was subtler than that.

53:02.560 --> 53:07.720
It was more like, just so you know, you know, it's a big mistake to spread rumors about

53:07.720 --> 53:08.720
the Coos.

53:08.720 --> 53:09.720
Well, no, no, no.

53:09.720 --> 53:15.880
Those are the two ends of the spectrum.

53:15.880 --> 53:25.800
If you mess with the Coos, you know, Joel Murray did what you did five years ago and

53:25.800 --> 53:30.120
now he's doing improv with Jeff Davis.

53:30.120 --> 53:34.240
I will bury you.

53:34.240 --> 53:37.760
So he didn't come out and say, retract that he, at one point, had.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.760
No, no, no, no.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.760
Look, you know what, there's, it's all, you know, what, what winds up happening is, and

53:41.760 --> 53:48.080
I said this when I, when I messaged him back, I said, this is what happens when you, when

53:48.080 --> 53:53.760
you communicate through, you know, playing telephone, right, you know, to use a really

53:53.760 --> 53:54.760
old thing.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.280
You know, it's older than that Chinese telephone.

53:57.280 --> 54:00.720
That was an expression.

54:00.720 --> 54:05.800
I said, you know, you say one thing, somebody then comes to me and says, did you hear what

54:05.800 --> 54:06.800
he said?

54:06.800 --> 54:08.640
And I go, oh, geez, he said that.

54:08.640 --> 54:10.720
And then it goes back and forth and back and forth.

54:10.720 --> 54:11.720
And that was the way.

54:11.720 --> 54:12.720
That was the way.

54:12.720 --> 54:14.720
So how were things left with you and he?

54:14.720 --> 54:15.720
Fine.

54:15.720 --> 54:16.720
Fine?

54:16.720 --> 54:17.720
Yeah.

54:17.720 --> 54:18.720
I mean.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.720
You guys going to hang out?

54:19.720 --> 54:20.720
No.

54:20.720 --> 54:25.800
You're going to, are you going to help him ski the 4K, or the 5K, 12K, 12K.

54:25.800 --> 54:33.320
Now, the 12K dude, when I hear, and this is just me projecting onto him, he even does

54:33.320 --> 54:34.320
my voice.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.320
It's a little scary.

54:35.320 --> 54:36.320
Well, no, it's unintentional.

54:36.320 --> 54:46.560
No, no, no, I kind of sound like you, regardless.

54:46.560 --> 54:51.320
The 12K dude, that's not bad.

54:51.320 --> 54:53.880
Believe me, it's funnier in context.

54:53.880 --> 54:59.600
There's that scene when he's making the burgers and Van Halen starts singing that terrible,

54:59.600 --> 55:03.000
it's not a good Van Halen song, by the way, for my money, and he starts doing animation

55:03.000 --> 55:04.280
with the burgers and the thing.

55:04.280 --> 55:05.280
Right.

55:05.280 --> 55:09.000
If there was a scene, if I were John Cusack and I looked back at the screening of that,

55:09.000 --> 55:13.040
I would not be proud of that scene because it's pretty, pretty ham bone.

55:13.040 --> 55:16.960
And so when I hear him say he doesn't like the music, I think he's embarrassed about

55:16.960 --> 55:19.120
that one scene more specifically.

55:19.120 --> 55:24.040
Well, that could be, but that takes me into a whole area that I can't even comment on.

55:24.040 --> 55:28.120
And that also makes me wonder, well, how does he feel about Tapeheads?

55:28.120 --> 55:29.440
He must be like a hipster.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.280
He must love Tapeheads.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.280
I have no idea what he likes or doesn't like.

55:33.280 --> 55:37.680
Because I just remember Tapeheads, which was an equally cult, and I bet that had a lot

55:37.680 --> 55:39.760
more street cred with music.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.920
Well, it was an independent movie.

55:41.920 --> 55:44.920
I was working for that company when it was made, actually.

55:44.920 --> 55:49.560
And that was a sort of low-budget, independent, edgy movie of the time.

55:49.560 --> 55:50.560
And Tim Robbins.

55:50.560 --> 55:55.800
How is it that you, so you're this guy in Better Off Dead, which by the way, what order

55:55.800 --> 55:56.800
is that in?

55:56.800 --> 55:58.520
When are you booger in relation to Better Off Dead?

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
I don't even know.

55:59.520 --> 56:06.960
It goes, it goes, it goes Revenge of the Nerds and Better Off Dead the same year.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.400
But Better Off Dead second.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.920
So my confusion is forgivable.

56:09.920 --> 56:10.920
Yes.

56:10.920 --> 56:17.360
But, and then there's, so were you, how does that, I want to hear the kind of story about

56:17.360 --> 56:24.760
you going from, I think every actor has that fork on the road career story, or your one

56:24.760 --> 56:28.160
bedroom apartment and you're thinking of moving back to, where are you from by the

56:28.160 --> 56:29.160
way?

56:29.160 --> 56:30.160
I'm from Detroit.

56:30.160 --> 56:31.160
Okay.

56:31.160 --> 56:32.680
So you're in L.A., I'm assuming, you're?

56:32.680 --> 56:35.600
No, I was in New York then, actually.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.600
Okay.

56:36.600 --> 56:37.600
But what's the threshold?

56:37.600 --> 56:39.400
What's the red light that you don't hit?

56:39.400 --> 56:42.560
I think it was, it was moonlighting, actually, it was none of those.

56:42.560 --> 56:43.560
Wait, what do you mean?

56:43.560 --> 56:44.560
Oh, it's right, you're on moonlighting.

56:44.560 --> 56:48.520
Well, I mean, but that was, God damn, I forgot about it.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.640
That was, I fucking loved that show.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.640
That's not fair though, I knew that, I was going to talk about it.

56:52.640 --> 56:54.040
I didn't know, I forgot about it.

56:54.040 --> 56:57.920
But that's, that's way after, that's after all that.

56:57.920 --> 57:03.120
And I know, but I was still living in New York the whole time, and I would do the movies.

57:03.120 --> 57:09.080
You don't have to realize, you're telling me that in your, in my head, this is how,

57:09.080 --> 57:10.520
this is what I was thinking.

57:10.520 --> 57:13.320
This will give you a great idea, because I started in the theater, okay?

57:13.320 --> 57:19.800
So I was working, like, from mid-seventies to my first movie, which was Risky Business,

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
which was the year before.

57:21.800 --> 57:24.360
Risky Business, I forgot, I knew that one.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.360
How can I forget that?

57:25.360 --> 57:28.520
You had the, the line that defines Risky Business.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
Right.

57:29.520 --> 57:32.200
This is Risky Business, man!

57:32.200 --> 57:34.080
That's kind of like that.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.680
Jesus Christ, this business is risky.

57:36.680 --> 57:46.320
Do you have an idea of how risky this business is?

57:46.320 --> 57:49.600
I forgot you right, I was, I was, I was in it.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.160
I was in that, and, but.

57:51.160 --> 57:54.160
This business is pure risk.

57:54.160 --> 58:00.680
They put me in that movie, and I thought it was the only movie I would ever make, because

58:00.680 --> 58:04.120
I was not thinking in terms of movies, I was thinking in terms of stage.

58:04.120 --> 58:10.840
So when I did Risky Business, I kept a journal every day that I was on the movie for 11 weeks

58:10.840 --> 58:17.440
or 10 weeks, only because I wanted to remember what making a movie was like.

58:17.440 --> 58:21.240
I really thought I would then just go back to doing, you know, regional theater, and

58:21.240 --> 58:24.120
doing, you know, stuff in New York and that, and that was going to be it.

58:24.120 --> 58:28.240
Are you a song and dance man, or are you just a dramatic, you want to play Willie Lohman,

58:28.240 --> 58:29.240
you want to.

58:29.240 --> 58:30.240
No.

58:30.240 --> 58:35.560
No, I, I just do the same rubbish on stage that I do on film.

58:35.560 --> 58:41.600
The, so, okay, so was, where was Risky Business in this, Better Off Dead, slash.

58:41.600 --> 58:46.040
83 was Risky Business, 84 was Revenge of the Nerds, Better Off Dead.

58:46.040 --> 58:49.680
Oh, okay, god damn it, I kept Risky Business out of nowhere.

58:49.680 --> 58:55.120
Anyway, my point is that all of the, what all of that was going on in the, the movies,

58:55.120 --> 59:01.280
the movie things, it was only when I got moonlighting that I actually was out here and working

59:01.280 --> 59:06.840
here and realizing I couldn't go anywhere because we were working, you know, 10 months

59:06.840 --> 59:07.840
out of the year.

59:07.840 --> 59:13.880
So you've always been sort of like on, on surely from the stage, and your, your mind.

59:13.880 --> 59:15.720
I mean, it's hard for me to even think about it now.

59:15.720 --> 59:22.760
That's so funny because I mean, you were, you were Booger slash Charles Dumar, and, and

59:22.760 --> 59:27.600
then I, yeah, at some point I bothered to see Risky Business, but it was about like

59:27.600 --> 59:35.520
sexy people, and I, it wasn't, I forgot that you were in that, and like, and I, moonlighting

59:35.520 --> 59:40.600
was my favorite show, and I was watching it every night, and, and I remember when you

59:40.600 --> 59:46.000
arrived as Miss De Pesto's lover, and, and I remember thinking like, ah, fuck him, he

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
sold out.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Right.

59:48.000 --> 59:54.440
Well, but you were thinking, and so it begins, I guess I'm not going back to the stage.

59:54.440 --> 59:57.440
I was thinking, I now have more than $200.

59:57.440 --> 59:58.440
Right.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:03.000
Because you were just doing these movies that were, yeah, that's despite their cultural

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
efficacy.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.800
Yeah, I mean, now it seems like I must have been just making a fortune.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800
And I wasn't.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.440
That's everyone's perception of everyone they, they see on screen, yeah.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440
Wow.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
All right.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.320
That's why it was so, I mean, because, you know, you do those movies, and I did maybe

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.200
six movies in the whole decade, six or seven movies, and that was it.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.440
Everything else I was doing was stage, you know, there was no money at all.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.000
Do you have anywhere to be?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
When?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Now?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Tonight.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
No, I was going to be here with you.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Right.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I sort of, I sort of cleared my mind.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
You don't have a heart out, do you?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
No, I don't have a heart out.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.160
This is the point where Dan's afraid to, to keep his guests as much as he wants you

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.160
to stay.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.160
No, no, no.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.520
I'm, I'm still good if you're, if you're good.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520
Okay.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.120
You're allowed to fuck straight off if you want to go, but we would love to have you

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.120
stay if you, if you could.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.160
No, I'm going to bring out my, some of my other, thank you.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.880
Uh, I, uh, let's, uh, is Spencer back there?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880
Spencer?

01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880
Are you in the house?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880
Yeah.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880
All right.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.880
Spencer, everybody.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880
Spencer, Chris.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880
Spencer.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:12.360
Oh, oh, my goodness.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:22.800
Oh, oh, it's great to be here.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.800
Spencer, Spencer, did you willfully ignore the most important high five of my life?

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.120
Wait, what are you talking about?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.600
I just hung a high five out there and you walked right by.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.000
Oh, I thought you were like, yay, Spencer, yay.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.840
Yes, but I wanted to make physical contact.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.720
I always want to make physical contact with you, Jeff.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.360
I'm going to, I'm going to fuck the shit out of you after the show.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360
Yeah.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:52.520
Spencer, were you affected in your, uh, upbringing by any of Curtis Armstrong's, uh, oof, oof.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520
Yeah.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520
Yeah.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520
Oh, totally.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.960
Like when I was in a middle school, I remember there's these kids talking about this movie

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.080
and I was like, that sounds like the best movie I've ever heard.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.520
And, uh, it was Revenge of the Nerds and it influenced my life.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.840
All right.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.760
It almost sounds like the answer he'd have if he was just trying to stay out of trouble.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.760
Right.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.760
Exactly.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.560
I definitely remember now that you guys bring it up that kids in middle school were talking

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560
about it.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.720
And I was like, that sounds crazy.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.160
I don't really watch movies.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.480
Uh, I hate to admit it, but yeah, it's a, it's a huge problem in my life because everyone's

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.080
all like, oh, it's like a risky business and I'm like, I don't know what you mean.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.680
Why is, why is this guy wearing underwear?

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.720
I don't, you miss all these, all these reference points.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.280
I don't know.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.840
What are you guys up to?

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.600
There was at least an entire episode of Moonlighting where it was you and Mr. Pesto, uh, uh, because

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600
it was like,

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.840
Yeah, that would happen a lot in broadcast TV back then.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.080
I remember an episode of Miami Vice when Crockett and Tubbs know where to be found and there

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.080
were just two guys.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.080
Yeah.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.220
Those were always, those were always the episodes at Christmas when the stars got to leave

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.960
like on December 1st and they had no one to film.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.600
So they would film us and that was, that was what that was.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.960
How was Sybil Shepard to work with, if I may ask?

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.720
Well, uh, I never had a problem with Sybil Shepard actually.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.120
She was a bit notorious later on.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120
I don't know about that.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:28.560
They were both notorious actually, um, at different points, but, uh, but I never had

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.600
a problem, you know, as far as acting.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600
I never had a problem.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600
I love that show.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.840
My favorite memory of that is my family all watched that.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.560
We didn't watch a lot of shows all as a family, but we watched it together.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.760
But every time Sybil Shepard was on screen, it was so gauzed out like she had this incredible

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.760
filter.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.760
Well, they would joke about that on the show.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.760
Yeah.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.760
They did.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.560
They made a joke about her fill, the filters.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560
Yeah.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.560
She came, she came out into the office.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.560
Well, you know what?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.560
I saw the camera.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.520
And Jerry Fenerman was the DP on Moonlighting.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.860
He was the DP on the original Star Trek.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:02.880
And if you watch the original Star Trek, every time there's a beautiful alien woman,

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.720
it, you know, there'll be Kirk and it's just Kirk.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.000
And then it goes to her close up and it's like she's, uh, you can barely see her.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.040
Somebody's rubbed Vaseline on the lens.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.120
The Vaseline that they've got on the lens.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.400
And it was, it was, uh, it was Jerry Fenerman's sort of his signature.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:27.000
And so he was still doing it in the 80s when it was actually now probably not such a good

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
idea.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Some walk by nerd.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Some walk by nerd.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Very good.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Yeah.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Thank you.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Thank you.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Very good.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
See, I got that.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.120
We've mentioned, uh, Nerddom, Star Trek, and, uh, and a bunch of things.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.400
We haven't even talked about Leonard Nimoy, man.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.400
I know.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.400
Oh, Leonard Nimoy passed.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.400
Yeah.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.400
That's a pretty.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.360
He, he all, all life well lived.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.360
That's one of those mission accomplished deaths that's like, oh, great to live for

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360
you forever.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.360
But we were, you know, 15 years ago, we had made our peace.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.360
Um, well, I expected you to laugh.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.360
It sounds like, I don't know.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360
That one landed on the foul line.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360
I don't know.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360
It was supposed to land so far out that it was funny.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.360
Like I was supposed to, like I was supposed to, I was making fun of myself.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.360
Instead of sounding like you wished him dead 15 years ago.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360
Yeah.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.360
It may be too soon, man, for that joke.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:25.360
I, uh, no, I mean, it's, uh, it's what a, what a, yeah, it's, I, the end of an era

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360
for sure.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.360
Spencer, did, did, uh, original Sirius Star Trek ever cross your path?

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.360
Uh, no, but I did enjoy that ballad of, uh, Bilbo Baggins there.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360
Yeah.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.360
Yeah.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.360
I remember that from his second album.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360
His best.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.360
Two sides of Leonard Nimoy.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:46.360
Is, uh, I consider it, I consider it kind of his Sergeant Pepper.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.360
Yeah.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360
No, definitely.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.360
So Leonard Nimoy was depicted graphically.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.360
Like, was it like, like, you know Leonard Nimoy is this like Vulcan-esque guy.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:00.360
It was exactly the album was called Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy and two pictures in profile,

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.360
one of Leonard as a, as Leonard and the other as Spock.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.360
Yeah.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.360
There's a great photo that Proup sent me today.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.360
It's a, it's him and a turtleneck hanging out with Jimmy Hendricks.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.360
And it's like, yeah.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360
Yeah.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.360
Because you like, you see, when that, that, that's weird, isn't it?

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.360
That there was a time when those things, Jimmy looks more excited to be with Leonard

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360
Nimoy than vice versa.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.360
I, well, can you imagine being, like, like, and being alive at a time, like, working

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.360
at a time when Star Trek was on the air.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.360
Yeah.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.360
And then Spock walking into a party.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.360
Like, are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360
Yeah.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360
Like, we get excited about Jeff Goldblum.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.360
Like, oh, he's kind of the Spock of Jurassic Park.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360
I don't know.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:45.360
Like, like, it's not, there's nothing like, like, I mean, Spock walked in the door.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360
That's a different thing.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360
Yeah.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360
Like, specifically Leonard Nimoy.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.360
Like, such a crazy, like, like, striking looking guy.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360
Oh, I, it's 9-Eleven.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.360
And don't we have a, are we, are we going to do a new tradition at 9-Eleven?

01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.360
What was it?

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.360
I forget.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.360
It was Make-A-Wish.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.360
Oh, yeah.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.360
It's your 9-Eleven wish.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.360
I wish, I wish for no more 9-Elevens, but, all right, let's forget that.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.360
I wish, I wish Leonard Nimoy dropped dead 15 years ago.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:17.360
Curtis, do you want to make a wish?

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.360
It's still 9-Eleven.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.360
Make your 9-Eleven wish before it's over.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.360
No, I can't, I can't.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.360
That's too much pressure for me.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360
Spencer, you get a 9-Eleven wish?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.360
I just want to be, we didn't actually settle, that was one of the pitches was to make a

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.360
wish, but that was not where we settled.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.360
I thought there was one that I jazzed to more than a wish.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.360
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.360
There was, I don't know what it is.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.360
Did anybody recall from last week?

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.360
I just love killing momentum.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.360
Whoa.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.360
Wow.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.360
Wow.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.360
It's more of an opportunity.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.360
Like a 9-Eleven during 9-Eleven.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:55.360
I just made a new wish, motherfucker.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.360
Did my wife ever make it here?

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360
Yeah.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360
Is Erin here?

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.360
Erin McGathy.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:14.360
Good day to the stage.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360
Hello.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.360
Hello.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360
Hi.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.360
Erin is the reason why we watch your show in bed with our dogs, our many dogs.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.360
We have a very specific fetish.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360
It was just outlined.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360
That's a really specific one.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.360
Curtis, I heard that not all of your summers have been sane.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.360
Curtis was in one crazy summer.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360
Did you guys bring that up already?

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360
Yeah, we did, actually.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.360
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360
You talked about that, but that's all right.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360
The pikey takes a long time with the burger.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.360
It's nice to know that you were listening to the show.

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.360
Me and my best friend, Kimber, is backstage.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.360
We got some burgers.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360
We ordered them with some boogers.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.360
Where'd you get the burgers from?

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.360
That's what I want to know.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.360
I don't know why in that moment I thought you were.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.360
I can't see him, so when that voice comes out, I get confused.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360
It's a real layout issue.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360
No.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360
Where'd the burgers come from?

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.360
I'm sorry I brought it up.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.360
It's very boring.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.360
We ordered burgers from the pikey thinking that we would get them before eight o'clock,

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.360
and we didn't.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.360
That's not boring at all.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.360
That story is a rich tapestry.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.360
That's a Navajo quilt.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.360
I'm very embarrassed about my one crazy summer joke,

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360
because I was about to come out and I'm like,

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.360
they haven't even mentioned one crazy summer.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360
We're going to be real cool.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Covered that first, actually.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.360
Well, this is One Boring Spring.

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.360
There's a segment I'd like to do.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.360
I'd like to add a segment that comes after 9-11

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.360
called Dan's Getting Tipsy.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.360
Play the theme music.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.360
Because this now is my favorite song of all time.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:06.360
From the morning to the night, you're going to drink, drink, drink, drink and drink.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.360
Family, family.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.360
There's always going to come a point, obviously, of the show,

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.360
because I drink throughout the show,

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:20.360
I start to lose control and start to regret.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.360
The reason I don't listen to the show the next night.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.360
Were you drinking before the show?

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.360
What I wanted to say is, no, I wasn't drinking.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360
What are you, Dr. Drew?

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.360
I'm just saying.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.360
Were you easing as a kid?

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.360
No, I was in the edit bay, but I just sit here.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.360
You sit down and you start to earn this drinking during the show.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.360
I started to get a little buzz, and then I started to think,

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.360
I just wanted to say, Curtis, you look so great on the show,

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.360
on the King of the Nerd show.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.360
You look so activated and glowing and happy and handsome and delivering so much.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.360
That's why I want people to watch the show.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.360
Because I look much better than I do here.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.360
Spencer, Molly just kicked in, so I want to tell you this.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.360
There's a segment for that, too.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.360
Everyone's drugs are kicking in.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:17.360
This is very dumb, but I think maybe, I'll call it 10 years ago,

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.360
give or take.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.360
I was at a Chipotle on Sunset Boulevard, and you were in front of me,

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.360
and I wanted to hug you, because there's Curtis.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.360
I was so happy, and I was too shy to say hello,

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.360
but I was very happy to be standing behind Curtis,

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.360
and I'm strong at the Chipotle.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.360
I think it was a different word.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.360
Baja fresh.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360
Now do you remember?

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360
Oh, the Baja fresh.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.360
I was the guy right behind you.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.360
You were the guy behind me that time.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360
I was the guy.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360
You know why I remember?

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.360
It was the only time I ever went into that place.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.360
Because it's such a risky business.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.360
That was the right response.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360
That was pretty crazy.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.360
When your business doesn't have insurance,

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:13.360
it is taking certain gambles on the lawn,

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.360
beat, beat, financial risk.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.360
Everybody's going to do it.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.360
Risky business.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.360
Curtis, you're so joyful on that show,

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.360
and you clearly are super into it.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.360
Has anybody brought up your rap, your TBS rap?

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360
My rap?

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.360
No, no one brought it up.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360
You have a rap?

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.360
Yeah, I think it's called On Fridays.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.360
Well, I don't know.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360
I'm not sure what it was called.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360
Is anybody familiar with Curtis's rap?

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.360
I'm going to try to do it.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.360
Oh, it's, no, you know what?

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360
King of the Nerds.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.360
King of the Nerds.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.360
King of the Nerds on Friday.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.360
TBS on Friday.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360
Nine o'clock.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360
The King of the Nerds.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.360
The King of the Nerds.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.360
The King of the Nerds.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.360
The King of the Nerds.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360
The Nerds is back.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.360
Back in the nerdiest nerd town.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.360
No, Nerds, New Night, New Nerds, in fact.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.360
The Ultimate Nerds in the Ultimate Showdown.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.360
Battlehead.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.360
Comes out for the Ultimate Nerd Crown.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.360
King of the Nerds.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360
Something like that.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360
Hashtag something.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.360
Hashtag nerds rule.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.360
Wish you would have known back in high school.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360
Yeah.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360
Wow.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.360
I kind of feel bad that MC John didn't sit on that one.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360
Yeah.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360
No.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.360
Dan has a new rap character.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.360
And I'm expecting, you know, Kanye to come out here any second.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:47.360
Also, Curtis, you've been, you've exposed a lot of skin this season.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.360
How do you feel about that?

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360
I got naked.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.360
Was that your pitch or was that, what was the...

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:58.360
Yeah, it was the only time I've ever actually appeared in front of people without any clothes on.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360
So we had a theory about that.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360
What was it?

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.360
Because you're, so you're EPing the show with Karenine.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.360
Yeah.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.360
He seems a little, like, can we talk about Bobby?

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
He, like, does he...

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.360
Can we talk about Bobby?

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.360
He seems less invested than the show than you.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360
Oh, no, no, no.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360
Not at all.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.360
No, he's absolutely, it's just, I mean, you know, you have two people.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.360
If we were both doing exactly the same thing, that would be...

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360
Right.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.360
Oh, so he...

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.360
He does what he does.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360
So he said, you're gonna get naked and you're like, yeah, I'll get naked.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.360
Yeah, no, no, I'll be, you know, we just, we had to get naked because, I had to get naked

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.360
because I will do anything.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:39.360
And they were trying to figure out, it was, well, I mean, the limits.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:47.360
But they were, they, we needed to explain why, this is so stupid, but we, it was actually

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.360
just because we needed to explain why the nerds were not gonna pick their teams this year.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.360
I mean, you didn't have to do what you did.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360
It's great, but it's good.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.360
Somebody said, one of the show runners said, what about if we do Terminator and you show

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.360
up naked from the future to explain why the nerds can't do this?

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.360
So I said, great, because it was like...

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360
It was fantastic.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.360
Yeah.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.360
It was a great idea.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.360
I was worried it was not gonna pay off until the end of the season that you guys were trying

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360
to do like a seasonal thing.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.360
Like this was the season when...

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360
Well, we've done it now.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.360
I mean, we did it, you know, after the first season, we came back with an explanation.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.360
We have to figure out why the king is dead.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360
No, no, you don't.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360
You don't.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.360
No, we do.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360
But it's very nerdy of you to do it.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360
We do that.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360
You don't have to do it.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.360
It's true.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360
No one, the bachelor never says like...

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.360
We ran out of roses on the first season.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360
We gave them all away.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.360
Yeah, we had to put them down.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.360
That's why we're different.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.360
But I guess they're not saying it's the king of married people on that show.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360
Like they're just saying, you two are married, fuck off.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.360
And you're saying it's the king of the nerds.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.360
No, I love that.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.360
Each season begins with the reason why the king of the nerds is now gone.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.360
So we have to get a new king and it has to...

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.360
You know, it's a science fiction thing.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.360
With those bits, like this is the third season.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.360
Have there been any that you've regretted?

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.360
Oh, what?

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360
You mean nerds?

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.360
Oh, well, sure.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.360
No, no, your bits like the Terminator...

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.360
Oh, no, no, no, I don't regret anything.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.360
Oh, that's good.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360
But you've regretted some of the nerds?

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.360
No, no, I don't regret them either.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.360
I thought if that's what you were going to ask, I was going to say,

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.360
no, I don't have any regrets about the nerds.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.360
And I have no regrets about anything I've ever done.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.360
Do you have any regrets in life?

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.360
He just said, no, you fucking asshole.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.360
Well, no.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.360
You're talking about the shot, guys.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.360
Wait a minute.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.360
He was asking about life.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.360
I was saying that I don't have any regrets about my career.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360
Oh, okay.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360
I mean, you know.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360
I just thought you should regret that question.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360
Well, I mean, he...

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.360
Yeah.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.360
I like you regret nothing.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.360
No, I regret nothing.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.360
I don't regret asking that question.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360
Fuck you.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
Yeah.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
All right.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.360
Now, do you regret saying bullshit?

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.360
No.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:01.360
Let's not acknowledge this asshole that keeps on talking to the audience.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360
Who got away?

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.360
Did you ever have any romances with any co-stars?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360
What?

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360
On the...

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360
You have to be more specific.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360
Oh!

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360
You mean...

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360
I mean, on the nerds?

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360
I mean, on the nerds?

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360
Like when you were wearing that Dickensian cap,

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.360
you had a better off dad or...

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360
Oh, my little top hat.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360
Oh, that was a big top hat, Curtis.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.360
Have I ever had romances on jobs, you mean?

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360
Yes.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360
Of course.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.360
Or what...

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.360
Was that cool?

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360
At the time.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.360
You don't have to say whom, but is there anyone that's like a very...

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.360
like a Diane Keaton where you're like,

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.360
I know what it looks like.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.360
Is there any...?

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360
No.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360
No, there's nothing like that.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
Nothing like that.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.360
It could be anything.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.360
Curtis, do you know what Diane Keaton's badge looks like?

01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:05.360
It has a very tasteful vest.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.360
You're saying Diane Keaton's vagina dresses up like Annie Hall?

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.360
I'm saying Diane Keaton's vagina dresses up like Diane Keaton, who dresses up like Annie Hall.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360
She's not always in a vest.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360
No, she's not, but that...

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
King of the Nerds!

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360
King of the Nerds!

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.360
King of the Nerds on Fridays!

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.360
All right.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360
All right.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.360
So thanks for doing that, because it gives me a chance to say it's on Fridays.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.360
And, you know, we're still running at this point.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.360
And it's doing well in the ratings now.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360
It's doing well in the ratings.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.360
Yeah.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.360
Which is a relief.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360
It is for me.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.360
I'm a TVist and you can't tell.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.360
I don't know when I'm watching the show.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.360
Usually in the old days in TV, you'd go like, well, obviously,

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.360
Manimal is killing.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.360
Because now the peacock has a fin on it.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.360
Because it turns into a shark and...

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.360
Wait, are you joking about that?

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.360
Did Manimal morph the peacock into other animals?

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360
No.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.360
Goddamn, that would be great.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360
No, because Manimal never killed.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.360
I used to...

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360
You ever pretended to be Manimal?

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.360
I would do a thing where I'd put my hand on my desk and make my finger pulse.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.360
Remember when Manimal was like, is this going to hand or puff out?

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.360
I had a Manimal trick when I was a kid.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.360
Jack Black, I think I've told this on the show.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.360
Jack Black was, when we were doing Heat Vision and Jack,

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.360
we were swapping stories about the influence of Six Million Dollar Man.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.360
And he said that he would go to school.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.360
I just talked about this, didn't I, on this podcast?

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.360
When he was in sixth grade, because he loved Six Million Dollar Man so much,

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.360
he would sometimes tuck wires, electrical wires into his sleeve,

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.360
and go to class and wait for, in his peripheral vision,

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.360
for another kid to possibly see the wires,

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.360
but not look at the kid and just hide the wires.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.360
Because he was that into...

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360
That's great.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360
He wanted to be a secret robot.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360
Wow.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.360
That's such a little...

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.360
I did something like that.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360
Do you want to hear what mine was?

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.360
Because I wasn't into Six Million Dollar Man,

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.360
but I just wasn't okay.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.360
Was that that same guy who keeps asking questions?

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.360
Okay, I didn't like it, okay?

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.360
But what I did, I loved Sherlock Holmes, though.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.360
I was really into Sherlock Holmes.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.360
Like, in what incarnation? Just the books.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360
Wow.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.360
A real nerd.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.360
Yeah.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:31.360
And my bedroom overlooked the street outside my parents' house.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360
And so what I would do,

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.360
because I couldn't get dates and I had no friends,

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.360
so I would lower my shade and light myself from behind.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.360
And then this friend of mine had given me...

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360
No.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.360
Stop. Let me finish.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360
So this friend of mine...

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360
I know where you're headed, Curtis.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.360
Had given me a violin, which had no strings.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:03.360
And I would stand in front of the shade and pretend to play the violin.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.360
That's called homologing.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.360
Hoping somebody would walk by and go,

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.360
boy, he's really more interesting than I thought.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.360
That is...

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360
That's great.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360
I actually did that.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.360
Was that based on an image that was described by Conan Doyle?

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.360
Yeah, so he's walking, you know, that acolyne figure walking past the shade.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.360
I would do that only if it was my figure was not really...

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360
Curtis, you know how you would...

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360
From the side, I have no nose at all.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.360
I mean, you can see it when I'm facing you.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360
But when you go to the side, I have no profile.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360
Now, when you picture Sherlock Holmes,

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.360
do you picture one of the actors from the films?

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.360
No, I picture what I saw in my head when I first read the books.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360
Who would that look like?

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360
It doesn't look like anybody that is in any of the movies.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360
Yeah.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.360
John Cusack.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.360
John Cusack, right.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.360
John Cusack?

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.360
Yeah.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.360
Yeah.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:00.360
When that Sherlock Holmes movie came out with Robert Downey Jr.,

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:04.360
I was amazed to see a sequence in that movie

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.360
that I had written into a script for the Heat Vision and Jack movie as a joke,

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.360
which is the idea that if you can get so intelligent

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.360
that you can know how to beat somebody up.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360
Oh, yeah.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.360
And I was like, that was the joke in the Heat Vision and Jack movie

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.360
is that he would get super intelligent

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.360
and then he'd be like, you know, describing with diagrams

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360
the way that he would punch people.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.360
And it's like, and then they did it for real

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.360
and they made a lot of money.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360
Yeah.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360
Nobody cared.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.360
Nobody laughed.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360
Everyone just went, here's my money.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.360
I love that he's so smart, he can beat you up.

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360
Oh, man.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360
Yeah.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.360
I was introduced to Revenge of the Nerds as a camp counselor.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.360
I had to chaperone a bus of a bunch of kids

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.360
going to compete in a soccer game,

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360
the sports competition,

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.360
even though I wasn't a sports counselor.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.360
And the most jockey, most handsome counselor was like,

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360
I got to show you guys this movie

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.360
because we got to watch movies on the buses.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.360
So this other counselor played Revenge of the Nerds

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.360
and it was such a crisis of self

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360
as an uncomfortable teenager,

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360
all these jocks laughing at it.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360
And the entire time I was like, what did you explain to me?

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360
Is it funny?

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360
Is it funny because you're laughing at them?

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.360
Or you would feel nerdy inside?

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360
Or what's happening?

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.360
It was just a strange...

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360
I remember that too.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360
All the kids were kind of laughing.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.360
They weren't nerds, but they loved that movie.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.360
The funny thing is, over the years,

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360
I get approached by people all the time.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.360
Guys on the street will come up to me

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.360
and they are clearly jocks.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.360
I mean, they've got no neck.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.360
They've got buzz cuts and all this

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.360
and the muscles and everything.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.360
I mean, they're ridiculous.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.360
They look so jocky.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:50.360
And they will come up to me and say,

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.360
Revenge of the Nerds, right?

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.360
And I go, yeah, yeah.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.360
That movie meant a lot to me.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.360
That was what my life was.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360
And I'm saying thank you.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360
Thank you.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360
It's very nice of you.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.360
And inside I'm going, fuck you.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.360
You beat up people like me.

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.360
But then I started thinking over time,

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.360
I was going, you know what?

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.360
Even within the jock world, there's a pecking order.

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.360
And it's possible that the guy that I'm talking to

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.360
was the guy who they called Tiny.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360
That's the thing.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:27.360
I remember doing stand-up in Michigan

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360
and I was talking to these motorcycle guys.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360
They were all super intimidating

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.360
and I was trying to intimidate me.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360
And then there was this one guy

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.360
and they kept calling him Cage.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360
They're like, there's Cage.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.360
Hey, Cage, you get the drinks.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.360
And Cage is like, all right.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.360
And then throughout the night,

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.360
I was like, Cage was more available to me.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.360
So I was like, so Cage, what's it like

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360
with this motorcycle group?

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360
And he's like, well, they do this.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360
And they're like, hey, Cage, come on.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360
And he's like, fine.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360
And then they started laughing.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.360
And they're like, you don't like being called Cage, do you?

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360
And he's like, no, I don't.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.360
And I was like, why don't you like being called Cage?

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360
It's like badass.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.360
And he's like, Cage is what you call a car.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360
I can't drive a motorcycle anymore.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.360
I drive a car.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:20.360
They call cars Cage's because they're free.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360
Wait, wait, wait.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.360
He thought that because they called him Cage,

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.360
he wasn't allowed to drive a motorcycle.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.360
No, no, they were teasing him.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.360
His name wasn't even Cage.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.360
Had he lost a motorcycle license?

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360
Yeah, something had happened.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360
And he couldn't drive the motorcycle.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.360
And so they were calling him the equivalent

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.360
of calling him lefty because he lost his right hand.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360
He should have taken himself so seriously.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360
The point being that they're...

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360
No, you're right.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360
That's the same thing.

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.360
It's very rare for a cool jock to actually feel cool,

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360
all the people that we think feel cool.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360
Or it's all a continuum in that the point is

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.360
that everywhere you go, there is no such thing.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360
That's why the nerd movement, eventually,

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.360
the nerd movement, once we started,

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.360
gave a name to feeling like the other.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.360
It was only a matter of time before that would be mainstream

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360
because everyone feels like the other.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360
There's no one that you've talked to.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.360
You go to your 20-year high school reunion.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.360
Nobody is self-identifies as normal.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.360
Nobody...

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:19.360
No.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.360
That's true.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360
There's a bunch of people that you thought picked on you

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360
and that were all represented the normal people.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.360
And within them, they were chewing each other to pieces,

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.360
which is what we learned from Molly Ringwald

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360
and Breakfast Club.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360
It's hard to be...

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.360
There's also a pride in what...

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.360
I guess in the nerd community is that it does worship intelligence.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.360
It worships knowledge, information.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.360
It worships efficacy, yeah.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360
And it's obsession.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.360
It's obsession.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.360
You acquire...

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.360
Even if you're not a PhD,

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.360
you've acquired vast amounts of knowledge

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.360
about whatever you are interested in.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360
About at least one specific thing.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360
When you were saying something about the...

01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.360
What's the comic book guy doing when you've got PhDs?

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.360
Well, the comic book guy, if you get him into a room with a PhD,

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.360
is going to be able to whoop the PhD on comic book information.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.360
So that makes that person intelligent in that way.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.360
And that's...

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.360
Everybody's got their thing,

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.360
and when nerds become obsessive about something,

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.360
they become brilliant.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360
Have you ever played any...

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360
Should I stop talking a while?

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.360
Am I still talking?

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.360
Curtis, have you ever played any role-playing games?

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.360
It is.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.360
You ask such interesting questions.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360
She doesn't mean sexually.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360
She means like D&D.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360
I'm not sure now.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.360
Have you ever broken in as a sexy burglar?

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360
Every question she's asked me,

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360
I've had to have a follow-up,

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360
because I'm not sure how to answer them.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360
Role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons?

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.360
No.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.360
Well, you're gonna...

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.360
You're about to right now.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.360
You're about to play a game called Shadow Run.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360
Okay.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.360
Alright, so Spencer is our Game Master.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.360
Can I just ask, so earlier when you said,

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360
do I have a heart out?

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360
You said no.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.360
And I said no.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.360
I remember that.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360
If I had said yes,

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360
then I wouldn't have had this heart out.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360
You were answering this question, yeah.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360
Okay.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360
You would be gone right now.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360
I'd be home by now.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.360
I like that you thought I just asked you if you role-play.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.360
Curtis, do you role-play?

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.360
You said, do you play role-playing games?

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.360
Also, you asked him if he had sex with women.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.360
Yeah, that's right.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.360
I have put myself into this.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.360
So you have asked a couple of questionable questions.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360
That's true.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360
But you've been talking.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.360
Wait a minute.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.360
You know what?

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.360
If this means I have to read something,

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360
you may be out of luck, pal.

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:49.360
Oh, well, yeah.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.360
Oh, no, I can probably read this.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360
Well, you need like glasses or...

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.360
I mean, I never know what's going on in these pages.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.360
Alright.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360
You can fake it.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.360
I don't know if I can fake it.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.360
I may have to have somebody get my glasses from the other room.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.360
Oh, that's easy.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.360
Can you do that?

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360
Can you have somebody do that?

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.360
I'll find them.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.360
They're in my coat.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.360
They're in my coat.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.360
They're in his coat.

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.360
Is there anything else in your coat I should know about

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:13.360
before I go through your coat?

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360
No, and there better not be anything in my coat

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.360
when I put it on later.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.360
I'm not gross.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:31.360
I'm not gross.

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.360
See, this coat is called children's porn, so...

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.360
Wait a minute.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:41.360
Not porn of children, but porn that's owned by children.

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360
Porn that children would make if they...

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360
If you said, hey, make a porn movie.

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.360
It's like a crayon and a donut.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:55.360
And they just go on a donut slide together.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.360
New zine idea.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360
Thank you.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.360
Okay, so...

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360
It's just...

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360
This is...

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.360
Your character has been handed to you.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360
It's a lot of...

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.360
It's a lot of little scrawly writing,

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.360
little statistics and things.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.360
They won't come into play unless you're asked.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.360
Essentially what it is, is it's improvised storytelling

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.360
with Spencer is the one that's in control

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.360
of anything that happens,

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.360
because he's the game master.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.360
So he's telling us what's happening,

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.360
but each of us is a character.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.360
There's no high pressure to it,

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360
because it's kind of turn-based.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.360
You're not like...

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.360
That's taped.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.360
So he's letting us know what's going on,

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:43.360
and then there's a point where we can do something.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.360
You can say, oh, I walk up the street,

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.360
or I go over to the vending machine,

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.360
and I punch it, or whatever you want to do.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.360
And then Spencer, who's the referee

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.360
and who understands the rules to the game,

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.360
he might say to you, what's your agility?

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360
And it's okay that it takes a half hour for you to go.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.360
It's three, because you find it somewhere on the sheet,

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.360
and you go, it's three.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360
And that's basically how it goes.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.360
Your agility.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.360
That's an example, yeah.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.360
That's the question that's often asked me

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.360
that I never have the answer to immediately.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:16.360
So in brief, like broad strokes, you're playing...

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360
You mean attribute.

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.360
Your attribute.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.360
You said agility, but you meant attribute.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360
Well, I was using...

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.360
I was riffing an example, yes, of an attribute.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.360
Agility, for instance.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.360
Yes, I was...

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.360
I'm not stupid.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360
I was looking for...

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.360
I'm sorry, but I was looking for agility,

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.360
the list of possible things for agility,

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.360
and there's no agility.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.360
There's attributes.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360
There's attributes, and then one of the attributes is agility.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360
I was just...

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.360
As an example.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360
The second attribute down is agility.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360
Oh, agility, yeah.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.360
I've never thought of...

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360
Agility as an attribute?

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360
Agility as an attribute.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360
Never mind.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.360
Okay.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.360
All right, so Spencer, do you want to briefly fill Curtis in

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.360
on what his character is for the evening?

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360
Your character is a doctor.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.360
He has a gun.

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.360
He could heal people.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360
Did you say he has a gun?

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360
Yeah, like...

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.360
Okay.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.360
Like a doctor.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360
Stupid me.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.360
I'm just...

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.360
I'm sorry.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.360
You guys are criminals.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.360
He has a gun.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.360
Thou might do some harm.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.360
Right, exactly.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360
Okay.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360
Yeah, you guys are criminals.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:28.360
You do missions for, you know, criminal employers.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.360
Oh, so not a medical doctor.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:31.360
He's...

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.360
He's like a doctor...

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.360
Like doctor...

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360
Doctor...

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.360
Evil.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.360
It's like bull.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.360
You're like a street doctor.

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.360
You work with criminals, and when criminals need medical help,

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360
you're the one that comes and passes them.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.360
Oh, I'm the guy.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.360
Oh, I'm that guy.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.360
You're like a mob doctor.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360
Okay, I'm the mob doctor.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.360
And it's the future.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.360
We're kind of like the A-team.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.360
It's the future.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.360
This is like 70 years in the future or so,

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.360
and we're kind of like the A-team.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.360
We're a bunch of like...

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.360
Okay.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.360
You know, we're specialists in certain ways.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.360
Dan's very strong.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360
Aaron's very charming and charismatic

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:02.360
and can talk away in and out of situations.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.360
I'm a magic user, so I can cast spells and shit like that.

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:10.360
So right now, we're looking for a guy named Baldwin Brown,

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.360
if I'm not mistaken.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360
Yeah.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.360
And we're trying to capture this guy

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.360
and bring him back to our contact.

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.360
So, Spencer, if you would, why don't you give us the brief...

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360
How do you do this?

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.360
And catch us up to date, please.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.360
All right.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.360
Last time on Shadowrun.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.360
Our heroes were in the warehouse looking for Baldwin Brown,

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.360
but he was nowhere to be found.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:42.360
So together, our heroes tased a bunch of junkies

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.360
and then slapped them away and then asked them questions

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.360
and then shoved RFID tags into their stomachs.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:55.360
Eve sent off a, you know, hawk spirit to find Baldwin,

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:58.360
but he would not return in some time.

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.360
Together, the heroes gathered up the illicit merchandise

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:08.360
and headed off towards the neutral drop zone.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.360
That's all.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360
All clear.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.360
Pretty...

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.360
Thank you, Spencer.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.360
Yep.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360
So pretty cut and dry there.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360
Yep.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.360
Did we...

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.360
I can't remember, did we...

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.360
Did we...

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360
We took a truck, right?

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360
The ladies are driving.

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.360
You're in a truck.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360
The fellas are in the back.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.360
The quarter guards are driving.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.360
Yeah.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360
And we're meeting up with our Johnson.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.360
Okay.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.360
And Curtis's character, the doctor,

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360
we haven't encountered him yet, right?

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360
Oh, he's been there.

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.360
Oh, so you happen to have him.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.360
So we don't have horticard.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.360
And so I'm in the back of the truck with you,

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360
Jim Nightblade, who is Dan.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360
And Dr...

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.360
Dr. Friend.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.360
Dr. Friend.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.360
Dr. Friend.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:52.360
Dr. Friend, up in the front maybe with Mercy, right?

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.360
Wherever he wants to be, man.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.360
Well, which is it?

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.360
What part of the truck do you want to be in the back of the semi?

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.360
Like...

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360
No, I want to be shotgun.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360
Okay.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360
You're shotgun.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.360
I mean, it seems appropriate.

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.360
What's your agility?

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:08.360
My agility is four.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.360
All right.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.360
Just checking.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360
Just checking.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360
That's good.

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.360
That's good time.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.360
All right.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.360
So we're...

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.360
And that's four out of ten?

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.360
I think it maxed out like 15 or something.

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360
Oh, 15.

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.360
Yeah.

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.360
We're new at...

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.360
I should be more than four then.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.360
But anyway.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.360
We're just starting out.

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.360
It's your game.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.360
No, you're a troll also.

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.360
You're not like a human.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.360
You're a troll.

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:37.360
Of course.

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
I should have mentioned that.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.360
A Dr. Gangster troll.

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.360
Yeah.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.360
Okay.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:47.360
It sounds like a Curtis Armstrong part, actually.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.360
All right.

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:52.360
Through my comm link, we all have a little...

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.360
We can all communicate to each other through comm links.

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.360
I say to Mercy.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.360
Mercy, where are we headed?

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.360
We're heading to...

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.360
We're going to the Johnson, right?

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360
Yeah.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.360
Sweet.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.360
We're going to the Johnson.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:07.360
I still have this photograph of Brian.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.360
Baldwin.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360
Baldwin.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.360
Of Baldwin standing in front of a bathroom.

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.360
So I'm looking at that.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.360
We're headed to the Johnson.

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.360
I don't like any of it.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.360
You've been a problem this whole time, friend.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.360
I can't go against my training.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.360
Okay, friend.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:33.360
I've been trying to help as much as I can, but I have to remember I am a doctor.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.360
All right.

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.360
Respect your integrity.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:41.360
How long does it take?

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.360
It's not integrity.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360
I've sold myself.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:51.360
I've sold myself to you people.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:37:02.360
And if it wasn't for him knowing what he knows, I'd walk away from all of this.

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.360
Hey, Nightblade.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360
Yeah, what the fuck's going on, Nightblade?

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.360
What do you got in this guy?

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.360
What are you holding over his head?

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.360
What are you talking about?

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360
We're a crew, Nightblade.

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.360
I don't want any blackmail happening behind our backs.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.360
This has got to be about trust.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.360
It's not about blackmail.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.360
It's about friendship and trust.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.360
Something you guys wouldn't know about.

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.360
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.360
Ask a friend.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.360
All right, doctor.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.360
Why don't you patch up your relationship while we get to the Johnson?

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360
Listen, doctor, I'll tell you one thing right now.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360
Life on the sprawl is all about secrets.

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.360
It's all about selling yourself.

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.360
If we had our way, we wouldn't be committing crimes for a living, believe me.

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:47.360
You know, I could always tell, you're different from them.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:50.360
You are.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.360
You don't have to be here.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.360
I don't want...

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360
You could do better than this.

01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.360
I'm a magic elf that is trained to use magic by Native Americans.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.360
Oh, come on, man.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360
I'm a girl.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.360
I'm a girl.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360
I'm a girl.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.360
Magic female elf.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.360
Woman, for God's sake.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.360
You're more than that.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360
What am I supposed to do?

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.360
Just go back and hide in the woods and do what?

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.360
I got to make a living somehow.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:22.360
Shh, they're coming.

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:24.360
Doctor, doctor, who's coming?

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.360
Who's coming?

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.360
Doctor, who's coming?

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.360
Pull over the car!

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
Pull over the car!

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360
Can we pull over the car?

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.360
Yeah, horticard.

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.360
I'm not driving.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.360
You're going to have to pull over the car.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.360
Stop.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.360
Horticard does that.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.360
Horticard's driving.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360
Okay, okay.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.360
Sorry.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.360
Hey, doctor, real quick.

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.360
Yeah.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360
I'm not going to forget what you said.

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360
We'll have to talk later.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.360
Okay.

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.360
We can all hear you.

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:52.360
I pulled over the car so you could talk privately, but I guess it doesn't matter.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.360
Skip back on the road.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.360
Okay, let's put it.

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.360
You just had us pull over.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:56.360
I know.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.360
I know.

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360
I know.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360
I'm flustered.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.360
We'd get there faster if we didn't keep pulling over.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360
I'll just say that.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360
Well, he said they're coming.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360
Who's coming?

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.360
I guess it doesn't make sense that I pulled over if someone's coming.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360
They're coming.

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.360
Let's meet them.

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.360
They seem nice.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360
Okay, let's put a pin in this.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360
I don't want to invalidate your feelings.

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.360
I will tell you the thing that I know about this guy that I have over him.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.360
He thinks they're coming a lot, even when they're not.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360
All right.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.360
That's right.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.360
What's our ETA to the Johnson hookup?

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360
Yeah, what's our ETA to the Johnson hookup?

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.360
Oh, once we get back on the road, it'll just be a couple minutes.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.360
Okay.

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360
Let's drive again.

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360
Horticard?

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360
Okay.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.360
No, we were driving.

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360
You just had us pull out.

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360
I know.

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.360
Are they coming again?

01:39:45.360 --> 01:40:01.360
No, it's the problem is that my thing about them coming, I lost a patient because I was

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.360
thinking about them coming.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360
All right, let's pull over.

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.360
Can we just get to the thing?

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.360
Can we just have one?

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:19.360
Dr. Frenn has said nothing for hours, and he waits until a crucial moment to bring up

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.360
past issues, and I feel like we should deal with this.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.360
Okay, here we are.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.360
We're pulling up in front of the Johnson.

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.360
So you enter the parking lot, which is the location of the neutral drop zone.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:37.360
It's a fenced off affair squished between a number of low buildings.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.360
The fence is covered in chains, but it stands wide open.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:46.360
Cars and trucks lined the street outside the parking lot and broken damaged buildings

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.360
lined the sky.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.360
I don't know.

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.360
Some of the buildings are lit up by orange light.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.360
No one is in the lot that you can see, but it's where you're supposed to meet.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:05.360
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.360
Wait, are you doing your moonlighting impression?

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.360
What is that?

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.360
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360
Come out to the coast and have a few laughs.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:21.360
Curtis, just so you know, Dan's character is strongly influenced by Bruce Willis.

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.360
Post moonlighting, Bruce Willis.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.360
Post moonlighting, okay.

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.360
It's nighttime, right Spencer?

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.360
Oh yeah, okay.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.360
I want to draw my weapon and get ready before I...

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.360
What?

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.360
What?

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.360
Okay, sorry.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:43.360
Just Jim, you always lead with force and we don't know what's going on.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.360
I'm getting out of a truck in an abandoned, vacant lot that we've been summoned to

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.360
that's loaded with valuable goods.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:59.360
Sorry, I thought I was talking to the guy who beat up a bunch of people for no reason previously.

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.360
One man's no reason as another man's precaution.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.360
Yes, exactly.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.360
Yes, precisely.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.360
Thank you.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:12.360
That is what I was saying.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:16.360
So I'm just saying I'm drawing my Aries predator or whatever it is.

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:24.360
Because I'm going to get out of the trailer now, I've been in the back of a truck like garbage.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:30.360
Alright, you hop out of the trailer in the parking lot, the location of the neutral drop zone.

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:36.360
You don't see anything around other than tons of cars and trucks that are just in the lot parked.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.360
They lie still.

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.360
Is anyone playing horticard?

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.360
No, I am.

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:48.360
He's the guy we need to horticard. I want to know if there's people in any of these cars and trucks.

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.360
Oh, I detect a person.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.360
Where?

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.360
There. He points in the direction of a truck.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:06.360
I'm going to put a spell on him. I'm going to cast a spell on him.

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.360
Alright, what do you want to cast?

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:16.360
He's now unable to do anything and we can take our time to figure out what our next move is.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:27.360
I can do that because I have a level 5 spell casting.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.360
And then these are your spells.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.360
Oh, yeah. Oh, these are the spells.

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.360
You don't have spell making up.

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.360
He has level 3 UCB spell.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.360
Oh, these are my things.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:44:05.360
Alright, there I've created a dome or wall of magical energy.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:11.360
We have to think fast. I don't know how long I can hold it.

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.360
Doctor, what is the wall between us and what?

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.360
It's between us and him, whatever he is.

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.360
Alright, I run up to the hotel, the hotel.

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:30.360
I run up to the wall and I use my perception to see if the person with their motives are.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:37.360
Who is he? What is he? What are his motives?

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.360
This guy's a really good doctor.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.360
He's a very good doctor.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:49.360
You don't see anything beyond the wall other than a truck, like a semi-truck.

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:54.360
Oh, okay.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:45:00.360
I'm so happy.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.360
Where's the truck that the guy's in? I'll go check it out.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.360
Horticard points at it.

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360
I walk in that direction.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:15.360
As you walk, you see lights from the trucks flick on, flanking your path,

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360
lighting up the entire lot.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:23.360
The truck you're walking towards, the door clicks open and you see a dapper figure emerge.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:29.360
It's a khaki suit wearing orc with a data jack in the side of his head and a monocle.

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.360
He's holding a metal briefcase.

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:36.360
Oh, no.

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.360
Mercy, go up there and do your thing.

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.360
Can I sprint up to where Jim is?

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.360
Alright, I'm going to use negotiation.

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.360
Alright.

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:49.360
Hey, handsome.

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:52.360
It's good to finally meet you in person.

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.360
It is great to meet you too.

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:57.360
I assume that you are this Johnson we're all talking about.

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.360
Oh, yeah. That's why we're all here, isn't it?

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.360
Yeah, it sure is.

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.360
Did you like my friend's wall that he made? That dome?

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.360
I got to say, it's a bit alarming.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:16.360
Well, the thing that our crew does, some crews just go around and they just talk to people,

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360
but we show what we can do.

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.360
He's a doctor with a rich past.

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.360
Yeah, and he may also be going through a very messy divorce.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.360
We're not sure.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:34.360
But so, we do not have...

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.360
Baldwin Brown.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.360
Yeah, we do not have old BB.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.360
And I was wondering if maybe we could have a little more time.

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:48.360
I do have a very good lead.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360
Well, what's the lead?

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:57.360
Well, I produce the picture.

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.360
Looks like it was just taken from his Instagram account.

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:04.360
Yes, here's the thing.

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.360
A lot of people wouldn't look at this.

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:11.360
And as we all know, there are only so many bathrooms in the city.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.360
I think that we should have a little bit more time.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.360
And if you need some more convincing,

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.360
why don't I show you what my old friend, Dr. Friend, can do spell-wise?

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.360
Take it away, Dr. Friend!

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:28.360
Agony! Agony spell!

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.360
Jesus!

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.360
Agony!

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.360
Agony induces terrible pain!

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.360
Same team!

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.360
In the target!

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.360
Until it is deactivated!

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.360
Jesus Christ!

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.360
Somebody! Somebody!

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:52.360
Oh my God!

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.360
The spell! There's something wrong!

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.360
It's affecting me!

01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:01.360
He has superpowers!

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:04.360
I never suspected!

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.360
I use...

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:11.360
And the same will happen to you all if you don't return with Baldwin Brown.

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:15.360
Okay, that went better. He took that better than I thought he would.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.360
Hey listen, we got a truckload of BTL chips.

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.360
That was part of the deal.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.360
It was 1500 a piece or something.

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.360
No, it was not that.

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.360
It was 1000 a piece.

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.360
1000 a piece, we got a truckload, so...

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.360
Yeah, at least pony up for the BTLs.

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.360
We almost got killed trying to get...

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:38.360
Alright, alright. How many boxes you got?

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.360
A million.

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.360
I'll just verify that.

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.360
He walks over to the back of the truck and starts counting.

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.360
It's like, why this? This is only 25.

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:53.360
I mean, that's a lot.

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.360
That's all that was there, we got them all.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.360
We got 100% of their BTL chips.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.360
Yeah, a million probably wouldn't fit in the truck anyway.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.360
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:04.360
You're asking the wrong guy.

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:11.360
Also, we have, using negotiation and intimidation,

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.360
you really should give us 1100 a box,

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.360
because there are a lot of people who want these chips.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:24.360
Well, and it's really for my street clinics.

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:28.360
And obviously we have no idea what he's going to do.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.360
I mean, you have to realize, I may be working with these people,

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:36.360
but I still care about people who have no safety net.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.360
And they come to my clinics on the street for help,

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:50.360
and these 25 boxes will just be enough to make the difference.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:54.360
I'm not sure what is being expected of you.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:50:00.360
It's being explained to you that we have a huge humanitarian incentive.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.360
We need a little bit more money.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.360
Why don't we get 1100 a box and we'll go and we'll get Mr. Brian.

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.360
Alright, that sounds cool.

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.360
Alright, thank you.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:12.360
Do you know anything more about where he is?

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.360
Hey, Mercy, you guys are all forgetting that I have my eagle spirit

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.360
scouting the neighborhood right now.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.360
No, I remember, I remember. Do you know anything?

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:28.360
I'm just saying, at any moment, I go into a Native American...

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.360
Jeff, as your friend, just take a...

01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.360
Salish?

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.360
I go into a shamanic trance and I try to communicate with my eagle spirit

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:38.360
who's flying over the city.

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.360
Do you see Balvin Brown anywhere?

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.360
No, it'll take me like 20, 30 minutes.

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.360
Okay, cool.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.360
So spiritual.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:03.360
I shoot a ray of energy into the air that spells TTYL.

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:08.360
See ya.

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:16.360
So the Mr. Johnson, he pulls a cred stick out of his briefcase

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:21.360
and he's like, this is, what's 25 times 11?

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:24.360
This is that many.

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:28.360
That many new yens for your troubles.

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.360
Times 100, do you mean?

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.360
Yep.

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.360
Anybody?

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.360
25 times 100 is 2,500.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:35.360
Don't worry about it, I'll do the math later.

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.360
All right.

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.360
He hands you the cred stick.

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:41.360
250, thank you.

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.360
The cred stick?

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.360
Yeah, that's like a credit card, basically.

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:47.360
It stores your money.

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:50.360
And the future has gotten longer and thinner?

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.360
Okay, sorry.

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.360
What is your problem with the credit, cred stick concept?

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:58.360
You know, it's more reflection of me.

01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.360
No.

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:01.360
It should be smaller.

01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:06.360
It shouldn't be, in the future, we shouldn't be advancing to bigger.

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:08.360
We should be shrinking.

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.360
Thank you for that.

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.360
Right, but what if the stick does more?

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:11.360
What if the stick is the whole thing?

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:13.360
I mean, where are you going to put the stick when you go out?

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:14.360
Right.

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.360
You have to have a special pocket.

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:17.360
Exactly.

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:19.360
Oh, maybe that's why they did it.

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.360
The stick is pretty small.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360
It's not like a giant stick.

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360
No, I know.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.360
A memory stick.

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.360
No, I got it.

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360
I'm sorry.

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.360
I can't, Curtis, this is Aaron talking.

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:35.360
I have a hard time remembering the name for the cell phone and the money ying ying.

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.360
Yeah.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.360
Okay.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.360
New yin.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:39.360
New yin.

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.360
New yin.

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.360
Yeah.

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.360
See.

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.360
All right.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360
You hear the cry of sirens.

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:45.360
They're close.

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.360
Too close.

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:47.360
It's the cops.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.360
Jackson's like, what the hell?

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360
They must have bugged the merchandise.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.360
Oh, shit.

01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360
What are we going to do?

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.360
Too late.

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.360
We got to take the credit sticks and run everybody.

01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.360
Yeah.

01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.360
We'll be back.

01:52:58.360 --> 01:52:59.360
Son of bitches.

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.360
They run.

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:01.360
Sorry.

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.360
He's just used sons of bitches.

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.360
Go ahead.

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:05.360
Wait, what?

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.360
Are you not satisfied?

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.360
Oh, it sounded like you guys were running away.

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:11.360
Well, we are running away, but you can run too.

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.360
Oh, yeah.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.360
We're not doing anything wrong to you, right?

01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:18.360
I got a whole truckload of goods to move immediately.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:20.360
It's a situation on my hands.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.360
You want to pay us to help you with that situation?

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.360
Uh-huh.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360
No.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.360
Nightblade, are you high?

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.360
He's not part of our group.

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:31.360
He's a customer.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:35.360
He's the guy that we're going to go off and do the job, and he's dissatisfied.

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.360
We're walking away, and he's calling us assholes.

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:38.360
What?

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.360
You worked at Radio Shack, and the manager had a problem.

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.360
Would you leave your family to burn?

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.360
I made a lot of sense.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.360
Hortegaard.

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.360
Hortegaard, is there a dark area nearby where we can hide where the cops don't find us?

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.360
I don't know.

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.360
Probably, just statistically.

01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.360
Eve, can you ask for an eagle?

01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.360
Can I cast invisibility over all of us and make us and the truck disappear?

01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.360
Not the truck.

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:06.360
You could do it on people, but it's going to take some drains.

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:10.360
I could also use phantasm and create some other thing to distract the cops.

01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.360
I could make some other thing happen far away that makes the cops go somewhere else to buy us some time.

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.360
You could?

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:17.360
Oh.

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.360
All right.

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.360
So how close are the cops?

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:21.360
Oh, they're going to be here in a couple minutes.

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.360
A couple minutes.

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:24.360
Jonathan, do you want out of this problem?

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.360
Maybe, but only for very cheap.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.360
Name a price?

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.360
700.

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:34.360
700 for each person that risks their life?

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:35.360
No.

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.360
Just to solve the situation.

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.360
All right, see you.

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.360
What kind of race?

01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.360
Let's go.

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.360
The guy's like, you sons of bitches.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.360
Yeah, but you got no right to say that anymore.

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.360
You had an opportunity.

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:53.360
Like, tell your accountant, you know, see you.

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.360
I go towards the street where the cops are coming.

01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.360
I can hear where the street where they're going to be coming from, right?

01:54:58.360 --> 01:54:59.360
Right.

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.360
And I say, everybody, get in the truck, get ready to get the hell out of here.

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.360
I'm going to create a phantasm to scare the hell out of these cops.

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:07.360
When it starts, we have to get the hell out of here and go the other direction.

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.360
Jonathan, you want to come with us or do you want out?

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:10.360
Well, I need that truck.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.360
I mean.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.360
Yes, we'll all get in the truck together with the merchandise and we'll go somewhere else and get away from these cops.

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.360
I'll drive the truck.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360
Sounds good.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.360
All right.

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.360
Jonathan likes it.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.360
I can just say that they're medical supplies if the police stop me.

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.360
All right.

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.360
You guys, everybody in the truck, I'm going to try this.

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360
We only got one shot at this, you guys.

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:29.360
And also our show is about to be over, so this has to count.

01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.360
All right.

01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:31.360
All right, let's go.

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:32.360
All right.

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.360
The truck rolls out of the parking lot.

01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:35.360
Okay.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:45.360
I go out into the streets and I touch my red feather earring and I summon all the magic of my training,

01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.360
my elven upbringing, and my Native American tribes.

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.360
And I summon a spirit.

01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:58.360
I summon a 20-foot-tall flaming gorilla to stand in the middle of the streets.

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.360
And just start freaking out in front of the cop cars.

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.360
Not only is it a giant gorilla, it's also angry.

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.360
No.

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.360
This is a flaming gorilla that means business.

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.360
But it's only a phantasm.

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.360
It can't really hurt him.

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.360
It's just going to scare these cops.

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.360
And I cast it as a level five.

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360
All right, that's a little fun.

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:21.360
Level five flaming gorilla, middle of the road, freaking out.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.360
All right.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:29.360
It appears to me I could have done the barrier here.

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:32.360
But I feel like I've already done it and now it's not going to work.

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:33.360
You kind of shot your what?

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.360
You shot your what?

01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:35.360
I shot it.

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:36.360
This would be the perfect time for it.

01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:40.360
If I'd known this is where we were going, I would have waited on the barrier for now.

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.360
We should have given you the script.

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:43.360
We're right at it.

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.360
This is the problem.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:45.360
Hey, don't get the script.

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.360
You don't know what to do.

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.360
Doctor, remember before when you told me that I'm bigger than this and there's more to me than this?

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:50.360
Yes.

01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.360
I think that we're all learning something today and that you're going to use to harness this ability

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:56.360
and know when to time it better next time.

01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.360
And to use it for good.

01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.360
Yes.

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.360
Level five gorilla.

01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.360
A gorilla sprouts up.

01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:04.360
He's 20 feet tall.

01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:09.360
He's beating his chest, which is on fire.

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.360
He's mean in business.

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:13.360
And you guys scoot off into the night.

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:16.360
Scoot.

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.360
If there's any cops following you, they make no indication.

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.360
20 minutes later, your, your eagle friend goes, hey, I found Baldwin.

01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.360
You're not going to like it though.

01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:27.360
Why not?

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.360
He's in a business building.

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.360
I mean, he's in a building.

01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.360
God damn it.

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:36.360
That's our kryptonite.

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:42.360
Are you saying there's a roof and walls and there's some sort of organization inside that makes money?

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.360
Yeah.

01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.360
It's a telepathic link.

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.360
You guys, it looks like we're going to have to get Baldwin.

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.360
Which, which business?

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.360
Eagle.

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.360
Oh, I don't, I don't know.

01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:02.360
So you, you truly thought we weren't going to like that he was in a business?

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.360
Oh, wait, no, I, you're not going to like the defense mechanisms around the business.

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:12.360
Oh, what are they?

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.360
Oh, they got magical barriers.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.360
Sounds like me.

01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:22.360
That sounds like a case for the magical barrier doctor to come in.

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.360
Cliff Hanger.

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.360
Wait a minute.

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:32.360
Curtis Armstrong will be back next week to reprise his role as the, as the astraly projecting doctor.

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.360
Thank you all for coming.

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:35.360
Erin Mcgathy.

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.360
Thank you.

01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.360
Thank you.

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.360
Thank you.

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.360
Thank you.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:43.360
Erin Mcgathy Spencer Crittenden.

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:44.360
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:46.360
Thank you everyone here at Meltdown Comics.

01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.360
Your mayor everybody, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:58:48.360 --> 01:59:00.360
Did you get any of that?

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:18.360
It's a good show.
