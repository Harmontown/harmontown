{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.000\nSome gorgeous uptown Burbank Harvintown once again is in session.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:29.000\nPlease welcome the Game Master Spencer Crittenden and the Mayor of the Mostists.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:33.000\nDan Harmon!\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:40.000\nHello, hello, thank you!\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:45.000\nI mean, obviously it's like, you know, hello, how are you in the usual niceties?\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nI also should add, I'm not a Nazi.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:52.000\nLike, that's a new thing that you just add to be polite.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:57.000\nThat's the new minimum definition of interhuman communication.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:00.000\nYou want to start, I'm not a Nazi.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:01.000\nYou have to know that.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nBut if you were, it would go a little something.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:09.000\nAnd then you say, oh Dan, you're pandering, you're virtue signaling, right?\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nIsn't that what you call it? You fucks?\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:12.000\nYeah.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.000\nOh, you say you're not a Nazi and then you get a big bell and a cookie,\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nbecause that's so easy to say you're not a Nazi.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nWell, no, it's not that easy to say, is it?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nIt's not easy to say you're not a Nazi.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:27.000\nThe president has a difficult time.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:34.000\nAnd he has no repercussions to fear, really, except for some Nazis not voting for him.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nAnd he has traded that today.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:41.000\nHe has officially decreed to the extent that a compulsively dishonest parasite can decree anything.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:47.000\nHe has decreed that he is a Nazi, because there are people goose-stepping down a main street\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:51.000\nin the heart of America, wherever the fuck that place is.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:57.000\nAnd it would have been so easy to trade a couple of Nazi votes\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nfor what he might have hoped would be a couple of non-Nazi votes.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:04.000\nPerhaps the easiest votes to get of all.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nSimple non-Nazi votes.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:11.000\nLow-hanging democratic fruit, it's been called.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nI promise to not be a Nazi.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:16.000\nYou're hired these days.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nHe couldn't do it.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nHe couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:24.000\nAnd that is as close as you're going to get with a coward to his saying,\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nI'm a Nazi, which is what he said.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\nHe just wants to be loved by Nazis.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:34.000\nAnd just wanting to be loved is important and human.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nWe all just want to be loved.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nAnd the big question is, when you are not loved and a Nazi is across the street going,\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:47.000\nYoo-hoo, do you go back to being not loved or walk across the street?\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nThat is what this civil war, and I promise you that's what's brewing,\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nis going to be all about.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:54.000\nAnd it's fucking over.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:55.000\nThe discourse is over.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:56.000\nWe have sat.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nWe have talked.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:58.000\nWe have argued.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nWe have pondered.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nThe discourse is over.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nThese people that tweet you when you retweet somebody,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nwhen you just say a simple fact that should not cause you to get a knot in your stomach,\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nlike, I'm not a Nazi.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:18.000\nThe people that tweet you and say, nor am I, but just out of curiosity.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nJust tell them to go fuck themselves.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nThe discourse is over.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nThe war has begun.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nYou're not talking to Nazis anymore.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.000\nYou're not talking to people that want to entertain the notion of being a Nazi anymore.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nYou don't want to talk to people that want to circumscribe the concept of Nazism\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:39.000\nwithin a fucking socratic dialectic about goddamn whether Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nThey're fucking Nazis.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nIt's the bedrock of humanity.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nIt is so low that the worst people in the world find it.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:48.000\nAnd that's where they rally.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nAnd it's so low.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nWe have gotten so bad that a third of our country has gotten there.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\n29% of the people are fucking Nazis.\n\n03:58.000 --> 03:59.000\nLet's face it.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nThat's a minority.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nWe can beat them.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:05.000\nWe have to say, I'm not a Nazi, though.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nTwo thirds of the country just don't want to be political.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:13.000\nIt's not politics to say you're not a Nazi.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nIt's like taking a shit.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nYou just do it.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nOr you explode.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nYou die if you don't shit.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:32.000\nAnd you die if you don't say you're not a Nazi.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nFascism is a fucking cancer.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nIt will eat your country unless your country kills it.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nHere's what happens when you get cancer.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nNothing good.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:41.000\nNothing.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nThere is no way out of it.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nI'm your country's doctor.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nYou've got cancer.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nYou have fascism.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nYou are going to suffer.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nYou are going to fight.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nYou are going to feel pain.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nYou are not getting out of this.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nWe have fascism.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nIt is happening.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nWe're fucking dead, maybe.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nOr maybe they're dead.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nThat's about it.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nIt's not a continuum.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nThere's no gray area.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nIt's not a fad.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:19.000\nFascism doesn't pop up and then recede when it finds out no one's into it.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nIt doesn't respond to love.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nIt doesn't respond to hate.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nIt doesn't respond to ignoring it.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:26.000\nIt doesn't respond to timeouts.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nIt doesn't respond to attention.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.000\nIt doesn't respond to lack of attention.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nYou stab it.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nYou cut it out.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nYou bombard it with poison.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nOr you die.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nAnd in any case, you will probably die.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nDon't die talking to cancer.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nDon't die hanging out with it.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nDon't die arguing with it on Twitter.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nIt's fucking fascism.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nEnough.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nTeam up.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nStop bitching about Bernie Sanders.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nI don't care what flavor you want your democracy to be.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:59.000\nIt's democracy versus motherfucking fascism.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\nYou can be as Bernie as you want.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nYou've got to do it later, man.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nYou've got to do it fucking later.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou've got to do it later.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:22.000\nYou've got to oppose fascism.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nAll right, so.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nSo I have fingernail questions.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nBecause I went on a week-long trip.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nThat was a fucking hairpin turn, man.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nI had to hack my fingernail clippers for one trip.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nDo they grow from the root and they just push forward?\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nThat's where the white lines happen.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:46.000\nAnd those happen so fast that we still haven't developed a pill.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nHow do you join Antifa?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nWhat is that?\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:53.000\nThat's just like a slur for not being a Nazi.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nIs that a term that's been invented by the opposition?\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\nYeah, more or less.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:02.000\nI mean, it takes the fascist out of anti-fascism.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nRight, it's like the optics couldn't be better on the term anti-fascist.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nYou don't want to lose that part.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nRight, that's why they lost it, is because otherwise they'd say anti-fascist,\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nwhich they're talking about themselves as a fascist.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nSo the bad guys shortened it to Antifa because that sounds like a Middle Eastern thing.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nThat's my perception. Who knows?\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nWell, I looked it up.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nSpencer, where do you fall on fascism?\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nI love it.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nBut only when it's under my banner.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nBecause I happen to be right.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nStop arguing with them.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:42.000\nEvery person, there's 20 dudes willing to take their khakis and their tiki torches out under the shit.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nThey're not even the worst of the bad guys.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nIt's the six to one outnumbering them that are just sitting there watching on their laptops,\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\ngoing like, they have a point.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nFuck them, shame them, find them, make them say, I'm a Nazi.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nIntroduce yourself to all of your friends tomorrow.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nHello, I'm not a Nazi.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nMake everyone say it or don't say it.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nIt's come to that. I'm sorry.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nIt's called quarantining.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nThe president cannot say, I'm not a Nazi.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nLet's make it the cool thing to do.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nLet's see if he catches on.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nLet's see if he's the last person to say it.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nThe whole tiki torch thing.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nHow many home depots are in Virginia?\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nLike, that's a lot of fucking tiki torches.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:27.000\nAnd how in love are they with that culture, that island culture?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nYeah.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nOr do they just hate mosquitoes that bad?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:38.000\nThey're throwing the only luau where nobody got laid.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:44.000\nYou know, the whole protest is all in the pockets of big tiki torch.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nHere's a fun joke.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nThat was Church's joke from earlier.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nI still heard joke.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nKnock, knock.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nWho's there?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nFunny.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nFunny who?\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nA funny Nazi doesn't exist.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nThere's no such thing.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:04.000\nHave you ever gotten a laugh from interacting with any of these people?\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nYou have to lose your humor before you get to that point.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nThey're not making music videos, these people.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nThey're not talented dancers.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nThere's no, you always see the people.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nI saw Hart Hansen, the poor, kind Canadian soul,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:23.000\ncreated bones, probably fed these people their fucking murder bones\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nfor 20 years of fucking syndicated bones episodes.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nAnd he bothers to say, well, the president seems like a fart face.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nAnd then someone's going like, hey, I love your show,\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:39.000\nbut respecting the president should be a thing.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nWhat, what, what, what?\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nFuck you, man.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nFuck you.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nFuck you.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nFuck you.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:54.000\nFuck you, fuck you, like nobody that makes television respects any politician.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nNobody.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:00.000\nLike go fucking watch all TV that's only made by fucking Nazis.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nLinwood Boomer.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nYou're going to be watching Linwood Boomer.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nLinwood Boomer's veggie tales show that we don't know about\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nwhere the tomato is like killing Jews and like,\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:11.000\nand then the pickle says like, how do you do that?\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd the tomato says practice.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nIt's not going to be good. It's not going to land a joke.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nI guarantee you that.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nI can't land a fucking joke.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:24.000\nWhy do you think they're so mad?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:29.000\nDo we have any Nazis here?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nIt's a legitimate question now.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nIt's just a fucking straight up legitimate.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nIt's as easy as it is.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nI'm a little disappointed, actually.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:41.000\nI thought our crowd was big enough to have a couple Nazis.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:48.000\nIs anybody kind of a Nazi?\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nSo here's the ways we could die.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nWe could die by Nazi.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI know I'm going to die.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nMy longest longevity will be like firing squad,\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nbecause I'm on record now.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nI've

11:38.000\nDan Harmon turned into Kramer.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nThe Nazis turned Dan Harmon into Kramer.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nIronically, okay.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nAnyway,

say, I'm feeling what you're feeling.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nI know you're upset.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nThank you for coming out to a warehouse in Burbank\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nwhen you're this upset.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nYou should be scared to leave your house now.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nThank you.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nI don't mean to dump on you.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nI'm just hoping to cathartify you a little bit.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nHe also wants to make up a new word called cathartify.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nYou know, and I know there's no straight answer.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nLike, for all of you, you're not all feeling the same way\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nand all sometimes.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nSome of you are coming here to escape this stuff.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nThen you're bummed out.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nI was like, oh, Dan's just as mad as I am.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nI don't want this shit.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nI don't want to listen to dad yell about what I'm yelling about.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nSome of you are coming.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nI was like, oh, God, what if I just talked about Minecraft\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nfor two hours?\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nYou'd be like, why did Dan do that?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nIs he a Nazi?\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nYou're like, like...\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:32.000\nSee, I feel like, like, I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist,\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nbut you know, like, a classic distraction tactic is like\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nwhen you're under investigation by special counsel\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nand all this stuff.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nLike, you start saying, oh, I want to bomb Korea\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nor Korea's going to bomb us and all this stuff.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nOr, you know, like, all this shit.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nAnd I think that Trump is distracting from the real issue\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:48.000\nof the day, which is if you have a dragon,\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:53.000\nwhy are you going to ride it into battle?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nIf you're the fucking queen,\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:58.000\nbecause you've got to hear you say dracarys.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nBecause if you don't say dracarys into his ear,\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nit might melt like, like, just thracky.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nWell, I don't think they'll do it.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nWell, I guess they might.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nYou don't write it in there.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nYou don't write it.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nYou fucking...\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nYou have to have remote control technology.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nIsn't there a line in a couple, like, last season\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nwhere Peter Dinklage is, like, lacking?\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nAnd he goes like, oh, yes, of course.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nEveryone knows that dragons have a limited bond\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nwith the people that save them\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nand that they recognize the...\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nLike, he does, like, a little line of exposition\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nthat kind of buffers it.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nIt's like, I thought I remembered that,\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nbecause I was like, oh, you vey.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nThat was a lot of leather.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nRight. If that doesn't go anywhere,\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nand it didn't in that season, at least,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nwell, not really, at least.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nI think it was just, like, a patch over the whole thing\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nwhere it's just like, you can take...\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nYou know, the dragons could be in a basement\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nand be bummed out that they're chained up\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nand almost eat you, but then you can take a bad guy there.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nYou can take your husband and the things,\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nbut then you can fly him over\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nand they can hit the ships that you need.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nI don't know. Who cares?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nIt's a good enough show.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nHave you guys seen King of Queens?\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:02.000\nGame of Thrones is good enough.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nI was in the desert.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nI've seen more episodes of King of Queens\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nthan any fucking person\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nsince the Geneva Convention should be required to watch.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nThis show is fucking insane.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nI started to love it,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nbecause it became a hero,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nbecause it was doing television so wrong\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nand surviving.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nIt became Frodo.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:27.000\nIt was like carrying the ring of entertainment\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nto a volcano and throwing it in.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nAnd I was so wrong going like,\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nwell, fuck it then.

have\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nvery lovable guests that I know you guys are\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nokay, we'll side with.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nBut yeah, wait, wait, wait, what was that?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nHow do you join Antifa?\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nOkay, I got that.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nOh, it's just, we're regarding my dogs.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nSo if the North Korea thing happens,\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nif we know there's ICBMs headed in,\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nI was like, do I have to kill my dogs?\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nThat's a thing.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nThey'll be fine.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nAnd then I was like, so I was like,\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\ndo I have to get cyanide tablets\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nso I can feed my dogs and then I kill myself?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:38.000\nAnd then, I don't think you can get cyanide tablets.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nWell, there's got to be something that kills dogs.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nWait, wait, a lot of things kill dogs.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nDog bullets, I don't know.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nYou love your dogs so much that you want\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nto be the one to kill them, not the ICBM.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nYou don't want to give them the chance to survive it.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nI feel like, I don't know, okay, yeah.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:57.000\nWell, we've all seen the road.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:00.000\nI don't want to, I don't care who survives,\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nI don't want anyone having to,\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nI don't want it to be me and my two dogs.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nBut then, Mike Waldron said,\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nno, you should keep those guys alive\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nand maraud the land with them.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nYeah.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nAnd I was like, oh, I like that,\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nmaraud the land with Nigel and Harvey.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nAlso, if you're too ill and like,\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nsuccumbing to radiation sickness to move,\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:21.000\nyour dogs will just eat you.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nAnd that's the final gift that you give your dogs.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nIt's just like dog cancer from eating\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nradioactive human meat?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nI mean, they probably have it too.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nNo, you can eat radioactive human meat.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nDo you think when dogs, like when they,\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nand by the way, you know, cats will eat you first.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nWe've been over that, right?\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nAnd it's not because they're like, yeah.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nThey love faces.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nYeah.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nDo you think when an animal starts to eat you,\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\ndo you think it knows it's you?\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nDo you think, I mean,\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nYeah.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nWe smell like us.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nYeah.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nAnd so they're like, well, I'm eating Frank.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nYeah.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:59.000\nYou're the person that has the can opener.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nYou represent food.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nThe moment you stop being able to operate the can opener,\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\noh, I am the can opener now.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nI'm going to open this guy's,\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.000\nI'm going to open this guy's eyeballs up.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nSo that means that every night,\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nwell, you're asleep, your dog or cat\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nlooks at you for a second,\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nand somewhere in their tiny brain,\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nit makes the calculation of like,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nI'll wait till morning.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:30.000\nLike, if it knows when you're dead that it's you,\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nthen it knows when you're alive that you're food.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nYeah.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:37.000\nYour worship is just its life on the knife's edge.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:43.000\nYou're never too far from getting your face devoured.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nAll right.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:48.000\nWell, I just made a,\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nI don't know if you call it a TV show anymore.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nIt's on YouTube with the Game Grumps.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nYou guys know what the Game Grumps are?\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nWell, don't give them a complex if you don't,\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nthey just pretend you do.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nThey're more influential than me.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nThey're influencers.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nThat silent thing.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nI'm going to kill myself.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:10.000\nI'm naming you guys in the note.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nHow about this, Dan?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nThey won't do that silent thing\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nif you start doing that funny thing.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nOh, shit.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nOh, shit.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:28.000\nThis show up until now has been fucking gold,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nbut it's,\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nyou can't, you're not going to get to me with that one.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nI'm not insecure tonight. I'm riding high.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nI feel good.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nI feel eloquent in my drunken rage.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nI'm not a Nazi.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nIt's the new minimum bar for nobility.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nI feel like a fucking knight.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nPlease welcome the Game Grumps,\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nAaron Hansen and Danny Avidan.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:54.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nHello.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nHi, Game Grumps.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nNow, statistically speaking,\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\none of you might be a Nazi.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nNot a Nazi.

23:21.000\nThank you.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nYou guys had me on your show, the Game Grumps.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nYes.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nAnd it was a lot of fun.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nIt was.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nIt really felt like we made fast best friends,\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nat least on my side, like...\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nThis is where we wanted to break the news to you, Dan.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nI'm like only your third favorite person.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\nYour episode was very well-liked,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nas far as we can tell.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nOh, really?\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nI mean, certainly on our end.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nRight.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nBut in terms of the fans.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nHow much do you guys look at, though?\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nI mean, you're in this gaming community.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nI'm not going to throw the whole community into the bus,\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nbut let's face it, I mean, come on.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nNazis, right?\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nJust a large share of that.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nWhat's the deal with Nazis?\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nI mean, come on.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nTo the point where I can't put you in a corner\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nand make you say yes or no to that.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nIt's a...\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nThey're there.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nThey exist there.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nThey said they aren't Nazis.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nThey said...\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nShhh.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nShhh.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nNo, you're very right.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nBecause I've experienced the same thing,\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nwhere it's like I could come on stage and just be like,\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nyeah, fuck Nazis, right?\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nBut like if I said that on Twitter,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nit's a whole thing, and then people start,\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nand then it's like, oh, but you...\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nI want to talk about this instead.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nIt's like, no, no, don't fucking skirt the issue, man.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nWe're talking about hating Nazis right now.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nWe're talking about game grumping.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nIt is weird.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:32.000\nThere's a game that we used to play.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nThis is probably not unique to us,\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nbut we would look at the YouTube comments\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\nand see how it started,\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nand then see what it ended up being,\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nlike 45 comments later.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nAnd it would always start with stuff like,\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nman, the cat in the head is a dumb game,\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nfucking Jews.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nYouTube comments are amazing.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nIt's like, yeah, it's like fun to play that game\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nof like, well, this is a knitting tutorial.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nThis can't get racist.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nAnd it's like 12 comments,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nand it's like typical Lib Tards,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nN-word, Lubbock.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nOf course you do a crook stitch.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nI mean, it's perfect, because the way\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nthey format comments is like,\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:09.000\nyou see the first comment,\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nand then it beds the other replies\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:12.000\nto that comment underneath it,\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nbut it only shows the last comment\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\nin that thread.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nSo it'll just be like,\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nI like when Dan said this funny thing,\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nand then it ends with fucking Jews,\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nlike literally, that's where it goes.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nIt's a bad time.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nOh, good.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nYeah.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nI mean, it's especially a bad time to go after Jews,\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nbecause even the Nazis\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nare into them now.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nI know, I'm a Jew.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nIt's not that kind of Naziism\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nright at the moment.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nMy girlfriends feel safe,\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nlike Jared Kushner is the Israeli\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nPrime Minister, I think, right now.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nIt's, we're fine.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nIn that department,\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nit's not going to manifest itself in quite that way.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nIt's a different, it's a new Nazi.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nIt's not your mama's Nazi.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nNo.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nIt's the hot new Nazi on the streets.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nThere's like frosted tips on the swastika,\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nif you look real close.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nFrosted tips?\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:03.000\nBut, no, but what I was going to say is,\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nI think, you know, and this is,\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nyou know, I get it, I get it,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nand I don't get it, I don't pretend to,\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nthe gamer community\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nhas had its good times\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nand it's bad.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nThe one thing that's kind of persisted is,\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:17.000\nit's a passionate community.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nA lot of very cool people are passionate\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nabout being gamers,\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nand a lot of horrible people are passionate about it,\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\net cetera, et cetera.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nBut, do you guys\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nlook at comments?\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nYou just implied that you do.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nNo, not anymore.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nWe did when we started, because it's,\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nyou know, you don't know what you're in for,\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nand there's that kind of feeling of like,\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\noh, cool, they're saying stuff about us,\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nand I can learn from it.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nYou can't fucking learn anything from it.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nYeah, I always wonder about that,\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nbecause I would obsess about it with community,\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nand I felt safe.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nI must have been incredibly popular\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nfor two seasons of community,\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nbecause, like, because I didn't,\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nI never really encountered so much\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nthat it made me cry,\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nand now I can't look at anything\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nwithout starting to cry.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nLike, it could be rude.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nDude.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nBut, maybe it's just like,\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nbut, but, but, but,\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nI got a, like, for a while, I was, like, insisting on it,\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nand I would say, like, like,\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nyou know, like, the modern family\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nshow runners would be like,\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\noh, you sure are active on Twitter,\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nand I got like, yeah, well, you sure\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\naren't handsome and successful,\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nand, and, and, and then,\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nand then it'd be like, you know,\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nyou should be careful with that feedback loop.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nDon't you're concerned about the feedback loop?\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nAnd I'd be like, feedback loop?\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nYou mean, like, giving the power to the people?\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:32.000\nYo!\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\nAnd then, but then, now, all these years later,\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nI talk to everyone, like,\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nI cannot stand you.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nI hate all of you.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nEveryone, everyone outside of my home.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nI hate you.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nCool.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nThat's sort of the paradox to it, right?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nLike, people,\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nfans at least, feel like\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nthey need to be listened to and engaged with,\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nand that makes you a better creator,\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nbut at the same time, they like you for the stuff\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nthat's coming out of your brain,\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nand not necessarily what they're asking for, right?\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nYou can't win either way,\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nso you just have to pick one and then stick with it.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nAnd I pick the one that keeps me out of therapy.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nWhich is, which is just doing\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nwhat comes out of your head,\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nand if that entails cutting,\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\ncutting the feedback loose.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nYeah, because it's, it's narcissistic\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\none way or another to keep, like,\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nlooking at what people are saying about you,\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nlike, regardless of the context, right?\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nLike, if you're Googling yourself,\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nif you're getting good or bad, it's still like,\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nthis is all about me right now.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nYou need to detach from that.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nAnd the thing about positive feedback is,\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nit may be less effective\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nper capita than negative feedback.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nWe all know that negative shit.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nWe've talked about this in the podcast.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nIf I say, oh, you're going to wear that shirt,\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nlike, you're going to remember that out of the nine things I say.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nI didn't even say anything negative,\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nbut I just, like, implied something that's like,\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nDid you just neg my Care Bears metal shirt?\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nYou're going to, you're going to remember that\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nthe next time you're going to dress,\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nit doesn't matter if you think that I'm a fashionista,\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nit'll just be like, it'll stick in your head\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nmore than if I told you you were handsome,\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nthat you look like you've been jogging today.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nI don't know what people say when they're being nice.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nThat sounds like an insult.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nIf you really want to fuck somebody up,\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\njust go, hey, what's up, ankles?\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nWhat?\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nWhy are my ankles?\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nWhat's wrong with my ankles?\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nPositive feedback doesn't stick as much as negative feedback,\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nbecause positive feedback\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\ntends to blend together,\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nand liking things is a harmonic thing.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nI'm not just saying that because I'm Harmon.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nI have a different view of that.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nI think the reason that negative stuff sticks\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nis because most people have a negative self-image of themselves,\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nand when they hear things,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nit validates what they already think about themselves,\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nand if you hear something positive,\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nit's usually something like, well, I don't really believe that,\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nand you sort of move on, you know?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nAnd then you see the person that's like, well, you're not funny,\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nand then you're like, I'm not funny.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nBut somebody else sees it too.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nAnd then it sticks in your brain.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nPeople want to self-improve.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nWe come out here to La La Land\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nto fix whatever happened on the playground.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nThat bully said I was a fat nerd,\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nso I'm going to go to LA,\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nand I'm going to make my fat nerdness\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\npowerful, and then a bunch of fat nerds\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nsay, you're powerful,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nand then one fat nerd goes,\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nbe nice if you was fatter and nerdier.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nAnd you're like, that guy, that guy!\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nYou know, everyone else, you're kind of like,\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nexcuse me, excuse me, you know,\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nand that's what people are always complaining about.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nIt always bums me out that people are like,\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nI know you don't respond to positive stuff.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nI know, like, oh, God,\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nI wish I could remember where I heard this,\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nprobably a radio lab.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nI'm about to do a dumb radio lab regurgitation,\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nbut I think one theory\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nis that the idea is\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nwe hold on to negative stuff\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nmore than positive stuff as a survival mechanism\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nfrom back in the day,\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nwhen you're out, you're a caveman,\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nand of all the stuff you learn in a day,\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nyou have to remember that that mushroom is poison.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nThat will kill you.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nYeah, totally, so that kind of\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nmight be why it sticks with us.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nI like that. Well, that puts a positive spin\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\non why negativity drives us.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nAnd then it doesn't involve us having\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nto listen to negative people,\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nbecause they're not mushrooms, they can't kill us,\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nthey're pieces of shit.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nAnd it's also okay to not look at feedback,\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nbecause let's be honest,\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nyou scroll so fucking fast\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nat the minute.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nThis is what I hate admitting,\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nbecause I hate it when people go,\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nugh, you don't like people when they support you,\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nso I think I'll tell you to go fuck yourself.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nAnd I say, double fuck you for implying that,\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nbut they're right, that person is right,\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nbecause I need to improve myself there.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nYou scroll through shit,\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nand your brain gets so good at recognizing\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\na solid, eloquent paragraph\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nthat's supporting you\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nto just fucking,\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nwhoop, you're just like scrolling\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nthe better the episode of Rick and Morty,\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nthe faster you scroll, and you can stop it.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nI was like, we're these fucking female writers,\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nfucking shit up.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nIt's the worst episode ever, and you're like,\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nfuck you, I'm gonna talk to you for three days.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nYeah.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nAnd it's a weird scanning\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nfor hatred and alarm,\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nand yeah.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nHave you ever heard of Herp Derp?\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nHerp Derp.

guess.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nAnd you saw a thing on TV\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nthat said eSports is this million-dollar industry\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nand knowing that I'm amazing at video games,\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nhe was like, let's start an eSports team.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nSo that's where\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nwe start off and then we recruit other gamers\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nand they're all like not your typical\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\neSports players\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nbecause they're usually like 18-year-old\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nKoreans.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nAnd now it's\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\ntopical, maybe okay to say\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nyou shouldn't be\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nKorean?\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nIf you're out there\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nand you're Korean,\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\ndon't.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nIf you heard me faltering at the end\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nof that conclusion,\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nI was like, yeah, I don't think\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nthis is going to come out\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\ntrue.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nI was just connecting linguistic dots\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nfrom the headlines.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nDoes anyone know where Guam is?\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nI don't know where Guam is.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nIt's way far.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nIt's much closer to South Korea\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nthan it is to Korea.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nIt sounds like it,\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nobviously it's not Guatemala.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nIt sounds like it should be in South America,\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nbut I assumed it must not be, otherwise\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nthey wouldn't be talking about it.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nGreat, good to

expected it to be.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nExcept in the dictionary.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nWhat the fuck\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nare we talking about?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nJust countries.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nIs it just\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nalphabetical?\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nWe're talking about good game.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nThere's game grumps and there's good game,\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nand now we're talking about Guam.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nAre we moving on to the next letter?\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nWhat's up with Guacamole?\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nIs there an avocado?\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nWhat is it?\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nYeah, that's what Guacamole is.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nI fell in

38:26.000\nSarah and Erika,\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nbecause they're more familiar with eSports\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nand competitive games.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nThey came in and did a great fucking job\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nand I am proud of the show,\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nbut it's\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\na special note\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nhow charismatic you guys are,\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nbecause you're self-starters,\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nyou're just doing this thing.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nThat's a common thing now,\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nlike top 40 artists\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nare people who just did it\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nby themselves and all this shit,\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nbut it's always impressive to see\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nyou guys,\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nyou didn't go to Juilliard,\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nbut you're amazing at being in front of the camera\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nand acting like yourselves,\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nwhich is a huge challenge.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nWell, I went to Juilliard for four years.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nYeah, no offense to everyone\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nwho went to Juilliard.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nThat's good too.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nBut no, you guys are\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nsuper,\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nI can see why the huge following,\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nbecause you're very genuine,\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nsincere, other synonyms for that.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nThanks, man.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nOne of the funniest things\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nin the world that the girls played for me\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nwas a clip of you\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\ngetting into it.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nWhat was the game where it was like,\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nunbelievably,\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nyou couldn't get past a certain level,\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\nI know you say it happens all the time,\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nbut it was like Rocket Boy.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nIf you're looking for highlights,\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nthat's probably something you could YouTube in,\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nlistening to Aaron\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nget so fucking sincerely upset,\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nway past the multiple thresholds\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nof like, okay, I should keep it together,\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nbecause this isn't good optics,\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nbut then getting so fucking mad.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nThat was definitely a form of therapy\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nplaying that game,\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nbecause I got more angry than I think\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nI've ever gotten ever in my life ever,\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nand it was just a dumb video game,\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nso I think I broke something\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nin the office.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nI think that's one thing that is true\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nof all things that are popular on YouTube,\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nbecause it's such a weird,\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nsome people like this, and some people like this,\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nand it's all so crazy and different,\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nbut the one common thread is that people like honesty,\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\npeople like super honest reactions,\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nwhether someone's having a really awesome time,\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nor a really shitty time,\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nor they're very embarrassed,\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\npeople are drawn to things\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nthat are real,\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nand I think TV is so much fakeness.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nJust honest these days,\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nyou have to be so faken good, it's insane,\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nlike the guy who does the\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nmicro impressions,\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nwho I really want to have on the show,\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nand I talked to him at Comic-Con,\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nhe does\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nthe 50 impressions\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nin a minute thing, but his impressions\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nare half a second long each,\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nbecause it's just like Kevin Spacey,\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nif he forgot his straw.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nIs that Ross?\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nThat guy's amazing.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nSo that's an example of\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nhe's not being himself,\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nhe's literally being other people,\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nbut it's like you have to be that on point,\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nor for the rest of us, you gotta be yourself,\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nbecause there's a long line of\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nit's a small corner in a big market,\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nwhatever the economics are.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nBut speaking of which,\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nI think you guys are like impressive

I mean, for doing my job here.\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nWe told you to look through the horses' saddlebags\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nto see if there was any identifying,\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000\nlike, you know, like, there's some pink slips.\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nOh, I remember that.\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000\nThat was the last episode.\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nAlright, well, I'm in the library with the guys.\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nOkay, so we split up for three seconds,\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000\nand now we're all in the library.\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nGood job, guys.\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nAlright, I missed you.\n\n01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nOkay, guys, keep your eye out for a sleeping prior,\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nbecause he sleeps in here, you know.\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nLet's go upstairs.\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nWe look around the library.\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nAlright. You go into the library.\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nIt's not a giant library.\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nIt's only got kind of wall bookshelves\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nthat don't go very high.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nI'd say they go about seven feet tall.\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nSo it's not like a sprawling\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nbook hop ellipse.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nIt's just a pretty small library.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nThere's a large table in the center,\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nand it has a couple books on the table,\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nlike, you know, someone has been studying a little bit.\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nAnd there's some other larger tables\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nfor kind of, you know, more people\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nto sit at, and they seem relatively clean.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nThere's also the stairway that goes up.\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nI poke through\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nthe stack of books that's the largest\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nat the smallest table.\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nOkay, one is\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nimprovised wards,\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nand the other is trap making 101,\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nand the other is what to do\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nwhen your church is under attack.\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nTrack making.\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nYeah,

thing.\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nThere's not, how much time do you want\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nto spend on that?\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nI want to go with the entire book.\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nNo, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nHe's not a fast reader.\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nI walk up that staircase.\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nI want to take that book\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nand put it in my backpack.\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nWhat to do when your church is

had to be published?\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nNot all\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\ncool things are popular.\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nI walk up that staircase.\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nYou go up the staircase.\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nWhat's your\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nperception?\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nUh-huh.\n\n01:25:12.000 -->

right?\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nHe was right.\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nWhat do you call it?\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nThe level, the part you step on\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nof the stair,\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nthe horizontal stair part\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nof the stair is...\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nThe step.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nThe top platform\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nof the step\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nof three of the stairs\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nis really loose.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nWhatever you call that,\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nthe subatomic portion of a set of stairs.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nSo I\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nnoticed that one of these stairs\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nis not an actual stair.\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nThree of the stairs are like loose\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nas if they're kind of up\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nhigher than it would normally be.\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nIt looks like they've been tampered with.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nIt looks like\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nit was pulled up\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nand then a bunch of marbles were put under it\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nand then it was put back.\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nOh, so I could have slipped\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nand broke my fucking ass.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nOr, you know, any number of other things.\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nAnd you still can't...\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000\nI pulled that step\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000\noff the marbles and reveal\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nwhat's underneath. Marbles!\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nOne of the marbles is gold.\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nOne of the marbles is gold?\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nI'm gonna take that, motherfucker.\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nPut it in my little knapsack.\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nI got a gold marble!\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nJesus, this guy's really into marbles.\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nHe loves them.\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nI continue up the staircase.\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nAll right, you do that.\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nWait, what does he do with the...\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nIs it like a section of three stairs?\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nYeah. What's he doing with it?\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nI'm proving\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nthat somebody home alone\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nto this fucking staircase.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nNo, but now you're stepping...\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nLike, from my perspective, all I watched\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nis you started going up stairs,\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nthen you stopped, stared at the middle of the stairs,\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nthen lifted three of the stairs up.\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nThere's marbles underneath.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nYou took one, and now you're going up the stairs.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nI presume with three stairs\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nin tow.\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nI just took the step part of that stair off\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nand put it aside.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nHow is that trap gonna work?\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nI have so many questions for the person\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nwho set this trap.\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nI think I was supposed to step on this,\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nand the marbles would shoot the stair\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nfrom underneath me, and I would go crashing to my death.\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nWhere would the stairs go? Up.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nUp? That's a ghostbusters joke.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nOh, they go up.\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nI mean, can I move the stairs?\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nThey were already moved.\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nRight, he moved.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nSo we're just looking at a platform of marbles?\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nNo, it's just stairs\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nthat have a\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nshitty part that's not meant to be stepped on.\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nIt was supposed to make me slip and fall.\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000\nBut the marbles are under the stairs.\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nThey're under the top.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nThere was a board with marbles, and if you step on it,\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nyou go, whoa, if I could go smash and you hurt yourself.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nJust pretend it makes sense.\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nLike they're like ball bearings.\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nCan I take\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nall the marbles?\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nWhat? I wanted those marbles.\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nAre the marbles heavy?\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nAre they better than my stones I used\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nin my slingshot?\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nYeah, but I have a gold one.\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nI investigate that gold marble.\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nIs there anything special besides it being gold?\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nIt's light, and in your hand,\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nwhen you move it around, you can feel it's\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nkind of sloshing slightly.\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nSloshing?\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nI think you should eat it.\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nI'm adding a bunch of marbles to my inventory.\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nNice.\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nBut I also think there was probably an element to this\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nthat was meant to\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nbe an alarm.\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nI think this gold marble is probably\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nlike a ninja smoke bomb\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nor something like that.\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nIt looks special. It's got a slushie.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nFlash bomb?\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nYeah, like a ninja flash bomb.\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nThere's a ninja in the audience who\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nwants to make sure you can get your terms right.\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nBut we have the worst ninja ever.\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nThey're not ninja smoke bombs.\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nThey're flash bombs.\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nTired of this shit.\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nAlright guys, I think I've defeated\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nat least one of the booby traps\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nin the staircase. Let's proceed\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nup the staircase together.\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nAlright, the rest of the staircase, uneventful.\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nYou get to the top, the door's locked.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nOkay.\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nI use the marbles on the door.\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nNo, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nAre any of you guys...\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nNo.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nFuck.\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nI don't have any lockpicking skills.\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nI mean, this is just like weird...\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nweird word.\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nI lightly knock on the door.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nI lightly go...\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nNot a stir, not a nothing.\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000\nI think you should light it on fire.\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nNo.\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nIs there a window nearby?\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nNo, this is like a narrow hallway.\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nIt's pretty dark and stuff.\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nNone of you guys can shrink\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nor turn into a ghost or anything.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nI can light things on fire.\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nMillennials.\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nAlright, wait.\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nSomeone just kick the door in.\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nLike this.\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nLet's just kick the door in.\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nMan, if we're going to do that.\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nIn theory, there's an old guy sleeping behind there\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nthat is or isn't a floating vampire\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nthat just got home.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nAre we looking for the event that's happening\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nthat could involve the corpse of that child?\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nThat happens later, right?\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nWhat?\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nDon't answer me.\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nWhere's Patchens?\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000\nPatchens?\n\n01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nPatchens?\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nHey guys.\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nThis guy just sneaks up on us every time.\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nI was in the library.\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nHey Patchens, do you have keys for this door?\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nNo, maybe there's some somewhere else.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nI'll go look.\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nOkay, yes please.\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nGo do that.\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nI found some keys.\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nHoly shit!\n\n01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nHe's like the paperclip in Microsoft Word.\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nI hate Patchens.\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nPatchens, do my taxes.\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nOpen the door for us, Patchens.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nAlright, he opens the door.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nThere's no one inside.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nIt's a very bare room.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nThere's like a single dresser with a mirror on it.\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nAnd on the dresser is like a bowl of water.\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nAnd there's a small table in a chair\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nthat's kind of like a desk.\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nIt has a candle.\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nThe candle is low, but it's not lit.\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nAnd there's no one in the bed.\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nThe bed's not even made.\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nI go tumble out of the bed\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nand like lay backwards.\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nLike I'm like...\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000\nI put the candle out and drink the water.\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nThe candle's out, but you drink the water.\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nIt tastes like hands.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nIt tastes like what?\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nHands.\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nWash their hands in that shit, man.\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nYou like that hand water?\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nWhat the fuck was I thinking?\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nI roll around in the bed giggling.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nYou gotta make your own fun around here.\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nHe drank hand water.\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nI love water so much.\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nI hope you love hands.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nSplit the diff, motherfucker.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nI examine the room some more.\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000\nIs there all there is to be seen in that room?\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nYeah, it seems like he doesn't actually keep anything\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nmore than just the clothes and the dresser in here.\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nLike not even any writing tools\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nor like books or anything.\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nI feel the bed to see if it's warm\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nand see if anybody's been there recently.\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nIt looks like Dan's been in it.\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nYeah, the bed hasn't been in otherwise though.\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nOkay, I'll tell you what though.\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nUnder the bed is where I look\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nand next...\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nGo for it.\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nI drape myself over the edge of the bed\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nwhile still laying on it.\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nI'm being playful. I'm like a little kitty cat.\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nI'm like Elizabeth's shoe\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nin the cold open of\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nAdventures in Babysitting.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nI'm just feeling sprightly.\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nWhen did they get a groan?\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nOne of the most amazing performances in cinematic history.\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nI drape my head\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nand look under the bed.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nYou don't see anything.\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nGuys, I think we're in the wrong room.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nThen I go like this\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nin keeping with my Elizabeth's shoe persona\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nin the 80s in general.\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nWhen I don't see anything, I go\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nI do one of those things\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nwhere the lower lip goes\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\noutside the upper lip\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nand you exhale and so your\n\n01:33:50.000

of the doors in this room\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nor just the way we came in?\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nWait, can we...\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000\nLook, this is

right?\n\n01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nWe could like...\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000\ninterrogate one about where this thing is happening.\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000\nYeah, last episode Steve found a sleeping person.\n\n01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000\nRight.\n\n01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000\nJeff looked him in the face\n\n01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nand he was

just...\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000\nLet's go back down real quick.\n\n01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nSince we're right here, we go downstairs,\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000\nwe're right in the sanctuary.\n\n01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000\nLet's go investigate that flame real fast.\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nThis guy just loves fire.\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nI know, it's my thing.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nWhy don't we take a look at it?\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nAll right, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nIf it's a dead animal, we go wake up sleeping town.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nNo, we're going to wake up sleeping town no matter what.\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nAll right.\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nLet's check out the fire.\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nYou go back into the sanctuary.\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nYou can see there's a door behind the podium\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nwhere the guy can go.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nLike the priest might after a sermon\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nwalk back there.\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nAbove the door there's a large open window\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nthat just displays the fire.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000\nIt kind of just displays the fire,\n\n01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nalmost like it's supposed to showcase\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nand frame the fire for people sitting in the sanctuary.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nSo yeah, there's a door\n\n01:35:54.000 -->
